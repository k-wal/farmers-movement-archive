09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Q2 records 107% surge in fresh investments||Fresh investment proposals surged sharply in the second quarter of this year, rising 107% over the first quarter, with 2,219 new projects entailing an investment of Rs. 2.19 lakh crore. Private sector investments also recovered significantly, rising 87% from the previous quarter when an extensive lockdown triggered a 23.9% contraction in the economy. On a year-on-year basis, fresh investments between July and September were still 11.32% lower but marked a sharp recovery from investments in the first quarter that were nearly 73% lower. Among the States, Chhattisgarh received the most investments in the second quarter followed by Tamil Nadu, which topped fresh investments in the first quarter, according to Projects Today’s latest report on investment announcements in the July to September quarter. Karnataka was third on the list, followed by Gujarat and Maharashtra. Chhattisgarh’s total investments of Rs. 35,771 crore in the quarter were boosted by the Rs. 22,653 crore Bodhghat irrigation project and public sector coal mining projects worth Rs. 8,200 crore. Tamil Nadu received 132 projects worth Rs. 23,332 crore in the same period. Cautious optimism Projects Today director and CEO Shashikant Hegde said it was too early to proclaim the return of normalcy. However, he said the impressive increase in fresh investment proposals, increased tendering activities and a sharp jump in the number of finalised project contracts in Q2 vis-à-vis the preceding quarter indicated a bounce back in project investment activities in India. “The project implementation ratio (project investment under execution as percentage of total outstanding investment) improved by a tad, from 37% in Q1 to 37.53% in Q2,” Mr. Hegde told The Hindu . “This indicates that at the ground level, project execution has not gained much traction in the second quarter. Pain issues like scarcity of labour, supply chain disruption and liquidity also persisted,” he said. Private sector investments in the second quarter were just 7% down from a year ago, with 618 new projects worth Rs. 83,608.2 crore. This was almost double the 315 new projects worth Rs. 44,714.6 crore announced in Q1, but still far less than the average quarterly investments of Rs. 1.69 lakh crore and Rs. 1.32 lakh crore in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/q2-records-107-surge-in-fresh-investments/article32808548.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Ram Vilas Paswan passes away||Union Minister for Food and Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan passed away on Thursday night after a prolonged heart ailment at the Fortis Escorts Hospital in New Delhi. He was 74. Widely known as the weather vane of Indian politics, Mr. Paswan has been a Minister in Union governments under six Prime Ministers, working with governments of all colours, from the United Front government of Deve Gowda to the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance government to current Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government. A stalwart of the socialist movement who later emerged as Bihar’s foremost Dalit leader with following across the country, Mr. Paswan was instrumental in the implementation of the Mandal Commission report in the 1990s. “I am saddened beyond words. There is a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan  ji’s demise is a personal loss. I have lost a friend, valued colleague and someone who was extremely passionate to ensure every poor person leads a life of dignity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. Mr, Paswan broke out from the Janata Dal to form his own party, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), in 2000. In November 2019, he handed over the reins of the party to his son Chirag Paswan, settling instead for a Rajya Sabha berth, which has now become a bone of contention between the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) and the LJP.

09 October 2020||Pune,||With a helping hand, rural scholars move closer to realising their dreams||Their spirits undeterred by the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars of Dakshana Foundation, which helps bright but economically disadvantaged students from India’s rural hinterland clear some of the country’s toughest entrance exams, have posted their best result yet in this year’s Joint Entrance Exam to engineering colleges. As many as 374 of the 486 Dakshana scholars who sat for them, cleared the tough test and four have secured category (SC/ST) ranks among top 50 students from the backward communities, according to the Foundation authorities. “Of the 374, more than 280 are expected to be absorbed by the IITs based on the closing ranks accepted by the IITs in 2019,” said Col. (retd.) Ram Kumar Sharma, chief executive officer (CEO). To select the best and brightest students from the country’s rural and semi-urban areas, the Foundation, in 2007, began by tying-up with seven Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) across the country, including in Rajasthan and Kerala. At Dakshana, students are coached free of cost over a two-year period to crack the IIT and NEET exams. This year, Dakshana’s topper, Gopal Agrawal, who secured an All-India rank (AIR) of 523, hails from a humble family in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district. Gopal’s parents have barely studied up to Class X and run a small shop in the village. His father’s monthly income is less than Rs. 10,000. “Cracking the IIT has been by single-minded goal since my school days when my teachers urged me to pursue engineering. When I entered the JNV, I understood that engineers are the future of India. Then I heard about the Dakshana Scholarship and made entering that my first goal and IIT my second,” says Gopal, whose boyish smile belies a steely determination. In 2014, the Foundation established its centre in Pune — its eighth — in a sprawling, 104-acre pastoral idyll flanked by hillocks in Kadus village in Pune’s Khed taluk. Of the 486 scholars, 127 belong to Dakshana’s one-year scholarship program held at the Pune campus, where they were provided free coaching, food and accommodation, to prepare for JEE 2020. The remaining 359 scholars were part of a two-year scholarship program run jointly with the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti exclusively for JNV students and were prepared at the JNV Bangalore Urban and the JNV Rangareddy in Hyderabad. According to Col. Sharma, Dakshana’s true success lay in bringing the light of education to thousands of families in the country’s rural hinterland, thereby unfettering them from the shackles of poverty. “Our young scholars need to study in a suitable environ. Dakshana, with it’s gurukul-like atmosphere of the Pune campus, is providing them with the wherewithal and academic support necessary to crack these difficult exams,” he said. Lauding the determination of the students, Mohnish Pabrai, founder and chairman, said, “Dakshana’s model of alleviating poverty and unleashing the tremendous untapped talent of rural India has been successful beyond our wildest dreams. However, the best is yet to come as we are just getting started.” The foundation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ministry of Education for screening and selecting the most promising JNV students. It also has a partnership with 19 State governments.  Our model of unleashing the tremendous untapped talent of rural India has been successful beyond our wildest dreams Mohnish Pabrai Founder and chairman, Dakshana Foundation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/with-a-helping-hand-rural-scholars-move-closer-to-realising-their-dreams/article32808780.ece
09 October 2020||Mumbai,||Republic TV, 2 others in TRP racket: police||Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday said a Television Rating Point (TRP) racket involving Republic TV, Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi has been busted by the Crime Branch. Owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema have been arrested and charged with Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) of the Indian Penal Code, Mr. Singh told presspersons. “In the preliminary inquiry, one person was arrested, and he has revealed that he had been working for a company called Hansa Research Group Private Ltd., which is part of the BARC [Broadcast Audience Research Council, an organisation that functioned under the Information and Broadcasting Ministry and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]. The accused said the company has misused confidential data, which had been entrusted to them. It has apparently been done for wrongful gains of various TV channels, which had resulted in wrongful loss to various advertisers and their agencies,” Mr. Singh said. A press release from the police said, “Preliminary investigation also revealed that these accused persons have manipulated the sampling metering services by inducing the Bar-O-Meter users by paying them periodically to watch particular TV channel/s.” Money to households “Around Rs. 400-500 was given to several households on a monthly basis. Hansa’s ex-employee and his companion were arrested and Rs. 20 lakh were found along with Rs. 8.5 lakh in the bank locker,” he said. “We will examine directors, promoters, employees, those who look after advertising, distribution and funding of Republic TV.” Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami released a statement on social media saying, “Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh has made false allegations against Republic TV because we have questioned him in the Sushant Singh Rajput case investigation. Republic TV will file a criminal defamation case against Param Bir Singh.” BJP president J.P. Nadda tweeted: “Shooting the messenger is an art the Congress, their allies and ecosystem have mastered. They’ve been unapologetic about it since the Emergency. Their assaults on Republic and trampling over media freedom will never be tolerated by the people of India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/republic-tv-2-others-in-trp-racket-police/article32808917.ece
09 October 2020||HUBBALLI,||CID begins inquiry into Davangere ‘custodial death’||Officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have begun investigation in a case of custodial death of a resident of Vittalapura village at Mayakonda Police Station in Davangere district. According to police sources, a CID team, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Girish, began investigation in the case on Wednesday. Already, four police personnel, including a sub-inspector, have been arrested in connection with the case. They have also been suspended from service. Vrundamma, wife of Marulasiddappa of Vittallapura village, had complained to Mayakonda Police seeking help to trace her missing husband who had left home to live with another woman. The Mayakonda Police subsequently traced him at nearby Huchchavvana Halli and had brought him to the police station on Monday. The police had reportedly asked the family members to resolve the issue through dialogue and the complainant’s family had conveyed it to the police that they would come on Tuesday. However, in a later development, Marulasiddappa’s body was found near the railway station on Tuesday afternoon. The family members of Marulasiddappa had laid a siege to the police station alleging that the police had beaten the victim to death, while the local police denied it and said that they had let him off as he complained of uneasiness. A case was registered at the Mayakonda Police Station on Tuesday night itself and Deputy Superintendent of Police Narasimha Tamradhwaj was appointed as the inquiry officer by the Superintendent of Police of Davangere Hanumantharaya. In the wake of a complaint of custodial death, initially Sub-Inspector of Police Prakash, Head Constable Nagaraj and Constable Sher Ali were suspended and arrested. Later, another Constable Rangaswamy too was suspended and arrested. Inspector-General of Police of Eastern Range S. Ravi, who had rushed to the station on Tuesday night, had assured the family members of handing over the case to the CID for investigation. Compensation Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Davangere Mahanthesh Bilagi handed over a compensation cheque for Rs. 4,12,500 to the wife of the victim. Mr. Bilagi has said that there was provision for giving a compensation of Rs. 8.25 lakh to the victim in this case. He said that they have now given 50% of the compensation and the balance would be disbursed after a charge-sheet is filed in court. The post-mortem of the deceased was conducted in the presence of the Third JMFC (Judicial Magistrate First Class) Court at the District Hospital in Davangere on Wednesday and has been videographed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cid-begins-inquiry-into-davangere-custodial-death/article32808693.ece
09 October 2020||MYSURU,||COVID-19 testing in Mysuru is now above target||The COVID-19 testing in Mysuru has been ramped up with more than 100 per cent target achieved since Wednesday. The surge comes after the government asked the district administration to carry out more testing in the wake of the infection rate spiking exponentially besides an upsurge in deaths. Consequently, the district administration sought two-weeks’ time to show the results and the ramping up of testing across the district. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said testing was unsatisfactory all through the month of September. As against the target, 45 per cent testing was done last month. Testing is critical to identify infected persons early and give them treatment. Besides, it prevents the spread of the infection among the community, she said. Ms Sindhuri said Mysuru is now doing more testing and has started achieving more than 100 per cent target. On Wednesday, 124 percent testing was achieved. She said special testing teams had been constituted and officers had been posted to Mysuru city as well as various places in the districts to coordinate and ensure successful testing. Mysuru is now divided into four zones for COVID-19 management and senior officers will be monitoring the situation with the help of field teams. “We are at it and all efforts are being made to control COVID-19 in Mysuru,” she said. Meanwhile, the district administration has urged the public to wear masks, maintain social distancing and avoid crowding. The public should also focus on maintaining hand hygiene using hand sanitizers and washing hands with soap.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-testing-in-mysuru-is-now-above-target/article32808876.ece
09 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Poverty should not deprive a child of quality education, says Jagan||Poverty should not prevent children from economically weaker sections from pursuing quality education. This is why the government is changing the face of government schools through a series of schemes to take care of every aspect of a child’s growing years, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said here on Thursday. Speaking at the launch of Jagananna Vidya Kanuka at a Zilla Parishad School in Punadipadu under Kankipadu mandal in Krishna district, Mr. Jagan said about 43 lakh children of classes 1 to 10 in government schools would receive kits worth Rs. 650 crore in the next three days. The kits include three pairs of uniform cloth along with stitching charges, textbooks, notebooks, a pair of shoes, two pairs of socks, a belt and a school bag. Quoting Nobel laureate and activist for girl education from Pakistan Malala Yousafzai and Nelson Mandela, the Chief Minister said the government had realised the need for comprehensive changes in the education sector to enable children to compete with the world. The fact that even after 73 years of Independence, 34% people in the State were not literate spoke volumes about the priorities of the previous governments, he said. Referring to Mana Badi-Nadu Nadu, he said schools were given a facelift and they were now equipped with proper toilets with water facility, fans and tubelights in classrooms, green boards and good furniture besides construction of compound walls, new kitchens and painting the buildings in vibrant colours. Major schemes Mr. Jagan listed other major schemes such as Amma Vodi, under which a financial assistance of Rs. 15,000 was deposited in the bank accounts of women who sent their children to government schools. “Nearly 43 lakh women and 82 lakh students benefited from it, ” he said, informing that the second phase of the programme would start on January 9. He spoke about Sampoorna Poshana drive that was all about a nutritious diet to pregnant women and neonatal mothers at a cost of Rs. 1,800 crore to the exchequer and how Anganwadi centres were being transformed into YSR pre-primary schools. Speaking about Jagananna Goru Mudda, Mr Jagan said like no other Chief Minister had ever done, he had taken personal care in deciding the daily menu to ensure that the children were served nutritious food. Complete fee reimbursement under Vidya Deevena and Vasathi Deevena programmes were aimed at helping economically backward students pursue their higher studies without any stress, he added. Education Minister A. Suresh said children were eager to attend school and enjoy the new facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/poverty-should-not-deprive-a-child-of-quality-education-says-jagan/article32808487.ece

09 October 2020||GUWAHATI,||Assam jails cannot be detention centres: HC||The Gauhati High Court has said that people declared as foreigners cannot be kept in jails that serve as detention centres, depriving them of basic human rights and human dignity. The court has also issued a notice to the Assam government to submit a report on the steps taken to set up detention centres outside jail premises and “hire any private premises” if “suitable government accommodations are not available for the purpose”.  Hearing a cluster of petitions filed on behalf of persons lodged in Assam’s six detention centres and their kin, the High Court referred to a Supreme Court case involving 37 “Pakistani prisoners” while issuing the order on October 7. These prisoners “not required under Indian laws” were kept in jail despite completing their sentence by 2009 because the Pakistan High Commission did not confirm their nationality. The HC ruled that jails being used as detention centres were in conflict with the model manual for such centres. It referred to the apex court’s observation that detainees should be kept in an “appropriate place with restricted movements” pending deportation or repatriation and provided basic facilities such as electricity, water, hygiene, etc. ‘Hire private premises’ “Further, the requirement is that such detention centres/ holding centres/ camps should be set up outside the jail premises. The State government is also to ensure... appropriate security at these places,” the court’s order read. Taking note of the absence of designated detention centres, the Bench of Justice M.R. Pathak said: “... If appropriate suitable accommodation is not available and the acquisition of land and construction is pending for the purpose of setting up the detention centres, the State government may hire suitable building for setting up the detention centres”. The Army’s retired Junior Commissioned Officer Mohammed Sanaullah, who spent a few days in the Goalpara detention centre in 2019 after he was declared a foreigner, said the government “might as well keep people like us” at home and “under surveillance” to save money on hiring private property. Lodged in six jails People declared foreigners or “illegal migrants” in Assam are kept across detention centres within six jails where they share space with others serving time for various crimes. These jails are in Dibrugarh, Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Jorhat, Silchar and Tezpur. A designated detention centre to house 3,000 people is being built in Goalpara district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assam-jails-cannot-be-detention-centres-hc/article32809199.ece

09 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||Falsely implicated, say Hathras accused||A letter written by one of the accused in the Hathras rape-murder case claiming innocence and seeking “justice” surfaced on a day the Allahabad High Court dismissed a plea filed by the victim’s family seeking an end to their alleged “illegal detention” by the U.P. police. In the letter addressed to the Hathras SP from Aligarh jail, accused Sandeep Singh claimed he and three others were falsely implicated in the case by the family of the victim. The October 7 letter, widely circulated on social media on Thursday, has thumb impressions of all four accused, the other three being Ravi, Lavkush and Ramu. In the letter, Sandeep claims he was friends with the victim and the two would also talk over the phone but the girl’s family did not approve of their friendship. He also goes on to claim that on the day of the incident, he had met the victim in the fields and that she was accompanied by her brother and mother. Sandeep further claims through hearsay information that after he left the spot on the girl’s request, the girl’s brother and mother beat her up. Aligarh jail authorities confirmed that Sandeep had sent a letter and it was forwarded to the Hathras SP. Reacting to the letter, a female relative of the victim told a television channel that she sensed “plans” being executed to protect the four accused. ‘Approach apex court’ In Allahabad, taking up a habeas corpus petition filed by the victim’s family against their alleged illegal detention, a Division Bench noted that U.P. had already been directed to file affidavits clarifying its stand by the Supreme Court. Similar directions had already been issued by the Lucknow Bench of the High Court in a suo motu petition on October 1, the court added. The petitioners are at liberty to file an appropriate petition or application before the apex court, the HC said. The writ was moved by Surendra Kumar, general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Valmiki Mahapanchayat, on behalf of the family, through advocates Kashif Abbas Rizvi and Joun Abbas. The petition also prayed for directing the administration to allow the family — the victim’s parents, two brothers, sister-in-law and grandmother — to move to Delhi. The State government counsel objected to the petition on several counts, prime among them that the matter was already sub judice before the Supreme Court, hence the plea before the HC was not maintainable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/falsely-implicated-say-hathras-accused/article32808918.ece

09 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Build STPs in three months, says ZP||With a view to preventing the flow of untreated sewage into the open in rural areas, the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat will direct multi-storeyed apartments to construct sewage treatment plants (STPs) on their premises. The gram panchayats concerned will issue notices to such buildings to get STPs built in three months, Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani said on Thursday. Speaking at the general meeting of the panchayat here, Mr. Selvamani said that notices would be served on all apartments that were letting out untreated sewage into the open. “They (apartment owners/residents association) would be given three months to set up STPs. If they fail to set up STPs, the panchayats would take action,” he said. Mr. Selvamani told reporters later that the panchayats would withdraw no objection certificates issued to such residential apartments. In case of commercial complexes, the panchayats would not renew trade licence. He said that directions were issued to taluk panchayat executive officers to ensure documents under Forms 9 and 11 were issued by gram panchayats to the newly built multi-storeyed buildings only if they have STPs built as per set standards. “If we find that Forms 9 and 11 were issued to buildings without STPs, the executive officers concerned would be held responsible,” he added. Panchayat member Mamata D.S. Gatty pointed out that many multi-storeyed buildings in Mudipu and other villages were letting out untreated sewage in the open. “Mudipu and other villages were fast developing. We should prevent such transgressions,” she added. To this, Mr. Selvamani said that the State government has issued directions to take action against those who were letting untreated sewage directly into the river course. “Survey of the riverbed from Uppinangady to Thumbe is being done,” he said. A committee headed by a Range Forest Officer would submit a report about STPs that need to be set up in this region. “I will submit a report on this to the government in a fortnight,” he said. When some members pointed out the lack of funds coming from the State government for development works in the district, MLC Pratap Simha Nayak said that the government was taking advances to complete the ongoing development works. The panchayat council decided to hold a meeting on October 29 with revenue and forest officials to discuss about encroachment of lakebeds and other pressing issues related to the two departments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/build-stps-in-three-months-says-zp/article32809294.ece

Uma Devi opined that the matter warranted a probe by the CBI. Criticism of the courts is nothing but an affront to democracy, of which the judiciary is an integral part, they observed. Appearing for the State, Advocate-General S. Sriram said he did not have any objection if the court wanted the CBI to ferret out the facts, while insisting that the government was not responsible for the references made to the judiciary through social media. He was responding to the observation by the Judges that if the case was not handled properly, they would be forced to rope in the CBI to expose those who made the derogatory remarks and the circumstances under which they stooped so low.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-for-cbi-probe-into-comments-on-judiciary/article32808542.ece

Mr. Raju and his wife were also directors in the company. In the complaint, the banks have alleged diversion and misappropriation of funds from 2014 to 2018. Among those named in the case are the company’s managing director and other directors. The PNB alleged that it declared the loan account as a fraud in November 2019. According to the complaint, the company’s directors had approached the bank’s corporate branch in Delhi for the credit facilities. Ind-Barath Thermal Power Limited, earlier known as Ind-Barath Power (Karwar) Limited, was to initially set up a 300 MW coal-based captive power plant in Karnataka.

The company was sanctioned a senior debt amounting to Rs. 941.80 crore and subordinated debt of Rs. 62.80 crore to part finance the project, which was completed. Subsequently, it sought working capital facilities to the tune of Rs. 300 crore in April 2014. There were persistent irregularities in the accounts of the company, which were brought to its notice by all the lenders, alleges the FIR. Searches at Bhimavaram Staff Reporter in Vijayawada writes: The CBI sleuths conducted searches on the properties of Mr. Raghu Rama Krishna Raju at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district on Thursday. “The CBI sleuths carried out day-long searches on Mr. Raju’s house.

In an attempt to crack down on offenders, RTOs have been directed not to issue certificates to motorists. A senior official with the Transport Department said, “The rule was being practised by the RTOs even earlier. However with fresh directions, it will be enforced strictly. Fitness certificates will not be issued until the vehicle owner clears all the dues and gets an NOC from the traffic police.” An order was issued to RTOs on September 30. According to the traffic police, around Rs. 100 crore is yet to come in from cases that were booked through contactless enforcement, which was started due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Despite the traffic department issuing notices to owners to clear their fines, they have failed to pay them,” said a traffic police official.

They declared RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha as their chief ministerial candidate. The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), meanwhile, released its first list of 42 party candidates, which included several senior BJP leaders who recently joined the LJP despite the BJP’s repeated warnings that the party may take action against those contesting the Bihar polls outside the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Janata Dal-United (JD-U)’s National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the State. In another development, Satya Prakash, son of former Union Minister and RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, joined the ruling JD(U) in the presence of State party chief Basistha Narayan Singh at the party headquarters. On the other hand, the RJD is said to have given a ticket to the wife of don-turned-politician Ramakishore Singh from the Mahnar Assembly constituency. Earlier, Mr. Raghuvansh had quit the party in protest against the likelihood of Mr. Singh joining the RJD. The party has also changed the Assembly constituency of Tej Pratap Yadav, older son of party chief Lalu Prasad, from Mahua in Vaishali to the Hasanpur constituency in the neighbouring Samastipur district. The RJD has fielded Mukesh Roshan from the Mahua seat. “Altogether, six parties are here on one platform to form the Grand Democratic Secular Front, and it appeals to the people of Bihar to give us one chance to see how Bihar would be a developed State in five years,” said the Front’s coordinator and leader of the Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), Devendra Yadav.

Party leader and spokesperson, Ashraf Ansari, said, “The LJP has given 20% of 42 seats to women (9), and most of the party’s district presidents too have been accommodated in the list, including several leaders from the BJP and JD(U).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/six-parties-join-hands-ahead-of-bihar-election/article32808503.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC slams govt.’s Tablighi affidavit||Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday pulled up the Union government for mistreating the Supreme Court for having a “junior officer” file an “evasive” affidavit containing “unnecessary, nonsensical” averments on petitions challenging the discriminatory and communal coverage of the Tablighi Jamaat incident by some sections of the media. “You cannot treat the court the way you are doing in this case... A junior officer has filed your affidavit. We find it extremely evasive and brazenly short of details. It even says the petitioners here do not point to any instance of bad reporting...” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Mr. Mehta promised to file a fresh affidavit. “We want the Secretary of the department [Information and Broadcasting] to file this affidavit... The Secretary has to say what he thinks of the incidents. We do not want any unnecessary, nonsensical averments like those made now,” the CJI said. ‘Most abused freedom’ Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for petitioners led by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, said the present government affidavit even accused the petitioners of trying to gag the freedom of speech. “Freedom of speech may be one of the most abused freedom in recent times,” Chief Justice Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench comprising Justices A S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanium, replied. The government affidavit had claimed that a “blanket gag order” on the media in this issue would violate a journalist’s right to free speech and an informed citizen’s right to know. The hearing began with Chief Justice Bobde asking whether the regulatory provisions of the Cable TV Act, which are meant for cable networks, would be “exercisable” on TV broadcasts. “We want to know if the government has any power to question or ban TV broadcasting signals”, he asked the parties. The CJI said regulatory bodies had issued advisories to the the TV channels. Mr. Dave argued that the Information and Broadcasting Ministry had indeed the power to ban TV broadcasting under the Cable TV Act. He referred to how Malayalam channel Asianet was banned for several hours in March under the Act in relation to their coverage of the Delhi riots. The court said it would hear arguments on this point and adjourned the case for two weeks. The petitions have said that certain sections of the media were spreading bigotry and communal hatred in relation to the Tablighi Jamaat conference held in the Nizamuddin Markaz area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-slams-govts-tablighi-affidavit/article32808513.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Despite the pandemic, two patients from Gujarat get new lungs||When Anuj Shah went from playing badminton with his children to becoming bed-ridden in a matter of weeks as he could not breathe, life took a bizarre turn for his family. His wife said the 39-year-old was diagnosed with hypersensitivity in the lungs in February and by June he was on lung support machine. When his doctors in Ahmedabad advised lung transplant, the family reached out to Apollo Hospitals. Very soon, Mr. Shah was airlifted to Chennai but he had to wait till the end of July for the transplant. Mr. Shah, who is recuperating back home in Ahmedabad, said he was doing well. Senior cardiothoracic and heart-lung transplant surgeon at the hospital T. Sunder, said Mr. Shah’s lung muscles had become weak due to his ailment and took time to heal. He received a double lung transplant; he was the first patient to get a transplant after the ban on transplants due to the pandemic was lifted. He is now able to walk around 2 km, indicating good recovery following the transplant. In another case, Ino Bhandari is grateful to the hospital that her husband K. Bhandari is now alive. Mr. Bhandari, also from Ahmedabad, was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease that caused fibrosis in the lungs. He was diagnosed in January and like Mr. Shah, arrived at the hospital in June. Ms. Bhandari said her husband’s oxygen requirement rose from a mere few litres to 17 litres. He was put on ECMO support for 46 days. On September 2 he underwent lung transplantation. He will be discharged shortly, said K. Madhan Kumar, senior consultant, heart-lung transplant surgeon. Senior cardiothoracic and heart-lung transplant surgeon Paul Ramesh Thangaraj, who was one of the three treating surgeons, said unlike the liver, heart, and kidneys, lung transplants are more challenging as they had an extreme interface with the environment. The surgeons said the delay in transplant could have been reduced had organs been available more easily. Hospital chairman Prathap C. Reddy lauded the surgeons, saying that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital had taken up the challenging procedures. “The successful double lung transplant was a result of the gold standard followed in clinical organ retrieval, preservation and transport with a dedicated team coordinating the complex logistics required to ensure timely transfers, a team keeping the recipient prepped and ready, and the transplant surgery performed by some of the finest and experienced transplant surgeons in the country supported by specialists from a variety of fields, transplant coordinators, social workers, psychiatrists and anaesthesiologists,” he said. He said the government had through an Act made transplants possible. Yet “Cadaver supply is still low. The government must take the big step. The patient must take the decision himself if he/she wants to donate organs,” he said, adding that countries such as Singapore had included a clause in the driving licence form, seeking to know if the person would like to be an organ donor. Hospital vice-chairman Preetha Reddy said it was courageous of the patients and their families who, despite the looming danger of COVID-19 infection, had agreed for the surgery. She also congratulated the doctors and the healthcare team for their dedication to ensuring patient safety. “Our team has worked hard to ensure safety of the patients,” she said. Managing director Sangeeta Reddy praised the hospital’s medical team for their effort in patient care, despite the risks involved. She pointed out that over 40% of those who had been infected had co-morbidity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/despite-the-pandemic-two-patients-from-gujarat-get-new-lungs/article32808491.ece

The NIA said that Cader is a business analyst at a bank in Chennai, and Nasir is a rice merchant in Bengaluru. The case was registered suo moto by the NIA on September 19 after certain incriminating facts emerged about a Bengaluru-based IS module during the investigation of another case, where a Bengaluru-based ophthalmologist Abdur Rahman was arrested. During Rahman’s examination, names of other associates who had travelled to Syria in 2013-2014 to join the IS came to be known. “Further investigation resulted in the busting of a module wherein it was revealed that accused Ahamed Abdul Cader, Irfan Nasir and their associates were members of the Hizb-ut-Tehrir, and they had formed a group called ‘Quran Circle’, which radicalized gullible Muslim youth in Bengaluru and funded their visit to the conflict zone in Syria to aid and assist the IS terrorists,” NIA said in a statement. Based on the information, the NIA registered a case under Sections 120B and 125 of IPC, and Sections 17, 18 and 18B of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused for affiliation with the banned terrorist organization IS/ISIL/Daesh and for “entering into a conspiracy to radicalise and motivate Muslim youth of Bengaluru to join IS and for raising funds to facilitate their travel to Syria”. The NIA said the accused and their associates played a very significant role in radicalisation of the members of the group and arranged funds through donations and their own sources for the visit of Rahman and others from Bengaluru to Syria to join the IS. The NIA said searches were conducted on the premises of the accused, and incriminating material and electronic devices had been seized. The accused were produced before a Special NIA Court in Bengaluru and NIA custody for 10 days had been granted for interrogation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-arrests-two-for-alleged-is-affiliation/article32808494.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||‘It is unclear who the LJP is fighting against’||Bhupendra Yadav , BJP general secretary in charge of Bihar, clarifies that the campaign of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the State is based on development work done under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is not part of the arrangement.  It is being said that the LJP’s decision to fight alone in Bihar is some sort of Plan B by the BJP to break the big brother status of the Janata Dal(U) in the NDA in Bihar? What do you say? These conspiracy theories are laughable. The BJP has only one plan in the election and that is to fight it along with the JD(U). We have spelt out that plan, but in case there is some confusion, I am spelling it out again. The BJP will contest 121 of the 243 seats, the JD(U) will fight on 122. The JD(U) will accommodate the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) under its quota of seats, while the BJP will accommodate the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). That is the only plan we have. The LJP is not a part of this arrangement because the party chose to fight alone. The NDA is fighting for development in Bihar under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and vision, with Nitish Kumar as the undisputed chief ministerial candidate of the alliance.  There is talk that many BJP leaders, desirous of fighting polls on seats now given to the JD(U) in the seat adjustment, will be fighting on LJP ticket. What will be the attitude of the party if that happens?  Anyone who has left the BJP to fight an election on the ticket of any other party, including LJP, is to be considered as a person ousted from the BJP. As I have stated, we are fighting the election in alliance with JD(U) and have mutually agreed upon seat-sharing deal with them. These are rumours being spread by the opposition to confuse voters. But the voters are smart enough to see through the ploy. As for the LJP, I see them as a highly confused lot. It is not even clear who the LJP is fighting against. They say they are against the RJD, but the LJP leader has gone on to congratulate RJD leader Tejashwi Pratap Yadav. They are fighting the NDA, but at the Centre, they continue to have ministerial berth in the NDA government. Their own party is ridden with infighting with allegations and counter-allegations of the leadership selling party tickets. LJP needs to do some hard thinking to figure out what exactly they want.  What will be the NDA’s campaign points with regard to the Bihar polls?  The NDA has entered the election with the slogan of “Atmanirbhar Bihar”. A lot of work has been done by the NDA government on issues of roads, power and water. Prime Minister Modi has launched fisheries and animal husbandry projects worth more than Rs. 20,000 crore in Bihar. Urban infrastructure projects worth Rs. 541 crore have been launched. For migrant workers, Prime Minister Modi has extended the distribution of free ration under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till Chhath Puja in November. Over the last few years, people in Bihar have been receiving benefits under the Ujjwala Yojana and other benefits through DBTs (direct benefit transfers), which earlier were just promises. This relentless development work will continue in Bihar under the vision of PM Modi and chief ministership of Nitish Kumar.  These are the first polls being held since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and there are worries that voters, especially those from the middle class, may not turn up in large numbers. Do you have a strategy for turning out the vote?  As much as 89% of Bihar’s population is rural. The Election Commission has reduced the maximum number of voters per booth from 1,500 to 1,000. It has also increased polling stations from about 65,000 to 1 lakh. To ensure that the voter gets to the polling booth, the NDA in Bihar has organised door-to-door campaign across 3,000 panchayats. The BJP has given a lot more tickets to women. They are active participants in electoral politics. This will also help attract more women to vote. More people-connect programmes will be undertaken, because there is no doubt that there is a pandemic but the process of democracy must not be weakened. For democracy to be strengthened, it is important that people participate in elections and seek accountability from their leaders. None of this shall happen at the cost of social distancing and other norms in place. The Election Commission is overseeing it and as the party in power, the NDA, too, will do everything to ensure that no one’s safety is compromised and that people feel confident enough to come out and vote. The poll is being billed as BJP vs RJD. Do you agree with this characterisation? The election is NDA versus UPA. The NDA has BJP, JD(U), HAM and VIP. We are together solidly and will form the government... As for the UPA, I am reminded of Mohammed Rafi’s famous song Ek dil ke tukde hazar hue, koi yahaan gira koi wahaan gira (The heart has broken into a 1,000, pieces falling here and there). This so-called Mahagathbandhan first forced HAM to leave, then they back-stabbed Mukesh Sahani's VIP, forcing them out of the coalition. Even the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has decided to fight on its own. So the UPA alliance is signalling that it has no place for backwards, Mahadalits and tribals; instead there are tying up with the ultra Left, who are part of the tukde-tukde gang, interested in a violent struggle to divide India. The only thing binding the UPA constituents is hunger for power now. I want to use this opportunity to ask the Congress, what drove it to join hands with the ultra Left Maoist Leninist party, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), along with the CPI(M) and the CPI?  The only thing binding the UPA constituents is hunger for power now||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-is-unclear-who-the-ljp-is-fighting-against/article32808501.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Dalit leader who wore many a hat||It was a simple question posed by his friend, “Do you want to be the government or servant?”, that led socialist leader Ram Vilas Paswan into politics. In the half century that he spent in the profession, he came to be known as the weather vane of Indian politics, serving in the Cabinets of six Prime Ministers of all hues, from the United Front government of H.D. Deve Gowda to the BJP-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was 1968. Ram Vilas Paswan, then a 22-year-old, had secured the position of Deputy Superintendent of Police in Bihar, a huge leap for the son of a Dalit farmer, brought up in flood-prone Shaharbannii village, now known as mantri tola thanks to its famous resident, in Khagaria district of Bihar. Should he take the unpredictable life of a legislator or return to being a “Dy.SP”, was the question. His friend Lakshmi Narain Arya said, “Yeh toh aapke upar nirbhar karta hai, aap government ban-na chate hai ya servant ban-na chahte hai.” He never joined the police. It has been a roller coaster ride for Mr. Paswan from the heartland of Bihar to 12 Janpath, sharing the boundary wall with one of the most famous political addresses of the country, UPA president Sonia Gandhi’s residence at 10 Janpath. He was in equal measure a participant and a spectator in the Lutyens power matrix. And he wore many hats — a Dalit leader, a socialist, a liberal and also a political opportunist. There was no turning back for him after being elected MLA in 1969 from the Samyukta Socialist Party. It is difficult to believe that till he fought his first election, he had no brush with politicians and had not attended a single political rally. It was more of a dare to defeat Congress old-timer Mishri Sadda who had been winning the Alauli seat since 1952. Long record In the 42 years since, he had been elected to the Lok Sabha eight times barring in 2009. And this year, he returned to Parliament once again for a second stint in the Rajya Sabha. In 1975, when the Emergency was proclaimed, he was arrested and spent the entire period in jail. On being released in 1977, he became a member of the Janata Party and won the election to the Lok Sabha for the first time on its ticket. He held the world record for winning the election by the highest margin. In 1989, he first became a Minister handling the Labour portfolio in the V.P. Singh government. His favourite stint was as Railway Minister in 1996 under Mr. Deve Gowda’s leadership. He was also part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, in which he was unceremoniously removed as Communications Minister, an announcement, he often said, that he first heard on TV. In 2000, Mr. Paswan broke from the Janata Dal to form the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) building up on the Dalit sena that he had formed in 1983. In 2002, after the Godhra riots, he quit the NDA. For a while, he drifted in the political wilderness which lifted when Congress president Sonia Gandhi, a neighbour of many years, walked across to his house to convince him to join the UPA. In the February 2005 Bihar Assembly elections, Mr. Paswan’s LJP contested the election with the Congress. The results threw up a hung Assembly. The LJP won 29 seats, its highest tally ever in the State. However, Mr. Paswan refused to support either Nitish Kumar or Lalu Prasad. Instead he insisted that a Muslim be made the Chief Minister. The State went to the polls again and Nitish Kumar won. In 2014, it was his son Chirag Paswan who steered him towards the BJP, a party that he had publicly recoiled from. He was the oldest of three brothers and one sister. He is often called a dynast. He brought his brothers Pashupati Nath Paras and late Ramchandra Paswan into politics. Of the six seats that the LJP won in 2019, three are from his family — Chirag, brother Pashupati Kumar Paras and nephew Prince Raj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dalit-leader-who-wore-many-a-hat/article32808505.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||PM hails Afghan ceasefire efforts||In a sign of India’s increased engagement with the ongoing Intra-Afghan Dialogue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a meeting with chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR) Abdullah Abdullah, who is here on a five-day visit. During the talks, Mr. Abdullah briefed the Prime Minister on the deliberations in Doha between the Afghan government and civil society representatives with Taliban representatives. “Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s commitment towards sustainable peace and prosperity in Afghanistan and welcomed efforts towards a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Mr. Abdullah, who met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval over dinner on Wednesday, will meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday, it said. Sustainable peace Addressing diplomats and scholars at an address organised by the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence and Strategic Analysis (MPIDSA), Mr. Abdullah said he had been “energised and re-energised” by India’s support to the people of Afghanistan “achieving a dignified durable and sustainable peace”. He expressed gratitude for the $3billion aid India has disbursed for projects across Afghanistan since 2001. Asked about his visit to Islamabad last week and whether India-Pakistan tensions would affect his mission for “regional consensus” for the IAN (Intra Afghan Negotiations), he said that Afghans would pursue their own “national interest”. “We need better relations with all countries. It is not our policy to decide the policies that other countries pursue towards each other, but we believe that peace in Afghanistan is in everyone’s interest,” he said, adding that Mr. Modi had assured him that India would support any peace agreement that was agreeable to the people of Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-hails-afghan-ceasefire-efforts/article32808526.ece

The family members also raised the issue of compensation with Mr. Sinha and expressed faith in the J&K government and the police “for their cooperation in the case so far”, officials said. Three missing youths — Imtiyaz Ahmed, 26, Ibrar Ahmed 20 and Ibrar Ahmed, 16 — were passed off as unidentified militants by the security forces after an operation in south Kashmir's Shopian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-l-g-sinha-visits-fake-encounter-victims-families/article32809202.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ahead of festival season, PM kicks off new campaign||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a Jan Andolan for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The campaign was launched in view of the upcoming festival and winter season as well as the opening up of the economy, said a release issued by the Union Health Ministry. “This will be a low-cost, high-intensity campaign with the key message — “Wear Mask, Follow Physical Distancing, Maintain Hand Hygiene”, said the Ministry. Vaccine rollout The campaign has been launched even as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged countries to plan for efficient rollout of COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available. “Like the rest of the world, the South-East Asia region continues to be at risk. To stop the spread of the virus, we need to do it all — continued strong leadership; robust public health measures; clear communication and an engaged, empowered and enabled population — to turn the tide,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region. In a communication to the member countries, Dr. Singh said, the global race for COVID-19 vaccine has gathered momentum. In anticipation of development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, countries should be prepared with an efficient and coordinated strategy and plan for rollout of vaccination.

09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||IAF showed capability in Ladakh stand-off: IAF chief||The rapid deployment of Air Force assets to forward areas in the ongoing stand-off in eastern Ladakh and support to the Army clearly demonstrated the “resolve, operational capability and the will to effectively engage the adversary” if the need arose, Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S.

09 October 2020||New Delhi,||What is TRP, why was it manipulated?||With the Mumbai police alleging that three television channels are involved in manipulating TRPs, here is a look at the whole issue.  Why is TRP important? In simple terms, anyone who watches television for more than a minute is considered a viewer. A viewer can be as young as a two-year-old. The TRP, or Target Rating Point, is the metric used by the marketing and advertising agencies to evaluate this viewership. In India, the TRP is recorded by the Broadcast Audience Research Council using Bar-O-Meters that are installed on televisions in selected households. As on date, the BARC has installed these meters in 44,000 households across the country. Audio watermarks are embedded in video content prior to broadcast. These watermarks are not audible to the human ear, but can easily be detected and decoded using dedicated hardware and software. As viewing details are recorded by the Bar-O-Meters, so are the watermarks. How are the households selected? Selection of households is a two-stage process. The first step is the establishment survey, a large-scale face-to-face survey of a sample of approximately 3 lakh households from the target population. This is done annually. Out of these, the households which will have Bar-O-Meters or what the BARC calls the recruitment sample are randomly selected. The fieldwork to recruit households is not done directly by the BARC. On its website, it has said that the viewing behaviour of panel homes is reported to BARC India daily. Coincidental checks either physically or telephonically are done regularly. Certain suspicious outliers are also checked directly. “BARC India also involves a separate vigilance agency to check on outliers that it considers highly suspicious,” the website says. And as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, these households rotate every year. This rotation is in such a manner that older panel homes are removed first while maintaining the representativeness of the panel. The rotation is conducted in a staggered manner every month. The Ministry guidelines further say that the secrecy and privacy of the panel homes must be maintained, and asked the BARC to follow a voluntary code of conduct. What are the loopholes in the process? The Mumbai police alleged that households were being paid to manipulate the TRP. “As in all our previous cases of suspected panel homes intrusions, BARC India continues to follow its established vigilance and disciplinary guidelines. BARC remains steadfastly true to its purpose to accurately and faithfully report ‘What India Watches’. BARC India appreciates the efforts of the Mumbai Police and will provide the support asked of it,” a BARC India spokesperson said. Several doubts have been raised on many previous occasions about the working of the TRP. On Wednesday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that the TRP process needs a rethink and attacked what he called “TRP journalism”.” Public broadcaster Doordarshan has time and again said that TRP did not reflect the actual viewership. As per reports, about 70% of the revenue for television channels comes from advertising and only 30% from subscription.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/what-is-trp-why-was-it-manipulated/article32808517.ece
09 October 2020||Mumbai,||3 channels in TRP racket, say police||Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday said a Television Rating Point (TRP) racket involving Republic TV, Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi had been busted by the Crime Branch. Owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema have been arrested, Mr. Singh told presspersons. “In the preliminary inquiry, one person was arrested, and he has revealed that he had been working for a company called Hansa Research Group Private Ltd., which is part of the BARC [Broadcast Audience Research Council, an organisation that functioned under the Information and Broadcasting Ministry and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]. The accused said the company has misused confidential data, which had been entrusted to them. It has apparently been done for wrongful gains of various TV channels, which had resulted in wrongful loss to various advertisers and their agencies,” Mr. Singh said. A press release from the police says, “Preliminary investigation also revealed that these accused persons have manipulated the sampling metering services by inducing the Bar-O-Meter users by paying them periodically to watch particular TV channel/s.” “Around Rs. 400-500 was given to several households on a monthly basis. Hansa’s ex-employee and his companion were arrested and Rs. 20 lakh were found along with Rs. 8.5 lakh in the bank locker,” he said. “We will examine directors, promoters, employees, those who look after advertising, distribution and funding of Republic TV.” Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami released a statement on social media saying, “Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh has made false allegations against Republic TV because we have questioned him in the Sushant Singh Rajput case investigation. Republic TV will file a criminal defamation case against Param Bir Singh.” BJP president J.P. Nadda tweeted: “Shooting the messenger is an art the Congress, their allies and ecosystem have mastered. They’ve been unapologetic about it since the Emergency. Their assaults on Republic and trampling over media freedom will never be tolerated by the people of India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-channels-in-trp-racket-say-police/article32808519.ece
09 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||HC rejects plea of Hathras victim’s family against curbs||The accused in the Hathras gang rape and murder case have written to the district police chief from jail claiming innocence and sought “justice” even as the Allahabad High Court dismissed a plea by the victim’s family seeking release from the alleged “illegal detention” of the Uttar Pradesh police in their native village. A Division Bench of Justices Prakash Padia and Pritinker Diwaker on Thursday noted that the State government had already been directed to file affidavits clarifying its stand in the entire case by the Supreme Court. ‘Can move SC’ “In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, judicial propriety demands that it will not be proper for this court to entertain the present petition on merits, especially when security has been provided to petitioners 1 to 6 and other family members of the deceased victim-girl on the observation made by the apex court,” said the High Court. If the petitioners have any grievance, they are at liberty to file appropriate petition or application before the apex court, the HC said. In a letter to SP Hathras, the accused Sandeep Singh claimed he and three others were falsely implicated in the case by the family of the victim. The letter, also widely circulated on social media on Thursday, has thumb impressions of all four accused, the other three being Ravi, Lavkush and Ramu. In the letter, Sandeep claims that he was acquainted with the victim and the two would speak on phone but the girl’s family did not approve of their friendship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-rejects-plea-of-hathras-victims-family-against-curbs/article32808522.ece

In an order, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla issued several amendments to the Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Act, 2000, and the Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Corporation Act, 2000, carried through the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020. The erstwhile State of J&K had provisions for imposition of property tax in the laws enacted by the then legislature. ‘Not to exceed 15%’ The MHA has substituted Sections 72 to 80 and now Section 72 states in the previous Acts of 2000: “Unless exempted under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, property tax shall be levied on all lands and buildings or vacant lands or both situated within the municipal area. The property tax shall be levied at such percentage not exceeding 15% of the taxable annual value of land and building or vacant land or both as the government may, by notification, from time to time specify.” Reacting to the decision, Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra tweeted, “These new provisions not only erode the followed convention but will have serious negative repercussions in the future. Wisely, it will create more chances of corruption now.

Inclusion of these procedures under Aarogyasri would ensure that the poor could opt for these surgeries without the feat of incurring huge expenditure. The government was prepared to amend the legislation governing the issue if need be. Members of the sub-committee - Ministers K. Taraka Rama Rao, E. Dayakar Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav - senior health department officials participated in the meeting which also made several other recommendations. The Minister said the health sector saw several changes since the formation of separate Telangana and these resulted in significant reduction in infant and maternal mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate dropped from 92 to 63 and infant mortality rate from 39 to 26. The State was ranked third next only to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in terms of providing effective medical services to people. The Cabinet panel discussed measures to strengthen the services further. Accordingly, steps would be taken to strengthen primary healthcare centres while all hospitals would be equipped with CT Scan, MRI, X-ray and other facilities. Steps were also under way to strengthen the infrastructure at MNJ Cancer hospital. Mr. Rajender said the basti dawakhanas were functioning satisfactorily and steps had been initiated to enhance their number to 300 in the coming days. There were 198 basti dawakhanas functioning to full potential while another 26 would be opened before this month-end. People were satisfied with the functioning of these units and it was therefore decided to enhance their number to cater to the needs. The government was maintaining the services of the 108 ambulances effectively with its own expenditure and efforts would be made to ensure that a dedicated ambulance would be deployed for each mandal across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/heart-kidney-and-liver-transplants-under-aarogyasri/article32809217.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Come with strong arguments in Lavalin case, SC tells CBI||The Supreme Court on Thursday told the CBI that it will need to bolster its appeal against Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the SNC Lavalin corruption case with “very strong arguments” as two courts had discharged him and some others of all wrong-doing. “You know that two courts have concurrently said these persons need not be tried. You will have to come up now with very strong arguments to say they should not be discharged”, Justice U.U. Lalit, heading a three-judge Bench, addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI. Mr. Vijayan was discharged in the case as an accused by both the Special Court, CBI, in Thiruvananthapuram, and the Kerala High Court. The CBI has, in its appeal, contended that Mr. Vijayan should face trial in the case. The corruption case concerns the loss of Rs. 86.25 crore in the Kerala State Electricity Board’s (KSEB) contract with Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of Pallivasai, Sengulam and Panniar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district . Mr. Vijayan was the State’s Power Minister then. The premier investigation agency said Mr. Vijayan travelled to Canada as a “guest” of Lavalin in 1997. It was there, in Canada, he made the “crucial” decision to promote Lavalin, who was a mere consultancy firm retained on fixed-rate basis, from consultants to suppliers. The CBI has argued that the decision of the Kerala HC to discharge the Chief Minister was “not correct”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/come-with-strong-arguments-in-lavalin-case-sc-tells-cbi/article32808489.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||MEA defends free press after Chinese note on Taiwan event||The Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday reiterated that the Indian media is free and it reports on issues on merit. The Ministry’s response came a day after the Chinese Embassy sent an email to around 250 journalists asking them not to refer to Taiwan as a “country” or a “nation” while covering a special event on October 10, organised by the Taipei Economy and Cultural Centre (TECC) in India. “There is a free media in India, that reports on issues that they see fit,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava in response to a question during the weekly online media interaction. The MEA response came a day after the note to the Indian media urged them to follow the “One China principle” with regard to the upcoming celebration of the “109th” anniversary of the “national” day of Taiwan. The Chinese Embassy reminded the Indian media that Beijing does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country or a nation and the Indian media should follow that while reporting on the Taiwanese event. India has officially followed the “One-China principle” and there has been no change in that stance. . The TECC does not have a diplomatic status here as India does not recognise Taiwan as a separate entity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mea-defends-free-press-after-chinese-note-on-taiwan-event/article32808510.ece

Kulkarni heard public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a direction to the authorities to issue guidelines to be followed by all media houses – print, TV, radio and Internet to refrain from publishing and curtailing any comments which may jeopardise the reputation of the police that may hinder the cause of administration of justice. A plea sought a direction to news channels to ensure against media trial place, which has the impact of prejudicing the independent investigation being undertaken by the CBI in the case. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, for former directors general of police and former commissioner of police, in another plea, spoke about media trials. He said media should not report on the criminal investigations in a case. Media had been commenting on witnesses and the prosecution. They were running hashtags and a campaign that involved prejudging a case. Naming anchors of Times Now Navika Kumar and Rahul Shivshankar, Mr. Chinoy said they were crossing the line in reporting the Sushant matter and running hashtags that involved prejudging like #ArrestRhea. He referred to guidelines issued by the Press Council of India: “Norms of Journalistic Conduct”, which contained provisions related to investigative journalism.

During Rahman’s examination, names of other associates who had travelled to Syria in 2013-2014 to join the IS came to be known. “Further investigation resulted in the busting of a module wherein it was revealed that accused Ahamed Abdul Cader, Irfan Nasir and their associates were members of the Hizb-ut-Tehrir, and they had formed a group called ‘Quran Circle’ which radicalized gullible Muslim youth in Bengaluru and funded their visit to conflict zone in Syria to aid and assist the IS terrorists,” NIA said in a statement. Based on the information, the NIA registered a case under Sections 120B and 125 of IPC, and Sections 17, 18 and 18B of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused for affiliation with the banned terrorist organization IS/ISIL/Daesh and for “entering into a conspiracy to radicalize and motivate Muslim youth of Bengaluru to join IS and for raising funds to facilitate their travel to Syria”. The NIA said the accused and their associates played a significant role in radicalisation of the members of the group and arranged funds through donations and their own sources for the visit of Rahman and others from Bengaluru to Syria to join the IS.The NIA said searches were conducted at the premises of the accused, and incriminating material and electronic devices had been seized. The accused were produced before Special NIA Court in Bengaluru and NIA custody for 10 days has been granted for interrogation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-arrests-two-for-alleged-is-affiliation/article32809137.ece
09 October 2020||MALAPPURAM,||Abdullakutty escapes unhurt from road crash||Bharatiya Janata Party national vice president A.P. Abdullakutty was involved in a road accident at Randathani, near Kottakkal, on Thursday night. The BJP alleged that it was an attempt on his life. The police said Mr. Abdullakutty, on his way to Kozhikode, had an argument with some people at Puthanathani, where he stopped his car for a tea. As he continued his journey, his car rammed behind another vehicle as it applied sudden brakes at Randathani, and a lorry hit his car from behind. But he was not injured. Mr. Abdullakutty proceeded to Kozhikode in another car, but later said that it was an attempt on his life. The police said the accident occurred at 10.15 p.m. and it was raining heavily in the area. BJP State president K. Surendran said in a statement that it was a deliberate attack on Mr. Abdullakutty. He demanded action against those responsible. He said BJP workers were duty-bound to protect their national vice president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/abdullakutty-escapes-unhurt-from-road-crash/article32809266.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||BJP workers clash with police in Kolkata||Several BJP supporters were injured in the violence. Party national secretary Arvind Menon and State BJP vice-president Raju Banerjee were among those hospitalised. Thousands of BJP supporters from across the State had assembled in the city for the march. Tents were put up in front of the party’s State headquarters in central Kolkata to accommodate them. A number of BJP MPs and party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya joined the protester. Youth wing president Soumitra Khan and national president of the BJP Yuva Morcha Tejasvi Surrya were among those at the march in Howrah. “The police had made unprecedented arrangements. Senior party leaders have sustained injuries. I also fell down. The attempt to suppress a peaceful movement will have more ramifications,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. ‘Crude bombs hurled’ Thousands of police personnel were deployed at the key intersections leading to the Secretariat. “The assembly has been declared illegal. We are urging you to disperse,” the police announced over microphones as protesters engaged in pitched battles with the security personnel. There were reports of crude bombs being hurdled in the Howrah Maidan and the police seized a firearm from a person during mob dispersal. The government had announced on Wednesday that the Secretariat would be closed for sanitisation on Thursday and Friday. Speaking to journalists later in the evening, Mr. Tejasvi Surya said about 1,000 party supporters were injured and about 500 taken in custody. He asked why the police mixed some dark blue chemical in the water used in water cannons. “We demand an inquiry into the use of this dark blue chemical, which is not used anywhere. This is gross abuse of human rights,” he said, adding it was a “black day in democracy”. State’s Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said a letter was sent by a political organisation on the evening of October 7 seeking permission for the rally to which the Home department has replied. “The applicant last evening had mentioned several rallies and said each of the rallies will have 25,000 youths. If several rallies, each having 25,000 youths, had to be sanctioned, that would have been a travesty as per the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) and lockdown norms,” he added. The blue liquid used in the water cannon was nothing but a dye, which was a practice followed globally to identify people after dispersal if required for necessary legal action, Mr. Bandyopadhyay noted. The Trinamool Congress leadership accused the BJP of trying to incite violence through the rallies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-workers-clash-with-police-in-kolkata/article32808492.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Q2 records 107% surge in fresh investments||Private sector investments in the second quarter were just 7% down from a year ago, with 618 new projects worth Rs. 83,608.2 crore. This was almost double the 315 new projects worth Rs. 44,714.6 crore announced in Q1, but still far less than the average quarterly investments of Rs. 1.69 lakh crore and Rs. 1.32 lakh crore in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively. While the surge in fresh projects investments was spread across all major sectors, the growth registered in the manufacturing sector was very interesting, the firm noted in its quarterly project monitoring report. Fresh manufacturing investments rose 31.3% from the previous quarter and were even 19.8% higher than the second quarter of 2019-20.  “In all, 315 new projects worth Rs. 35,195.68 crore were announced in Q2, of which about 96% came from private promoters,” the report noted. A solar cells and modules project of Vikram Solar in Tamil Nadu worth Rs. 5,423 crore was the largest private manufacturing investment announced, followed by Edison Motors electric vehicles project in Uttar Pradesh worth Rs. 5,000 crore. As many as 98 new pharma and drug projects were announced, most of which were to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, or APIs, currently imported from China. Jubilant Generics’ Rs. 864 project to make APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates in Karnataka was the largest pharma bet in the quarter. Infrastructure continued to account for half of all fresh projects in the second quarter, rising from 1,085 projects worth Rs. 58,583 crore in Q1 to 1,751 projects worth almost Rs. 1.16 lakh crore. Real estate and construction, one of the largest job creators in recent years, also saw a recovery of sorts with new project announcements reverting to virtually the same levels as a year ago. “Although the staggered unlocking of the economy in Q2/FY21 did not lead to increase in the pace of project execution due to labour and liquidity issues, the announcement of new projects gained momentum,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/q2-records-107-surge-in-fresh-investments/article32808495.ece

09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Teesta backs collective action against ‘Hindutva fascism’||Renowned human rights activist Teesta Setalvad emphasised the need for collective action against Hindutva fascism by building inter-sectional alliances across various oppressed groups and individuals. Delivering the 11th Balagopal Memorial Lecture online on the topic ‘State of our Republic’, Ms. Setalvad advocated taking a leaf out of the country’s history of Shramanic fight against Brahminism, in order to forge alliances and understanding among various groups to fight what she termed as the ‘proto fascist’ state. Constitutional values such as equality, right to freedom and right to life are not foreign concepts as denounced by the right wing, but are embedded in the soil of the South Asian sub-continent. Invoking Buddha, Mahavir, Charvakas, Lokayat tradition, dissenters such as Basavanna, Narayan guru, Periyar, and Sufi and Bhakti traditions, Ms. Setalvad said questioning, resistance, and organising have always been part of the Indian tradition. “We need to really spend some time in building these deeper understandings and translating these deeper understandings into collective action, long term collective action, where hate propaganda needs to be dispelled within the family, within the mohalla, within the society, within caste, within unions, within farmers’ organisations, within women’s organisations, everywhere,” she said. Observing that the Indian Constitution and constitutional values are being hollowed out every day and that the attack is on multiple fronts, Ms. Setalvad cited several instances such as the verdict on Babri Masjid demolition, gang rape of a Dalit girl in Hathras, and the state’s response to it in denying her dignified last rites, spree of arrests of activists and students, abrogation of Article 370, passing of CAA in Parliament, attempts to force NRC on people, and orchestration of Delhi riots. Application of discriminatory governance and law stemmed from a ‘proto fascist’ ideology espoused by the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha, which drew not from more eclectic and inclusive Hinduism, but from the most rigid form of Hindutva advocated by the likes of V.D. Savarkar, who in turn were inspired by Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany. This ideology seeks to convert the Indian Constitutional Republic into an autocratic, discriminatory, theocratic state, by vitiating law and its institutional structures. Citing passage of money bills, farmers’ bills, labour laws, and environmental laws, she alleged that Parliament is being used to demolish the Constitutional morality and law, thereby thwarting people’s will. Criminal law is being invoked against Muslims, Christians, communists — all-encompassing term for dissenters — who speak against the Prime Minister or Home Minister or Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister. This has never happened in India, she said. Electronic media is acting as genocide-enabler by becoming the vehicle for targeting specific groups, she said, terming it a Goebbelsian phenomenon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/teesta-backs-collective-action-against-hindutva-fascism/article32809228.ece

09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Heart, kidney and liver transplants under Aarogyasri||The Cabinet sub-committee constituted for suggesting steps to improve health and medical infrastructure has recommended inclusion of heart, kidney and liver transplantations under Aarogyasri programme. The cabinet sub-committee which met under the chairmanship of Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Thursday resolved to submit a detailed report incorporating inclusion of transplantations under the Aarogyasri programme. The report will be submitted to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao soon. The Cabinet sub-committee discussed health infrastructure related issues in detail during the meeting. Briefing reporters later, Mr. Rajender said the transplantation operations were presently being conducted at NIMS, Osmania and Gandhi hospitals. The cabinet sub-committee wanted these procedures to be extended to all teaching hospitals. Patients particularly those from lower and middle classes were forced to spend Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 lakh on these transplantations and this was proving to be a huge burden on their finances. Inclusion of these procedures under Aarogyasri would ensure that the poor could opt for these surgeries without the feat of incurring huge expenditure. The government was prepared to amend the legislation governing the issue if need be. Members of the sub-committee - Ministers K. Taraka Rama Rao, E. Dayakar Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav - senior health department officials participated in the meeting which also made several other recommendations. The Minister said the health sector saw several changes since the formation of separate Telangana and these resulted in significant reduction in infant and maternal mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate dropped from 92 to 63 and infant mortality rate from 39 to 26. The State was ranked third next only to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in terms of providing effective medical services to people. The Cabinet panel discussed measures to strengthen the services further. Accordingly, steps would be taken to strengthen primary healthcare centres while all hospitals would be equipped with CT Scan, MRI, X-ray and other facilities. Steps were also under way to strengthen the infrastructure at MNJ Cancer hospital. Mr. Rajender said the basti dawakhanas were functioning satisfactorily and steps had been initiated to enhance their number to 300 in the coming days. There were 198 basti dawakhanas functioning to full potential while another 26 would be opened before this month-end. People were satisfied with the functioning of these units and it was therefore decided to enhance their number to cater to the needs.  Transplantations presently being conducted at NIMS, Osmania and Gandhi hospitals.

At present, the civic body conducts over 500 camps day till the afternoon. Principal Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, participating in a health camp at NSK Nagar in Anna Nagar, said as positivity rates were high in some zones, more fever camps would be held to bring down the percentage of COVID-19 cases. He said health camps would be held near offices from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and in residential areas between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Second sero-survey Mr. Radhakrishnan said a second sero-survey had been proposed by the civic body in low-income areas, selecting random streets to ascertain the immunity level of persons who were previously affected by COVID-19. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash pointed out that organising such fever camps helped identify symptomatic patients early. He said the fever camps would be held intensively for another three to four months, and advised residents not to let their guard down. People must wear masks and adhere to safety protocols in work spaces, he said. Mr. Prakash said based on the directions of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the testing rate was trebled from the second week of June, with over 16 lakh people tested. He said Chennai was the first city in the country to test 20% of its total population. He was confident that if this testing rate continued, the positivity rate could be brought down to 5%. He pointed out that due to intensive fever camps and strict quarantine rules, the doubling time of cases was 93 days though the Indian Council of Medical Research had set the doubling standard at 14 days. According to figures, 56,904 fever clinics were conducted from May 5 (when the first fever camp was organised) until Wednesday. A total of 28.93 lakh people attended the clinics with 1.68 lakh symptomatic patients identified. The Thiru Vi Ka Nagar zone saw the highest number of participants in 5,356 camps with 3,23,970, while Teynampet, by holding close to 6,000 camps, saw a participation of 3,12,435. The total cases detected stood at 26,034 (16%) out of the 1,66,253 influenza-like illness cases. A senior official of the Health Department said though the average number of persons attending the camps now stands at 51, during the lockdown period, the footfalls were in the range of 70 to 80 per camp. He said the reopening of offices and commercial establishments had resulted in a dip in numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-will-hold-additional-fever-camps-every-evening/article32809162.ece

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha also directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to file a similar affidavit by November 5 since public interest litigation petitioner M. Muruganantham told the court that not less than 20,000 people were homeless and destitutes in the Chennai city limits alone. The judges wanted to know the methodology adopted by the government as well as the civic bodies for identifying the homeless people, the availability of temporary shelters to house them during rainy and winter season and the amount of funds that had been allocated for it. The interim order was passed on the PIL petition that had been pending in the court since 2018. The litigant had claimed that the concept of temporary shelters for the homeless was completely absent in the State forcing those people to brave cold and rains. It was also brought to the notice of the Bench that the Supreme Court had taken up a similar case in 2016 and constituted a committee headed by retired Delhi High Court judge Kailash Gambhir to verify whether the urban homeless had been provided with shelters. The committee had also been ordered to inquire into the slow progress in establishing such shelters under the National Urban Livelihoods Missions and the possibility of non-utilisation, diversion or misappropriation of funds allotted to the State governments, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-report-on-steps-taken-to-identify-homeless-destitutes/article32808629.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Admission of 65 doctors in PG degree, diploma courses illegal’||It is high time that courts stopped showing misplaced sympathy for ineligible candidates admitted to medical courses, the Madras High Court said on Wednesday while declaring as invalid the admission of 65 doctors in various postgraduate degree and diploma courses in May 2017. These candidates had now almost completed the courses and even written their final examinations on the basis of interim orders passed by the court. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said a stern message must be sent to medical institutions which admit ineligible students through dubious methods, year after year, by taking advantage of the delay in the commencement of the counselling process and the deadline fixed by the Supreme Court for completing admissions. “Every year, this court is able to see that there is a huge delay even to start the first round of counselling... It is not known as to whether such a confusion is created for any valid reasons or it is intentionally done to help the self-financing institutions to take advantage of the last minute chaos and admit candidates on their own,” the judge said. Colleges asked to pay He also imposed a total cost of Rs. 30 lakh on Arupadai Veedu Medical College, Vinayaka Mission Medical College, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Manakula Vinayakar Medical College and Hospital, Venkateswara Medical College and Hospital, and Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, all in Puducherry, for having admitted the 65 doctors in the PG courses in violation of the norms. The Medical Council of India (MCI) itself had directed the six institutions to discharge all 65 candidates. However, they had approached the High Court and obtained an interim stay of the discharge orders in 2018. While granting the stay, the court had obtained an undertaking from the students that they would not claim any equity if the writ petitions were taken up for final disposal after they complete their studies. “Therefore, even though the dismissal of these writ petitions is going to cause great damage to their careers, it is something which is not totally unexpected,” the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/admission-of-65-doctors-in-pg-degree-diploma-courses-illegal/article32808688.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bank executive held for identity theft, novel fraud||An engineering graduate, employed in the credit card division of a leading private bank in Chennai, has been arrested by the Ambattur cyber crime cell for committing financial fraud. The 28-year-old accused, Karthikeyan, working as a customer executive at the bank’s branch in Vadapalani, had meticulously planned and transferred Rs. 10.36 lakh from a man’s credit card to a bank account opened in the name of another person. Explaining the modus operandi, Deepa Sathyan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ambattur, said Karthikeyan used a mobile he found on the road to open a current account in the name of one Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Medavakkam, in a small bank in Valasaravakkam, showing Mr. Kumar as a proprietor of a firm and also obtained a merchant point of sale (POS) machine. “Citing the lockdown, he convinced Mr. Kumar to complete the KYC verification via video call without raising suspicion,” she said. Later, he contacted Iruthayaraj, a nursing assistant in Mangadu and a credit card customer at his workplace, and misled him into applying for a credit card. Karthikeyan then obtained the relevant details to use the credit card and used the POS machine, obtained in Mr. Kumar’s name, to charge Rs. 10.36 lakh. When Mr. Iruthayaraj received the credit card bill for the transaction, he approached the bank and learnt that he had been cheated. He then lodged a complaint with the police. The police traced the transaction to Mr. Kumar. When he denied any wrongdoing, the police traced the phone number registered with the bank and found that it belonged to a woman, who had lost her phone eight months ago. They later found that the accused had used the same number to contact Mr. Iruthayaraj. “We examined the CCTV camera footage at the bank in Valasaravakkam. After nearly a month-long watch, we traced the vehicle used by the accused to visit the bank and tracked down Karthikeyan,” Ms. Deepa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bank-executive-held-for-identity-theft-novel-fraud/article32809164.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro’s weekday traffic up||A month after resuming services, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has pulled in office-goers on Anna Salai. There is a two-fold increase in the number of passengers travelling on weekdays. From 12,000 a day, the number has increased to nearly 25,000. Yet, this constitutes just 20% of the pre-COVID-19 traffic when 1.15 lakh passengers used the services every day. The airport, High Court and Meenambakkam stations receive the maximum number of passengers. Nearly 2,000 passengers use the airport station, and the High Court and Meenambakkam stations handle nearly 1,800 and 1,600 passengers respectively. Earlier, the stretch from Chennai Central to St. Thomas Mount would have more passengers than the Washermanpet-airport section. But the Washermanpet-airport stretch carries a majority of passengers now, sources said. According to CMRL officials, since most of the government employees have returned to offices, they travel through the stations on Anna Salai. Hence, the stretch from Washermanpet to the airport through Anna Salai now carries more traffic. “Take for instance, AG-DMS, LIC, Government Estate or Madras High Court, there is a gradual increase in the number of people using these stations. As air traffic has improved, we are seeing a mild increase in the number of users at the Airport Metro station. But since the airport’s parking fee is very high, many coming from southern suburbs such asTambaram or Pallavaram head to the Meenambakkam station, leave the two-wheelers there and travel,” an official said. No IT travellers With no IT travellers, the stretch between Chennai Central and St. Thomas Mount suffers from poor patronage, officials said. Data show that a maximum of nearly 6,300 passengers travel between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and another 6,300 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. These two hours in the morning and in the evening account for nearly 25% each of the total ridership. “Since we don’t have many taking early morning or late night trains or buses, there are only 200-220 commuters from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., only 100-150 passengers travel. Only by mid or late next year, we may see the pre-COVID-19 levels of traffic,” a source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metros-weekday-traffic-sees-an-increase/article32809167.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Children take to music, dance and art online||Theatre sessions through an app? Or how about meeting for an online book club session? With children having settled into an online class routine through their schools over the last few months, extracurricular activities aren’t far behind. When the lockdown to curb COVID-19 started in March, Crea-Shakti was working with children for theatre in around 70 schools across south India, says founder and chief mentor Dushyanth Gunashekar. “This number almost instantaneously reduced as schools themselves were grappling with how to begin classes online. For the last two years, we had been working on our drama-based learning app, Crea Play, which then began to evolve from being an app focussed on content for multidisciplinary learners,” he said. Crea Play now has daily live classes, which use theatre to improve creativity, communication, writing and acting. Mr. Gunasekar says around 4,000 students have signed up. For teachers, taking art classes online has meant they have had to take another look at their curriculum to tailor it to the virtual medium and schedule classes in such a way that students don’t feel burdened. “Several children have online classes at school throughout the week and it became important for me to ensure that they don’t feel overworked when they attend my piano class,” says Shameer Mohamed, a piano instructor from the city. Tvarita, a city-based performing arts centre, has seen more parents sign their children up for dance classes during the last six months, which the organisation has been conducting online. “Parents are trying to keep kids at home engaged and online dance classes are perfect for that,” say Tvarita co-founders T.M. Sridevi and Deepthi Ravichandran. For schools that have a full calendar during a regular academic year with regard to extracurricular activities, the focus is not just on hosting these classes online but also on events to encourage more participation. Students from SEED Academy had their first virtual book club session a week ago. “We’ve had sessions in the past and decided to take them online for children above the age of 8. The kids were thrilled to have an opportunity to read and discuss a book,” says Vani Sastri, co-founder and managing director.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/children-take-to-music-dance-and-art-online/article32809382.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Have you stopped insisting on e-pass, HC asks govt.||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to clarify by Friday as to whether the requirement of people having to obtain e-passes for both intra-State and inter-State travel, to contain the spread of COVID-19, had been given up or not. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed State government pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to obtain instructions from the authorities concerned and inform the court since there was no clarity on the issue so far. The direction was issued during the hearing of a writ petition, filed last month, challenging the State government’s August 31 lockdown extension order, which stated that the insistence on obtaining e-passes for travel would continue for one more month in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner, K.R. Ezhil Nadhi, contended that such insistence on e-passes amounted to curtailing the free movement of citizens. It was also argued that the State government had no authority to do so, since the Union Home Ministry had permitted travel without e-passes. Lockdown extension When the case was listed again on Thursday, the petitioner’s counsel told the court that the State government had issued yet another order on September 30, extending the limited lockdown by one more month. However, this order had no mention of e-passes. Therefore, nothing much would survive for adjudication in the writ petition, if the State government informs the court that it had stopped insisting upon e-passes for travel, he said. The SGP, on the other hand, urged the court to grant him some time to obtain instructions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/have-you-stopped-insisting-on-e-pass-hc-asks-govt/article32808623.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fee for students at TNAU affiliated colleges fixed at Rs. 50,000 per annum||The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday fixed Rs. 50,000 per annum as the overall fee for students (both for those admitted through counselling and through management quota) in colleges affiliated to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), accepting the recommendations made by retired High Court judge K. Chandru in this regard. This is also the first time that students admitted through counselling (government quota) and management quota have to pay the same amount of fee. No difference “The Supreme Court has said there should not be any difference between students admitted through counselling and those admitted through management quota,” Justice K. Chandru told  The Hindu  . The committee, after taking into account the overall circumstances, has also observed that any kind of fee under different heads such as special fee, library fee, laboratory fee, audio-visual education fee, games fee, computer fee, National Cadet Corps/National Service Scheme (NCC/NSS) fee, sports fee, guest lectures fee, cultural event fee, placement and competitive fee that was being collected, “is prohibited”. The overall fee of Rs. 50,000 per annum for two semesters would be allowed to be paid either completely for the year or in two instalments — one payment for each semester, the State government said in a G.O. issued Thursday. The private colleges affiliated to the TNAU shall be allowed to collect a one-time fee of Rs. 5,000 towards caution deposit apart from the fee fixed per annum, which should be refunded at the time when the student leaves the institution. “It is made clear that other than the fee and the caution deposit, no other fee of any kind shall be collected,” the G.O. issued by Agriculture Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi stated. In line with the retired judge Chandru’s recommendations, the State government has decided to consult the TNAU Registrar on other allied matters, including hostel and mess fee. It would also examine the committee’s recommendation in regard to payment of the fee for 2020-21 academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fee-for-students-at-tnau-affiliated-colleges-fixed-at-rs-50000-per-annum/article32808627.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Murals liven up Ennore school||Children studying in the Chennai Corporation Primary School in Annai Sivagami Nagar, Ennore, have an artistic school building to come back to when the State government decides to reopen schools. While they were deciding on carrying out regular maintenance and painting work for the school building, headmistress T. Vetriselvi said S. Vasugi, a teacher in the school, came up with an idea. “For a while, she has been telling us we could paint the walls of the school building in a unique way which was when the suggestion of painting it like a train came up,” Ms. Vetriselvi said. The headmistress said they decided to go with the design of a Metro Rail coach. “Children love travelling by train and even as adults, we often end up making friends on these journeys. It evokes pleasant memories and when children come back to the school after the pandemic, we want them to be happy and excited,” she said. The facade of the school has been painted like a Metro train and a compound wall near the building has been painted to look like a station, with people walking on the platform. The mural has been done in such a way that the school doors are the doors for the train coach. Sathya, one of the painters involved in the project, said they were happy to transform the school for the children. Apart from the building facade, classrooms walls have also been painted with cartoon characters as well as educational content such as the solar system, English words for better communication, alphabets and numbers for the younger children. The school has a student strength of around 300, from Classes LKG to V.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murals-liven-up-school-in-ennore/article32809170.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After 40 days, 99-year-old awaits her return home||“I have been on room air for three days. Can I go home?” Jeyalakshmi asks her doctors at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). After spending 40 days in the hospital, including a number of days in the intensive care unit, the 99-year-old, who is on the road to recovery from COVID-19, is eagerly waiting to return home. “It was surprising that she knew so much about the discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients — managing on room air for three days. A crucial factor that paved the way for her recovery was that she came to the hospital at the right time. She had mild symptoms and was admitted to the hospital on August 29. But three days later, the infection started to progress. But she was already under medical supervision,” said E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH. Admitted with complaints of fever, nausea and abdominal pain, the nonagenarian’s first chest X-ray showed no findings, though she had tested positive for COVID-19. However, she went on to develop respiratory distress. “Her condition started to worsen. All inflammatory markers were elevated, and we started the required line of management. She required oxygen support, but was not maintaining saturation on a non-rebreathing mask (NRM) and high-flow nasal cannula. In high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), we can provide up to 70 litres of oxygen, but she was unable to withstand it. We then moved to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (C-PAP) therapy and she was on the C-PAP machine for five days,” he said. A repeat X-ray showed bilateral extensive lung involvement. She was treated with remdesivir, steroids and vitamin supplements. She started showing signs of stablisation, after which she was sequentially weaned to HFNO and NRM. “Now, we are providing intermittent oxygen supply, especially at night. She is stable,” Dr. Theranirajan added. On Thursday, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, who was on a visit to RGGGH, met Ms. Jeyalakshmi. She will be discharged in a few days, doctors said. Officials said that so far, 21 persons aged over 90 had been discharged from RGGGH, after treatment for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-40-days-99-year-old-awaits-her-return-home/article32808616.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Leaders condole Paswan’s death||Leaders of political parties in Tamil Nadu on Thursday expressed condolences on the passing of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Expressing shock over the death of Lok Janshakti Party leader, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said, “My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.” DMK president M.K. Stalin said, “Heartfelt condolences to Chirag Paswan and his family on the demise of Thiru Ram Vilas Paswan, Founder of @LJP4India and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. Indian politics has lost a dynamic leader today.” MDMK founder Vaiko said that Mr. Paswan cared about Sri Lankan Tamils. “He sought justice for them in Parliament and said that a separate Tamil Eelam is the solution. He lived his life for the oppressed,” he said. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said, “Mr. Paswan fought for the rights of Dalits and his untimely death has come at a time when his party is getting ready to contest the Bihar Assembly election alone. It is a big loss.” PMK founder S. Ramadoss said Mr. Paswan was one of his closest friends among politicians active in national politics. “He has participated in several events organised by the Pattali Makkal Katchi in Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, including an event in 1992 for Tamil Rights Conference.” “Deeply saddened to hear about the demise of Lok Janshakti Party President and Hon'ble Union Minister #Ram Vilas Paswan. A veteran leader, he will be remembered for his work to emancipate Dalits and the downtrodden. My heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family,” tweeted VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan. Puthiya Tamilagam founder Krishnasamy said he was saddened to know about the death of his friend, Mr. Paswan, who has been the voice of the original inhabitants of India in Parliament. “He has been an important part of Indian politics for over 50 years.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leaders-condole-paswans-death/article32809174.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Upbeat AIADMK launches poster campaign for its CM candidate||A day after the AIADMK announced Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its electoral face for the 2021 Assembly polls, party functionaries were upbeat and put up posters pitting Mr. Palaniswami against DMK president M.K. Stalin, in various places, though elections are months away. In fact, the AIADMK’s IT wing launched its social media campaign for Mr. Palaniswami on Wednesday itself, extolling his political “achievements”. One such poster asked “ seyal nayagana , arikai nayagana ” alluding to Mr. Palaniswami as a “performer” and Mr. Stalin as one who “issues only statements”. “Earlier, there was no necessity for both the AIADMK and the DMK to name a Chief Minister candidate. But now, there is such a necessity, and with the official announcement coming from our party coordinator, what else do we need? It is natural for us to work for the victory of our party,” said AIADMK spokesperson R.M. Babu Murugavel on the publicity work. But isn’t it too early for a poster war? “Seven months will just fly by. A winning party will always work and not wait for an election, to wake up at the eleventh hour. Moreover, our government has done so much for the people and we have content for posters. If the DMK president speaks at two public meetings, we will have content for the campaign for two years,” said Mr. Murugavel, who is also the joint secretary of the party’s legal wing. Ready for battle According to him, the party is poll ready. “Only today, our district secretaries obtained approval from District Collectors for our booth-level agents. We are all ready,” he said. The DMK, however, appears to be waiting. DMK spokesperson J. Constantine Ravindran said his party was not bothered by the AIADMK naming its Chief Ministerial candidate. “How does it matter who is the captain of the ill-fatedTitanic, which is set to sink?” he asked cryptically. He felt the posters were only meant to project Mr. Palaniswami as the AIADMK candidate to the general public. Mr. Ravindran recalled that when AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran was the Chief Minister, a member of his Cabinet had said that only MGR was “number one” and others were “zeroes”. The Ministers behaved similarly when Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister. “Now, these zeroes have decided to become number one. That is how we see the developments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upbeat-aiadmk-launches-poster-campaign-for-its-cm-candidate/article32808619.ece

The Economic Offences Wing had registered a case against DHFL and 11 others on the direction of the Madras High Court for allegedly defrauding money from investors by floating bogus schemes and for non-refund of deposits totalling Rs. 218 crore. Those who invested in DHFL schemes have been advised to lodge complaints with the Economic Offences Wing. Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were produced before the Special Court under the TNPID Act in Chennai on Wednesday. The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate had arrested the Wadhawans, who were accused of money laundering in the Yes Bank scam. Between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs. 3,700 crore in short-term debentures in DHFL. In return, the Wadhawans allegedly paid kickbacks of Rs. 600 crore to the former Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor and his family members, seeking to pass them off as loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-arrest-promoters-of-dhfl/article32809171.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco drops order mandating completion certificate for buildings||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has told its field officers to effect new service connection without insisting on completion certificates for certain types of buildings. An earlier instruction issued on May 14, 2020, by the State utility said that except for residential buildings up to 12 metres in height and not exceeding three dwelling units, or 750 square metres, and all types of industrial buildings, all other building owners in the State must submit completion certificates to get electricity supply. This meant even a small commercial consumer with a 100 square feet shop cannot obtain a service connection without producing a completion certificate. The May 14 instruction had cited the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. Similarly, an instruction issued on June 4 cited a Madras High Court order on the issue. An memo issued on October 6, 2020, by Tangedco’s Director (Distribution) instructed its field officials to follow the procedure for effecting service connections that prevailed before the issue of the instructions dated June 4 and May 14, which mandated producing completion certificates by small commercial and other consumers in the State. Moving back to the old procedure would help new consumers get power supply without submitting a completion certificate. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, has written to the Tangedco chairman on the new instruction, alleging that it may be in contrary to the orders of the High Court. “We strongly oppose and condemn the action of the Tangedco for unilaterally taking such decisions,” he said. P. Muthusamy, former Director (Engineering), Tamil Nadu, pointed out that the shortcomings in the order has led to difficulties for small consumers, which forced Tangedco to withdraw its earlier instructions. “As per the government order, a small petty shop, tea shop or grocery shop owner should produce a completion certificate to get electricity supply, whereas the owner of a big, three floor, 7,500 square feet, residential building need not produce a completion certificate,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-drops-order-mandating-completion-certificate-for-buildings/article32808689.ece

Rajkumar, the founder of Sujatha Biotech and the man behind several brands including Velvette Shampoo and Nivaran 90, died in a private hospital in Chennai on Wednesday. He was 67. He is survived by his wife, son and two daughters. A qualified doctor, he was widely known for his sachet concept, which gave an affordable option to middle income families. He was called the ‘sachet pioneer’. “Our father (Mr. Chinnikrishnan) was doing this shampoo business and was into packaging goods. But it was Rajkumar who made the sachet popular in the market,” said, C.K. Kumaravel, CEO and co-founder of Naturals Salon and Spa and brother of Rajkumar. He is also the brother of C.K. Ranganathan, chairman and managing director, CavinKare Pvt. Ltd. “In the early 1980s, Velvette had a marketing tie-up with Voltas. In the late 1980s, Rajkumar took a bold decision and met Adi Godrej of the Godrej Group. That was the defining moment of the sachet revolution,” Mr. Kumaravel said. Mr. Godrej immediately took up marketing and distribution of Velvette shampoo and the regional brand went national. After Velvette, Rajkumar moved on to Nivaran 90, a cough syrup sold in sachets, and Memory Plus, a memory enhancing herbal pill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/entrepreneur-ck-rajkumar-dead-at-67/article32809156.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Central, Tiruchi among stations yet to comply with green norms||The Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway station and Tiruchi junction are among dozens of major railway stations across the country that are yet to comply with the green norms stipulated under various statutory rules of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). A joint inspection by CPCB and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials at the Central and Tiruchi railway stations in the Southern Railway, recently, revealed that both the stations had not got the necessary approvals under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Air Pollution) Act, 1981, and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. With the National Green Tribunal directing the authorities concerned to ensure that the green norms are complied with, in a stipulated timeframe, the Ministry of Railways has written to general managers of all zonal railways to take immediate steps to comply with the CPCB guidelines, as regards environment management, particularly waste water and solid waste management. The officials were told to obtain statutory approvals to meet safe environment standards from the competent authority. The Central railway station, with a footfall of 1,57,074 a day and 54 originating/passing-through trains, had not obtained the consent of pollution control authorities, under the Water Act and the Air Act, authorisation for a solid waste processing facility, and plastic waste, e-waste and battery-waste disposal. Inspecting officials recommended that a waste-to-energy plant be installed, and till then, suggested the provision of any treatment facility to manage wet waste and stop disposing it to the Chennai Corporation. Noise level checks were carried out at four locations, and the findings were found to be higher. In Tiruchi too, the report said consent from pollution control authorities was not obtained. Among the recommendations for Tiruchi were installation of a waste-to-energy plant. Southern Railway spokesperson said the process of getting necessary approvals was under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-tiruchi-among-stations-yet-to-comply-with-green-norms/article32808620.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Admission in PG diploma course in archaeology: CM writes to PM||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to amend its guidelines to include the postgraduate degree in Tamil language as one of the minimum qualifications for admission to PG diploma in archaeology in Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology. In his letter, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr. Palaniswami referred to an advertisement for admission to the PG diploma course in archaeology for 2020-2022 at the institute and pointed out: “There are about 48,000 inscriptions in all the languages that have been published so far by various agencies in India, including the Archaeological Survey of India, of which more than 28,000 inscriptions (which is over half) are in Tamil language alone.” While it was a laudable initiative to create a suitable talent pool in a consistent manner that will unravel the country’s glorious past in a professional way, some of the guidelines served as “entry barriers for the aspirants across the country especially for people from Tamil Nadu”, he contended. The minimum qualification criteria prescribed was a Master’s degree in, among other relevant subjects, Indian classical languages such as Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Arabic or Persian, he said. “Unfortunately, among the listed languages, only Sanskrit has been declared as a classical language in 2005. Furthermore, Tamil, which was the first language in India officially recognised as a classical language in 2004, has been completely ignored,” he underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/archaeology-admission-cm-writes-to-pm/article32808624.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNCC plans rally against Farm Acts on Oct. 11||The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee will hold a massive rally against the three Farm legislations in Tiruvannamalai on October 11 in which former Union Minister P. Chidambaram and top leaders of the TNCC will participate. The party will also release a booklet on why the Congress is opposing these Farm legislations. Why the hurry? “When farmers organisations or opposition parties had not put forth any representations [for such legislations], what was the Central government’s hurry to pass the three Bills in Parliament without consulting the State governments? For whose benefit were these passed? The BJP does not have any answer to these questions. These three legislations are integrated with one another and will destroy the livelihood of farmers,” TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said in a statement on Thursday. Mr. Alagiri said in the past six years, contrary to the BJP’s 2014 election manifesto promise of ensuring 50% higher prices for produce above MSP and doubling farmers’ income by 2022, farmers have been getting less than MSP and have been incurring losses, increasing their debt burden. The three legislations encourage private enterprises in agriculture, and farmers will lose out by not even getting the Minimum Support Price, he said terming it as a big betrayal by the Modi government to the farmers in the country. Mr. Alagiri said the Congress was protesting across the country to protect farmers and will hold a rally on October 11 in Tiruvannamalai against the legislations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tncc-to-hold-rally-against-farm-acts-on-october-11/article32808626.ece

Palaniswami, urging him to hold the Centre accountable for the non-payment of GST compensation to the States. Mr. Stalin thanked the Chief Minister on behalf of the people of the State for declining to accept both borrowing options proposed by the Union government at the GST Council meeting held on October 5. Appreciating the Chief Minister for upholding federalism, Mr. Stalin said the Centre had a moral and legal obligation to pay compensation to the States and its proposal that the States borrow to meet their revenue shortfall was a travesty of the rights of the States and justice. CAG report “Further, the CAG Report for the fiscal year 2018-19 shows the Union government had illegitimately transferred Rs. 47,272 crore from the GST compensation fund to the Consolidated Fund of India during 2017-18 and 2018-19. The possibility of such illegitimate transfers for the past fiscal year [2019-20] remains,” he said. ‘Wrongful actions’ Mr. Stalin said that according to the CAG report, the Centre admitted to such wrongful actions and promised to correct them by depositing the money back into the GST compensation fund from the Consolidated Fund. “In light of these facts, I urge you to ensure that the Union government will stick to its commitment to the CAG and initiate compensation payments to the States. He also accused the Tamil Nadu government of betraying the people on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hold-centre-accountable-for-non-payment-of-gst-compensation-stalin/article32808631.ece

But there is no cause for celebration. We are saddened by his death. He did not resurface after getting into the water to anchor the boat against cyclonic winds. He has two school-going children, and their education and future must be taken care of by the government,” said K. Raghu, the boat driver. The fishermen, who arrived from Delhi after COVID-19 tests, said they thought they could return by sea, which was why they wanted to ensure the safety of the craft. “But despite our best efforts, it sank. The boat-owner, too, has lost over Rs. 70 lakh... The government should consider some kind of relief for him too,” he added. Recalling the ordeal, the men said they had turned off the engines after casting the net, as was their practice. But when they tried starting it the next morning, it did not work. The battery ran down while they tried to repair the craft after which communication devices, too, stopped working. “The rations lasted till the 28th day after which we caught some fish now and then and ate them boiled. Then, on some days, it was just plain water,” said V. Parthiban, another fisherman. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said the State had taken steps to search for the men when they went missing. It had also coordinated with the Centre and the Myanmar government to bring them back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kasimedu-fishermen-return-home-seek-compensation-for-dead-colleague/article32809165.ece
09 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders crackdown on packaged water units||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to crack down on all illegal packaged drinking water units across the State. It wanted criminal cases to be booked against those who were tapping groundwater and exploiting it commercially without obtaining no objection certificates (NoCs) from the officials concerned. Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh also directed the government to take a policy decision, within four weeks, on levying appropriate charges on such commercial units for the extraction of groundwater. They directed Special Government Pleader (SGP) J. Pothiraj to ascertain the government’s decision in this regard by November 19. Earlier, the Bench recorded the SGP’s statement that the survey of groundwater level across the State was being taken once in three years and that those areas were classified as safe, semi-critical, critical and over-exploited on the basis of their groundwater level. NoCs were issued on the basis of such classifications. Since the last survey was done in 2017, the government authorities had begun a resurvey this year and had already completed assessing the over-exploited areas. The resurvey of safe, semi-critical and critical areas would be completed by March 2021, and thereafter NoCs would be issued, the SGP said. The submission was made when the counsel, representing some packaged drinking water units, complained that the denial of NoCs on the basis of the 2017 survey was not right.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-crackdown-on-packaged-water-units/article32808690.ece

In its recent wind tariff order, which came into effect on October 7, with a validity till March 31, 2022, TNERC said that on account of the unprecedented situation due to the outbreak of COVID-19, where several restrictions were in place on the movement of people and opening of offices, leading to a gradual slowdown in economic activity, it had decided not to disturb the current position on banking facility. The banking facility allows captive wind power generators to sell surplus power to distribution companies. Through the facility, wind power producers feed the electricity generated by their wind mills into the State grid and draw the power for captive use within the banking period. The banking facility has remained a contentious issue for long, with the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) urging that it be withdrawn and wind energy developers wanting it to continue. TNERC said the banking period would continue for 12 months, from April 1 to March 31 of the succeeding year, for projects commissioned on or before March 31, 2018 . The applicable banking charges shall be 14% in kind. For projects commissioned on or after April 1, 2018, the facility to bank energy shall be for a period of one month, it added. TNERC has decided to retain the levy of transmission, wheeling and scheduling and system operation charges, at 50% of what is applicable for conventional power, notified from time to time, for projects commissioned under the normal category. It has also decided to retain the levy of cross subsidy surcharge, at 60% of what is applicable to conventional power. TNERC also said that procurement of wind power by Tangedco shall be through competitive bidding, following all prescribed procedures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/norms-on-banking-of-wind-energy-to-remain/article32808621.ece

Chidambaram nearing disposal||An election petition, pending in the Madras High Court for the last 11 years, challenging the victory of former Union Minister P. Chidambaram from Sivaganga parliamentary constituency in May 2009, is nearing disposal. Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana on Thursday commenced hearing final arguments on the petition. Advocates Rajendrakumar and G. Saravanakumar argued the case on behalf of the election petitioner R.S. Rajakannappan, who contested the 2009 elections as an AIADMK candidate but had recently joined the DMK. After hearing them, the judge posted the case to Monday for hearing senior counsel G. Masilamani and R. Thiagarajan for Mr. Chidambaram. The election petitioner had lost to the former Union Minister by a margin of 3,354 votes. Then, he had accused the returned candidate of manipulating the vote counting process. In his election petition, he alleged that the Returning Officer had illegally added the votes secured by him in Alangudi Assembly segment into the kitty of Mr. Chidambaram. If such illegality had not occurred, the petitioner was confident of having won the seat by a margin of 7,034 votes. He also claimed that AIADMK cadres had agitated against the illegal decision right at the counting centre but they were beaten up by the police. The election petition was also filed on the ground of bribing of voters. However, Mr Chidambaram stoutly denied all allegations levelled against him and termed them to be a figment of imagination of the petitioner. He also stood his ground during elaborate cross examination by the counsel for the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/election-petition-against-p-chidambaram-nearing-disposal/article32808684.ece
09 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Collector urges industries to follow precautions||Collector K. Rajamani has urged industries to quarantine migrant workers who are returning to work and to test those who show symptoms of COVID-19. At a meeting held on Wednesday with representatives of industrial associations, the Collector said that nearly 47,000 workers, who returned home during May-June, had come back. When the workers returned, they should be quarantined for a week to 10 days. Only those, who did not have symptoms, should be permitted to enter the factories. Even if a unit wanted to test all the workers, it should be done after four or five days of the return and not immediately. In a press release, the Collector pointed out that the industries had started working with 100 % workforce. All units should use thermal scanners to check temperature, use pulse oximeters, and maintain registers. If any worker had fever or cold, he or she should be tested immediately. The units should also have hand sanitisers at the entrance. Vehicle parking area should not be crowded and there should be separate entrance for workers and to move goods. The masks and gloves used at industries should be disposed off safely. The common bathrooms and drinking water facilities should be cleaned regularly. While the number of cases reported in industries was low in the district, all the precautions should be taken. The Collector told The Hindu officials from the Revenue, Health, Labour, and Industrial Safety departments and local bodies would visit the factories regularly to ensure that all the protocols were followed. Officials from the Industrial Safety Department visited 600 units and a few had some violations. Both, the Central and State governments, were monitoring the situation in Coimbatore district because of the presence of large number of industries. The industries had so far followed the norms. The district administration was also focusing on industrial segment to ensure the units took all steps to control the spread, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-urges-industries-to-follow-precautions/article32809185.ece
09 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘No major increase in occupancy of buses’||Over a month after the resumption of bus services by the Coimbatore Division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), there has not been any major increase in occupancy in the district amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A senior TNSTC official said on Thursday that only around 500 town and mofussil buses were operated of the 1,012 buses in the district. While the district used to see between 6.5 lakh and 8.5 lakh passengers travelling a day, the number has come down to around two lakh passengers a day, he said. “Despite operating 50% of the total fleet of buses, the earnings are not even 50% of the collections prior to the lockdown,” the official said. The TNSTC saw around Rs. 40 lakh of earnings a day for the 500 buses, while the earnings used to be around Rs. 1.5 crore a day when the total fleet of buses were operated in the district. Private bus operators also resumed their operations. The reason for the low occupancy in TNSTC buses could be the hesitation among the public to use public transport as Coimbatore district witnessed fresh COVID-19 cases at a steady pace, the official opined. With the situation less likely to improve before the upcoming festival season, the number of special buses for Ayudha Puja and Deepavali might be reduced by the TNSTC Coimbatore Division, according to him. The official noted that no relaxations had been made in the COVID-19 precautionary measures inside the TNSTC buses such as allowing passengers only if they wore masks, provision of hand sanitisers to passengers, wearing of masks and gloves by the drivers and conductors and regular disinfection of the buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-major-increase-in-occupancy-of-buses/article32809188.ece

People from the locality complain that crossing and movements of wild boars on roads here are resulting in accidents to motorists. After the issue came to its attention, the Forest Department urged the panchayat administrations to take measures to prevent littering of food, vegetable and meat wastes on the sides of roads. “Several minor accidents were reported in the past due to the movement of wild boars in the panchayats. One such accident was reported last week at Mathvarayapuram,” said a person from Mathvarayapuram. Vegetable, poultry and meat wastes attract wild boars as they are easy food. S. Vetrivel, vice-president of Mathvarayapuram village, said large numbers of wild boars lived in bushes on the sides of Masa Orambu stream at the panchayat and they also strayed into nearby farms. “Efforts will be taken to prevent dumping of waste outside the garbage bins. The location of the bins will also be changed,” he said. A senior official with the Forest Department said that a sizeable population of wild boars lived outside protected forest areas. They engaged in crop damages and scavenging garbage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wild-boars-that-scavenge-garbage-pose-threat-to-motorists/article32809184.ece
09 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||River Noyyal, its tributary polluted with heavy metals: study||River Noyyal, the lifeline of Coimbatore district, and its tributary, the Chinnar, are polluted with heavy metals, says a recent study. Samples of water, sediment and specimens of a freshwater crab species collected from the river had high presence of heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, lead and zinc, the study says. Though similar samples from the Chinnar river showed the presence of these heavy metals, the levels were, however, not as high as those found in the samples from the Noyyal. Samples of water and sediments from Noyyal were collected at Marudurai village in Tiruppur district and from Chinnar at Sadivayal village in Coimbatore district. Crabs were lifted with the help of farmers from two other locations. The study titled “Assessment of Heavy Metals Pollution in Noyyal and Chinnar Rivers, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India with Reference to Crabs ( Gecarcinucidae )-A Baseline Study”, and authored by V. Gayathri, T. Muralisankar, R. Rajaram, M. Muniasamy and P. Santhanam, was recently published in the Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology. According to the researchers, the study on the pollution in the Noyyal is essential because it is a tributary of River Cauvery, the main source of water for drinking, agricultural and farming in many districts of the State. Noyyal, which originates from the Vellingiri Hills in Coimbatore district, flows through four districts - Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode and Karur. The study found that the total hardness, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, residual (free) chlorine, dissolved oxygen, and alkalinity were significantly higher in Noyyal water when compared with the samples from the Chinnar. Further, pH, total hardness, chloride, nitrates, and alkalinity levels in the Noyyal water exceeded the permissible limits of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 2012) for drinking water. Zinc, cadmium and lead levels were found to have exceeded in the water samples of both rivers compared to the permissible limits of BIS and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA 2002), said the study. The level of lead was significantly high in the water samples of both rivers. Presence of lead found in Chinnar water beyond the permissible limits of BSI and USEPA suggests that the river water was polluted by the metal, might be due to the dumping of domestic waste and agricultural activities in the river basin. The analysis of sediment samples from both rivers found a significant increase in the level of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc in Noyyal sediments compared to sediments from its tributary. Zinc content was high in the sediments of both the rivers, the study showed. It was found that the level of bio-accumulation of the heavy metals and biochemical constituents were higher in specimens of Spiralothelphusa hydrodroma crab species collected from the Noyyal than Barytelphusa cunicularis crab species collected from Chinnar. According to the researchers, the two freshwater crabs were chosen for analysis as crustaceans-like crabs and shrimps are highly sensitive to heavy metal pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/river-noyyal-its-tributary-polluted-with-heavy-metals-study/article32808660.ece

Venkatesan, secretary of the association, said that the delay in settling dues had left hundreds of farmers in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur districts in distress. Mr. Venkatesan said that Ambika Sugar Mills at Chittoor and Thiru Arooran Sugar Mills at Thirumandakudi and Kottur were yet to settle dues to cane growers who had supplied sugar cane to the mills over the last four years. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has already initiated insolvency proceedings against the four mills based on petitions filed by banks. This has confirmed the fear of farmers that they will no longer get the pending dues, he said. Status of growers The Association also demanded that an amendment be made in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to change the status of cane growers from operational creditors to priority creditors. The Tamil Nadu Government has already sent a proposal in favour of the amendment to the Centre. The Union Government has the responsibility to protect the welfare of farmers. Hence, it should immediately intervene and ensure settlement of pending dues to farmers, Mr. Venkatesan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cane-growers-demand-settlement-of-dues/article32808686.ece
09 October 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Kisan scheme scam: call for stern action||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has urged the government to take stern action against officials in the Agriculture Department in the State who had allegedly siphoned off crores of rupees from the PM-KISAN scheme. The scam rocked the State government recently after it came to light that money under the scheme was credited into the account of fictitious farmers.   CB-CID probe The government ordered a CB-CID probe and is in the process of recovering the funds as genuine farmers have not received the PM-KISAN assistance. Under the scheme, the Union government had proposed to give Rs. 6,000 to eligible farmers as an assistance and had directed the Agriculture department in the respective States to credit the sum in the beneficiaries account directly. Finding loopholes in the system, officials across the State had siphoned off the money. 5,000 fake In Dindigul district, out of 11,000 beneficiaries, 5,000 were not genuine farmers. So far Rs. 1.76 crore had been recovered and Rs. 24.32 lakh would be collected soon, officials have said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kisan-scheme-scam-call-for-stern-action/article32808632.ece

So, the officials said that they sought people’s cooperation to achieve the goal. The fine was imposed after there were complaints that many people shopping in NGO Colony and other pockets were not wearing masks.

Members said that currently works under the scheme were executed only in village panchayats from 2006 and not in municipalities and town panchayats. They said that the Central government had proposed to extend the scheme to town panchayats and urban areas across the country which will ensure regular income to the farming community. Currently, about 25 lakh farmers are residing in 526 town panchayats and they wanted the scheme to be implemented in their town panchayat also. They said that regular works under the scheme will ensure regular income for the workers who are without regular income in all these years. They wanted the Central government to implement the scheme at the earliest. Later, they submitted a petition to an official at the panchayat office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-extend-mgnregs-works-to-town-panchayats/article32808679.ece

09 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Empty rooms stare hotel owners in the face||Relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown norms notwithstanding, the occupancy rate in most of the hotels in Madurai is only around 20%. The large number of unsold rooms is causing consternation among the hoteliers who have borrowed heavily to keep their establishments running. Madurai Hotel and Lodge Owners Association president K.P. Navaneetha Krishnan says the occupancy ratio at most hotels and lodges, irrespective of their size, is only around 15% to 20%. “Though some hotels have reduced their room tariff by half, the customer footfall has hardly increased,” he says. S. Senthil Nathan, Director (Operations), Hotel Germanus, says many of the business conferences and meetings that used to regularly take place at the hotels, are now being conducted as webinars due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Many businesses have not shown interest in booking halls or rooms for the next few months,” he says. Currently, only those who travel by their own vehicles from other places stay at hotels and lodges, and only when it’s absolutely necessary, says Mr. Krishnan. “The tourist inflow has also not picked up as people are scared about their safety in these COVID-19 times. Many customers keep enquiring about the safety precautions that we follow in hotels,” he says. Wallets gone light Since the pandemic has also financially affected people from all walks of life, they have very little disposable income. So, spending their leisure time at hotels will be their last priority,” says Mr. Senthil Nathan. The income is meagre, but the hotels and lodges have electricity bills and other bills to pay, and salary for their staff. “Regular disinfection of the hotel and taking up other safety precautions due to the pandemic has added to the expenditure,” he says. The lower footfall has financially affected all hotels and lodges, says A. Ramasubbu, proprietor of Sai Ram Residency. “Those who have borrowed heavily from banks are suffering the most as they find it hard to repay the installments,” he says. G. Vasudevan, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Travel Mart Society, and Director of Fortune Pandiyan Hotel, says usually hotels have a occupancy ratio of 70% during this period of the year. “It will take more months for businesses to return to normality. But it is important that people follow safety precautions by wearing face masks, frequently washing hands and maintaining personal distance in public places,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/empty-rooms-stare-hotel-owners-in-the-face/article32809286.ece

09 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Students asked to come to school in violation of norm’||Students Federation of India (SFI) has alleged that a private institution in Balarangapuram here had asked students to attend classes at school, in violation of the government’s directive. SFI district secretary S. Veldeva said the government first announced that students could come to school to clarify doubts on the subject, but with their parents’ consent. The decision was later cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic not subsiding. ‘Face masks not worn’ A. Bonyface, a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), said the students did not wear school uniform. They had classes for four hours and did not wear face masks inside the classroom, he said. Mr. Veldeva said action must be taken against all private institutions that ask students to come to the school during the pandemic. Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said that when he enquired with the school, they said a small number of students had come to the school to clarify doubts. “But the management asked the students to leave home by noon. There has been no official circular permitting management of schools to ask students to come to the institutions to attend classes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-asked-to-come-to-school-in-violation-of-norm/article32809288.ece
09 October 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court orders re-post mortem of Saptur youth’s body||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday ordered exhumation and re-post mortem of the body of K. Ramesh, 20, from Saptur, who died allegedly due to custodial torture. The court directed that the re-post mortem should be conducted by medical experts from Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital. The court was hearing the petition filed by Santhosh, brother of Ramesh. It is said that their elder brother Idhayakani had eloped with a relative girl, and her family filed a complaint with Saptur police. The petitioner alleged that they were subjected to torture by the police on a regular basis in the name of inquiry. The police did not even spare his mother. Their mobile phones were also seized by the police, he alleged. The petitioner said at 7 p.m. on September 16, Sub-Inspector Jeyakannan, constable Puthiaraja and two others picked up Ramesh from their house. The next day, Ramesh was found hanging from a tree in a nearby hillock, he said. The family alleged that Ramesh was tortured to death. Though it was initially assured that the post mortem would be conducted at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), Madurai, it was conducted at Usilampatti Government Hospital, he said. The petitioner’s family was called to cremate the body. Since it was an unnatural death, the body could not be kept in the house and it was buried on the same night. Having serious doubts over the conduct of the post mortem, the family wanted a re-post mortem. Justice G.R. Swaminathan took a serious view of the fact that the autopsy was not done by a regular forensic team. The allegation of custodial death was made in the very first instance. The FIR itself referred to that, the judge said. The authorities ought to have taken the body either to Government Theni Medical College or the GRH. “I fail to understand why the post mortem was done in a hurried manner at Usilampatti GH,” the judge said. Justice Swaminathan observed that what was done could not be called a forensic autopsy. The court took into account that though the post mortem was done for one hour and claimed to be videographed, only video clippings running for seven minutes were available. The judge directed that the second post mortem could be done at the burial site itself and it should be videographed. The case was adjourned till October 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-orders-re-post-mortem-of-saptur-youths-body/article32808636.ece

09 October 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Consider slain SI’s son for job on compassionate grounds, says HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to consider the representation for appointment on compassionate grounds made by V. Ashok Kumar, son of Sub-Inspector of Police R. Vetrivel, who was hacked to death in 2010 in a case of mistaken identity. Vetrivel was attacked with a bomb and hacked to death by a gang in Alwarkurichi (now in newly created Tenkasi district) over a family feud involving another SI, Sivasubramanian. The incident had sparked an outrage after it was said that two Ministers who were at the spot failed to help Vetrivel when he was bleeding profusely. However, this was denied by the Ministers. The petitioner said that following his father’s demise, his mother was appointed as an Office Assistant on compassionate grounds. However, she did not take up the job as she had to look after him and his sister, who were in Class VIII and Class IV respectively. Instead, she sent a representation asking the State to consider the petitioner for appointment once he turned major. He said that he was an engineering graduate now and made a representation in 2018 for appointment on compassionate grounds. But, there was no response from the government yet. Hearing the plea, Justice Krishnan Ramasamy directed the State to consider the representation sent by the petitioner on merits within four weeks, and disposed of the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-slain-sis-son-for-job-on-compassionate-grounds/article32808635.ece

Speaking at a webinar organised by Aravind Eye Care System on the occasion of World Sight Day here on Thursday, he said that if diabetic retinopathy was identified at a later stage, the patient might have to undergo a surgery. “So it is important that people undergo an eye check-up once a year, even if there are no symptoms,” he said.“Glaucoma, which is usually asymptomatic, is a silent stealer of vision,” said R. Ramakrishnan, Senior Medical Consultant at Aravind Eye Hospital, Tirunelveli. V. Raghuram Venkatesan of the hospital said a nutrient-rich food of vegetables and fruits was essential for the eyes. Karthik Srinivasan, Retina Consultant, said it was better to avoid using contact lenses during the pandemic, he said.

09 October 2020||Mayiladuthurai,TAMIL NADU||Commercial Tax Office Complex to function as temporary Collectorate in Mayiladuthurai||The Commercial Tax Office Complex will function as the temporary collectorate for the newly-formed Mayiladuthurai district. Proposals were sent to the office of Commissioner for Revenue Administration for formation of an additional Division with Sirkazhi as headquarters following the public hearing conducted on July 30 for demarcation of the boundaries for the new district carved out of Nagapattinam district. Mayiladuthurai district was formed with Kuthalam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi, and Tranquebar taluks. Two new taluks with Kollidam and Sembanaarkovil as headquarters are likely to be created for the new district. Nagapattinam district was left with the taluks of Kilvelur, Nagapattinam, Thirukkuvalai and Vedaranyam. At the public hearing in Nagapattinam on the same day, the participants raised demand for creation of a new division with Vedaranyam as headquarters. According to officials, there were demands for creation of more taluks in Nagapattinam district and bifurcation of villages as well in Vedaranyam block. The need for bifurcation of some of the villages as big as 15 square kilometres was felt in the aftermath of the Gaja cyclone when the administration faced tough situations in reaching out to the affected people with relief, it is learnt. The demands raised during the public hearings were under the consideration of the Commissioner of Revenue Administration. The Dharmapuram Adheenam in Mayiladuthurai has come forward to provide substantial land for establishing a permanent collectorate complex. This proposal is also being processed, official sources said, indicating that the extent of land required for the Collectorate was not available in the town limits. Though the Adheenam land is away from the urban limits, the location was being considered in view of the requirement of a huge land parcel for the new Collectorate. In all likelihood, the announcement on functioning of the new Mayiladuthurai district, for which the government had already posted a Special Officer and a Superintendent of Police, will be made any time soon, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commercial-tax-office-complex-to-function-as-temporary-collectorate-in-mayiladuthurai/article32808600.ece

09 October 2020||Perambalur,TAMIL NADU||Adopt high-density planting system to ensure high yield, cotton farmers told||Tamil Nadu Agricultural University's (TNAU) Cotton Research Station (CRS) in Perambalur district has advocated adoption of high-density planting system (HDPS) and mechanisation to ensure higher yields and returns. During the World Cotton Day celebration at the CRS in Veppanthattai in the district on Wednesday, cotton farmers were also apprised about a compact variety CO 17 with a yield potential of 1,800 kg per hectare under irrigated conditions and suitable for HDPS and mechanical harvesting. The CRS has identified the new compact type, zero monopodial cotton culture, suited for rainfed cultivation in Perambalur district, S. Somasundaram, Associate Professor and Head, Cotton Research Station, said. The compact cultivars with synchronised, early maturing, short stature, zero monopodia (no vegetative branches) fewer bolls plant are well-suited for mechanical harvesting, K. Sakthivel, Assistant Professor, Plant Breeding and Genetitics, said. Conventional cotton varieties cannot be used under HDPS system, he said, adding that the bushy formation was not suited for mechanical harvesting. Detailing India's leadership in cotton cultivation and production at the global level, Prof. Somasundarm said that mechanisation was inevitable for sustenance in cultivation of cotton. Cotton picking by hand was the most difficult, tiresome and labour-intensive job. The average labour requirement was 517 man hours per hectare. One person can pick about 15 to 20 kg cotton every day. But, by machine harvesting, a maximum of 2,180 kg could be realised, Prof. Somasundaram said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adopt-high-density-planting-system-to-ensure-high-yield-cotton-farmers-told/article32808592.ece
09 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Opposition playing politics over decision to reopen schools: CM||Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday flayed the Opposition parties over their criticism of the Puducherry government’s decision to permit high school students to visit their institutions on a voluntary basis to clear doubts. “We have made it very clear that students could visit the schools only with the consent of parents. The government has to prepare the students for final examinations in March. And we have made it clear that if any student gets infected [with COVID-19], we will reconsider the decision,” he said in an audio message. Several States have resumed educational activities for even smaller classes. Even States with much higher numbers of COVID-19 cases have allowed students to visit schools, he said. “Staging of protests in front of schools by a section of political parties is only an attempt to tarnish the image of my government. They are trying to play politics on the issue,” he added. Upping the ante against the government on reopening of schools, the AIADMK on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the Lt. Governor on the issue. Party leader A. Anbalagan, in the memorandum, said the government went ahead with the decision despite objections from several political parties. Besides the AIADMK, the principal Opposition party AINRC was also against the decision to start academic activities in high schools. Meanwhile, schools in Puducherry and Karaikal regions reopened on Thursday to permit students of Standards IX to XII to visit their institutions on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from teachers, to get doubts clarified, for counselling and other related works in areas outside the containment zones. The sessions began for students of Standards X and XII while activities for students of Standards IX and XI will commence on October 12. The schools will function only during forenoon, and work for six days instead of five days. The schedule for class-wise opening will be Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for Standards IX and XI, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays for Standards X and XII.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/opposition-playing-politics-over-decision-to-reopen-schools-cm/article32809388.ece

Arun has directed the Pondicherry Co-operative Wholesale Stores Limited, which runs the Amudhasurabi outlets, to ensure uninterrupted supply of POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) for government vehicles. In an order issued on Wednesday night, the Collector said non-functioning of outlets had led to a shortage in supply of petroleum products for government vehicles. Since government vehicles depended on Amudhasurabi alone, disruption in supply would affect administrative works. A shortage in supply had affected administrative continuity and various enforcement activities of the government, including works in containment zones, the order said. Mr. Arun directed the cooperative authorities to ensure appropriate supply. A roster system should be followed in providing POL so as to ensure gas for all department vehicles. Priority should be given to Fleet Card Holders, the order said. Violation of the order would attract punishment under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The outlets would be attached to a functioning organisation to ensure adequate supply, the order said.

09 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Bars may take time to reopen||Despite clearance from the government to reopen bars from October 1, many owners are taking their own time to reopen them. A source in the Excise Department said many of the bars are taking time to reopen due to various reasons, including time needed to clean up the premises after remaining closed for several months. “Only a few liquor sale outlets-cum-bars have opened. Others want to wait for some more time before reopening,” the source said. Unsure of returns According to a bar owner, the traders are apprehensive about returns if they open the outlets with all restrictions in place. “Business is down in liquor shops due to the hike in excise duty imposed when IMFL outlets were allowed to function from May-end. Obviously, the price of liquor will be more in bars and the traders are not sure of getting customers,” he said. Some bars need more time to clean up their premises and procure new stock, he added. The bar association members on Thursday met Deputy Commissioner (Excise) Shashvat Sauraubh to discuss issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bars-may-take-time-to-reopen/article32809386.ece

09 October 2020||Salem/Erode,TAMIL NADU||Police reach doorstep of people to settle complaints amicably||Following instruction from senior officers, police personnel in Salem, Namakkal and Erode have launched inquiry into complaints at the petitioner's place itself. Namakkal district police launched the programme on Wednesday and police officials visited the complainant’s place and conducted inquiries. According to police, the programme has been launched as part of COVID-19 safety measures and to improve relationship between police and the public. Superintendent of Police S. Sakthi Ganesan said, “the programme has elicited good response from the public. Police go to the spot of complainants, especially those involving senior citizens and regarding domestic violence and are able to provide immediate solution to the issue at the spot itself. The entire process is transparent since the process happens in front of the people. “Also, other issues which generally may not come to our knowledge would be brought to notice like lack of streetlights at a place. We would be able to take necessary measures immediately.” The programme was launched in Salem on Tuesday. As instructed by Salem City Police Commissioner T. Senthil Kumar, inspectors, sub-inspectors and head constables with city police would provide a Community Service Register number for complaints received. They would visit the complainant at their residences itself and enquiry further about the complaints. Both the petitioner and accused are called to the place and enquiry is conducted. Salem district police also launched the scheme on Tuesday. Deputy Superintendents of Police visited complainants at their respective places in their sub-divisions and inquired with complainants. Pradip Kumar, DIG, Salem Range, said, “its a new initiative and we are receiving positive feedback from both police and the public.” In a move to resolve petty issues and disputes that are non-sensitive and non-cognizable, police personnel in Erode have started visiting the complainant’s residence and conduct inquiry and settle the issue amicably. Issues related to quarrel with neighbours over drainage, water, dumping of garbage, problems over collecting water from public tap, problems over monetary transactions and family disputes are taken up with police stations in respective areas and inquiry is held. The issue, when left unattended at an early stage, turns into a major law and order problem leading to assault and sometimes murder. Rajesh Das, Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order), who recently assumed office, directed all the Superintendents of Police to reach the doorsteps of complaints and resolve the issues. After studying the nature of the complaint, the Inspector of Police and his team visits the house of the complainant and conducts inquiry. Erode Town Deputy Superintendent of Police Raju said that certain issues like disputes over conduct of festivals in temples, problems between two groups or issues where crowd gathering is expected will not be taken up under the system. He said that regular procedures will be followed for sensitive issues and added that only petty issues will be resolved under the new system. Superintendent of Police P. Thangadurai told The Hindu that the system was implemented in all the 37 police stations in the district to resolve non-sensitive and non-cognizable offences. He said that the visit of police personnel to each area helps them to monitor the public activities and also create awareness on crime prevention by stressing on installing closed circuit television cameras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-reach-doorstep-of-people-to-settle-complaints-amicably/article32808664.ece
09 October 2020||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Need to promote Sivakasi fireworks||Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore has initiated a discussion to bring an export hub in Sivakasi for its fireworks goods taking a cue from Centre’s proposal to transform each district into an export hub. He held a discussion with representatives of the fireworks industry and Petroleum and Explosives Safety officials here on Thursday. “China has cornered the entire export of fireworks industry across the globe though Sivakasi has a huge potential for export of its products,” he said. Stating that the Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, had said that export hub should be created in each district to export its special products, he said that Sivakasi fireworks should be exported to harness its potential and further develop the industry in the interest of the manufacturers and workers. “Now that Chinese crackers are facing opposition world-wide, we should explore how to capitalize on the situation and promote Sivakasi fireworks,” he added. Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives R. Sundaresan said that the bottleneck in exporting fireworks would be discussed threadbare in the coming days to export Indian fireworks. Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers’ Association president Ganesan Panjurajan said that at present India’s export was only around 0.5% of Rs. 50,000-crore export market. “Shipping has been the major handicap for exporting fireworks. Not all shipping liners accept fireworks for transport and freight charges are almost equal to the production cost. If this issue is redressed, Sivakasi can export its products to many countries,” he added. Office-bearers from TANFAMA and The Indian Fireworks Manufacturers’ Association took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-promote-sivakasi-fireworks/article32808649.ece
09 October 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Farmers protest move to acquire farm lands for laying Thiruvaiyaru bypass road||A section of farmers staged a black flag protest at Kandiyur on Thursday against the reported move to acquire farm lands for laying a bypass road at Thiruvariyaru on the Perambalur-Manamadurai national highway. The farmers, led by P. Sukumaran, district vice president, Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, got into agricultural fields and staged a demonstration. The farmers alleged that about 100 acres of farm lands were proposed to be acquired at Kandiyur, Arasur, Thirupanthurithi and a few other villages near Thiruvaiyaru for laying the new by-pass road. The move was reportedly shelved in 2019 owing to stiff opposition from farmers. But officials were now conducting land surveys to demarcate the land to be acquired, they charged. Rather than acquire farm lands to build a new bypass road, the existing road can be widened by removing encroachments, they suggested. Some of the farmers held black flags while a few others carried begging bowls in their hands as a symbolic protest to highlight their plight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-protest-move-to-acquire-farm-lands-for-laying-thiruvaiyaru-bypass-road/article32808597.ece

09 October 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||3 supervisors sacked||After a section of beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) tested positive for COVID-19, the District Collector has removed three site supervisors from work. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to ensure the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is maintained, he said. There were lapses in the SOP and the workers had taken off their face masks during breaks, M. Govinda Rao, District Collector said. “The site supervisors were instructed to ensure masks were worn at all times and that they maintained personal distance, since the number of those testing positive increased, they were suspended,” he said. Clusters were identified among the workers who tested positive in Kalanaivasal and Sornakadu, after which three site supervisors were removed. “Many of the patients were primary contacts of patients who tested positive earlier,” he said. The Project Officer of the District Rural Development Authority said that of the 70,000 beneficiaries in the district, 234 had tested positive for COVID-19. Among them, a large number tested positive over the last month. Most patients were asymptomatic, and went unnoticed. “We do not allow the beneficiaries to come to work if they have cold, cough or fever. However, since many of them were asymptomatic, we could not contain the spread,” he said. A coordination meeting was convened after the removal of the supervisors. Chaired by the District Collector, the attendees, including Block Development Officers, supervisors and field level staff were instructed to ensure six feet distance, and that they wear masks at all times. Field-level staff have also been instructed to conduct inspections and monitor the adherence to the SOPs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-beneficiaries-of-mgnregs-test-positive-3-supervisors-sacked/article32808594.ece
09 October 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Procurement of paddy with up to 20% moisture content recommended||The district administration has recommended to the government relaxation of norms on the maximum permissible moisture content in the paddy procured through the Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs) following widespread requests from farmers in view of the sporadic rains. “We have recommended to the government that paddy with moisture content of up to 20% may be procured (as against the current limit of 17%),” Collector M. Govinda Rao told reporters in Kumbakonam on Thursday. Mr. Rao said that that such as relaxation had been given about four years ago. “In the mean time we are trying to help farmers and are also exploring the feasibility of extending some technological support to dry the paddy,” he added. He maintained that paddy was being kept safely at the DPCs. Each permanent DPC has space to store about 100 tonnes. Besides, farmers have been provided tarpaulins under various government schemes. Mr. Rao said 252 DPCs have been opened for the current kharif season offering revised rates to farmers and more would be opened wherever needed. During 2019-20, a record 7.7 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured in Thanjavur district. Kuruvai paddy was raised on 58,945 hectares (ha) in the district, against the target of 43,825 ha thanks to the timely release of water and the execution of kudimaramathu works. Harvest has been completed on about 45,000 ha. Significantly, the average yield has also increased to 6.2 tonnes a ha against the normal of six tonnes a ha, he said. He also expressed confidence that the area under coverage during samba will also exceed the targeted 1.27 lakh ha in the district. Already 35,000 ha has been covered. Steps have been taken to extend timely credit to farmers and so far about Rs. 137 crore has been disbursed as crop loans against the target of Rs. 344 crore. Adequate stocks of seeds, fertilizers and other inputs was being made available. PM KISAN Scheme fraud Answering a query, the Collector said that a field inquiry conducted jointly by the Revenue and Agriculture department officials has revealed that about 5,000 ineligible persons had received financial assistance to the extent of Rs. 1.60 crore sanctioned under the PM Kisan Scheme. “We have recovered Rs. 1.40 crore of this and two computer centres through which the irregularities were committed have been closed. Besides, the services of four data entry operators working on contract basis have been terminated,” he said. COVID-19 On the pandemic situation, Mr. Rao said that the district had only 1,268 active cases as on Thursday and attributed the recent increase in number of average daily cases to the relaxation of lockdown norms and movement of people. More cases were being reported from rural areas now while earlier it was the urban centres which reported high number of cases. However, a trend of slight decline in the case load was perceptible over the past few days, he said.  We are also exploring the feasibility of extending some technological support to dry the paddy M.

09 October 2020||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Membership drive launched||Knowing pretty well that the AIADMK would taste defeat in the ensuing general elections, the AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam has 'cleverly' announced Edappadi K Palaniswami's name for the post of Chief Minister, said DMK district secretary Thanga Tamilselvan here on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said that the AIADMK government had failed in all fronts and the people were convinced that the DMK was the only party which could pull them out of the crisis. There has been corruption reported in every sphere and the people were fed up with the present government. Even during the pandemic days, some of the functionaries indulged in corruption, he charged. Considering all these factors, the people were convinced that the DMK would bring back the glory to the State and M K Stalin would lead Tamil Nadu to the top in all spheres. The DMK, he said, would win hands down in all the four Assembly constituencies in Theni district, Mr. Thanga Tamilselvan said. He launched the membership drive of the party here and asked the party men to work hard and not to be over confident. The DMK had recently appointed Mr. Thanga Tamilselvan as the one of the district secretary of Theni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/membership-drive-launched/article32808650.ece
09 October 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Biometric authentication suffers a glitch||Connectivity issue hits the biometric authenticated Public Distribution System (PDS) in different parts of the district. The system, aimed at preventing bogus transactions at ration shops and unauthorised use of ration cards, has been implemented in the district since August 1. Tiruchi was one among the four districts in the State where the new system was introduced on a pilot basis. As per the system, the cardholders will have to authorise themselves by placing their thumb on the biometric devices at the ration shops for getting the commodities. The salesmen have been asked to distribute PDS items only after the device reads and authenticates the thumb impression. However, complaints have cropped up in different parts, mainly rural areas, of the districts that cardholders were forced to wait in long queues for a long time to draw the commodities. There were instances of customers, after standing in queues for long, returning home without buying the commodities. Connectivity issues were said to be the reason for the delay. “I waited for more than two hours on Wednesday to buy commodities at a ration shop on Nelson Road in Thiruvanaikoil. Since the biometric device failed to read the thumb impressions, many cardholders were asked to visit the shop the next day. We often face the problem,” says S. Subramani, a cardholder in Thiruvanaikoil. Enquiries revealed that many ration shops in rural areas had been facing the issue. It was acute in the ration shops at Kannuthur, Inamputhur, Vaiyamalapalayam, Elaman and Purathakudi villages in Manapparai and Vaiyampatti unions. Poor internet connectivity and server issues were leading to problems in completing the sales process. Though the new system was in force since August 1, the issue had turned worse over the past week. “We cannot complete the sale process unless the biometric device reads the thumb impression of the cardholders. Hence, distribution is slowed down. However, the situation is gradually improving,” A. Sahayaraj, a salesman at a ration shop at Purathakudi near Vaiyampatti. Anbalagan, District Supply Officer, when contacted told The Hindu that the system, which was introduced in Tiruchi on August 1, had been extended to other districts since October 1. There has been teething troubles here and there. There were some glitches on the server for an hour on Wednesday and Thursday. However, the issues had been resolved quickly. It would stabilise in the days to come, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/biometric-authentication-suffers-a-glitch/article32808603.ece

Whenever these districts receive abundant rainfall, the area of cultivation crosses 1 lakh acres as farmers go in for cultivation of other crops also. In the first step, 45,161 tonnes of urea has been imported by Indian Potash Ltd. at VOC Port, Thoothukudi. The consignment that reached the port on Wednesday will be sent to various districts of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States. “Of this quantity, Tamil Nadu will get 35,561 tonnes and Thoothukudi’s share will be 6,000 tonnes. The imported urea will be sold to farmers through private dealers and farmers’ cooperative societies at the prescribed price. The dealers and cooperative societies have been instructed to display the price list of the chemical nutrients and pesticides and sell it at the right price. Farmers, after producing their Aadhaar card, can buy the chemical nutrients through ‘point of sale’ to enjoy the subsidy,” said S.I. Mohideen, Joint Director of Agriculture, Thoothukudi. One more shipment of urea is expected to arrive at Thoothukudi seaport in near future. “Hence, there will be no dearth of urea for farmers during this pisanam season,” Mr. Mohideen said. Meanwhile, Tirunelveli has received 1,330 tonnes of factamfos from Kerala, which will be shared among Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts during the pisanam paddy season. “Thoothukudi will get 300 tonnes and the remaining 1,030 tonnes will be shared by Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts. The chemical nutrient will be sold through private and cooperative society stores to farmers at the prescribed price. Since agriculture officers have been instructed to monitor the sale of the chemical fertilizers at the right price to farmers, dealers selling them at inflated price will lose their licence besides facing legal action,” warned Joint Director of Agriculture, Gajendra Pandian. Also, 8,000 tonnes of Factamfos will reach Thoothukudi seaport shortly, he added. Welcoming the arrival of fertilizers to Tamil Nadu ahead of pisanam paddy season, leading fertilizer stockist ‘Minnal’ Mohamed Ali says a major quantity of the fertilizer imported at Thoothukudi harbour is being sent to Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka and Kerala, where the paddy season has ended after the southwest monsoon. “Farming operations will move to top gear only in Tamil Nadu during the season between October and February as the State alone gets good rainfall during the northeast monsoon during this period. There is no point in sending the fertilizers to neighbouring States where the paddy season has already ended. Hence, the Tamil Nadu Government should get a major quantity of the imported fertilizer for farming operations in the State during this season,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/urea-factamfos-arrive-ahead-of-pisanam-paddy-season/article32809456.ece

09 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Kumari Isaiyaruvi Abubucker no more||Noted singer Abubucker, popularly known as Kumari Isaiyaruvi Abubucker, passed away at Hasthinapuram in Chennai on Thursday. He was 83. Born in Kaanchaampuram, close to the coastal hamlet of Thaengaaipattinam near Kanniyakumari-Kerala border in 1937 to Maluk Mohammed and Ayisha Beevi, Abubucker was attracted by his maternal uncle M.P.V. Hasan’s outstanding singing skills in Tamil, Malayalam and Arabic, who also taught his nephew the history of Prophet Mohamed. Since his unique voice attracted many, Abubucker got the chance to showcase his talent at the age of 15 in a mosque. “He was a self-made singer, who could reach any high note that his voice attracted Mohamed Ali-Shali brothers of Thiruvananthapuram when they happened to hear his performance at Poovar Noohu Oliyullah Dhargah,” says K.M.A. Nizam, MDMK’s Tirunelveli City district secretary. Encouraged by the compliments, his discourses and devotional concerts that were organised in mosques in Panachchamoodu, Kadayalaumoodu, Kaliyakkavilai, Paarasaala and other areas created a huge following in these areas when he was just 18 years old. “His contribution in taking Seeraapuraanam , Rajanayagam, Kunangudi Mastan Saheb Songs, Sorganeedhi , Nabhimargal Varalaaru , Mohideen Maalai , Kavi Moosa’s songs, among others, with Carnatic flavour to the masses is matchless,” recalls freedom fighter Kodikkaal Shaik Abdullah. Apart from Carnatic-flavored Islamic devotional songs, Abubucker’s rendition of folk songs earned him fans from all walks of life and even beyond the geographical boundaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala as his unique voice could be heard everywhere through television. Almost all mosques across Tamil Nadu might have hosted his discourse on Seerapuraanam and Tamil literature associated with Islam on special occasions. Though Abubucker’s efforts to enter the tinsel world did not yield desirable results for him, his discourses and devotional concerts continued for long. His association with lyricist Ka. Mu. Sheriff gave different dimension to his Islamic discourses organised even in Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai. “After Abubucker singing a portion of Seeraapuraanam in his mesmerizing voice, Sheriff would speak in detail about this portion that attracted huge crowd everywhere they performed,” MDMK singer Puliyangudi Abubucker says. Though several titles were conferred on him, Abubucker loved Isaiyarvi the most, as rain would also be a visitor to his concerts and discourses on most of the occasions, says Mr. Nizam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kumari-isaiyaruvi-abubucker-no-more/article32808647.ece

Preliminary checks revealed that the four men identified as Fateh Chand, Jayantilal and Sivaramakrishnan, all from Tirunelveli, and Kalyanakumar of Tenkasi, were proceeding to Tenkasi. When police checked the vehicle, they found the cash in a bag. As the foursome could not submit valid documents for the huge amount, they alerted the income tax department for further inquiry. Police sources said one of them, working with a pressure cooker manufacturing unit, was returning to Tenkasi with the money he had apparently collected from dealers in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts. The IT department inquiry would throw more light on the seizure, said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rs-6010-lakh-cash-seized/article32808625.ece

09 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Mahadayi: State govt. gearing up to counter Goa’s allegations||Irrigation Department officials in Karnataka are gearing up to counter Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant’s claim that the State is diverting the Mahadayi waters in a way that it can change the river’s course. Goa has filed a contempt petition in this regard in the Supreme Court. Mr. Sawant had alleged at a press meet in Panaji earlier this week that Karnataka was diverting the Mahadayi waters. He also alleged that Karnataka had begun work on the Kalasa-Banduri Nala projects without due permits and clearances from the Central government. Subsequently, the neighbouring State filed a contempt petition against Karnataka. Karnataka Irrigation Department engineers told The Hindu that they were yet to get a clear idea about what is in the petition since there was no official communication. “But based on Goa Chief Minister’s press conference, we can infer that they are alleging that we have diverted the Mahadayi waters in violation of rules. That is not true,” said Mallikarjun Gunge, managing director of the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd., the special purpose vehicle tasked with the Mahadayi project.  “There has been no diversion of any kind. They have also alleged that we have begun work in the Mahadayi river basin without obtaining due permits from Central agencies. That is also far from truth. We have applied to all jurisdictional agencies and we are waiting for permissions,” he said. “When the Mahadayi tribunal, a Supreme Court-appointed body, gave its award allocating separable share of water to the riparian States, both Karnataka and Goa opposed it. We have both approached the Supreme Court against the award and that is pending there. We will take our next steps once that is settled,” he added. Diversion of the Mahadayi waters is “nearly impossible” because the barrier built between the nalas and the river is an underground concrete wall that is six metres wide. “It cannot be opened or removed easily. We have not even contemplated that,” he said. Karnataka’s legal team in New Delhi is also waiting to hear about the petition. “We are yet to get a copy of the petition, if it has been filed,” said Mohan Kataraki, senior advocate in the Supreme Court who is part of Karnataka’s legal team. According to him, Karnataka had ably answered all the issues raised in Goa’s contempt in 2018. “It was not very significant and did not have much impact. Similarly, we don’t believe the current petition will have much of an impact,” he said. Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said his department had not taken any illegal steps. “We are taking all necessary legal steps to get approvals before starting work,” the Minister said. Site visit Meanwhile, Goa-based environmentalist Rajendra Kerkar told The Hindu , “We requested Goa to file the contempt petition as Karnataka has gone ahead with the diversion despite the assurances given by senior counsel Fali Nariman. Goa government engineers have visited the work sites and collected documents and pictures of the diversion work. This is being presented before the Supreme Court.” He claimed that it was not a sustainable project and would cause great harm to the Western Ghats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mahadayi-state-govt-gearing-up-to-counter-goas-allegations/article32808729.ece

09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Majority of the people who died had comorbid conditions’||The external death audit team constituted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to undertake an audit of all fatalities owing to COVID-19 in various hospitals in the city has observed that a majority of people who died were aged over 55 and had comorbid conditions/complications. The observations were submitted to civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad. Mortality was high within 72 hours of hospitalisation as a large number of patients were brought to the hospital after delay or were in bad clinical condition at the time of admission. The audit also noted that most of the patients who died had been admitted to ICU and ICU-ventilator beds, and a majority had major comorbid conditions/complications. The committee, which had been formed after some hospitals recorded a high case fatality ratio, made several recommendations to be implemented at the community, institutional and administrative levels. At the community level, it recommended strengthening monitoring protocols and follow-ups of patients in home isolation to identify complications early for timely hospitalisation. Facilities in ambulances also need to be reviewed in view of patient deterioration en route to hospitals, it noted. Address data mismatch At the institutional level, the committee underscored the need for standardisation of documentation and reporting systems with respect to death forms and presenting statistics to the BBMP, as there was mismatch in data sets. In the death certificates, the immediate cause of death should not be merely COVID-19 but the medical condition leading to the death, it noted. With several medical college hospitals getting referrals from corporate and private hospitals and smaller government centres, it is essential that such serious cases are better managed in the initial stages in the same institutions to reduce hospital mortality, said the report. Infrastructure gaps with respect to ventilators, oxygen availability and supply, manpower should be addressed, while protocols of treatment need to be uniform and rationalised. The committee also recommended addressing comorbid conditions and putting in place standard operating procedures and follow-up protocol, as well as closer monitoring of the elderly. Community awareness At the administrative level, it called for greater emphasis on community education on getting tested, seeking medical help early and removal of stigma associated with COVID-19. When it came to infrastructure, the committee recommended good quality ventilators and other equipment in government hospitals and enlisting more hospitals in the private sector to increase bed allocation etc. Mr. Prasad said that towards improving infrastructure, the State government had procured 200 ventilators – 100 each distributed to private and government hospitals. Installation will be completed over the next week. Though the number of positive cases being reported had increased, there was no issue with regard to availability of beds, he maintained. He said there still were around 10% vacancy in the beds available for treatment of COVID-19 patients. “When the average cases reported were around 3,000 a day, the vacancy was around 20% to 30%. This has now come down to around 10%,” he said. Mr. Prasad also said that two COVID Care Centres, each with 100 bed capacity, would be opened in Sarvagna Nagar and Shantinagar. “We will open more centres, if required. As of now, we do not foresee such a requirement,” he said, and added that residents’ welfare associations had been directed to help the civic body identify people with ILI/SARI, comorbidities, and elderly citizens.  Mortality was high within 72 hours of hospitalisation as a large number of patients were brought to the hospital after delay or were in bad clinical condition at the time of admission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/majority-of-the-people-who-died-had-comorbid-conditions/article32808726.ece
09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 15,000 govt. schools see rise in enrolment for 2020-21||In an unusual reversal of the usual trend which sees parents rushing to private schools for admissions, enrolment in government schools has increased compared to the previous year. According to data provided by the Department of Public Instruction, 15,189 government primary schools have recorded an increase in student intake. There are 43,287 government primary schools in the State. While the increase in student strength is around 10% in some schools, several schools have reported a 100% increase. In many instances, government schools have been forced to turn away students due to constraints in infrastructure. The department is still in the process of collecting data for the 2020-21 academic year. So far, 42.5 lakh children have been admitted to government schools, 12.17 lakh students to government aided schools, and 40.57 lakh children to private unaided schools. Data for eight lakh students is yet to be collated. For the 2019-20 academic year, 43.28 lakh students were enrolled in government schools, while private unaided school enrolment was 46.13 lakh and aided schools had 13.33 lakh students. Gangadharappa B.R., Headmaster of Government Model Higher Primary School, Menase, Sringeri taluk, Chikkamagaluru district, said their enrolments from LKG to class 1 for this academic year stands at 245. Last year, the student strength was 185. “We have been taking up several measures to improve the quality of education in our school, but the increase in the number of students this year is unprecedented. Parents of 30 students have removed their students from private schools and enrolled them in our school,” he said. One of the main reasons for this sudden ‘popularity’ in government schools is the fees. Many families are pulling their children out of private schools as they can no longer afford private school fees due to salary cut or job loss on account of the pandemic. “It was not a choice we wanted to make but we were pushed to make this decision for financial reasons,” said Gautam S., an autorickshaw driver who has admitted his son to class 4 in a government school for this academic year. Government schools in rural areas are also reporting an increase in student strength as many families have migrated from urban areas to rural areas after they lost their jobs during the pandemic. Rishikesh B.S., associate professor, Azim Premji University, said that there is a good chance of parents who have made the switch to government schools keeping their children there even when the crisis is over. “They will realise that the quality of education in government schools is far better than some of the private schools. Teachers at government schools will also do everything they can to ensure that the children are retained in their schools,” he said. V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that the reasons for improvement in government school enrolments could be attributed to the efforts of the State government as well. “We have started the Vidyagama scheme where teachers from government schools go to the neighbourhood where students reside and teach them. The government has also started English-medium sections in government schools, which have received a good response,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-15000-govt-schools-see-rise-in-enrolment-for-2020-21/article32808742.ece
09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||57 nominations filed for Council polls||As many as 57 candidates have filed their nomination papers in the four Legislative Council constituencies going to the polls in the State. Thursday was the last day for filing nominations. The final list of candidates in the fray will be known on October 12, the last date for withdrawal of nominations. There are a few candidates who have rebelled against their respective parties and filed nominations, and they are expected to withdraw from the race. Bangalore Teachers, Karnataka South-east Graduates, North-east Teachers, and Karnataka West Graduates constituencies are going to the poll on October 28, following the retirement of members on June 30. The polls had been deferred by the Election Commission owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The counting of votes will be taken up on November 2. Number game Currently in the 75-member Upper House, the Congress has 28 members while the BJP has 27. The Janata Dal (Secular) has 14 members, besides Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty and an Independent. The elections are seen as important by both the ruling BJP and the Congress to increase the number in the Upper House. Incidentally, on the last day of the legislature session a fortnight ago, the combined Opposition — Congress and JD(S) — defeated a crucial Bill bringing about changes to labour laws, and stalled two more Bills pertaining to the Land Reforms Act and the APMC Act. Those in fray Among those in the fray include Sharanappa Mattur (Congress) in the North-east Teachers constituency, Puttanna (BJP) in Bangalore Teachers constituency, R. Chowdareddy (Janata Dal-Secular) in Karnataka South-east Graduates constituency and S.V. Sankanur (BJP) in Karnataka West Graduates constituency.

09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC opposes move to appoint only IAS or IFS officers as KSPCB member-secretary||Declining to accept the guidelines framed by the State government for selecting candidates to the posts of chairperson and member-secretary of the Karnataka State pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday said the government could not have decided to appoint only an officer from the cadre of IAS or IFS to the post of member-secretary of the board. Also, the court said that in the light of the Supreme Court’s judgment in Techi Tagi Tara vs. Rajendra Singh Bhandari case it was the duty of the State government to prescribe the educational qualification for the post of the chairperson. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while hearing a batch of PIL petitions questioning the legality of the guidelines fixed for selecting candidates to posts of member, member- secretary, and chairperson in the KSPCB. The Bench said the board must consist of persons having technical expertise and experience in dealing with environmental matters  as the board plays a pivotal and crucial role in implementing three important laws, the Environment (Protection) Act, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, enacted to protect environment and ecology. The apex court, the Bench said, had referred to the recommendations made by a committee, which had said that the member-secretary of the State Pollution Control Boards should possess a postgraduate degree in science, engineering or technology and have adequate experience of working in the areas of environment protection. Pointing out that State government had not given any reason for choosing officers from only IAS and IFS cadres for the post of the member secretary, the Bench said the guideline to consider officers of only these cadres was contrary to the provisions of the law while stating that the law does not refer to appointment only from IAS or IFS cadres. While pointing out that appoint of officers of IAS or IFS cadres would affect functioning of the board as the government would transfer the officers frequently citing exigencies, the Bench said that the member-secretary requires a minimum tenure of two to three years. While directing the government to reconsider qualification for both the posts, the Bench also said the government cannot appoint any person to these posts without prior permission of the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-opposes-move-to-appoint-only-ias-or-ifs-officers-as-kspcb-member-secretary/article32808731.ece
09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Bypolls amid pandemic risks people’s lives’||The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has questioned the timing of the byelections to two Legislative Assembly segments and polls to four Legislative Council seats amid the pandemic. “What would have happened if the polls to the Bihar Assembly and bypolls to 54 constituencies were delayed by three months? What would have happened if President’s rule was imposed in Bihar for three months and a caretaker government allowed?” Mr. Kumaraswamy asked. He said he was running a temperature after a two-day visit to Sira.He told reporters here: “Winning or losing is common for political parties. Just because you win one election, can we get power? Politicians are playing with the lives of people. In these circumstances, how do we participate in elections? We have to go to villages where crowds will gather. Will everyone be wearing masks or is it possible to maintain social distance?” However, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the JD(S) will contest the byelections to the two seats, and brushed aside allegations of Congress leaders that the JD(S) was contesting to help the BJP win elections. “Whether we win or lose, we will fight in both the seats.” While the party has finalised Ammajamma as the candidate for Sira, it is yet to name its nominee for R.R. Nagar segment, he added. On Congress and BJP poaching JD(S) leaders, he said such party-hopping was common as many leaders after enjoying power and position in the JD(S) join other parties. “Two of the Congress’ nominees for the Council elections were in the JD(S),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bypolls-amid-pandemic-risks-peoples-lives/article32808735.ece

09 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||When a ‘passenger’ joined mid-air||When a pregnant woman in her mid-30s felt pain and complained to the cabin crew of Indigo 6E 122 flight Delhi-Bengaluru, little did she know that her baby would be born mid-air. This was just 15 minutes after the flight took off from Delhi on October 7. When the cabin crew asked if there was a doctor on board, a plastic surgeon Nagaraj attended to her and suspected indigestion. But as pain did not subside, the crew asked if there was another doctor on board. That was when Sailaja V., a consultant gynaecologist with Cloudnine hospital, rose to help. However, the woman, in a state of restlessness, walked towards the restroom and that was when her water broke. “I realised she was into labour, and that her pregnancy was at least 32 week old. She was alone and had not seen a doctor before. I sanitised myself, wore the gloves, and started the delivery process. We used whatever we could lay our hands on. After cutting the umbilical cord, I used the gauze as no clamps were available. The premature male baby was born at 6.10 p.m. near Bhopal,” Dr. Sailaja told The Hindu . “The mother was bleeding and we needed clothes. Passengers came forward to help and we used shawls to wrap the mother and the child. Bags were placed to make an elevated bed on the three-seater row for the mother,” she said adding that it was a great feeling to hold the baby. Dr. Sailaja said she was happy to have saved two lives and do justice to what she had learnt. “The lady was extremely strong and it was her second baby.” About the response from other passengers, the doctor said, “Passengers were extremely cooperative; they were thrilled, amazed, and fearful. When the pilot announced that there is a new member on board, everyone applauded.” She said the crew was extremely supportive, and stressed on the need for airlines to train staff to deal with such emergencies. “Airlines should engage with maternity hospitals to train their staff to give basic training, this will help a lot.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/when-a-passenger-joined-mid-air/article32809150.ece

09 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Speedy justice sought for victim||Condemning the gang-rape and murder of a young woman at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, office-bearers and members of the KPCC Scheduled Caste Department staged a protest in Hubballi on Thursday. Staging the demonstration in front of the Mini Vidhana Soudha in Hubballi, chairman of KPCC SC Department F.H. Jakkappanavar and district president of KPCC SC Department Shankar Hosamani strongly condemned the incident and termed it a disgrace to civil society. They said that ever since the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre, a series of such inhuman crimes and massacres were being reported in the country. What was even more shameful was the apathetic attitude of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath towards the victim’s family. The protestors sought the intervention by the President in the matter and capital punishment to all those involved in the heinous crime against the young Dalit woman. They said that the Uttar Pradesh government was behaving like a dictator in its bid to prevent the Opposition from taking the Constitutional path of agitation to seek justice for the victim’s family. The protestors also sought an immediate relief of Rs. 5 crore to the victim’s family and urged the President to intervene. Subsequently, accompanied by president of the Dharwad Rural unit of the Congress Anil Kumar Patil and other leaders, including Sadanand Danganavar, Anwar Mudhol and others, they submitted a memorandum addressed to the President to Hubballi Tahsildar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/speedy-justice-sought-for-victim/article32808707.ece

09 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘We’re strong enough to fight elections independently’||Responding to the remarks of his party’s critics, especially the former Chief Minister and the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah, national president of Janata Dal (Secular) and Rajya Sabha member H.D. Deve Gowda has said that his party was strong enough to contest elections on its own. “I don’t respond to what others say about my party. Everybody knows about my party’s efforts in nourishing leaders and allowing them to grow. What all I can say is that my party with lakhs of grassroots-level workers is strong enough to contest elections on its own. It will contest four council polls — two each from teachers constituency and graduates constituency — and the bypolls to the two Assembly segments on its own. Let people talk however lightly about my party. I will only respond after the elections. My focus is on organising the party and fighting the elections,” he said. He was addressing a media conference at his party office in Kalaburagi on Thursday. Multiple reasons Asked about the current economic and employment crisis, the former Prime Minister said that the country’s economic crisis had multiple reasons, including “global events” and the COVID-19 situation. “I am observing everything. The political war between the Congress and the BJP has begun,” he said. Asked about the inter-State dispute over sharing the Krishna waters, Mr. Gowda said that he had fought for Cauvery and Mahadayi waters in the past and would continue to fight for the Krishna waters. “I have become a Rajya Sabha member as the party forced me to do so. I will continue to fight in Parliament against any injustice to the State,” he said. Janata Dal(S) State president H.K.

09 October 2020||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||KPCC launches ‘Arogya Hasta’ programme in gram panchayats||To control the spread of COVID-19 cases in the State, the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) has launched the ‘Arogya Hasta’ programme, former MP and State president of the outreach programme R. Dhruvanarayan said. Addressing a press conference at the district Congress party office here on Thursday, he said around 15,000 party workers were appointed and training is being carried out by experts for providing health services in all the districts. The insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh has been provided to all the 15,000 workers by MLA Ajay Singh, who is also in charge of the Arogya Hasta programme. Mr. Dhruvanarayan said that a total of 7,400 Arogya Hasta kits were distributed at gram panchayat levels so far and 220 doctors were appointed under the outreach programme. The programme is tentatively estimated to cost around Rs. 6 crore and the donation was raised from the party leaders, he added. Alleging that the State government had failed in containing the spreading of the virus, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said that the B.S. Yediyurappa-led government was indulging in large-scale corruption in the name of purchasing healthcare and medical equipment for the treatment of COVID-19. Though KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar exposed the corruption of the BJP government, no action had been taken yet. Economic slowdown Criticising the ongoing economic slowdown in the State, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said the State was under severe financial stress, and it had decided to borrow Rs. 33,000 crore loans from financial institutions for the payment of salaries and the development work.  A total of 7,400 Arogya Hasta kits were distributed at gram panchayat levels so far and 220 doctors were appointed under the outreach programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kpcc-launches-arogya-hasta-programme-in-gram-panchayats/article32808718.ece

09 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Signature campaign planned||Terming the passage of the three Bills as a “death sentence” to the farming community, MLA Priyank Kharge has accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of being anti-farmer. During a joint press conference, Mr. Kharge and MLA Ajay Singh on Wednesday said that the BJP government has passed the three Acts — Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — without holding any discussion and consent from pro-farmer organisations. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee would launch a signature campaign on October 10 as part of a nation-wide campaign by the Congress to collect 10 crore signatures from across the country. A memorandum with these signatures will be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind on November 14 demanding the withdrawal of the Acts. He said that the Modi government had promised to double the income of farmers by 2022 by implementing the Swaminathan report, but farmers income has gone down. Farmers income was around 4.3 % during the UPA-II government, and now it has declined to 3.1 % under the BJP rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/signature-campaign-planned/article32808700.ece

09 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Expatriates returning to work to get RT-PCR report in eight hrs||Having ramped up testing facilities in Dakshina Kannada district, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramachandra Bairy on Thursday said expatriates, who are going abroad to resume work, will get reports of RT-PCR test for COVID-19 within eight hours of collection of their samples. Speaking at the general meeting of the Zilla Panchayat here, Dr. Bairy said that the expatriates should clearly mention that they are undergoing the RT-PCR test as they need to resume work abroad. “They will get their reports within six to eight hours,” he said. This test will be done free at the laboratory of the Government Wenlock Hospital, while it will cost Rs. 1,600 if it is done in private laboratories. The test results will be valid for 96 hours from the time of swab collection. Panchayat members Koragappa Nayak, Mamata Gatty and Dhanalakshmi pointed to problems faced by patients in getting treatment for COVID-19 and other ailments in private hospitals. They pointed out that patients are charged hefty amount for preliminary investigation tests and treatment is not given till the amount is paid. “How can you expect a poor patient to deposit money before hand when he is eligible for free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka scheme,” Ms. Gattay asked. Another member K. Sujatha said that a hospital made a patient wait for eight days to give treatment. Dr. Bairy said that directions were issued to all medical officers in taluk hospitals and community hospitals to refer all suspected COVID-19 cases to the Government Wenlock Hospital. “If the patient needs specialist services, we will refer to private hospitals,” he said. Hospitals were directed to treat emergency cases as suspected COVID-19 patients and continue with treatment in anticipation of RT-PCR test result. Most of the RT-PCR test results were being issued within 24 hours, he added. On the demand for waiving charges for CT Scan and preliminary investigation tests being done for Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka beneficiaries, Dr. Bairy said that nothing can be done at their level as it was a policy decision of the State government to collect preliminary investigation fees. Earlier, members paid their condolences to the former President Pranab Mukherjee, singers S.P. Balasubrahmaniam and Pandit Jasraj and the former Defence Minister Jaswant Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/expatriates-returning-to-work-to-get-rt-pcr-report-in-eight-hrs/article32809303.ece

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. D’Souza said that the probe should be conducted either by the Anti Corruption Bureau or the Lokayukta. He said that the project cost got escalated by three times from the initial estimated cost. People were suspicious over the cost as well as the detailed project report, he said. Mr. D’Souza said that despite two years of the commencement of the Smart City project, not a single work has been completed; as such, there was a need for public audit too. MSCL should make public a list of completed projects and the amount spent to facilitate a debate, he said. Land acquisition The former MLC wondered why neither Mangaluru City Corporation nor MSCL were able to take up construction of the railway overbridge at Mahakalipadpu in South Mangaluru. Even land acquisition was not completed for the Rs. 40-crore project, he said. He said that the grants that had to be given to the city corporation were being allocated to MSCL. Thus, the process has become non-transparent. Expenditure made towards public purposes need to be made transparent. Though Rs. 8 crore was sanctioned for the development of eight lakes in Mangaluru Urban Development Authority limits several months ago, work was yet to commence.

Volunteer Services Organisation (VSO), the social unit of MAHE, held an array of “Virtual Giving and Volunteering” activities for students, staff and their family members along with the constituent institutes of MAHE to celebrate the “Joy of Giving”, said a release here. Various activities, including mask making, yoga sessions named “Relax, Breathe and Repeat” and Rags to Bags-Making carry bags from old t-shirts, were initiated virtually. Virtual projects such as Health Bites - to maintain balanced diet and build immunity and Salute to COVID warriors - wherein students express their gratitude virtually, were also planned. With an intent to Gyaan Daan, VSO engaged student volunteers in curating an Activity Workbook, including crossword, riddles, puzzles, short stories, for underprivileged children in the eight-12 age group. Rangat – a cultural extravaganza was held wherein volunteers submitted entries under the categories of Dance, Music and Dramatics virtually, which would be compiled and reposted for the residents of Asare and Hombelaku - rehabilitation centres for specially challenged individuals and people with mental disorders, respectively, and also for nearby slums and orphanages of Udupi. To contribute to Nature, VSO has initiated a project, “Plant a sapling”, wherein student volunteers from various parts of India are encouraged to plant a sapling or a stem in their houses and contribute towards a greener earth. To instil the value of generosity in children, VSO has collaborated with Madhavakripa Schools, where the primary school children are encouraged to make Box of Happiness containing “7 days-7 items” to be sent to villages in rural India with the collaboration and support of Goonj.

09 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Abhimanyu, company have it easy||Dasara elephants led by Abhimanyu are having it easy though they are undergoing routine practice since the last few days within the palace premises and getting acclimatised to the urban environment. Unlike in the past, Dasara has been reduced to symbolism this year due to the pandemic and will be devoid of the 5-km-long procession in which the presence of the elephants was the top attraction. In all, 12 elephants used to camp in the city for 45 days ahead of the festivities and it was done to help them get acclimatised to the din and noise of the city. It was also an exercise to make the elephants familiar with the procession route. But this year’s event slated to take place from October 17 to 27 will be a simple affair and confined to the palace premises. So instead of the customary 12 elephants, only 5 elephants will participate and the procession will hardly cover around 400 metres to 500 metres. Hence the veterinarians have decided that a daily walk of 1.5 km around the palace premises was sufficient an exercise to keep the elephants fit instead of the regular walk of 10 km from the palace to Bannimantap and back which was the norm all these years. Abhimanyu began “weight training”’ and carried a sand bag weighing 350 kg on Thursday. The weight of the sand bag will gradually be increased over the next few days to match the 750 kg weight of the golden howdah which it will carry during the Vijayadashmi procession on October 27. Elephant Vikrama too will under go “weight training” from Friday and be a standby for Abhimanyu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/abhimanyu-company-have-it-easy/article32808886.ece
09 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Farmers oppose MUDA project||Farmers from Mysuru rural have expressed their ire over the proposed satellite township at Ballahalli on the outskirts of the city as it entails large-scale acquisition of agricultural land. The project was proposed by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) years ago and efforts are on to acquire nearly 500 acres of land at Ballahalli which is located about 6 km off the Outer Ring Road from Dattagalli in Mysuru West. The agitating farmers gathered outside the MUDA office on Thursday and raised slogans seeking abolition of the project. A section of the farmers alleged that the land registered in the name of the MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajiv at Ballahalli, has been kept out of the purview of the notification and termed it as a conspiracy. The farmers alleged that real-estate sharks were keen to create a land bank so as to sell it to investors in future and it was a conspiracy to divest the farmers of their property. But the MUDA authorities have stated that the Ballahalli satellite project does not entail outright purchase of land. Instead, farmers will be made partners in development and they will sign an agreement with the MUDA which will develop the land and sell 50 per cent of the sites to the public while the farmers will be free to sell the remaining 50 per cent of their share at the prevailing market rate in lieu of compensation. This arrangement, according to the MUDA, was beneficial to the farmers as they can sell the sites at a rate higher than a one-time cash payment awarded by way of compensation for land acquisition. For the MUDA, it will save enormous cost that is incurred towards land purchase. However, the farmers from the region are wary that they would not only be divested of their land but they will not come across suitable buyers at such far-flung areas. This will enable real-estate sharks to artificially depress the site value and procure it from them (farmers) at a lower rate. Members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene have also opposed the project on the grounds that acquisition of prime agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes will have a long-term bearing on food security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-oppose-muda-project/article32808890.ece
09 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Farm bills will boost farmers’ income: Sadananda Gowda||Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers and former Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Thursday said farmers can now sell their produce anywhere and to anybody in the country at the price of their wish with the passing of three bills on agriculture market reforms in accordance to the Centre’s vision of “one nation, one market for agriculture”. The larger idea is to double farmers’ income, he added. Speaking at a press conference here, the Minister said farmers can now sell produce from the field itself with all restrictions removed. If they wish, they can turn into entrepreneurs, carrying out direct marketing of their produce besides marketing their produce to food processing industries, private traders or directly to the consumers with no compulsions on them whatsoever. As per the laws, farmers can finalize the price of their produce well in advance by having an understanding with retail and wholesale traders; finished goods’ manufacturers; hotels and other interested parties. The bills overcome all uncertainties on the farm produce, he explained. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 were passed in Parliament recently. Lashing out at the Congress for misleading farmers on the Centre’s farm policies, Mr .Gowda said the Congress was not able to find any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the laws. Therefore, it is spreading lies and provoking farmers against the Centre. This is a ploy to defame the Narendra Modi government, he alleged. The former Chief Minister alleged that his party’s opponents were spreading rumours among farmers that the system of minimum support price (MSP) was being withdrawn. It is false and there also no plans in the future as well on the issue. Not just continuing the MSP, but the Centre is strengthening the concept of MSP in future. Henceforth, before the season commences, the MSP would be announced. The Minister for Agriculture has also clarified in Parliament on the continuation of MSP which has been reiterated by the Prime Minister. Mr. Gowda claimed that the new laws would bring price stability with farmers getting better opportunities for inter-state marketing of their produce. This will also result in expansion of the food processing industry, creating more jobs in the area. “The laws are aimed at revolutionising the farm sector,” he maintained. Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar and Mysuru MP Pratap Simha were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farm-bills-will-boost-farmers-income-sadananda-gowda/article32808888.ece
09 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Golden Chariot to be back on track from January||Karnataka’s luxury train Golden Chariot is set to chug from January 2021 to cater to travellers in anticipation of a revival of tourism by then. The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) is also toying with the idea of introducing a Christmas package provided the COVID-19 situation eases to a significant extent by December. The circuitous journey of the luxury train came to a grinding halt due to the pandemic in March 2020 and the rakes were grounded following suspension of all travel and tourism activities since then. But consequent to the graded unlocking, the KSTDC has announced the itinerary for the Golden Chariot starting from January. The itinerary comprises the Pride of Karnataka (six nights), Jewels of Deccan (six nights) and a 3-day package titled Glimpses of Karnataka. The destinations to be covered will include prominent places of tourist interest, including Mysuru, Kabini, Belur-Halebid, Hampi, Badami, Pattadakal, Aihole besides Goa. Kumar Pushkar, MD, KSTDC, said the bookings are open and the same can be done on the Golden Chariot website. “We have kept the options open to introduce a Christmas package in case the situation eases with respect to the pandemic,” he added. The itinerary of the Christmas package and the costs have not been worked out but it is likely that the same circuit will be marketed with minor modifications to cater to the domestic travellers. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Development Corporation (IRCTC) was vested with the task of refurbishing the interiors of the luxury train and they worked on it from January to March this year to complete the task ahead for the 2020 summer itinerary which was suspended due to the pandemic. So when the Golden Chariot chugs again in January, it will be akin to a brand new train with the interiors overhauled, said Mr. Pushkar. The new makeover and the interiors are said to befit taste of international train travel enthusiasts with new comfort features, including upholstered furniture, elegant drapery, renovated rooms and bathrooms, crockery and cutlery of reputed international brands and fresh linen apart from in-room entertainment with Wi-Fi enabled smart TVs in every cabin. The vestibules will also be changed to facilitate easy and safe movement of guests from their respective coaches to the restaurant, which will be in the middle of the rake. Also, the rakes which are stationed at Chickballapur will be moved to the Ashokapuram Railway Workshop in Mysuru for retrofitting of new suspensions and changing the vestibules. “The State government has already paid the railways for change of suspension and it will be completed by December,” Mr. Pushkar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/golden-chariot-to-be-back-on-track-from-january/article32808739.ece
09 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Active cases dip in 12 districts, continue to rise in most others||At least 12 districts in Karnataka have registered a dip in the number of active COVID-19 cases during the three-week period ending October 3, while most of the other districts in the State continued to see numbers rise. Even though the number of active cases in the State rose from 97,815 on September 12 to 1,12,783 on October 3, districts like Gadag, Davangere, Ballari, Belagavi, Yadgir, Bidar, Bagalkot, Mandya, Shivamogga, Koppal, Kalaburagi, and Haveri managed to drop their active caseload. While districts like Mysuru and Raichur almost flattened the active case growth curve by allowing only a marginal rise in their numbers, districts like Chamarajanagar, Chickballapur, Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Vijayapura, Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Uttara Kannada, Hassan, Bengaluru Urban, Chikkamagaluru, Ramanagaram, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Dharwad, and Udupi saw their active cases increase during the three-week period. The rate of decline in active cases was highest in Gadag district, which almost halved them from 1,177 to 616 during the study period, showing a negative growth rate of 47.7% followed by Davangere, which brought down the active cases from 2,557 to 1,494, indicating a negative growth rate of 41.6%. On the other hand, Chamarajanagar recorded the steepest Moving Growth Rate (MGR) of 215% in the State with its active cases increasing from 360 on September 12 to 1,134 on October 2. Chickballapur also recorded a high growth rate in terms of active cases with the numbers going up from 1,003 on September 12 to 1,949 on October 3, registering a MGR of 94.3%. Kodagu’s active cases during the period went up from 310 to 503, showing a MGR of 62.3%. In Bengaluru Urban, the number of active cases went up from 40,929 on September 12 to 53,292 on October 3, indicating a MGR of about 30% during the three-week period. Jeevan Raksha, an initiative by management consultant firm Proxima, which is studying COVID-19 trends across the country, noticed a trend of mixed performances among various districts in a State. Active growth case The number of active cases can go up when the patients are not recovering as fast as anticipated while the number of positive cases continue to mount, said convener of Jeevan Raksha, Mysore Sanjeev. “The active growth case reflects the quality of containment management of a particular district in a given point of time,” said Mr. Sanjeev. Districts with a Testing Positive Rate of 5% and above indicate a high spread of the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/active-cases-dip-in-12-districts-continue-to-rise-in-most-others/article32808713.ece

The workers of the youth wing shouted slogans against Trinamool Congress chief and Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee for the attack on Mr. Surya. “The goons of Trinamool Congress hurled petrol bombs on the rally led by Mr. Surya,” they said. “Ms. Banerjee used her party goons to attack the young MP from the State. But the party has enough strength to face such kind of attacks or any threats as it believes in the rights enshrined in the Constitution,” the protesters said. Later, they burnt an effigy of Ms. Banerjee at Subhash Chowk. District unit president of BJP Sharanabhupal Reddy and others participated in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-yuva-morcha-condemns-attack-on-tejaswi-surya-in-kolkata/article32808705.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Conservation initiative at Bandipur draws criticism from wildlife activists||The authorities in Bandipur have launched an initiative to create natural barriers and check-dams using dead wood and fallen trees for groundwater recharge apart from soil and moisture conservation. But the initiative has raised concern among wildlife activists on the grounds that it could alter the forest dynamics and the eco system besides increasing human-animal conflict on the periphery due to increase in wildlife density. The inititative is expected to ensure greater availability of water during peak summer besides reducing the quantum of combustible material in the national park which fuels forest fire. The Conservator of Forests and Director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, T. Balachandra, told The Hindu that they have identified undulating terrain and placed clumps of fallen trees and branches which act as a check against water run-off during the rainy season. Recharging These barriers help impound water which forms a shallow poor surrounding these natural barriers and facilitate percolation and recharge the groundwater table. This is the first such initiative in the State and logs of wood are collected and clumped together and placed across streams with the help of the camp elephants. ‘’We have used our department staff for the purpose and deployed the camp elephants to create this barriers using the available dead wood’’, said r. Balachandra. Nearly 500 such check-dams have been created across different ranges of Bandipur. “We receive rains till December and want to ensure that not a single drop of water is wasted’’, he added. Such check-dams have been created in Hediyala, Gundre, N.Begur, Ainur Marigudi and other forest ranges. The authorities say this has multiple benefits as it ensures greater availability of water for animals during summer and eliminates dead and dry wood which otherwise becomes highly combustible and fuels forest fires during summer. However, wildlife activists are not impressed and have pointed out that such interventions in protected areas is in contravention of the habitat management protocols. Bandipur already harbours a high density of animals and the authorities should allow for nature to balance the wildlife population. “Else the animals will spill over outside the buffer zone, escalating the conflict situation’’, said the activists. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also drew attention to habitat management with respect to national parks where the optimum tiger carrying capacity has been reached. It said in a communique that forest habitat intervention should be planned to minimise conflict outside and reduce “artificially induced internecine interactions among tigers’’. The NTCA said that excessive habitat interventions are being carried out without keeping in view the carrying capacity of the forests with respect to harbouring wildlife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conservation-initiative-at-bandipur-draws-criticism-from-wildlife-activists/article32808891.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Committee constituted to come up with action plan for Vrushabhavathi||After years of neglect, resulting in it being mistaken for a giant sewer, there is finally a plan for the highly polluted Vrushabhavathi river. A committee has been constituted by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to draw up an action plan for the Vrushabhavathi Valley (V-Valley). The KSPCB memorandum about the committee stated that there is a need to protect and conserve the Vrushabhavathi to “conserve the water source, ensure maintenance of micro climatic conditions, including temperature.” The committee will be headed by the KSPCB Member Secretary, and will include the president or representative of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), a waste water engineering expert nominated by the KSPCB Chairman, and Namami Vrushabhavathi Foundation’s Niveditha Sunkad. Vrushabhavathi Valley is one of the three major valleys in Bengaluru. The river flows south, joining the Arkavathi, a tributary of river Cauvery. The catchment of V-Valley is 170 sq.km. covering about 90 BBMP wards, the memorandum said. “V-Valley generates about 480 MLD of domestic sewage. Most of this is being discharged into the valley either in partially treated form or in untreated form. This has resulted in the pollution of Vrushabhavathi causing problems to the surrounding environment,” it added. Patrolling vehicles A KSPCB official said the first decision taken by the committee is the deployment of night patrolling vehicles. Teams of two marshals with vehicles have been deployed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. to identify culprits discharging effluents and dumping solid waste into the valley and report it to the Board. Illegal night discharge and dumping has been one of the biggest problems. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) too has raised the issue. The Hindu had recently reported about coloured water, suspected to be effluents from dyeing industries, being discharged into the lake. Residents living near the river said the next priority of the committee should be to look at polluting industries. “They need to identify polluters and bring in solutions instead of penalising them. From Hosakerehalli side and from Uttarahalli side, there are a lot of dyeing industries that are discharging effluents into the lake,” said a resident. Ms. Sunkad, who is on the committee, said constitution of the committee was a first step. “Solutions are there. It is just that the KSPCB has to do the bridging between solutions and industries,” she said. But questions are being raised about the composition of the committee. Some point out that external expertise comes in the form of an ‘invitee wastewater management expert’, and that there are no external scientists in the committee. Sharachchandra Lele, Distinguished Fellow in Environmental Policy and Governance of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology, which has carried out studies on the river, said it is important for the committee to understand the problem thoroughly – both about the industrial and the domestic pollution – by consulting those who have researched the river. “They should hold a public hearing process to determine what should be the use and therefore what should be the water quality goal for the river, how domestic sewage will be tackled because the main problem lies in lack of connectivity with the sewer system or lack of STPs, and determine the main roadblocks to controlling industrial pollution. They should involve the polluting industries as well as common citizens in solving the problem,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/committee-constituted-to-come-up-with-action-plan-for-vrushabhavathi/article32809139.ece

Yediyurappa on Thursday instructed officials of 10 districts to conduct more tests and track primary and secondary contacts to contain the spread and mortality rates. The virtual meeting with the Deputy Commissioners, chief executive officers, superintendent of police, and district health officers of the 10 districts assumed significance in the wake of the forthcoming Dasara festivities and byelections to two legislative Assembly and four Council seats in the State. In the presence of Cabinet colleagues, the Chief Minister held a videoconference with the officials at his home officer ‘Krishna’, and directed the district administration to adopt a target-oriented approach to detect COVID-19 cases to provide treatment on time. The meeting did not discuss reopening of schools and colleges, said one Deputy Commissioner. The State government has not taken a decision on reopening of schools and colleges in the State, though the Central guidelines left it to the discretion of States to take a decision after October 15. Top district officials of Ballari, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Dharwad, Belagavi, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Tumakuru, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada attended the meeting. Mr. Yediyurappa instructed officials to intensify RT-PCR tests and reduce the number of rapid antigen tests. On the rise in the number of deaths in some districts such as Dharwad, he told officials to conduct death audits as most of the deaths occurred after 72 hours of the patients’ admission to hospitals. Over 50% of COVID-19 deaths occurred within 72 hours of hospital admission, he said.  With a surge in cases in the Mysuru district, the Chief Minister informed the district administration to conduct more virtual programmes to contain the pandemic. The district administration has been told to submit a report on the present status of the pandemic and precautionary steps taken. A large number of tourists visit Mysuru during Dasara. On the awareness drive, Mr. Yediyurappa said maintaining social distance, wearing masks, and using sanitisers are only measures available now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yediyurappa-instructs-officials-in-high-incidence-districts-to-intensify-covid-19-testing-tracking/article32808715.ece

The research was recently published in Cancer Reports , an international peer-reviewed journal. Skin cancer, the most common kind of cancer, is caused mainly due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. Common treatments for skin cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A team of researchers led by Kaushik Suneet and Shilpee Jain from the Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering (BSSE) and the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics (MRDG) at IISc. have developed the bandage with a unique blend of magnetic nanoparticles fabricated using a method called electrospinning. It comprises nanoparticles made from an oxide of iron, Fe3O4, and a biodegradable polymer called polycaprolactone (PCL) pasted on a surgical tape. The magnetic material generates heat when it is subjected to a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field. In order to investigate whether the heat generated and dissipated by the magnetic bandage can treat skin cancer, the researchers did two experiments: one in vitro – on human cancer cell lines – and the other in vivo – on mice with artificially-induced skin cancer. In both experiments, the heat generated by applying AMF to the nanofibrous magnetic bandage killed the cancer cells successfully. Moreover, in the in vivo experiment, the healthy tissue remained intact with no signs of burns, inflammation, or thickening, said Mr. Suneet. “The elevated temperature at the treatment site enables heat to penetrate the tumour cells, rupturing the compact random vasculatures (network of blood vessels) of the tumours,” explained Ms. Jain, who was a DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellow at BSSE when the study was conducted. “In contrast, the normal healthy cells, owing to their organised open vasculatures, dissipate the heat to maintain normal temperatures, and so remain unharmed,” she said. Although this novel treatment has been shown to be effective against skin cancer in lab experiments, it is still at a nascent stage of development as a clinical therapy. “Further studies are required to test the efficacy on a larger scale before employing it for pre-clinical and clinical applications,” she cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iisc-researchers-develop-bandage-to-treat-skin-cancer/article32809143.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by S. Arunachalam, a resident of Amruthnagar. The BDA Commissioner had issued these instructions in his communication dated July 8, 2020. Pointing out that no provision of any law has been referred by the Commissioner to exercise the power to issue such a direction, the bench said that prima facie, the Commissioner’s decision interferes in investigation conducted by agencies like the ACB and the BMTF. Observing that the BDA Commissioner, prima facie has no power to interfere in the investigation conducted by these agencies, the bench cautioned the BDA of serious action if no law officer represented the authority during next date of hearing on November 10 as the BDA has not responded to the court’s notice and queries made during the hearing on September 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-stays-bda-order-telling-staff-not-to-attend-acb-probes/article32809142.ece

The only exception is a 14.5 acres of land at Veeyapuram, a proposed reserve forest, which is home to a small number of plant and animal species and a few private forests in small tracts of land. But things are changing. The Alappuzha municipal area sandwiched between the Arabian sea and Vembanad Lake is set to host a mini-forest in the near future. The Kerala Development and Innovation Strategy Council (K-DISC) has joined hands with a consortium involving Thiruvananthapuram-based Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation, Culture Shoppe and Invis Multimedia to create a forest on 20 cents of land on the premises of the Port Museum, which is being set up as part of the Heritage Project, using the Miyawaki method. 3,200 saplings As part of creating the mini-forest, 3,200 saplings of 100 species will be planted there. “Our aim is to reinstate the green cover where there is a deficiency of it. Using this model of intense foresting will increase biodiversity and create an ecosystem. Planting operations are in progress and in three years it will take the shape of a dense forest,” says Hari Prabhakaran, Director, Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation. Indigenous species Majority of the saplings being planted are of indigenous species. They include medicinal and fruit-bearing plants. Apart from supporting local wildlife, the mini-forest will help in sequestration of carbon. Miyawaki is a technique introduced by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki that revolutionised urban afforestation by creating dense and native forests. It involves planting several native species in a small area and making it a self-sustaining green space in three to four years. The K-DISC is funding the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-mini-forest-coming-up-in-the-venice-of-the-east/article32808841.ece

Paul has demolished two illegal constructions in the catchment area of the Anayirangal dam, near Munnar, by private individuals. About 25 cents had been found encroached upon and constructions done there. Udumbanchola tahsildar Niju Kurian directed the village officer to take action and the team demolished one building completely and another partially. It was found that B.L. Ram residents Selvaraj and Mukesh Sivadasan had constructed the buildings encroaching on the catchment area under the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). When a group of people assembled there opposing the demolition, the revenue team returned and gave a report to the tahsildar. The report was given to the KSEB and a reply is expected to initiate further action, Mr. Kurien said. A copy of the report was also given to the District Collector. For constructions in Devikulam taluk, no-objection certificate from the revenue authority is mandatory as per a High Court order. The buildings were on the catchment area and without the NOC. 110 houses A revenue official said nearly 110 houses were in the catchment area under the KSEB. An inquiry found that almost all houses had house number and electricity connection. In the absence of follow-up action by the KSEB, there would be chances of further encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-illegal-buildings-in-dam-area-demolished/article32808821.ece

As many as four granite quarries were functioning in various parts of the panchayat and most of the quarries were functioning by flouting the norms set by the Mining and Geology Department, P. Kunjahammed, chairman of an action committee of villagers, said. A quarry unit in ward 9 was functioning in a human habitation and the explosions from the quarry were posing a severe threat to normal life, he said. Around 100 families live in the area and the working of the quarry unit had upset their lives. Many houses and wells in the area were damaged by the vibrations caused by the loud explosions, he said. The indiscriminate quarrying had adversely affected the natural water sources such as springs and streams in the area, K. Damodaran Kuruppu, convenor of the organisation, said. The movement of heavy vehicles to transport large granite boulders had damaged the roads too, he said. Though the quarry owners were directed to alert the villagers before explosions by sounding sirens, they were yet to obey it, he said. Now, the quarry owners were competing to exploit maximum resources within the given period by using heavy machinery such as excavators, rock-breakers, and compressors, he said. Though many complaints were submitted to officials concerned, they were yet to adopt any measures to address the issues, he said. They warned the authorities that if the grama panchayat did not cancel the licence given to the quarries, the people would launch an indefinite agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/villagers-threaten-to-launch-stir-against-quarrying-in-vengapally/article32808751.ece

09 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||PCB to go after Periyar polluters||The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) is planning to inspect and collect data from industrial units and other establishments on the banks of the Periyar found contributing to its pollution. The initiative is part of follow-up measures being taken after the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the government and the board to come up with a plan to save the river from pollution. The tribunal had recommended fixing environmental compensation on erring units and establishments responsible for the pollution of the Periyar in an order issued on August 19. Inspection schedule A meeting of senior board officials held in Thiruvananthapuram decided to draw up a schedule for inspecting the industrial units. The board will also inspect establishments located on the banks of the river functioning in violation of the Environment Protection Act and the Water Act. The inspection is expected to reveal the lack of effluent and sewage treatment plants in most of these units, resulting in pollution of the State’s longest river. The Southern Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had pointed out that the board’s report on the Periyar submitted on August 17 was only general in nature without specific comments on the report prepared by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management appointed by the tribunal. SLMC report “There is no reference to the report submitted by the SLMC, and what is the proposed action that they are going to take on the basis of the suggestions given by the SLMC to prevent pollution from being caused to the Periyar,” it asked. The counsel for the board had assured the tribunal that it would come up with a detailed report on the action taken against each erring unit along the stretch of the Periyar. However, senior board officials expressed doubts on whether the inspection report could be submitted before the next hearing of the tribunal scheduled for November 5, as the process of data collection and industry visit was time-consuming. The board had informed the tribunal that a few units on the river bank had violated the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-to-go-after-periyar-polluters/article32808755.ece
09 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||YouTube video unveils elephant trade||Boasting about trading 200 elephants in a YouTube video has landed a self-styled elephant trader of Kollam in trouble with the Forest Department booking cases against him for illegal transport and sale of elephants and taking his 15 elephants into custody. Five cases have been booked against V. Shaji of Kaveri Puthenkulam, Kollam; K.S. Rashmi, Kollam; Shinu of Mavelikara; Manish Nath, Kollam; and a few others for illegally trading 15 captive elephants. The accused have been booked for illegally transporting the elephants from other States, keeping the animals without valid documents and trading them. The relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Captive Elephant Management Rules have been invoked against them, the officials said. The department swung into action last month after the video, Puthenkulam Kaveri Park, in which Shaji stated that he had brought nearly 200 elephants from Assam, Bihar and Andaman and traded them in Kerala, went viral. He claimed to have purchased the elephants, Modi, Lakshmi, Anadapadmanabhan and Rao among others, and brought them to the park. The preliminary verification of documents indicated that the elephants, which were in the names of others, were in the custody of Shaji, said officials. Special team formed A special team with over 100 persons was formed and searches were carried out in Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Mavelikara. The key accused could not be arrested as he went into hiding. Even though the team had plans to take the possession of the animals, the idea was later dropped and the elephants were left with its keepers after recording its custody. In another incident, two cases were booked against A.V. Prasanth of Manikandeswaram, Peroorkada, for the illegal trade of elephants. He was arraigned as the first accused in both the First Information Reports filed by the Forest Department at the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1, Nedumangad. In the first case, Prasanth has been made the accused for illegally bringing an elephant from Uttar Pradesh in violation of the provisions of the Act and Rule and forging documents. In the second case, besides Prasanth, Bency Shaji, Praveen and Sreejith have been arraigned as the accused. The case is that Shaji sold the elephant to Praveen. The animal was then sold to Sreejith from whom Prasanth bought it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youtube-video-unveils-elephant-trade/article32808868.ece

While the worst maintained roads are in West Kochi, the situation in the city is in no way better. Faced with public fury over the deplorable condition of the Kundannur-Maradu-Pettah Road on NH 85, the PWD (NH Wing) has begun repair work and resurfacing in the busy corridor. “Vulnerable portions are being surfaced using concrete paver blocks, while the rest of the road will be resurfaced with bituminous macadam bituminous concrete [BMBC],” said a PWD official. The inordinate delay in resurfacing the stretch has resulted in shops, other establishments, and vehicles getting thickly coated with dust, since hundreds of container and tanker lorries jostle for space with smaller vehicles along the corridor every day, said Shamier Abdulla, social activist. The recently launched anti-corruption people’s movement, V4 Kochi, too had expressed shock at the dismal condition of city roads. Over the past two years, motorists have been demanding that the PWD (NH Wing) repair the pothole-ridden service roads of the Kundannur flyover. The agency attended to a few gaping potholes within a day of outrage in social media about the shoddy state of the service roads and the NH stretch on the northern side of the flyover. Damaged bridges The PWD (Bridges Wing) is under fire for the deplorable condition of the Harbour Bridge that links Thopumpady with Willingdon Island. Gaping potholes dot the bridge’s central portion and either end. The PWD has also not repaired the severely potholed road linking Mattancherry BOT bridge with the Cochin Port. Similarly, the Bridges Wing is facing flak for concrete giving away at several places on Venduruthy bridge. The most vulnerable are two-wheeler riders who are caught off guard by potholes atop the bridge which was commissioned a decade ago. Sources in the PWD (Roads Wing) said Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) was engaged in upgrading many arterial roads it owned. “They [CSML] have assured that potholes on Park Avenue Road and Banerjee Road will be repaired within a week. We will shortly repair potholes on MG Road and Civil Line Road. The stretch from the international stadium up to Kacheripady is being resurfaced,” they added. Meanwhile, patch work is over at Panampilly Nagar, while resurfacing will be done during dry weather. The Vennala-Arakkakadavu Road and Vennala-Alinchuvadu Road are being repaired. Officials of the Kochi Corporation cited the ongoing strike by a section of contractors who are seeking clearing of long-pending dues, as a reason for the shoddy condition of many side roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/commuters-struggle-with-poorly-maintained-roads/article32809275.ece
09 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Waste-to-energy projects reek of corruption: Cong.||The State government’s decision to entrust private stakeholders with the task of establishing and operating waste-to-energy (WTE) plants in eight districts and its move to name the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) as the nodal agency and change the terms and conditions of the contract reek of corruption, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary and former Mayor Tony Chammany has said. Expensive affair Going ahead with the decision will result in civic agencies having to spend more than double the funds being spent now, on garbage treatment. This is because the firm that is chosen will presently have to be given over Rs. 3,500 per tonne of waste it collects. This is more than double the rate prevailing now. It will result in the firm getting Rs. 4,500 crore from the Kochi cluster (Kochi Corporation and neighbouring municipalities) alone as tipping fee, Mr. Chammany said. Moreover, the terms and conditions of the agreement were changed to suit the interests of private firms. ‘Violation of norms’ The Union government’s solid waste management rules say that garbage treatment is the responsibility of local bodies. The decision to have KSIDC, an agency entrusted with promoting industrial development, as the nodal agency is a violation of the condition. A New Delhi-based consultant without proven expertise in the field was appointed sans transparent tender process. A 10-member advisory committee had earlier fixed the norm that the tender would be awarded to the firm which produced energy at the cheapest rate. This condition was later changed to “the firm which transported garbage at the lowest rate.” It will result in firms not adhering to their responsibility of treating garbage and generating electricity from it, Mr. Chammany said. The former Mayor alleged that a senior government official who had recently retired from service had been masterminding the entire episode, which would result in private firms unduly benefiting from the agreement, at a huge cost to the local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/waste-to-energy-projects-reek-of-corruption-cong/article32809267.ece
09 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Corporation under fire for ‘failure to protect assets’||The civic administration of Kochi has come under fire for failure to protect its assets. Pointing to the attachment of the new office complex of the Kochi Corporation and the nearly 1.50-acre holding in which the building is coming up, in a civil dispute, LDF councillors alleged that the civic body had lost several of its valuable assets owing to the lackadaisical attitude of the administrators. A civil court in Ernakulam had issued the attachment order on an execution petition filed by the Palace Administration Board of the Kochi Palace from which the Kochi Corporation had acquired the holding in 1989. Compensation The Kerala High Court had issued an order in 2011, directing the civic body to pay a compensation of Rs. 1.85 lakh per acre, as the original compensation fixed for the land was adjudged as inadequate. However, the corporation failed to pay the compensation and present its case in the court, according to the lawyer of the board. The case has been posted for October 14. It was the inept handling of the case and related affairs that culminated in the attachment order, said LDF leaders K.J. Antony and V.P. Chandran, in a joint statement. The LDF councillors alleged that the lawyers of the corporation did not turn up in court while the case was being considered. The civic body also failed to send responsible officials to attend the mediation process. The failure of the corporation to effectively handle such cases has culminated in a huge liability, they said. The corporation is liable to pay a huge amount as compensation for land acquisition for Brahmapuram, Sahodaran Ayyappan Road, Atlantis overbridge, and the Thammanam-Pullepady road. Besides the compensation component, the civic body also has to pay an interest of around 15% in most cases. The delay in clearing the payment is adding to the financial liability of the corporation, they said. The LDF leaders said the civic body had failed to initiate steps to protect its 16-cent holding on M.G. Road despite the corporation council directing it to act, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporation-under-fire-for-failure-to-protect-assets/article32809271.ece
09 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Container lorries may be regulated on NH Bypass||The movement of container lorries through the congested Kundannur-Edappally NH Bypass may be regulated from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., foreseeing the additional influx of vehicles when the six-lane flyovers are opened at Vyttila and Kundannur in a month. The ongoing reconstruction of the Palarivattom flyover and the impending barricading of more areas at the junction could create traffic hold-ups at the junction. Taking container lorries off the National Highway Bypass will considerably decongest junctions on the NH Bypass, especially Palarivattom and Edappally, said sources in the city traffic police. Careless parking The curbs on movement of container lorries can be introduced if the District Collector prohibits their movement through the stretch from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Apart from decongesting the NH Bypass, it will also lessen illegal and haphazard parking of lorries on Container Road, they added. The Collector heads both the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and the District Road Safety Authority. Ro-ro ready The alternative method to transport containers the cost-effective and environment-friendly way is to resume their transit in lorries on the waterway route from Willingdon Island to Bolghatty Island. While lorries have to travel over 40 km through congested roads, the waterway is less than 3 km long. In order to facilitate the plan, the Cochin Shipyard had recently built a pair of roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels for the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). The Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) is expected to operate the vessels. Time-saver The turnaround time per trip for ro-ro vessels is one hour, while it is more than double through the road route. A private firm withdrew a ro-ro vessel it had operated on the stretch in 2017, mainly because of differences of opinion with the Cochin Port Trust over caution deposit. Moreover, the vessel needed a draft of 2.5 metres, while the waterway fell short of that in many places, official sources said. MoU awaited A draft of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between IWAI and KSINC is awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Shipping. The tariff per lorry and other aspects too have to be finalised. KSINC will host a webinar in a week, to take container lorry operators and other stakeholders into confidence. It is estimated that around 800 container-laden lorries are using the route every day.  The two ro-ro vessels can operate in a feasible manner if they carry at least 300 of these lorries, although they have much higher capacity. Each vessel can carry up to 15 lorries and need a draft of only 2 metres, they added. KSINC has readied crew and other infrastructure for the vessels, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/container-lorries-may-be-regulated-on-nh-bypass/article32809276.ece

The Ministry notified an area varying from zero to 1 km around the boundary of the sanctuary as the ESZ, which would cover the holdings of Southern Railway, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, and the Greater Cochin Development Authority. The holdings of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Cochin Port Trust, the sub-station of the Kerala State Electricity Board, Pandit Karuppan memorial, and Asmara, LMCC Convent, and other private lands too come under the ESZ of the sanctuary, which is located within the city, according to the notification. However, the conversion of agricultural and other lands has been permitted to meet the residential needs of the local residents. The conversion shall be allowed for widening and strengthening the existing roads and construction of new roads, construction and renovation of infrastructure and civic amenities, non-polluting small-scale and cottage industries including village industries, the notification said. Convenience stores and local amenities supporting eco-tourism, including home-stays can also be set up in the area, it said. The notification empowers the State government to prepare a Zonal Master Plan (ZMP) within two years. The ZMP should provide for the restoration of denuded areas, conservation of existing water bodies, management of catchment areas, watershed and groundwater management. Soil and moisture conservation, needs of the local community and such other aspects of the ecology and environment that need attention should feature in the ZMP, it was suggested. The Ministry suggested that all existing places of worship, villages and urban settlements, forests, agricultural areas, fertile land, green areas such as parks, horticultural areas, orchards, and waterbodies with supporting maps and giving details of the existing and proposed land use features be demarcated in the plan. The ZMP should be prepared in consultation with local people and the State government, the notification said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/conversion-of-land-around-mangalavanam-banned/article32808749.ece

SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai had visited a few of these sources to ascertain the extent of pollution, as he was not satisfied with the response of the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) on the violations. A drainage with little idea about its origin was found at the rear side of a bonemeal unit at Edayar. It was filled with septic waste, sewage, and other effluents and was suspected to be leading to the upstream of the river. A pipe was seen near the irrigation canal connecting the river and Chakkarachal paddy field. Its mouth was found opening into the river. Reddish and orange coloured thick water was seen flowing into the river through the pipe, said the SLMC report which was filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “Here it is relevant to note that at the other end of the paddy field, no source of water was seen flowing through this pipe. The intelligent deduction that can be made here is that underground pipes are laid starting from some industrial units, which ultimately discharge industrial waste illegally to the river through this pipeline. However, correlation is required through further investigation,” it added. The SLMC chief found a drainage near another bonemeal unit. Local residents informed him that septic and sewage effluents were often pumped into the drain, and they ultimately reached the river. Many complaints An illegal drainage was also found for alleged dumping of waste from a steel recycling unit. The committee received complaints from local residents about a lorry that was found dumping untreated effluents into the river. A pump set and hose were seen near the waterbody. The vehicle was seized by the police from the premises of a fish and chicken meal manufacturing unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slmc-track-drains-pipelines/article32808756.ece

09 October 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||Village tourism project at Munroe Thuruthu||Munroe Thuruthu is all set to witness a big leap in tourism with a village tourism project launched by Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran on Thursday. A boat jetty at Arinallur, houseboat terminal near Kannankattu bridge, and five footbridges will be constructed as part of the project, which also includes a lake view shelter and landing facility. “The tourism sector in Kollam has been seeing some good tidings with projects such as Jatayu Earth’s Centre, Thenmala ecotourism, and Meenpidi Para. By uplifting places such as Munroe Thuruthu, the government plans to promote rural development through tourism,” said Mr. Surendran, inaugurating the project via videoconferencing. The village tourism project will be implemented in an environment-friendly manner without harming the wetland ecosystem. The Rs. 3-crore project aims to tap the tourism potential of the place while protecting the livelihood of the residents. “With the completion of the project, tourists will be able to arrive directly at the Karuthrakadavu terminal. The new facilities will attract large number of tourists to the island,” added the Minister. Kovoor Kunjumon, MLA, who presided over the function, said various projects being implemented in Munroe Thuruthu would place the island on world tourism map. “Munore Thuruthu is a destination with great possibilities,” he said. The District Tourism Promotion Council had been offering special packages to the island, an important tourist spot in the district frequented by both domestic and foreign travellers. Tourism Director P.Bala Kiran presented a report while Munroe Thuruthu grama panchayat president Binu Karunakaran, vice president Manju Sunidharan, Chittumala block panchayat president P.

The plant was set up as an emergency measure with the usage of ventilators and oxygen going up due to the COVID-19 situation. “The plant was installed within seven days to ensure the availability of oxygen in the hospital to treat COVID-19 cases and other patients,” said a note issued by the office of Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. The hospital had a unit that could dispatch 300 cylinders, but the new plant was set up to fulfil the extra oxygen demand due to the surge in patients. The plant can store 300 KLD of liquid oxygen. It also has a provision to control and prevent the loss of oxygen, making it more beneficial to patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-mch-gets-oxygen-plant/article32808829.ece
09 October 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||CPI, NCP reluctant to hand over seats||In what could be a major hurdle in the proposed induction of the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani into the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the district leadership of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday revealed their disinclination to give up any seats in their possession to the regional party. While the NCP held that it would not give up the Pala Assembly constituency, long regarded as a bastion of the Mani group, the CPI was more explicit in its opposition to the proposed induction by stating that the regional party’s entry was not going to make any difference. “There is no question of giving up Pala, Kuttanad or any of our seats to anyone for anything. This is a decision taken by none other than the party president Sharad Pawar,” said Mani C. Kappan, the NCP legislator from Pala. Mr. Kappan’s response comes amidst reports about the Mani faction holding discussions with the LDF leaders, including its convener, and looking to swap its Rajya Sabha seat with the NCP for Pala constituency. No formal discussion “The coalition is yet to initiate any formal discussion on the induction of the Mani group. As a key constituent of the LDF, we have welcomed the entry of a new partner but it should not come at a cost,” he added. The CPI district leadership, on the other hand, maintains that the existing political situation does not warrant the entry of the Mani group into the LDF. Having held elaborate discussions on the proposed association with the Mani group in the various party forums, the CPI district leadership has reported the feedback of workers from the local level to the State leadership. Pro-UDF vote base “The Mani group has a pro-UDF vote base, which is unlikely to come in favour of the LDF,” C.K. Sasidharan, CPI district secretary told mediapersons here on Thursday. On the occasion, he also expressed the party’s unwillingness to hand over any of its sitting seats in the district to the Mani group. The statements by the NCP and the CPI leadership assume significance particularly in the wake of a scheduled steering committee meeting of the KC(M) Mani group to be held on Friday. According to sources, pressure is mounting on the KC(M) leadership to take a political decision at the earliest in view of the upcoming local body elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpi-ncp-reluctant-to-hand-over-seats/article32808822.ece

09 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Post-COVID disorder likely in kids||The surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks in the State has left open the possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children, a rare disorder that involves constant fever and extreme inflammation resulting from exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Public health experts point out that the disease has been found in children in countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. and States such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra around four weeks after the caseload peaked there. K.K. Purushothaman, professor of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Thrissur, told The Hindu on Thursday that like adults, a large majority of children too could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Unless tested properly, its presence would not be revealed. “Earlier, the number of cases was comparatively low. However, the reported caseload has now reached over 2.5 lakh in Kerala. There could be undetected infections too, may be one-third of our total population is already infected. In such a scenario, there is a possibility of children, so far protected owing to their confinement at homes, getting affected,” he said. It might not manifest now itself, but a couple of weeks later, as seen in the U.S. and the U.K., Dr. Purushothaman said. “The infection may show up in the form of either symptoms or other problems among adults in the first phase. Only in the second phase does it lead to a dip in oxygen levels in blood , hypoxia, and other complications. Among children, there may not be a first phase of infection as most of them are asymptomatic and they may directly enter the second phase,” he noted. Different symptoms The symptoms seen in children during this period too are markedly different from adults. “They may have acute abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or vomiting. Skin lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, strawberry tongue, and swollen hands and feet could show up,” he said. A study conducted between May 1 and July 15 in select hospitals in Mumbai revealed 23 cases and one death. Similar research done by the Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, led to the discovery of 19 such cases between May 4 and July 8. It is learnt that a few hospitals in Chennai are now reporting at least one or two cases every day. “This syndrome, however, can be treated if detected early. Doctors should be alert if they notice the symptoms. All government medical college hospitals have the facilities. Health professionals and associations such as the Indian Medical Association and Indian Academy of Paediatrics should create awareness about it,” Dr. Purushothaman added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/post-covid-disorder-likely-in-kids/article32808863.ece
09 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Jal Jeevan to cover all panchayats in Kunnamangalam constituency||The Jal Jeevan rural water supply project for the State launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday will cover all the grama panchayats of Kunnamangalam assembly constituency in Kozhikode district. Administrative sanction has already been given to shortlisted projects worth Rs. 55 crore for implementation in the first phase itself. The highest amount of Rs. 21 crore will be spent for providing 8,400 domestic water supply connections in the remote areas of Olavanna panchayat. The second highest allocation of Rs. 14 crore is for Peruvayal panchayat, where 4,000 connections will be given. Kunnamangalam, Chathamangalam, Mavoor and Perumanna are the other panchayats that will directly benefit from the project. At the constituency-level launch of the scheme on Thursday, officials said the project to be implemented with the Central government support would provide 22, 955 new water connections. It would give higher priority to backward communities and settlements, and would be implemented by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) and the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (Jalanidhi), they said. According to project coordinators, the mission-mode project would strive to improve rural water supply schemes by facilitating 21.42 lakh new domestic connections across the State in the first phase itself. It would reach out to 716 panchayats in Kerala in such a way to cover all the shortlisted beneficiaries by 2024, they said. KIIFB fund The strengthening of some of the existing water supply schemes, and the development of potable water sources in rural areas too would be part of the Jal Jeevan Mission. To support it, some of such projects would be completed under the development schemes of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) . Koyilandy drinking water project would be one of such major schemes to be completed using the KIIFB fund. KWA officials said there would be separate panchayat-level and State-level committees for the thorough monitoring of the project implementation. For the public, project details and its execution status would be made available on a portal for review, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jal-jeevan-to-cover-all-panchayats-in-kunnamangalam-constituency/article32808747.ece
09 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Traders, farmers hit hard by erratic lockdowns||Erratic Sunday lockdowns and illogically imposed containment zones in and around the city in the wake of the COVID-19 spread have irked not only traders but also farmers in Kozhikode district. The closure of the Agricultural Urban Wholesale Market at Vengeri due to the rising COVID-19 cases has put the farmers of Kozhikode and Malappuram districts into hardship. “Those who reached the markets on Mondays and Thursdays to auction vegetables are now unable to sell their produce. We are awaiting an order for reopening the markets now,” Narayanan Kalpakassery, chairman of Sangha Maithri, an apex body of farmers’ forums, and convener of the auction committee, said, adding that farmers had been facing a harrowing time due to the recurrent lockdowns from April. More than a dozen traders and headload workers at the Vengeri market had tested positive last week. A major factor leading to the present situation was allowing traders from the Palayam market to merchandise after it was closed due to COVID-19 spread, according to many. The district administration has been drawing flak for unscientifically closing and reopening markets and the commercial streets in the city. “The objectives of the administration in shifting the goalposts are ambiguous. One day it closed down SM Street and its adjoining areas and allowed other commercial streets to function. Similar is the case with the Palayam and Central markets. Daily wage earners have no means of livelihood,” Velayudhan, a worker, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-farmers-hit-hard-by-erratic-lockdowns/article32808759.ece
09 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Call for ‘generational shift’ in IUML||There may be no clamour in the youth wing of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) for more representation in the legislative spheres. But strong sentiments within the Muslim Youth League (MYL) against the party leadership's reluctance to set in motion the 'much needed generational shift' in the party are likely to be articulated more strongly now. IUML MLA K.M. Shaji's recent appeal for more representation for party youth leaders in the Assembly and Parliament reflects those sentiments. The MLA has publicly pitched for the youth leadership of the party. More youth representation in legislative bodies would bring in fresh views and opinions, he said. MLAs plea He urged the leadership to extend the three-term limit set for party candidates in local body elections to party leaders contesting in Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “Fresh views and thoughts are indispensable for a democratic system to be energetic and without the presence of youth leaders who are better informed on issues concerning education and entrepreneurship, legislative discussions risk being run off the mill,” Mr. Shaji told The Hindu when contacted on Thursday. Mr. Shaji’s call, according to IUML circles, will kick off debates within the party and is likely to serve as an impetus to the MYL to mount pressure on the party leadership to field more youth leaders in the next Assembly elections. A section of the MYL leadership feels that the Congress has ensured adequate representation to young faces in the Assembly. The MLA is seen as giving voice to the resentment among MYL leaders. The feeling within the youth wing is that even those who had ascended to the top rung on the party ladder after their election to legislative bodies during their young age are not prepared to offer the same electoral prospects to young leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-generational-shift-in-iuml/article32808866.ece

The youth wing of the merchant’s association resorted to the hunger stir alleging that revenue and police officials were forcibly closing shops in containment zones without giving any logical explanation. They also accused officials of taking unilateral decisions. KVVES State president T. Nazeerudheen,who opened the protest, alleged that the ‘unscientific classification’ of containment zones without discussing any safety arrangement with traders was troubling thousands of hapless traders who had been struggling to overcome financial blues. Youth wing leaders who took part in the strike said the alleged flaws in the declaration of containment zones were badly affecting the lives of many daily wage workers. Merchants’ demand The issues were also placed before the District Collector during a conciliation talk in the evening. KVVES leaders who took part in the meeting said their request to consider the presence of merchant organisation leaders also while fixing containment areas was duly considered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/indefinite-strike-by-traders-called-off/article32808761.ece

The government has entered into agreements with the managements on the fee structure and seat allotment. The Kerala Self-Financing Engineering College Managements Association (KSFECMA) and Kerala Catholic Engineering College Managements Association (KCECMA), which represents 90 and 14 private engineering colleges respectively, have inked the deals with the government. Retaining the existing seat matrix, the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE) will allot students to 50% of the seats in the colleges on the basis of a rank list prepared on the basis of merit and reservation guidelines. Of the remaining seats, 35% (out of 50%) will be filled by the managements (under the management quota) with students who figure on the KEAM/JEE entrance list. The remaining 15% can be filled under the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quota. Two groups At colleges functioning under the KSFECMA, the seats filled up by the CEE are further divided into two — lower-income group and others. The annual tuition fee for both the groups will be Rs. 50,000 each while the latter will incur an annual special fee of Rs. 25,000. An annual tuition fee of up to Rs. 99,000 and Rs. 1.5 lakh will be charged from students who secure admission under the management and NRI quotas respectively. These groups will be required to pay an annual special fee of Rs. 25,000, besides an interest-free refundable deposit of Rs. 1.5 lakh. While an annual fee of Rs. 75,000 will be charged by the KCECMA-aligned institutions, students except those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Eligible Communities (OEC) or fishermen community, will be required to make an interest-free refundable deposit of Rs. 1 lakh. Students admitted under the NRI quota will have to remit up to $7,000 in addition to the fee payable by other candidates. However, they will not be required to pay the refundable sum.

While allotments will be completed by the CEE by October 31, the students will have to join their allotted colleges by November 4. The Architecture College Management Association (ACMA), a collective of 27 private architecture college managements, will adhere to a similar seat matrix.

The case graph fell from 1,182 which was the highest single-day spike to be reported in the district. Notably, the testing also fell with 6,514 people subjected to tests during the last 24 hours. As many as 7,520 people had been tested the previous day. However, health authorities were yet to conclude whether the slump in cases could be attributed to the fall in testing alone. While the district authorities have stated that 349 people acquired the infection through local transmission, they were yet to trace the source of infection in 98 other cases. Fifteen health workers have also been diagnosed with the disease. Nine more deaths The death toll rose to 281 with nine more deaths that were reported in the district recently being attributed to the disease. The deceased include natives of Pachalloor (60-year-old), Vallamvettikonam (45), Plavilakkonam (58), Mariyapuram (61), Vizhinjam (36), Santhivila (58), Nalandanada (68) and Palayam (60). The health authorities were yet to identify the native place of a 72-year-old man whose death has been included in the district’s death toll. Among those who tested positive, there were 135 persons aged above 60 years and 47 children aged below 15 years. The district placed 3,337 people under quarantine on the day. With this, the total number of people being monitored as part of the COVID-19 containment efforts has gone up to 31,100. Bringing much relief, 1,520 people recovered from the illness on the day, thereby bringing the number of active cases in the district down to 11,800. Police officers infected Four officers attached to the Museum police station tested positive on Thursday. With this, the number of police personnel who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the station within a few days as gone up to 24. While the remaining staff of around 35 personnel will be subjected to tests on Friday, the City police is likely to disinfect the premises and deploy officers from other stations until those infected recover from their illnesses. The headquarters of the Attingal municipality has been closed for three days after a clerk in its revenue section tested positive. While the municipal authorities initially planned to confine restrictions to the wing alone, it was later decided to shut the office entirely. It will resume functioning on October 12. 274 booked Meanwhile, the Thiruvananthapuram City police continued its crackdown on violation of the COVID-19 protocol. As many as 274 people were booked for flouting guidelines. While 213 people were charged for not wearing masks, 10 violated physical distancing norms. Fourteen drivers were booked for operating services without complying with the rules. The police registered cases against seven commercial outlets. In all, a fine of Rs. 46,000 was collected from the violators. District Collector Navjot Khosa issued guidelines for activities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme. While no such works will be permitted within containment zones, physical distancing norms must be strictly enforced in other places where the activities are permitted. Besides, not more than five people will be permitted to work in a single batch.

The State Excise Enforcement Squad (SEES) led by Circle Inspector T. Anikumar nabbed Riyas and Jaseem of Nagaroor, Faizal of Pavaratty in Thrissur, and Niyaz of Konni in Pathanamthitta. The gang was purportedly caught during an attempt to smuggle 100 kg of ganja and 3 kg of hashish oil in a pickup. A car that apparently escorted the pickup was also seized by the law enforcers at Velamkolli along the Alamcode-Nagaroor road. In Coimbatore The four-member gang is suspected to have bought the contraband from Andhra Pradesh. After transporting the consignment to Coimbatore, they allegedly shifted the drugs to the pickup and remodelled the vehicle so that it would resemble those transporting live chicken. The contraband was intended to be sold among youth in Thiruvananthapuram and elsewhere, official sources said. Efforts spearheaded by the SEES had foiled several attempts to smuggle narcotic substances through the district of late. Excise officials had confiscated 500 kg of ganja near Attingal a month ago. The team busted a bid to sneak in 203 kg of the contraband on September 22.

With some supporting staff and two guards of the temple too testing positive, authorities decided to restrict the entry of devotees from Friday. The joint chief priest was the first to test positive. Tantri Tharanallur Satheesan Namboodiripad will perform pujas in the meanwhile, according to temple chief executive officer V. Ratheesan.  The authorities are hopeful of opening the temple to devotees on October 16, a day before the idols of Goddess Saraswati from Padmanabhapuram Thevarakkett, Kumaraswamy from Velimalai Murugan temple and Munnuttinanga from Sthanumalayan temple in Suchindram reach the Navaratri mandapam in front of the temple for Navaratri celebrations. The 10-day Alpashi festival is scheduled to commence on October 15 and the Tantri and the temple authorities will have to take a call on it. The 10-day Painkuni festival, scheduled to commence on March 30 and deferred due to the spurt in COVID-19 cases, was held from September 10 in a low-key manner.

09 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cong., BJP press for CM’s resignation||The Congress and the BJP on Thursday sought to use a recent court filing by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to press for the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the charge of abetting gold smugglers and economic offenders. Quoting a statement of second accused Swapna Suresh included in the chargesheet filed by the Central agency invoking the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr Vijayan was “in the knowledge of” the appointment of UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh as a marketing consultant at the Space Park project under the IT Department. The deposition has lent credence to the suspicion of the Opposition that gold smugglers and economic offenders had infiltrated Mr. Vijayan's office, he said. Swapna had told the ED that she had met Mr. Vijayan “5 to 6 times in the presence of his former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar”. The bureaucrat, who controlled the Chief Minister’s Office and was a close confidante, had “illegally recommended” Swapna to the government post when she was an employ of the UAE consulate, Mr. Chennithala said. He said the ED had revealed that a builder had paid Swapna and others a considerable bribe to bag the UAE-Red Crescent-Life Mission contract to construct dwellings for the poor at Wadakkancherry in Thrissur. The builder later offset the bribe against the contract amount by reducing the number of apartments from 200 to 140. Finally, the homeless picked up the tab for the government-sanctioned graft. He and four UDF leaders marched to the Secretariat to demand Mr. Vijayan's resignation. BJP president K. Surendran said the ED had exposed Mr. Vijayan's links to economic offenders and traitors. He named two more senior government officials who, he said, had assisted Swapna. He said Mr. Vijayan had lost the right to continue in office. The BJP would step up its agitation for his resignation. CPI(M) counters Meanwhile the CPI(M) said the Congress and BJP had cherry-picked the ED’s statement to portray the government in a bad light. The ED clearly stated that Mr. Sivasankar was the “point of contact” between the State and the UAE consulate. Moreover, Swapna had told the agency that Mr. Vijayan knew her as secretary to the UAE Consulate General. The CPI(M) State secretariat, which is scheduled to meet here on Friday, was likely to counter the charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-bjp-press-for-cms-resignation/article32808854.ece

Christened Operation Stonewall, the inspections were carried out by 67 squads. Vigilance officials found that a large number of tipper lorries transporting quarry products were operating without the passes issued by the Department of Mining and Geology. Many of the vehicles that did possess the passes were found to be carrying excess loads. Of the 306 vehicles inspected till Thursday evening, 133 were found to be operating without the mandatory passes. As many as 157 lorries were found to be carrying loads in excess of the permissible limit, Vigilance Director Sudesh Kumar said. Inspections carried out in the quarries revealed irregularities in 27 units. In many quarries, the inspections were continuing late into Thursday evening, the Director said.  KOMPAS portal  Rules require vehicles transporting quarry products from quarries and crusher units to be registered with the Kerala Online Mining Permit Awarding Service (KOMPAS) portal of the department and obtain the passes. But Vigilance officials found that most quarries were allowing vehicles that did not possess the passes also to transport rocks and minerals. They also found that planks were being fitted to the sides of the trucks to illegally increase cargo space. The raids were conducted on the basis of information received by the VACB Director that the government was losing crores of rupees by way of royalty owing to the malpractices and that officials of the Mining and Geology Department and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) were remaining silent on the issue. The MVD has collected approximately Rs. 11 lakh as fine from the vehicles carrying excess load. The vehicles that lacked passes were seized and handed over to the Department of Mining and Geology. The raids were led by H. Venkatesh, Inspector General of Police, VACB. The inspections would continue in the coming days, Mr. Sudesh Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/operation-stonewall-unearths-major-misdeeds/article32808858.ece

But, the required change can be brought about only after amending the Kerala Municipality Act and the Panchayat Raj Act and considering the technical issues in allowing such leeway without checking whether the house is to be built in paddy land or wetland or in CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) zones. Engineer to certify According to LSGD sources, the proposal was considered along with the amendments to building which were notified recently, but the proposal was set aside at that time due to the changes required in the Acts. As per the plan, the owner can get a certified engineer to certify that the construction of the house below 300 sq ft will be carried out within the rules. Once this self-certification is submitted to the local body, construction can begin after a specific time period of a week or two, in case there are no objections. Inspection An official from the local body needs to inspect the construction before it reaches lintel level to ensure that all setback measurements are being followed. In case of violations, the construction can be stopped. Recently, States such as Telangana and Punjab tried the self-certification system, which is expected to save on the waiting time in processing building permit applications for those constructing small dwellings. In grade 2 panchayats, classified so based on lower annual revenue, construction of houses can be done without permit for buildings of area up to 1,000 sq ft. But, this became an issue as some banks insisted on building permit number for sanctioning loans. Amendment Panchayat secretaries were also reluctant to issue permits in cases where there was no need for these, forcing some to redraw the plan and construct houses above 1,000 sq ft. This situation had led to the government introducing an amendment recently that building permit should be issued even in such cases, if the building owner demands.

The societies will directly procure paddy in four districts — Alappuzha, Palakkad, Thrissur and Kottayam. This arrangement will ensure that farmers get the price for paddy — Rs. 27.48 per kg — on the same day and that they are protected from exploitation by mill owners, Minister for Cooperation Kadakampally Surendran said after a high-level meeting attended by Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman, Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty, Cultural Affairs Minister A.K. Balan and senior officials. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) will offer cooperatives the services of paddy procurement officers for carrying out quality inspections on the paddy. Cooperatives confining their activity to procurement alone will be paid Rs. 73 per quintal of paddy. They will be paid Rs. 214 per quintal if they convert it into rice and transfer it to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) at an outturn ratio of 64.5%. A lead cooperative will be appointed at the district level for coordinating paddy procurement by the societies, Mr. Surendran said. In Palakkad district, the cooperatives will be responsible for paddy procurement and the transfer of the rice to the FCI. They will enter into agreement with the mill owners.

09 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Extend compensation period of GST: experts||For sustaining cooperative federalism, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation cannot be confined to a limited period of five years, say experts of the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), an autonomous institution of the State government. They are of the view that as long as there is GST there shall be GST compensation for States. “The GST Compensation Act is premised on the explicit recognition of the unconditional surrender that the States together have made towards evolving one common market with one tax. Hence, there is reason to believe that in the absence of GST compensation, GST would not have been born,” say K.J. Joseph, Director, and N. Ramalingam, Associate Professor. Experts say they fail to understand the reason as to how the GST can continue without GST compensation even after five years unless there are mechanisms built in to ensure that the States receive a higher share of the tax revenue. The States, which together account for around 60% of the combined expenditure of the Centre and the States, have been enticed to compromise with a constitutional guarantee of 14% growth in their tax revenue under GST. Had there been no GST compensation, GST would not have been there for establishing the One Nation, One Tax regime. The outcome of the GST is that the tax revenue is shared equally. Given the equality in the distribution of outcome, the question arises whether the cost of establishing GST has also been equally shared. The cost is viewed in terms of the pre-GST revenue surrendered by the States and the Centre. The Arvind Subramanian committee report has shown that the revenue forgone by the Centre has been Rs. 3.28 lakh crore and that by the States Rs. 3.69 lakh crore. “Our estimate revealed that this amounted to a surrender of 51.8% of the States’ total tax revenue and 28.8% for Centre’s gross tax revenue.” While in absolute terms the difference is not substantial, in relative terms the surrender by the States is almost twice that of the Centre. GST compensation is the constitutionally paid price for the higher surrender that the States have made, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/extend-compensation-period-of-gst-experts/article32808865.ece

They also inquired whether the LIFE Mission had legally vetted the deal with the UAE-Red Crescent before becoming a signatory in the memorandum of understanding struck with the foreign entity. Pecuniary advantage The VACB also sought to probe whether if any government official had caused any private party to gain pecuniary advantage from the deal. It also reportedly asked Mr. Jose if the LIFE Mission had any role in awarding the project contract to a private builder who had testified in court that he had paid nearly Rs. 5 crore as bribe to brokers to seal the bargain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigilance-questions-life-mission-ceo/article32808855.ece

09 October 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Chitravathi’ to impound water to its full capacity||The Chitravathi Balancing Reservoir (CBR), a multi-purpose project, is set to impound water to its full capacity of 10 tmcft for the first time, this season. All this is now possible because the State government has released Rs. 240.52 crore as a one-time settlement to all project-affected and the online payment began on Wednesday. The project has originally been designed as the tail-end reservoir for Tungabhadra High Level Canal (HLC) with 4 tmcft allocation but never got more than 2 tmcft any year. While the compensation for the lands and houses was being given from 2006 onwards in phases, the last time any payment was made was in 2009, when the installation of all the gates was completed after the installation process began in 2005. For the past week, the district administration has been working overtime to finalise the list of 1729 project-affected persons and served them Form-C notices, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu. While Rs. 49.2 crore was transferred on Wednesday (confirmed by the beneficiaries), Rs. 75 crore on Thursday another Rs. 20 crore on Friday would be paid. “The villagers are getting prepared to vacate their houses within the next week to 10 days so that impounding of water could be taken up immediately,” said Mr. Chandrudu. Currently, the CBR (named after the first MLA of Pulivendula Penchikala Basireddy, the PBR) has 6.5 tmcft and about 2,800 cusecs of floodwater was being let out as impounding would inundate four villages in Anantapur district.  Major fillip When Government Order was issued recently releasing the amount for the final settlement for the loss of houses and structures due to inundation in Marrimakulapalli, Chinnachagalarevu, Raghavapalli, and Peddachagalarevu villages, several issues cropped up regarding the quantum of compensation, and all those were amicably settled and Rs. 10 lakh was being given every loser. “There were some attempts at manipulating the Aadhaar data to become eligible for compensation as a major, but the alert district administration foiled them. Ssome people (22 of them), who were given Indiramma houses in the past, but no construction was taken up, also will get the full quantum of Rs. 10 lakh,” the Collector explained. The project would be a major fillip to the six drinking water projects in Anantapur district some in Kadapa district in addition to irrigating 1.05 lakh-acre ayacut, project Executive Engineer Urandur Rajasekhar told The Hindu . Out of this only 5,000 acres is in Yellanur mandal of Anantapur district, while the rest is in Pulivendula in Kadapa district. Three fishermen societies having 500 members from both districts operate in this reservoir and export tonnes of quality fish. Dharmavaram, Puttaparthi, Pulivendula, Dharmavaram Rural, Kadiri Town and Rural drinking water projects get water from this. “Once the floodwater flow from Chitravathi ceases, a five-stage 1,500-cusecs lift scheme from Gandikota Reservoir will fill the CBR bringing in Penna and Krishna water to this project,” Mr. Rajasekhar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chitravathi-to-impound-water-to-its-full-capacity/article32808553.ece

The crop damage has affected 4,977 farmers. According to Joint Director of Agriculture Ramakrishna, a ground-level survey conducted by the Department of Agriculture in the last one week showed that groundnut crop in 3927.15 hectares spread over 144 villages in 40 mandals was badly damaged and the department will recommend for compensation based on the percentage of loss. While agreeing that the total yield would come down in groundnut, Mr. Ramakrishna said that excess rain in September did the maximum damage leading to the germination of pods. With regard to the groundnut crop, 3,139 farmers were affected and their crop details were enumerated. All of these farmers had crop insurance too, which was a saving grace. The second most affected crop was cotton in 30 villages of 12 mandals belonging to 1,393 farmers, who had sown in 1719.35 hectares. The majority of the crop damage was in Peddavadaguru, Gooty, and Pamidi mandals. Paddy in 21 villages of 11 mandals belonging to 277 farmers sown in 222.33 hectares was damaged. The other crops like maize, ragi, jowar, castor, redgram, bajra, greengram and millet (korra) were damaged in small areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/crops-in-over-6000-hectares-damaged/article32808551.ece

The Tourism sector, which witnessed the zero-presence of tourists at all its projects in Chittoor district, except the Tirumala temple, is now limping back to normal. Tourism Manager (Chittoor) D.V. Chandramouli Reddy has told The Hindu that in the wake of COVID-19, tourists are bound to think of their safe travel, boarding and lodging. “It’s exactly here we want to play the crucial role. As Chittoor holds ample tourism potential with its vibrant presence of temples, scenic waterfalls and hill station Horseley Hills, we want to provide the right guidance to tourists in these aspects. Our action plan is that hoteliers, tour operators, lodges and service apartments are roped in to get registered with us. This trade registration on our official website www.aptourism.gov.in has already commenced. The tariffs are just negligible, that too for longer periods, based on the specified categories,” says Mr Chandramouli Reddy. The trade registration will allow stakeholders to furnish their details, facilities they are offering with permitted tariffs, besides allowing them to post their links. “This will be welcome to tourists to have prior information about their travel, boarding and lodging, with emphasis on adhering to COVID-19 rules,” says the official. Apart from Tirupati, the tourism wing has plans to involve stakeholders in all prominent destinations such as Srikalahasti, Kanipakkam, Madanapalle and Kuppam. “As we are expecting the arrival of tourists from January, we would be taking stock of the situation at premier destinations such as Talakona and Horseley Hills and improve the facilities. Now, as per out statistics, the present footfall of tourists stands at 20,000 per day. We are expecting the return of full potential by March next,” he says. Chandragiri opens Meanwhile, the famous Chandragiri Fort, 10 km from Tirupati, has opened to the public from October 1. However, the ticket issuance is made digital through QR Code payment.

According to the police, the accused, Hari Krishna (35) of Gangavaram mandal in the district, called Chittoor MLA Jangalapalle Srinivasulu on Sunday and informed him that ACB raids were on the anvil. He reportedly told him to send some money, failing which his house would be raided. The MLA in turn asked his personal assistant to deal with the matter. Hari Krishna told the PA that an ACB team was camping at a lodge in Chittoor and that a few more sleuths were on their way to conduct raids on some influential persons in Chittoor, including the MLA and furnished some confidential information pertaining to the MLA’s assets. He provided a mobile number, asking the PA to send Rs. 7,800 for food expenses of his team, contending that they had no cash at the midnight hour. As the matter looked suspicious, it was brought to the notice of the Deputy SP (Special Branch) U. Sudhakar Reddy, who in turn alerted the urban police.

09 October 2020||K. UmashankerCHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Giving a decent farewell to COVID victims||When the first casualty due to COVID-19 occurred in Chittoor district on May 18, 2020, at a COVID hospital, it led to an uneasy calm all over. Not only the medical authorities, but also the civic bodies found it difficult to tackle the public hostility in giving a decent burial to the victim. Close to five months after the first death due to COVID, Chittoor district is now heading towards the 700-mark, but is nowhere witnessing any resentment to the funerals. Reacting to the aggressive atmosphere in the public towards giving a decent burial to COVID-19 victims, Senior Civil Judge and Secretary of District Legal Services Authority (Chittoor) I. Karuna Kumar embarked on a mission to launch a public awareness campaign on the issue. When people started obstructing the funerals, the judicial officer, in coordination with the revenue, police and medical authorities, persuaded the villagers not to panic, and understand the scientific reality about COVID, besides having a rethink on their perception of “life and death”. “Though the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution also includes the right to decent burial or cremation, we had never brought to play the legal aspects. In coordination with the COVID-19 task force officials, we pleaded with those who opposed the burials. Despite a sizeable number of incidents of obstructing the burials taking place in the district, not even a single case was registered anywhere. Our campaign led to wonderful results,” Mr. Karuna Kumar said. Grounding the campaign at the grass-root level by deploying personnel of the Legal Services Authority from the mandal units, Mr. Karuna Kumar conducted a series of review meetings with them. Whenever a case of obstructing the funeral of the COVID victims was reported, the task force rushed to the spot and settled the row. In some cases, the officials had to arrange the funeral at government lands. “Members of the COVID Task Force at all levels in the district succeeded in driving home the point among the public that the bodies of COVID victims would not spread infection. Much to our satisfaction, there is a tremendous change in the mindset of the people,” Mr. Karuna Kumar said. Unlike in the previous months, now the family members of a COVID victim are made to join the funeral formalities at the crematoriums and burial grounds. “The COVID-19 pandemic would be disappearing sooner or later, but our message to have respect for dead bodies should continue to inspire one and all,” Mr. Karuna Kumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/giving-a-decent-farewell-to-covid-victims/article32809351.ece

09 October 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Gang tracked with CCTV cameras, nabbed within hours of dacoity||A network of surveillance cameras at important junctions in Prakasam district helped police crack a dacoity case within seven hours of its occurrence and arrest five members of the gang based at Stuartpuram in neighouring Guntur district on Thursday. The gangsters robbed at knife point a journalist from neighbouring Kurnool district of Rs. 50,000 cash and a mobile phone early on Thursday after taking him to a remote place with a promise to give three times more counterfeit currency for Rs. 1 lakh, Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal told the media here on Thursday evening. The SP said initially one of the accused showed two 500 rupee notes said to be counterfeit ones to the scribe, Sampangi Ramesh, who came to the busy Kunta junction along with his friend Nageswara Rao. On getting satisfied as they looked similar to original notes, the duo went with the person towards Dornala in a car and on reaching a remote place, he took him to nearby bushes. Four other accused pounced upon him and snatched away the cash bag brought by the complainant at knife point and all of them sped away in the car. CCC spots car Following a complaint with the Peddaravidu police, all police stations in the vicinity, including Markapur, Tripurantakam, Dornala, Yerragondapalem and T.V. Palli were alerted and checking of vehicles was started at all check-posts under the supervision of the command control centre (CCC) here. The CCC identified the gangsters’ car moving swiftly near the Bodireddypalli junction thanks to CCTV surveillance, the SP said.

09 October 2020||Special Correspondent,ANDHRA PRADESH||FDNA opposes move to privatise college||The Forum for Development of North Andhra (FDNA) has appealed to the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana not to allow the proposed privatisation of the Maharaja College (MR College) in Vizianagaram. In a letter to the Minister, who is an alumnus of the institution, on Thursday, FDNA general secretary A. Aja Sarma and organising secretary M.S. Vasa expressed concern over the media reports that the MANSAS Trust was planning to privatise the college. Set up as a school in 1857, the institution was upgraded into a high school in 1868 and subsequently into a college in 1879. New buildings were constructed for the college with the UGC funds recently, they said. Referring to the decision reportedly taken by the MANSAS Trust to privatise the MR College, they said the State government cannot just wash its hands of the issue on the plea that it is up to the Trust to take a decision.  There are 12 educational institutions under the purview of the MANSAS Trust. “The assets of the trust are not the personal property of an individual. The trust was established to protect land. Had it not been established, the government would have acquired the land long ago. The protection of land is, therefore, the responsibility of the trust. If the trust tries to dispose of the land, the government should intervene,” argued the FDNA representatives. They noted that legendary writers such as Gidugu Rammurthy and Gurajada Appa Rao, former Chief Justice of AP High Court P. Satyanarayana Raju and former Judges of AP High Court K. Punnaiah and G. Ramanujulu Naidu are all the alumni of MR College. “You (the Minister) are also an alumnus of this college. It is wrong to privatise the institution. The trust chairperson is believed to have said that the decision to privatise the college was taken by the previous government. A mistake is a mistake, irrespective of who does it,” said Mr. Aja Sarma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fdna-opposes-move-to-privatise-college/article32809352.ece
09 October 2020||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Juveniles taking to crime worries police||In the last 10 days, the police cracked more than 12 crimes, and arrested over 15 persons and took into custody at least six juveniles in conflict with law, for allegedly being involved in these offences. This trend of juveniles taking to the crime route at an early age, is a cause of concern for the police. “They are young and have gone wayward at an early age. And most of such juveniles have taken to the crime route to fund their vices. This is a very disturbing trend,” said DCP (Crime) V. Suresh Babu. “Young people taking to crime path in their formative years is certainly a cause of worry. The issue needs a holistic approach, as many factors such as education, social and economic issues are involved in this,” observed City Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha. Distrurbing trend According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, as many as 1,122 juveniles were apprehended in the State on charges of various crimes in 2017. The number, however, came down to 960 in the next yar. As many as 820 cases with alleged involvement of juveniles were registered in the State last year, suggests the NCRB data. Statistics further say that last year, 17 juveniles were involved in murder cases, 11 for causing death due to negligence, 16 for attempt to murder, 24 for outraging the modesty of women, 28 for attempted rape and rape, 381 for theft, 152 for burglary and 18 for robbery. Of the juveniles in conflict with law, 149 have never went to school, while 454 had completed their primary education and 342 had studied up to tenth class. Economic factor According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Annepu Narasimha Murthy, who has focussed his thesis for Ph.D. on ‘Children in conflict with law in Visakhapatnam’, around 75% of the juvenile in conflict with law are school dropouts and 87% of them have taken to crime due to poverty and low family income. “Economic factor plays a key role in luring these young minds into the ‘world of crime’. My study has revealed that apart from economic issues, 75% of juveniles in conflict with law, were sucked into crime due to social issues and weakening of social institutions,” he observed. Other factors include cultural issues, such as modern lifestyle and addiction to vices at an early age. “About 77% of such juveniles were addicted to vices and modern lifestyle. To fund the vices and lifestyle, they take to crime for easy money. Lifestyle is also influenced by exposure to various media, especially films and television,” Mr. Narasimha Murthy pointed out. Exposure to violence His study in Visakhapatnam, has also revealed that about 80% of juveniles in conflict with law, do not have adequate parental supervision. “This happens mainly due to the reasons and factors associated with broken families, parents having criminal background, exposure to domestic violence at a very early age, child abuse and poverty,” said Mr. Narasimha Murthy. According to Mr. Suresh Babu, it has been seen in most cases that the juveniles begin with petty crimes such as picking pockets and end up committing grave crimes, including house break-ins, murders and rapes. “Once one resort to crime, they get exposed to hardened criminals at various stages. One a juvenile starts making easy money , it becomes very difficult for them to resist. That is why there is a need for holistic rehabilitation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/juveniles-taking-to-crime-worries-police/article32809479.ece

09 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Children strike a chord with ‘Jagan mama’||The launch of the much-awaited Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme at the Punadipadu Zilla Parishad High School in Kankipadu mandal of Krishna district on Thursday became a platform for Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and the schoolchildren to shower their love and affection on each other. Before the formal launch of the programme, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy went round the classrooms, taking a look at the spanking new look of the place, sat with the children on the newly-painted benches, and interacted with them. Later, in his speech, the Chief Minister said he did not want children from the economically poor families left out in the race of quality education. “We are giving them new uniforms, textbooks, shoes, socks, belt and a school bag. They will now go to school wearing a new uniform and carrying a set of new things in a new bag. Let them also know that now their “mama” (maternal uncle) is the Chief Minister who will take care of all their needs,” he said amidst loud applause. Shaik Tasleem, a Class IV student from the mandal parishad primary school, won hearts instantly by addressing the Chief Minister as “mavayya” (mother’s brother). The young girl said she wanted to become a Collector, which now seemed possible through the various schemes launched by the government. She went on to wish that her “Jagan mavayya” should be in power till then to witness her serving the poor just like he was doing now. The girl said their school was now equipped with all facilities, it looked good as it was given a facelift under the Nadu-Nedu programme, and the children were served nutritious food under the ‘Goru Mudda’ programme. “Our mavayya knows what we need to come up in life,” she said, and promised to make the best of the various programmes to study hard and become a responsible citizen. Leela Lahari, a Class V student from the Mandal Parishad School at Kankipadu, said she went to a private school till third class. Due to financial problems, she shifted to a government school. But last year, her family realised that the scenario was changing when her mother received a cash assistance of Rs. 15,000 under the ‘Amma Vodi’ programme. “And now, I have received this gift of school kit from my maama,” she said, looking at a smiling Chief Minister. Lahari promised to work hard to achieve what she aspired in life and said she would also tell her friends and others about the advantages of studying in government schools. English medium Usha Kumari, a member of the Parents Committee of the government school at Punadipadu, appealed to the Chief Minister to bring in English medium as a mode of instruction as it would help their children compete with others with confidence. She assured that the parents would extend their full support to him.  I want to become a Collector, which now seems possible through the various schemes launched by the government.

09 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Swarna Palace fire: victims’ kin question police ‘inaction’||Family members of those who died of asphyxia in a fire accident that took place in a hotel-turned-COVID care centre in the city have expressed concern over what they called the “inaction of the police and slow pace of investigation into the case.” Ramesh Cardiac and Super Speciality Hospitals Pvt. Limited had taken lease of Hotel Swarna Palace for running a COVID care centre. Both the managements had reportedly entered into a MoU for the purpose. On August 9, at around 4.45 a.m., fire occurred in the ground floor of the building, which later spread to the other floors. Ten patients admitted to the COVID care centre died of asphyxia as thick smoke engulfed the rooms in which they were undergoing treatment. Twenty-one other persons suffered injuries. The Governorpet police registered a case. The government and the district Collector ordered an inquiry into the tragedy separately. The police arrested three staff members of the Ramesh Hospitals. However, the hospital authorities said the management was in no way responsible for the accident as the hotel management should look after the safety and security of the patients. The Revenue, the Police and the Fire personnel who visited the hospital said the accident took place due to non-availability of fire alarm, fire-fighting gadgets and emergency equipment in the building. Ramesh Hospitals management obtained stay from the court, which was vacated in the higher court later. “We have seized some important documents. A few suspects are not cooperating in the investigation. But we have recorded the statements of some persons,” a police officer said. The family members of a few victims, however, blamed the government for the “poor action against the accused.” They alleged that the accused were freely moving outside due to some loopholes in the system. Poser to police “How can the police take up investigation without questioning the prime accused in the case and how can the accused escape from the police for more than a month,” a family member questioned. A senior police officer said investigation into the case was nearing completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/swarna-palace-fire-victims-kin-question-police-inaction/article32809470.ece
09 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farm reforms will help farmers immensely: GVL||The three Acts pertaining to the farm sector enacted recently were a significant step towards implementing the recommendations made by the Swaminathan Commission in 2006, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, BJP MP and Spices Board’s chilli task force chairman, said on Thursday. “Farmers stand to gain from these new pieces of legislation, which facilitate adoption of advanced technologies and remove bottlenecks in the supply chain, besides ensuring remunerative prices,” Mr. Narasimha Rao asserted while interacting with the chilli farmers at the market yard in Guntur. ‘Middlemen eliminated’ Mr. Narasimha Rao said chilli and tobacco were major crops in Guntur and Prakasam districts, and that the Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs), to which the Centre accorded high priority, would be of immense help in earning decent returns. “This is due to the elimination of middlemen, who have been a bane for farmers,” he observed. Up to 1,000 farmers can join the FPOs. The Central government will extend a financial support of Rs. 25 lakh to each FPO for the first four years and scale up assistance through other means subsequently. Mr. Narasimha Rao said the fear that the new laws would rob Agriculture Produce Market Committees of their autonomy was misplaced as they were not being meddled with. “Henceforth, farmers can sell the produce through the Electronic National Agriculture Market without much difficulty. They can even trade their commodities anywhere in the country,” he added. Necessary steps were taken for augmenting the value of commodities, particularly the perishable ones, and, thereby, enable the farmers to fetch minimum returns, he added. Tobacco Board Chairman Y. Raghunath Babu, Guntur chilli yard chairman Chandragiri Yesu Ratnam and BJP State vice-president Ravela Kishore Babu were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farm-reforms-will-help-farmers-immensely-gvl/article32809344.ece

09 October 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||MANSAS in crisis as Pusapati families at loggerheads||Row over MANSAS Trust among the Pusapati family members has proved to be a bane for more than 1,500 employees, including those of outsourcing, working in Maharaja College of Vizianagaram and other educational institutions. MANSAS, one of the India’s richest trust with properties worth Rs. 50,000 crore in North Andhra and several other places, is now unable to pay salaries to the staff. A reported move to privatise the MR College, which was established in 1879, shocked its teaching and non- teaching staff. It turns into a major controversy as almost all families in Vizianagaram have an emotional attachment with the college which produced many eminent personalities like Gurajada Apparao, Gidugu Venkataramamurthy, and Chaganti Somayajulu. Activities of the trust were smooth till 2019. Former Minister P. Ananda Gajapati Raju’s younger brother and former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju was the chairperson till Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju was made as head of the institution six months ago. Ms. Sanchaita is the daughter of Uma Gajapathi Raju who got divorced from Ananda Gajapati Raju three decades ago. Mr. Ashok Gajapati Raju has challenged her appointment in AP High Court. Meanwhile, Anand Gajapati Raju’s second wife Sudha Gajapathi Raju and her daughter Urmila Gajapathi Raju also claimed their right over the trust. According to sources, the three families have differences. Ms. Sudha Gajapathi’s family members have grouse against Mr. Ashok Gajapati Raju as they were kept away from MANSAS affairs after the death of Ananda Gajapathi Raju. They also oppose Ms. Sanchaiata’s claims saying that her mother had taken divorce long ago and she cannot be the chairperson of the trust. The internal bickering has an impact on the maintenance of 12 educational institutions, including MR College, where more than 10,000 students are pursuing various courses. Proposal opposed “Professors, lecturers and employees lament they become scapegoats with the internal fight among the three families. The government should cancel privatisation proposal since MR College is the lone aided institution helping many youngsters to get higher education at affordable fee structures,” said Reddi Sankara Rao, secretary of Pattana Powra Samskshema Sangham, a civic society of Vizianagaram. Aam Aadmi Party Vizianagaram district convener K. Dayanand said that the employees were unable to get salaries for the last three months although MR College had funds to the tune of Rs. 120 crore in banks. “Privatisation would lead to huge fee structure in future. The government should intervene and ensure free education for all students,” he added. Students Federation of India district president Ch. Venkatesh and secretary P. Rammohan and others have been holding agitations for the last one week for the protection of MR College. “Announcement of zero year for 2020-21 is a big shock for the students. It is a step towards privatisation. We will strongly oppose the move,” said Mr. Venkatesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mansas-in-crisis-as-pusapati-families-at-loggerheads/article32809359.ece

09 October 2020||B. Chandrashekhar,TELANGANA||TS farmers likely to reap rich harvest this season||With favourable seasonal conditions on their side in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on sourcing inputs, the farming community of Telangana is set to reap a rich harvest this Vanakalam (Kharif) season as officials of the planning department have estimated the crop production of about 179.4 lakh tonnes including nearly 98 lakh tonnes for food crops. According to the first advance estimates of crop production prepared by the Bureau of Economics and Statistics (BES) for the first crop season of 2020-21 agricultural year, the production of all major food crops, except that of maize which is cultivated on lesser extent compared to previous years on the advice of the State government, such as paddy, red gram, soya bean and jowar is expected to go up considerably this season. Record jump Among the non-food crops, the production of cotton is expected to see a record jump although the difference in the extent of cultivation is only about 6 lakh acres higher this year at about 60.22 lakh acres against nearly 54.46 lakh acres last year. The planning authorities have estimated the production of cotton at 99.53 lakh bales of 170 kg each against the production of nearly 60 lakh bales last year. It is expected to cross one crore bales given the fact that the fibre crop has been cultivated in 60.22 lakh acres extent against 59.58 lakh acres taken into consideration by the officials while estimating the production. “Production of paddy, which is estimated at 125.46 lakh tonnes from 50.19 lakh acres is expected to cross that threshold too as the actual extent has been over 52.56 lakh acres against the extent taken into consideration by the planning authorities,” a senior official of the Agriculture Department said that total production of food crops could very well cross one-crore tonnes. Similarly, the production of red gram is estimated at about 8.44 lakh tonnes from the cultivation of the crop in 10.55 lakh acres. Last year, the production was only about 1.9 lakh tonnes from over 7.38 lakh acres of cultivation. This season, the crop is cultivated in nearly 10.77 lakh acres against 10.55 lakh acres taken into count by the BES officials while preparing the advance estimates of production. Another major food crop soya bean is expected to give a production of 3.42 lakh tonnes from 3.95 lakh acres of cultivation. The final extent of the crop, however, is nearly 4 lakh acres this season. Its production was 2.74 lakh tonnes from nearly 4.27 lakh acres of cultivation during the last Kharif season. The BES officials have also estimated the production of jowar at 53,000 tonnes, black gram 21,000 tonnes, green gram 22,000 tonnes, maize 4.7 lakh tonnes, groundnut 41,000 tonnes, sugarcane 15.78 lakh tonnes, turmeric 2.54 lakh tonnes, chilli 4.1 lakh tonnes and onion 38,000 tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-farmers-likely-to-reap-rich-harvest-this-season/article32809244.ece
09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Disabled students getting used to the new normal||Out of the myriad unforeseen changes that COVID-19 has brought into our lives is the way education is imparted to children. The sight of children squirming in chairs and sofas at home while attending online classes has become quite ubiquitous. But what about the visually impaired? Teachers at the Devnar School for the Blind, Begumpet, are relying on the sharp memory and hearing ability of students with visual impairment to take classes. Audio tapes of academic lessons are sent through Whatsapp and in the case of students of classes IX and X, Braille text books are sent home. Earlier, apart from learning in classrooms, students with partial or complete visual impairment used to learn with the help of computers or other digital screens at school, like screen readers, while using the Braille slate and stylus to write. Since they are now staying at home and do not have access to these resources, the school’s management is relying on smartphones. “We have provided 20 phones to families not able to afford with the help of donors,” said founder and chairman of Devnar Foundation for the Blind Dr. A. Saibaba Goud. How do the boys make use of this new situation? “We use the screen reader software to access classes. Once we reach the home page in the phone, the screen reader suggests we tap it twice to open Whatsapp. If I tap on science group, the audio lesson plays,” says 13-year-old Y. Nagaraju of Class IX. A Xth standard student R. Devender Reddy says that though they initially faced difficulty, they have got used to this form of education now. “The biggest advantage is we can download and hear the classes whenever we want to,” he points out. G. Hogla, a teacher at the school, said that students are encouraged to send their doubts in audio form as it helps them practice for final exams. “During exams, they have to dictate answers to a scribe, so this practice helps our students,” says Mrs. Hogla. For those with hearing impairment, hearing aids are used. Online classes have staggered timings for the benefit of students staying away in far off villages, having internet issues and because the lone smartphone could be used by other family members. “Therefore, it is not fair to hold classes at a fixed time. In any case, we are available to our students over the phone throughout the day,” says Y. Devender Reddy, another teacher. Braille text books have been distributed to all class IX and X students. It was restricted to these two classes because of the huge costs involved in printing, admin officer V. Ramakrishna said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/disabled-students-getting-used-to-the-new-normal/article32809219.ece
09 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Water flow hit by human intervention||On top of the Damagundam ridge near Vikarabad at an elevation of 700 metres above sea level, the green valley presents stunning views. On the ridge, a farmer has used an earthmover to clear a path for water to flow down the hill to the lake. The farmer lives in Pudur village and the water will fill a lake whose overflow would emerge as a stream and merge with other streams to reach the Himayatsagar reservoir on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Experts now say that it is this fiddling with the water flow that has affected the spread of both Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes and the water quality. “When the twin reservoirs were built there was a clear command by the ruler that additional water-holding structures will not be built. But that rule was broken after National Watershed Development Programme commenced in 1990s,” says B.V. Subba Rao of the Centre for Climate Change at the Engineering Staff College of India. According to an estimate, there are 70 educational facilities, 35 mineral water bottling plants, and 790 check dams in the catchment areas of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar. “The result is disruption of both surface, sub-surface flow and water table,” says Mr. Rao who believes in the sustainability of water use from the dams for drinking water needs owing to their low carbon footprint. A number of farm houses have been built by politicians, film stars and celebrities right up to Aziznagar area, sending land prices soaring. These high-walled structures have further disrupted the natural water channels called by the locals orrey (stream), vagu (rivulet), cheruvu (lake), and nadi (river). This has impacted the lakes which now require ever more quantities of rain to fill up. “Water flows east as well as west from the Damagundam ridge. Owing to high land prices, many buildings are coming up around water bodies like Sarpanpally lake. Other water bodies are also being filled up and have impacted water channels,” says Venkatesh Goteti who lives near Pudur village. “The Himayatsagar got filled up quickly this year owing to two days of rain in the Shamshabad area. The water channels have been disturbed by unprecedented construction activity,” says D. Narasimha Reddy who works in the field of environment and development. “Even if this water is released into the Musi river it will not be cleaned up. It will only distribute the pollution and will spread downstream at a great velocity,” he says. Despite the talk about water being released from the reservoir a few days ago, it was only filled to one third of the capacity. The capacity of the 1920 Osman Sagar is now filled to one third of the capacity. The 3.9 tmcft was 1.038 tmcft on October 6 and the stored water is being used for drinking water needs of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-flow-hit-by-human-intervention/article32809232.ece
09 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Dharani: TS provides secondary internet broadband connectivity to MRO offices||With the stage being set for the launch of the Dharani, the integrated Land Record Management System portal soon, the State government is taking adequate care to avoid any breakdown in connectivity and ensure interruption free online transactions. The government has decided to opt for secondary connection of internet broadband in all the 590 mandal offices spread across the State and directions have been issued accordingly to the District Collectors. The mandal offices are presently connected using the 12 mbps connectivity through the State Wide Area Network. The SWAN connectivity provided through BSNL would be the backbone for the Dharani project and it is available on 24x7 basis. However, it has been decided to have a secondary connection from any local service provider in the respective mandal offices to avoid downtime/failure in connectivity while using Dharani applications. The decision was taken by the IT Department and instructions to this effect have been circulated to the electronic service delivery wing of the department.

09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Jungle sojourn thrills Gagan||For London Olympics bronze medallist and shooter Gagan Narang, it was an irresistible invite as the chief guest of the Elephants Rejuvenation programme at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in MP during his recent trip. The 37-year-old Gagan was at the reserve for the ‘Samapan Samaroh’, the closing segment of the programme. “It is a nice feeling to be in the jungle, in the midst of these magnificent wild animals. It is a whole different kind of world. And especially because of the pandemic, it is so refreshing mentally too,” said Gagan, who also contributed in his own way for the programme and for the well-being of the staff in the reserve, including the mahouts, who also assemble for the event. “This is different from adopting any animal. It is more of a symbolic gesture to be out there. Being an avid wildlife and nature lover, I thought it was one of the better ways to be away from the madding crowd,” Gagan said. And, the World Cup champion, himself being a brilliant photographer too, took time to have a feel of the reserve and was apparently delighted to go around the reserve which he says is full of the typical, magical monsoon greens. “Definitely, it is a different kind of challenge for the park officials in managing wild elephants. But, I am sure they have the expertise to handle the situation aptly,” Gagan concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jungle-sojourn-thrills-gagan/article32809408.ece

09 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress protests outside Home Minister’s house||Congress party led by AICC secretary A. Sampath Kumar, Youth Congress president Anil Kumar Yadav and NSUI president Venkat Balamoor staged a protest at Home Minister Mahmood Ali’s residence in Banjara Hills demanding his resignation against the ‘rising’ atrocities against women in the State. Tension prevailed as the Congress leaders and workers tried to barge into the residence but could not as the gates were closed. As they were informed that the Home Minister was not inside, they sat on a dharna in front of the house. Mr. Sampath Kumar alleged that Telangana was turning into another Uttar Pradesh and the recent rape of a dalit girl in Khammam and the government’s failure to even console her family was an indication of the situation. Similarly, another girl in Moinabad was killed and a ruling party leader was behind it, he claimed. It was unfortunate that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with the police officials and claimed Telangana was safe, Mr. Sampath Kumar said. The gathered workers raised slogans against the government and also demanded the resignation of the Home Minister. The protesting leaders and the cadre were arrested and shifted to Goshamahal police station. The Home Minister called Mr. Sampath and assured that action would be taken against the culprits involved in atrocities against women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-protests-outside-home-ministers-house/article32809248.ece
09 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Why is govt. seeking private property details: Jagga Reddy||Congress MLA of Sangareddy T. Jayaprakash Reddy has questioned the government’s intention asking people to furnish their property details for incorporation in Dharani portal and alleged that the data could be compromised. Speaking to reporters here, he said the government should also take details on the loans owed by the people to institutions and individuals while seeking to divulge the details of properties. He felt there is a motive behind collecting the personal property details of people when they were available with the sub-registrar offices and with local body authorities. Stating that such a huge decision should have been taken after putting the idea for discussion and debate among the public and experts, he said he wanted to question the government on this in the Assembly, but he was not given any opportunity. Public opinion should be sought first on such a massive decision, he argued. To instil confidence among the people, the government should first start uploading the property details of the Chief Minister, Ministers, MLAs, IAS and IPS officers, he said so that people can be convinced about the idea. The entire exercise looks faulty and is bound to create more problems for the people in future, he claimed. Mr. Reddy said people were worried that the government wants to misuse the data to target them in the future and also cut down the government benefits. People buy properties with life long savings and they don’t want to put that data for manipulation, he claimed.  “Government should first upload property details of the Chief Minister, Ministers, MLAs, IAS and IPS officers so that people can be convinced about the idea.

09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR upgrading speed to run trains at 130 kmph||South Central Railway (SCR) has taken up the task of upgrading maximum permissible speed in the sections of ‘Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal (GQ/GD) routes’ including the sections of Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur, Vijayawada- Visakhapatnam and Wadi- Gooty - Renigunta sections to 130 kmph. Existing maximum permissible speed between Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada and Kazipet -Secunderabad is about 120 kmph, while it is 110 kmph between Vijayawada - Gudur and Wadi -Gooty - Renigunta sections. These routes are under the process of speed upgradation up to 130 kmph as decided by the Railway Board, informed General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Wednesday. Railway Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO/Lucknow) had already conducted ‘oscillation trials’ through ‘Confirmatory Oscillograph Car Run’ (COCR) consisting of 24 coaches of all classes. During this check, the engineering teams travelling in these special inspection trains check for the signalling, traction distribution equipment, locomotive and coach fitness. Trial runs were conducted in July between Balharshah - Kazipet - Secunderabad and Gooty - Renigunta sections. Works pertaining to upgradation of these routes to required standards like sturdier rails, improvement of curves, gradients and other components in double line electrified routes are under way, he said. Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) Ch. Rakesh said about 260-metres-long welded rail panels are being laid to improve track structure. Trial runs are also being carried out in the remaining sections of Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur & Wadi - Gooty sections with the track strengthening and other infrastructure enhancement already in progress to meet the specified standards. Once all the infrastructure improvements are done, a detailed report will be sent to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (Secunderabad circle) for getting necessary permissions to enhance the maximum permissible speed of all these routes to 130 kmph. Mr. Mallya pointed out that increasing the trains speed in these important sections of Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal routes will definitely boost the operation of passenger and freight trains. “As the running time of the passenger services can be drastically reduced, it will pave the way for running more number of trains,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-upgrading-speed-to-run-trains-at-130-kmph/article32809222.ece

In the rural areas, more than 55,000 non-agricultural properties have been enumerated as against a total of 2.93 lakh properties across the district till Tuesday, sources added. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar along with Collector R V Karnan visited Allipuram and various other localities in Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) limits on Thursday to take stock of the implementation of the ongoing property enumeration survey. Interacting with the denizens at Allipuram, the Minister explained about the significance of the ongoing survey aimed at creating a comprehensive database of all property related information and issuing non-agricultural property passbooks. Once the data is uploaded in the App and the Dharani portal is launched, the "maroon" coloured pattadar passbooks will be issued for the non-agricultural property owners as per the new Revenue Act by the ensuing Deepavali festival, he said. The mega exercise will help pave way for integrated land record management and a hassle free property related transactions such as obtaining loans from banks. Those living in houses without municipal numbers in the merged villages under the KMC limits will be issued "by numbers" for the purpose of enumerating the non-agricultural properties as part of the ongoing survey/enumeration, he said in response to specific pleas from some dwellers of the locality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/survey-of-non-agricultural-properties-picks-up-pace/article32809262.ece
09 October 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Farmers in Khammam district take to drones to spray pesticides||Remote-controlled drones are gradually gaining traction with some tech-savvy farmers in several villages, mainly in mandals bordering Andhra Pradesh, putting them to good use in these times of COVID-19 pandemic-induced farm labour shortage. A couple of farmers in Siripuram and Astnagurthy villages in Wyra mandal and a few villages in Chintakani mandal have already started using drones for spraying pesticides on crops. A progressive farmer of Venkatagiri village in Thallada mandal set a relatively new trend in the district by using a drone to spray the natural neem oil as part of organic pest control methods. The availability of locally built drones, exclusively designed for spraying of pesticides, in the market in big towns of the neighbouring State is prompting some tech-savvy farmers to buy them for their own use and for letting the devices to other interested farmers on hire basis. Labour shortage This trend is gradually catching up even as the problem of labour shortage continuous to persist and more farmers evincing keen interest in drones to harness its potential for pesticide spraying operations. However, most of them are unaware of the regulations governing the aerial spraying of pesticides. Sources in the Agriculture Department said aerial spraying of pesticide needs approval from the Central government agencies concerned. Sources added that there is no provision for use of drones for spraying pesticide in the Insecticides Act, 1968. “We have started using a drone for pesticide spraying recently and found it very useful in terms of saving time, cost of chemical and above all overcoming the shortage of farm labour," said M Venkateshwara Rao, a progressive farmer of Siripuram (Kanakagiri) village in Wyra mandal. The drone equipped with micro sprayers, without any cameras, is proving to be immensely useful in spraying pesticide on our paddy crops with precision, Mr Rao, who is an agricultural graduate, said. It is completing the spraying operation in one acre field in less than 15 minutes as against hours of toiling involved in manual spraying method, he noted, adding that they have hired a trained person for operation of the drone. When contacted by The Hindu , Joint Director of Agriculture, Khammam, Vijaya Nirmala said the department has not yet received any specific guidelines pertaining to the use of drones for pesticide spraying.  It is very useful in terms of saving time, cost of chemical and above all overcoming shortage of farm labour. M. Venkateshwara Rao, A progressive farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-in-khammam-district-take-to-drones-to-spray-pesticides/article32809258.ece
09 October 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Pvt. hospital sealed in Khammam||The District Medical and Health authorities on Thursday issued orders to seal Sri Pooja Hospital at Mayuri Centre here for allegedly violating the procedures governing the medico-legal cases and functioning of private hospitals.

09 October 2020||MEDAK,TELANGANA||After six years, two girls reunited with father||In a welcome development, two girls were handed over to their father on Thursday. Bethani Home located at Donti was venue for this heart-touching event. Mahamooda was 12 years old and Sakeena six years old in 2014. They were native of Nagsanpally village in Srirangapur village of Vanaparthy mandal. Their mother passed away and father Vazeer is a street vendor. As he was not taking care of them properly, both of them left home after attending a Jatara at Srirangapur and reached Hyderabad by train. There the railway police handed them over to child welfare department which shifted them to Bethani Home. Recently, Kavitha, a 15-year-old girl from Vemulapadu village in Hanumanthapadu mandal of Prakasham district in Andhra Pradesh, was repatriated to her parents Israel and Padma. She had been staying at Bethani Home since 2014. When she informed officials that she wanted to go home, they traced her parents and handed her over her to them on October 6. After seeing the emotional bonding of Kavitha with parents, both Mahamooda and Sakeena expressed their wish to meet their father Vazeer. The officials first contacted Anjaneyulu, the sarpanch of Nagasanpally, and checked whether the children of Vazeer went missing. They also contacted locals, called Mr Vazeer, checked his credentials and handed over the children. “Initially, both sisters were not much interested in going to their father. But after seeing the case of Kavitha and her meeting with parents they changed their mind and expressed willingness to return home. We were already in the process of contacting Vazeer and that made our job easy to call him here and hand over his daughters. We will also make a followup on their education and well being through the child welfare committee there,” said Ch. Nagaraju, Child Protection Officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/after-six-years-two-girls-reunited-with-father/article32809413.ece

09 October 2020||New Delhi,||EPCA directs Delhi, other States to implement GRAP||A Supreme Court-appointed pollution monitoring body has directed Delhi and neighbouring States to implement air pollution control measures under “very poor” and “severe” category air quality of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) from October 15, including a ban on the use of diesel generators, except for emergency activities. The Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) on Thursday wrote to Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan on the issue. “The use of diesel generator sets will be banned (other than essential/emergency services) in Delhi and in vicinity towns — Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in U.P. and Faridabad and Gurugram in Haryana. In 2019, the States of U.P. and Haryana had informed EPCA that they will put in the required measures by winter 2020 so that electricity from the grid can be supplied without disruptions in these areas, which would then obviate the need for diesel generators,” the letter said. Additional steps The letter said that a CPCB-led task force and the EPCA will continue to review the situation. If the weather pollution turns adverse, then “additional steps”, including a ban on construction activity and enhanced parking fees among others will have to be implemented, as mentioned under a different category of the GRAP. “However, in this winter with all the combined efforts of the Union and State governments, we should try and avert the need to use these additional emergency measures for pollution control. We recognise that the economy is already under stress post-lockdown and therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption,” it said. EPCA Chairman Bhure Lal said in the letter that there is “enough evidence” that pollution will make COVID-19 “more dangerous” and therefore, there must be zero-tolerance for air pollution.  If the weather pollution turns adverse, then ‘additional steps’, including a ban on construction activity and enhanced parking fees among others will have to be implemented EPCA letter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/epca-directs-delhi-other-states-to-implement-grap/article32808902.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Riots victim pleads case for higher compensation||A 22-year-old man who lost his right hand during the communal riots that broke out in February was presented before the Delhi Assembly Minorities Welfare Committee  as his case was initially put under the “minor injuries” section while his is a case of permanent disability. The compensation due to the victim identified as Akram Khan, resident of Chand Bagh, is Rs. 5 lakh, but he was only paid Rs. 20,000 while at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital where he was being treated in February. Mr. Akram claimed that a bomb was thrown in his direction on February 24 and the severe injuries he sustained led to his hand being amputated. Committee chairman Amanatullah Khan said that Mr. Akram’s case was presented before the panel. “His first medico-legal certificate (MLC) stated that he had suffered minor injuries. Later, it was changed to major injuries but he has suffered a permanent disability due to which he is entitled to Rs. 5 lakh,” he said. Government representatives present during the Wednesday meeting said that the matter will be looked into, Mr. Khan said. “Three-four operations took place at GTB Hospital but my treatment there was cut short because it was made a COVID-19 facility. Three months after the incident and treatment at GTB, I shifted to St. Stephen’s Hospital where another operation took place. One more operation is left but doctors are yet to finalise the date. Money is a concern because I have lost my job and now I am fully dependent on my family,” said Mr. Akram, who has his elder brother by his side for physical assistance to perform basic tasks. Four other cases During the meeting, four more similar cases were flagged where the MLCs wrongly stated that the victims had suffered minor injuries while the injuries were actually grave, resulting in inadequate compensation. The committee also sought response on six contentious videos that had surfaced during the riots, including one of a woman, Ragini Tiwari, who allegedly made provocative statements during a Facebook Live session on February 23. The government representative is said to have assured that the action taken report will be submitted in the next committee meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/riots-victim-pleads-case-for-higher-compensation/article32808898.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Baba ka Dhaba and the magic of social media||Kanta Prasad pulled down his mask every few minutes to reveal a nearly toothless smile, his eyes taking in with gratitude the crowds thronging his tiny food stall, Baba ka Dhaba, that was forlorn and empty till just a day ago, much as it had been through the last six months. On Thursday though, everything changed for the 80-year-old and his family that was on the brink of penury. Social media spun its magic with a video of Prasad tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown being shared widely across platforms — and customers made a beeline to eat his food as did camera crews, bloggers and journalists. Baba ka Dhaba, a little blue box at Malviya Nagar in south Delhi, was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebrities from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal. A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business. “Like everyday, my parents started cooking at 6 a.m. When they reached the shop at 8.30 a.m., they found people already lined up outside. For the first few hours, we sold only parathas and then prepared more items,” said Azad Hind, Prasad’s 37-year-old son. By 12 noon, all items on the menu, comprising chapati, rice, mixed vegetable, and paneer, all ranging between Rs. 10- Rs. 50, were sold out — much to their surprise and stupefaction. Before COVID-19 took its toll on businesses countrywide, Prasad would make enough to save Rs. 4,000- Rs. 5000 almost every month. His stall, which he has been running with his wife since the early 1990s, hit its nadir during the lockdown and in the weeks that followed. The elderly couple barely made enough to make ends meet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/baba-ka-dhaba-and-the-magic-of-social-media/article32808901.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Three members of ‘Lifafa gang’ arrested||Three members of ‘Lifafa gang’ were arrested for allegedly robbing people after giving them lift at a very low fare, the police said on Thursday. The accused have been identified as Bablu (36), a resident of New Ashok Nagar; Laxman (40), a resident of Paharganj and Sunil Kumar (32), a resident of Dallupura, they said. They used fake number plates during the commission of crime on Ring Road and national highways in Delhi. The accused used to target commuters waiting for conveyance to reach their destinations. They assured them to drop at their destination at low fare, the police said. During the journey, they used to take passengers in confidence and on the pretext of police checking, they managed to obtain their valuables in a lifafa [envelop] and later either exchange the envelop or if the passenger resisted, they would rob them of their belongings, a senior police officer said. Thereafter, they used to drop them on the way. On Wednesday, the police got a tip-off that a member of ‘Lifafa gang’ would visit Dhaula Kuan to commit robbery around 11 a.m.. “Around 11.40 a.m., the police spotted a car going towards Gurugram. After spotting policemen, the accused opened the front and rear gates of their car and tried to flee the spot, but were nabbed,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-West) Devender Arya said. One car, two loaded countrymade pistols, one silver chain and three live cartridges were recovered from their possession, the police said, adding that 19 yellow envelopes and two fake number plates were also recovered from the car. During interrogation, Bablu confessed to his involvement in several cases of robbery and cheating in various parts of Delhi. He also said that he used to keep a fake ID card with him to pose himself as a policeman to dupe passengers, the DCP said. One of their associates, Mahender, is absconding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/three-members-of-lifafa-gang-arrested-for-robbing-people/article32808906.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Air quality poor, likely to improve in coming days||The air quality of the city continued to be in the “poor” category on Thursday, after dropping into the category for the first time in over three months a day before, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. “AQI is forecast to be in the higher end of moderate to poor category for Friday. However, AQI is forecast to improve thereafter to the moderate category.

As per SAFAR, the fire count in the region was 399 on Wednesday. The boundary- layer wind direction and speed are favourable for transport of pollutants towards Delhi, but a shift in the wind direction is forecast and it is likely to extend the moderate air quality condition for a few more days. Environment Minister Gopal Rai launched a ‘war room’ at the Delhi secretariat on Thursday to monitor efforts to contain pollution, fumes and dust levels in hotspots. He said that the ‘war room’ will be equipped with “high-end technology” to monitor real-time pollution data, hotspot conditions, and NASA-ISRO images of stubble burning. Real-time data “The war room is fully equipped with technology to monitor real-time pollution data. Three large LCD screens are present across the room,” said Mr. Rai, who added that a 10-member expert team will operate from the war room.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/air-quality-poor-likely-to-improve-in-coming-days/article32809205.ece

He said, “The 520-km stretch between Nagpur and Shirdi will be thrown open for vehicular movement on May 1, 2021. Further extension of the stretch to Bhiwandi, which will take the road’s length to 623 km, will be completed by December 1, 2021. The entire expressway will be ready for use from May 1, 2022.” Mr. Mopalwar said of the Rs. 55,332 crore construction cost, Rs. 40,000 crore will be for carrying out engineering work. He said the development plan is ready for eight of the 19 townships that will come up along the e-way. “Land acquisition for six of them will be completed by June 2021. These townships can accommodate up to one lakh people. Various businesses and industries will be allowed to set up shop in these townships,” Mr. Mopalwar said. e-charging stations After every 40-50 km along the e-way, amenities and charging facilities for electric vehicles will be available. Mr. Mopalwar said an Integrated Traffic Management System will be set up to keep tabs on whether vehicles are speeding, observing lane discipline or suffering breakdowns. The e-way will have eight tunnels, viaducts, a bridge over the railway line, an underpass and an overpass to avoid obstructing the movement of wild animals. Officially named the Hindudridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway, the road will connect 10 districts, 26 tehsils and 392 villages. The e-way is expected to reduce the travel time between Mumbai and Nagpur to eight hours and boost business along it. The project was proposed by the previous BJP-led government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mumbai-nagpur-expressway-will-be-ready-by-may-2022-msrdc/article32808809.ece
09 October 2020||Navi Mumbai,||IPL betting gang busted; 11 arrested||The Local Crime Branch (LCB) of the Raigad police has busted a gang of 11 bookies who placed bets on matches in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), which kicked off on September 19 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On October 1, acting on a tip-off, police inspector Jamil Shaikh from the LCB raided a room in 007 Universe Resort at Khandpe in Karjat. The police found Kanti Karamsibhai Varsungiya (43), a resident of Kopri in Thane, and Prakash Popat Pujari (42), a resident of Mulund, placing bets on a match between Kings XI Punjab and Mumbai Indians. The police seized five mobile phones. During interrogation, the accused revealed that they used various mobile applications to place bets. They divulged the details of 20 mobile IDs, of which four were used for betting. The SIM card used by the accused was also registered in the name of someone else, the police said. “During the course of our investigations, we found that their modus operandi involved the main bookie creating 10 IDs using a super mastercard and distributing them to 10 other bookies. These bookies then use their mastercards to create 10 other IDs, which are given to gamblers, mostly based in UAE. The 10 bookies finalise the betting amount and then pass the information to the main bookie. Every Monday, they would calculate the loss and profit margin. Each mastercard had a limit on the money that could be spent based on the game and the bookie,” Mr. Shaikh said. The police then went on to arrest nine more bookies from Mumbai and Thane. “The main bookie is yet to be arrested. More than five bookies are wanted and based in Gujarat, Bengaluru and Dubai. Two teams have been sent to Bengaluru and Gujarat to trace them,” Additional Superintendent of Police Sachin Gunjal said. The accused have been arrested on charges of cheating and forgery under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the IT Act. The accused have been remanded in police custody till Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ipl-betting-gang-busted-11-arrested/article32808811.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Infection spreading from offices to families, notes NCDC report||Contact tracing of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi has been “very limited since the beginning” and it needs to be “more rationalised”, said a report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and submitted to the Delhi government. The report titled Revised Strategy for control of COVID-19 version 3.0 , which is yet to be made public , also noted that with the resumption of economic activities, workplaces are becoming “hotspots” and infection is spreading from workplaces to families. “Identification of workplace clusters for saturation testing after risk assessment should be undertaken on priority by all districts,” the report said. On patients being ‘brought dead’ to hospitals, the report said that to “some extent” this could be attributed to “gaps” in the system and “delay” in accessing healthcare. Critical care “Mortality analysis of three Central government hospitals revealed that patients brought dead comprise 15% in RML, 6.5% in SJH and 44.6% in Lady Hardinge. Although dramatic course of illness is inevitable, but to some extent it could be attributed to system gaps in proper triaging/selection of patients to put under home isolation and delay in accessing critical care,” said the report, seen by The Hindu . It has also pointed out multiple shortcomings in the fight against the virus. ‘7-10 contacts only’ “Contact tracing activities in Delhi have been very limited since the beginning. The number of contacts traced per positive cases on an average remained only 7-10 per contact,” the report stated. It also said that the fatality rate in Delhi (1.9%) is higher than the national average (1.5%), and mortality rate of under 15 and people between 16-44 years of age is a “concern”. The report was prepared in consultation with an expert group headed by V.K Paul, member of NITI Aayog. Last month, L-G Anil Baijal had asked for a revised plan to fight the virus.  The report said that scaling up of daily COVID-19 testing in the city has “not been specific”. “Increase in number of tests should be reflected in increased case finding. Merely increasing number of tests to reduce positivity rate would not be appropriate,” the report said, adding that majority of testing has been done in camps at railway stations and bus stands and hence the majority of people tested are “asymptomatic”. The report said that positivity rate of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is 4.3%, while that of RT-PCR is 20.2%. This again underlines that RT-PCR is more accurate, but the Delhi government has been heavily dependent on RAT. The High Court has also asked the government to increase RT-PCR testing. The report said that criteria for scaling up of testing should be based on positivity of each district and preferably ward level, and should not be “target driven”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/infection-spreading-from-offices-to-families-notes-ncdc-report/article32808802.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||Submit relevant judgments in support of plea, HC tells Karat||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat, who is seeking registration of FIR against Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Pravesh Verma for their alleged hate speeches in relation to anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh here, to submit relevant judgments in support of her plea. Justice Yogesh Khanna has posted the case for further hearing on November 2. Requisite sanction Ms. Karat has challenged an August 26 order of a trial court here rejecting her plea for registration of FIR against the BJP leaders on the ground that the requisite sanction from the competent authority, the Central government, was not obtained. Ms Karat’s counsel Siddarth Aggarwal claimed that a cognisable offence is made out against the BJP leaders and an FIR should be lodged against them for their alleged hate speeches. Advocate Mr. Aggarwal submitted that his client’s complaint was kept pending before the trial court for nine months and later, the trial court rejected the plea without even going into the merits of the case. Mr. Aggarwal argued that the magistrate has refused to exercise the jurisdiction, which the law vests on him. The trial court in its order had stated that prior sanction of competent authority — Central government — is required as per Section 196 the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) at the stage of ordering of registration of FIR as both Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma are MPs. Ms. Karat’s plea contended that when the State and the police have pointedly excused the speeches of the accused and other persons, the only recourse available to her was judicial. The judicial recourse has been barred by the trial court without considering that the very State that is supportive of the accused persons would function as the sanctioning authority, the plea argued. Ms. Karat had sought registration of FIR against the leaders under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC. Ms. Karat had stated that Mr. Thakur raised provocative chants during a rally. The complaint stated that Mr. Verma gave false, provocative and communal statements against the Shaheen Bagh protesters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/submit-relevant-judgments-in-support-of-plea-hc-tells-karat/article32808795.ece
09 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Rules framed to tackle fake news on social media’||The Central government has informed the Delhi High Court that it was aware of the dangers of fake news on social media platforms, and accordingly necessary guidelines have been framed under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in an affidavit filed before the court, stated that any unlawful content on social media platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, can be removed either by an order of the court, or a government notification or by the company’s grievance officers. The grievance officer under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules is bound to redress any complaint relating to unlawful content within one month. ‘No clear mechanism’ The Ministry’s submission came in response to a petition filed by former RSS ideologue K.N. Govindacharya seeking removal of fake news and hate speech being circulated on social media and online platforms. Mr. Govindacharya, in his petition filed through advocate Virag Gupta, has alleged that social media platforms “have become a haven for hate speech” and in the absence of details of designated officers, there is “no clear mechanism to enforce justice”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rules-framed-to-tackle-fake-news-on-social-media/article32808796.ece

Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said civic bodies had been instructed to de-seal all the properties sealed by the committee before Diwali. “To reduce bureaucracy, a single file will be made for all the properties sealed in one zone, single instruction will be made and all the properties will be de-sealed by the civic bodies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-begins-de-sealing-campaign/article32808800.ece
09 October 2020||Pune,||VBA backs Oct. 10 shutdown to push for Maratha quota||While stating that the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) would be extending support to the shutdown called by Maratha outfits in the State on October 10, VBA chief Prakash Ambedkar hit out at the two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs from the royal families purporting to represent the interests of the Maratha community. Speaking in Pune, Mr. Ambedkar came down especially hard on Udayanraje Bhosale, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Satara and direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, castigating him as an ‘imbecile’. Mr. Bhosale had earlier called for all reservation to be abolished if the Maharashtra government failed to ensure implementation of the Maratha quota law in the State — a statement that irked Mr. Ambedkar. Mr. Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, claimed that he had not read anywhere of either Mr. Bhosale or Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje — the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Kolhapur — expressing their support for the shutdown.  Questioning Bhosale “I wonder how a dolt like MP [Udayanraje Bhosale], who does not understand the Indian Constitution, was sent by the BJP to the Upper House… how can he demand for all reservation to be scrapped if the Maratha quota law does not get implemented in the State?” said the VBA leader. Expressing his support for the shutdown, Mr. Ambedkar said that community leader Suresh Patil of the Maratha Arakshan Action Samiti had allegedly called him to demand support for their rally on Saturday. “I have accordingly discussed the issue with my office-bearers and activists. We have decided to extend our support for the shutdown with the understanding that the Maratha community will not demand their quota from the pre-existing reservation for the OBC [Other Backward Classes] community as they are separate things,” said Mr. Ambedkar. Tense atmosphere The VBA chief further cautioned that given the tense situation prevailing in the State over the Maratha quota issue, there was a distinct possibility that social harmony between the Maratha community and the OBC community could fray if the former insisted on getting their benefits from those already granted to the backward communities. Mr. Ambedkar’s comments on Mr. Bhosale evoked a predictably furious response from the latter’s supporters, who raised slogans against him in Satara. “Mr. Ambedkar’s condemnable remarks are an insult to the Chhatrapati’s throne… Maharashtra will not tolerate such regrettable statements,” said the Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra minister, Shamburaj Desai, who is an MLA from Satara. Mr. Desai said both descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji had clarified their position on the reservation issue. ‘Unwarranted remarks’ While welcoming the VBA’s support for the shutdown on Saturday, Mr. Patil said that Mr. Ambedkar’s remarks concerning Mr. Bhosale were “regrettable” and utterly unwarranted.  How can Udayanraje Bhosale demand for all reservation to be scrapped if the Maratha quota law does not get implemented?

09 October 2020||Pune,||Active COVID-19 cases down to 2.41 lakh in Maharashtra||Maharashtra reported 13,395 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday as opposed to 15,575 patients being discharged, keeping up the heartening trend of recoveries outpacing new cases.

So far, two people have been nabbed in connection with the crime on February 3. Three people had allegedly attacked two watchmen on duty at the bungalow at Parsik Hill in Mumbra town and stolen taps and pipes, a police spokesman said. One of the watchmen was seriously injured and he died a couple weeks later, following which sections related to murder were added in the case, an official from Mumbra police station said. On Wednesday, acting on a tip-off, the police laid a trap in Vitawa area of Thane and nabbed the accused, Ganpat Falanaswami Gullar (20), a resident of Kalwa township. Earlier, a few days after the incident, the police had arrested one of the accused, Sanjay Bhandari. A case has been registered under Sections 302 (murder), 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

09 October 2020||Washington,||Pandemic dominates Harris-Pence debate||Against the backdrop of a raging pandemic that has claimed more than 2,10,000 lives across the country, Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris faced off in the only V-P debate of the season in Salt Lake City, Utah. With acrylic sheet barriers beside their desks — a reminder of the public health crisis the nation faces — the candidates sparred on the Trump administration’s pandemic response, the economy, climate, China and Ms. Harris’s prosecutorial record. Ms. Harris described the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic as “the greatest failure” of any administration in U.S. history and said — citing investigative journalist Bob Woodward — that the President knew about the viral threat at the end of January (weeks before a public emergency was declared). She said the administration still did not have a plan to tackle the pandemic. “And frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to re-election based on this,” Ms. Harris said. The debate was noticeably civil and involved some substantive policy discussions unlike the presidential debate last week between President Donald Trump and his challenger, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Also noticeable — and discussed on social media and in the press — was a fly that landed on Mr. Pence’s head during the debate. Mr. Pence said Mr. Biden, if elected President, was going to raise taxes and that he was going to ban fracking, prompting Ms. Harris to declare — twice — that Mr. Biden would not raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 a year and would not ban fracking. Mr. Pence said Mr. Biden was a “cheerleader for Communist China”. Ms. Harris said the Trump administration had lost its trade war with China and that had an impact on the U.S. economy and jobs. Dodging questions Candidates avoided answering questions — Ms. Harris repeatedly did not answer a question on whether or not her party would “pack the court” (increase the number of Supreme Court justices from nine) if Republicans confirmed judge Amy Coney Barret to the court. There were instances of Mr. Pence providing information on one subject when he was asked about another. The Vice President refused to answer whether climate change was an existential crisis. “The climate is changing, we’ll follow the science,” he said. The Trump administration has often questioned the role of science as a basis of policy making. In September, at a meeting with state officials in California to discuss the wildfires ravaging the West Coast, Mr. Trump had said, “I don’t think the science knows.” Ms. Harris defended a hypothetical Biden-Harris administration’s decision to join the Paris climate accord and said they would do so “with pride”. Mr. Pence also did not elaborate on how the pre-existing health conditions would be covered in any alternative plan to the Obama-era Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which the Trump administration is litigating in the Supreme Court. “If you have a pre-existing condition..., heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you,” Ms. Harris had said during the debate. “If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition, they’re coming for you. If you’re under the age of 26 on your parents’ coverage, they’re coming for you,” she said. Transfer of power When asked a question on what he would do if Mr. Trump refused to accept the election results, Mr. Pence did not provide a straight answer, instead saying that the Republicans were going to win the election. “When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election,” Mr. Pence said, referring, among other things, to the impeachment of Mr. Trump by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. Responding to a similar question on the Biden-Harris strategy if Mr. Trump refused to accept the results, Ms. Harris said: “Please vote. Vote early, come up with a plan to vote.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pandemic-dominates-harris-pence-debate/article32808481.ece
09 October 2020||COLOMBO/CHENNAI,||High-powered Chinese delegation visits Sri Lanka||In what is said to be the first outbound visit by top Chinese officials to South Asia since the outbreak of COVID-19, a senior Chinese delegation will meet Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Colombo on Friday. A “high-powered Chinese delegation”, led by senior Chinese leader and top foreign policy official Yang Jiechi, who is a member of the Communist Party of China’s Politburo and the director of the Central Committee’s Foreign Affairs Commission, the top policy-making body, will arrive in Colombo on Thursday night, the Foreign Ministry in Colombo said in a statement. “Being the first ever Chinese visit in the South Asian region since the global coronavirus epidemic, the visit is expected to strengthen cooperation between Sri Lanka and China, in the areas of combating the global pandemic and revival of economic relations,” the statement said. Four-nation tour Sri Lanka will be Mr. Yang’s first stop on a four-nation tour, which will also see him visit the UAE, Algeria and Serbia, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, adding he was invited by the governments of the four countries. The visit takes place against the backdrop of worsening India-China relations and rising U.S.-China tensions, and a push by Beijing following the pandemic to deepen its economic ties in the neighbourhood, including through cooperation to battle the impact of COVID-19, a move that is being closely followed in both New Delhi and Washington. The Chinese delegation’s meeting with Sri Lanka’s two most powerful leaders comes a fortnight after the virtual summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Mahinda Rajapaksa. It also comes days after the ‘Quad’ meeting in Tokyo, where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to “regional tensions” between India and China. Debt freeze New Delhi, in the bilateral summit, promised Colombo a $15-million grant for the promotion of Buddhist cultural exchanges. However, there was no final word on Colombo’s request for a debt freeze and an additional $1.1-billion currency swap facility — RBI signed one for $400 million in July — that President Gotabaya and PM Mahinda have sought from New Delhi. In March this year, Sri Lanka and China signed a “facility agreement” for a $500 million loan, on Colombo’s request. In Friday’s meetings, the two sides will likely discuss strengthening economic cooperation, specifically looking at ongoing Chinese-backed projects such as the $1.4 billion port city coming up on over 650 acres of reclaimed land by the seafront in Colombo. Mr. Yang arrives in the midst of an unusual China-U.S. spat playing out in Sri Lanka. In a statement on October 5, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo slammed the U.S. for “naked hegemony, supremacy and power politics” after the American Ambassador in Colombo, Alaina Teplitz, in an interview with local media, criticised Chinese projects in Sri Lanka. “The U.S. believes that partnerships between countries should be open, transparent, and mutually beneficial — and if this is what Sri Lanka’s relationship with China embodies, then we encourage it,” she said, adding that “a 2019 World Bank study concluded that more than 60% of China-funded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects are allocated to Chinese companies and stressed that tender processes are opaque.” The Chinese Embassy responded strongly, saying the interview “severely violated the diplomatic protocol”. “While it’s always not surprising to see the U.S. interfered into a sovereign country’s internal affairs, the general public is still astonished to witness its despicable attempt to manipulate others’ diplomatic relations,” the statement said. Chinese analysts have welcomed the return of the Rajapaksas to the helm, with PM Rajapaksa’s stint at President marking a rapid deepening in strategic and economic ties. Last month, both countries marked the six-year anniversary of the Colombo Port City project, which had been launched by Mr. Rajapaksa and President Xi Jinping in September 2014 as a flagship project in China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Marking the anniversary, China’s official Xinhua news agency said last month the project “has powered through a turbulent six-year period, overcoming numerous challenges, including the Easter bombings in April 2019 hitting three luxury hotels near the project and affecting the country’s tourism, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the country less than a year later.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/high-powered-chinese-delegation-visits-sri-lanka/article32808479.ece
09 October 2020||WASHINGTON,||U.S. wants early return of troops from Afghanistan||All U.S. troops in Afghanistan should be “home by Christmas,” President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, just hours after his national security adviser said Washington would reduce its forces in Afghanistan to 2,500 by early next year. A landmark deal between the United States and the Taliban in February said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government. Mr. Trump and other officials have said the United States will go down to between 4,000 and 5,000 troops in Afghanistan around November. Beyond that, officials have said that a reduction will depend on conditions in Afghanistan. On Twitter, Mr. Trump said: “We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!” It was unclear whether Mr. Trump was giving an order or verbalising a long-held aspiration. Mr. Trump, who is seeking re-election next month, has made walking away from “ridiculous endless wars” the cornerstone of his foreign policy, even though thousands of troops remain in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The Taliban, fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish their Islamic state since their ouster in 2001, welcomed Mr. Trump’s comments. The U.S. President’s statement was “a positive step towards the implementation of the Doha agreement”, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem said in a statement, referring to the February pact signed in the Qatari capital. The Afghan government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-wants-early-return-of-troops-from-afghanistan/article32809124.ece
09 October 2020||Stockholm,||American poet Louise Gluck wins Nobel Literature Prize||American poet Louise Gluck won the 2020 Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday, an unexpected choice known for themes of childhood and family life that draw inspiration from myths and classical motifs. Ms. Gluck, 77, was honoured “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal,” the Academy said. Ms. Gluck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for her collection The Wild Iris and the National Book Award for her latest collection, Faithful and Virtuous Night , in 2014. Ms. Gluck was not seen as a favourite for the Nobel in the run-up to Thursday’s announcement. The chair of the Academy’s Nobel committee, Anders Olsson, lamented that she was not more well-known, “at least outside the US’ borders”, and had not been translated into many other languages. She is the fourth woman to win the Nobel Literature Prize in the past decade — after Olga Tokarczuk, Svetlana Alexievich and Alice Munro — and only the 16th since the Nobel prizes were first awarded in 1901. A professor of English at Yale University, Ms. Gluck “seeks the universal, and in this she takes inspiration from myths and classical motifs, present in most of her works,” the Academy said in its prize citation. “The voices of Dido, Persephone, and Eurydice — the abandoned, the punished, the betrayed —are masks for a self in transformation, as personal as it is universally valid.” Natural tone Her collections The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990) address “almost brutally straightforward images of painful family relations”, the jury said, noting that her use of a “deceptively natural tone is striking”, with “no trace of poetic ornament.” Ms. Gluck is also a poet of radical change and rebirth, describing in her poem Snowdrops the miraculous return of life after winter, her work often marked by “humour and biting wit”. The jury said her 2006 collection Averno was a “masterly collection, a visionary interpretation of the myth of Persephone’s descent into Hell in the captivity of Hades, the god of death.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/american-poet-louise-gluck-wins-nobel-literature-prize/article32808472.ece

The shakeup comes a week before Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were set to square off for the second presidential debate in Miami. Mr. Biden’s campaign insisted its candidate was ready to move forward, but the future of the event is now in serious doubt. The Commission on Presidential Debates made the decision unilaterally, citing the need “to protect the health and safety of all involved with the debate.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-rejects-virtual-debate-with-biden/article32808482.ece
09 October 2020||COLOMBO,||Indo-Lanka Accord can’t be thrown away: Tamil MP||A fortnight after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a virtual summit with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, urged the country to address Tamil aspirations with the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Tamil MPs questioned the government’s commitment to the preceding Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987. Jaffna legislator and All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) general secretary G.G. Ponnambalam told Parliament his party rejected the contentious legislation on the basis that it “does not even form a starting point” to finding a solution to the Tamil national question. The ACTC has two legislators in the 225-member House. However, observing that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa might think that because [some] Tamil people reject the 13th Amendment, they have an opportunity to “throw away” the preceding Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, he said: “That will never happen.” Mr. Ponnambalam pointed to a “massive gap” between the Accord and the 13th Amendment that he called a “unilateral interpretation” of the bilateral agreement by the then J.R. Jayawardene government. “Therefore, whilst we reject the 13th Amendment... the Accord is something we will not reject. On the contrary, we will hold India to account that it upholds the provisions of the Accord,” the Jaffna MP said,. Reiterating his point on the Accord, M.A. Sumanthiran, fellow Jaffna MP, said the agreement “has to be honoured”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indo-lanka-accord-cant-be-thrown-away-tamil-mp/article32808477.ece
09 October 2020||Athens,||Court to rule on Golden Dawn leaders||A Greek court on Thursday will deliver eagerly-awaited sentences after leaders of neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn were found guilty of running a criminal outfit in a landmark case, a court source said. The court is also expected to announce whether judges would accept any mitigating terms in passing sentences, said the source, who wished to remain anonymous. After over five years of hearings, the panel of three judges on Wednesday unanimously labelled the paramilitary party a criminal organisation in what was seen as the most important political trial in decades. The verdict translates into possible prison sentences of up to 15 years for the top members of the party, including its founder Nikos Michaloliakos. Unless the court on Thursday agrees to suspend sentencing pending appeals, police are standing by to take those convicted to prison, a source said. Key crimes carried out by Golden Dawn are the 2013 cold-blooded murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas and the beating of Egyptian fishermen in 2012 and communist trade unionists in 2013, the court established.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/court-to-rule-on-golden-dawn-top-brass/article32808473.ece

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Should Indian startups take on global Internet giants?||Online payments company PayTM recently announced that it was building a ‘Mini App Store’ which would ‘empower Indian developers’. This move came days after PayTM was removed from Google’s Play Store over apparent violation of its policies. Though it was reinstated later, PayTM and several other Indian Internet startups allege that Google is using its market dominance to arbitrarily enforce policies and target competitors. The Play Store is the key app store for Google’s Android operating system, which runs over 90% of smartphones in India. Google also announced that it will start enforcing a 30% commission on all payments made for digital services in apps from its Play Store. Though the implementation of this plan has since been postponed to next year, it has caused much heartburn in the Indian startup environment. There is discontent brewing against tech giants in their home country as well, with a similar tussle going on between Apple and some game developers in the U.S., and the government readying an anti-trust lawsuit against Google. In a conversation moderated byP.J. George, Thillai Rajan and Jayadevan P.K. discuss whether the Indian startup ecosystem is ready to take on the giants on whom they are dependent for crucial infrastructure. Edited excerpts:  The Internet startups in India are in the initial stages of banding together to take on the likes of Google and Facebook. Has the Indian startup environment matured enough for such a fight? Thillai Rajan:Yes, definitely the Indian startup has matured enough. The growth of mobile phones, particularly smartphones, has been significant in the last decade. And as the market has grown, naturally the service providers and the app developers have also grown. So we have an ecosystem that’s very active with a large number of consumers and service providers. What is missing has been the infrastructure piece. But in some ways, we have also been able to develop expertise in infrastructure; for example, on payment gateways. Since demonetisation and other changes, payment gateways have become substantially stronger. Today, I think the Indian startup environment is mature. But one thing we need to be cognisant of is that, if we’re really looking at competing effectively with the likes of Google and Facebook, then we need to be well prepared. We need to build like-for-like capabilities, the way Google has done over the years. Jayadevan P.K.:India’s startup ecosystem is still in its first innings. The U.S. has been playing this match over and over again. Even markets like China have evolved and raced past India. Just to give you one data point, in the fourth quarter of 2019, you had $34.2 billion of venture capital going into the U.S. market. India had only $6 billion and that’s supposed to be a record-breaking quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, we had only $2 billion. From a product point of view, we don’t have the infrastructure that is required to build and scale nimble startups, at least not yet. For example, a lot of startups are launched on Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud, or on Microsoft Azure. India doesn’t have large infrastructure players that can help set up stuff. Everybody in the Indian startup ecosystem knows that we’re not there yet. So, do we want to take on these giants? I would argue that we should not compete, but cooperate. It is best for a country like India to have an approach where we compete when it makes sense, on a level playing field; and cooperate and take help from whatever quarters it comes from. Do we need an Indian app store? There is obviously always a case for more competition in the market but an app store is a very tricky challenge to take on. It is the expression of a bunch of things that have come before it, which is your hardware. India has zero strength in hardware. We have practically no real manufacturing or chipmaking. That said, we have companies like Indus OS which have built app stores, and have about 100 million users. That’s a sizeable population, but it’s still not deep enough to be like a Google or Amazon which coexist in an ecosystem like India. So, my view is we don’t need to take a confrontational approach. Google has a near 100% dominance in the app marketplace in India. What are the implications of the company having such a hold on the Indian market? Is it monopoly, or is it ‘the bigger, the better’? JPK:Why does Google work? There is an element of trust that Google’s invested in building up. Its products are user-friendly. It has also spent a lot of time expanding the market by localising its products. So, from that point of view, Google has been investing in the Indian market. Now, from an Indian entrepreneur’s point of view, the concern is legitimate. Are we paying too much to access our own users by giving a 30% cut to Google when you are selling a service or a product through an app on the Google App Store? These companies also have to advertise via Google to reach their customer base. In effect, a large chunk of all the money that these companies make goes to Google and Facebook. The challenge is that India as a market itself is poor, in the sense that it doesn’t have enough spending capacity. For digital services to take off and be profitable and viable, one of the thumb rules that several companies talk about is that the GDP per capita should be above $4,000. For example, in markets like Indonesia, where the GDP per capita recently touched $4,000, companies have also been growing profitably and faster. India is still at about $2,000 to $2,500. So, here your potential to monetise this user is very low. If you end up spending a ton of money on distribution and on your commissions to Google and others, you end up with practically nothing. That’s the challenge that entrepreneurs have been flagging. Google has been reasonable, I think. After the PayTM fiasco, Google has come back and said that it will revisit the 30% commission policy some time next year. TR:One of the raison d’etre for businesses is to create shareholder value. The mechanisms by which shareholder value is created keep changing as the company moves across its life cycle. Startup companies create value by being innovative. Bigger companies like Google and Facebook create shareholder value by building barriers that startups cannot afford to create. They have much larger tools in their arsenal to be able to create barriers. One of the tools they use is to buy all competition to ensure that they stay in the market and create shareholder value. Now, the question is, when does the consumer benefit? Is it going to be in the short term or in the long term? In the short term, the consumers will benefit because as the bigger companies assimilate these innovations, these innovations become stronger and the bigger companies can use their infrastructure to make them available to a larger number of people. But what happens in the long term? As the stickiness of the services increases, and the consumers find it very difficult to break away, there’s something called a creeping expropriation of consumer surplus. Gradually, the billings start rising and consumers end up paying more because there is not enough competition in the market. To overcome these circumstances, the Competition Commission of India and others ensure that the monopoly position is not being abused by companies. For example, they can ensure that the companies don’t overcharge or they can ensure that the companies are split into different smaller entities. It is going to be a very dynamic interaction between the size of the companies and the regulatory framework in countries to ensure that the competition as well as the consumers benefit. The Department of Justice in the U.S. is gearing up for anti-trust action against Google. What is the best play for the Indian government in such a scenario? Is it stricter regulation or is it better to leave it to the markets and hope an Indian giant develops to take on the Silicon Valley giants? JPK:Companies like Google or Amazon also do not operate like a foreign entity. They have set up base in India and have a stake in the market; which means they also work with policymakers. I would like to think that it’s good to have these foreign competitors who are willing to abide by local laws. We also cannot have too much of reactive policymaking against them as it doesn’t signal well for attracting foreign investors. Also, it is a slippery slope to be nationalistic about products that are built for the Internet, which is global. If we create a very strict policy environment which encourages only local Indian innovation and tries to stave off foreign competition, I suspect we are going to end up with subpar products, and large industrialists capturing policy. It’s a very tricky balancing act, where you have on the one side investments that these larger companies are making and on the other side, you have to think of Indian companies. Now, the truth is that a lot of these Indian companies are also funded by Chinese or U.S. investors. So, it’s not as easy as saying ‘I’m an Indian company and I want regulations for India.’ TR:We cannot just hope for it to happen. There has to be a conscious strategy. In the technology sector so far, in the Indian context or even in Silicon Valley, the role of the government has been very little. We could probably take the example of what the government in China does. Specific technologies and companies that developed these technologies are chosen; and then there is unwavering support from the government. The government does it in multiple ways, such as giving domestic startups favourable access to the market, giving them an opportunity to grow and to stabilise their offerings. There is a conscious strategy to develop a giant that can compete with the global leaders. Today, we are looking at these kinds of long-drawn-out strategies in other areas; for example, in winning gold in the Olympic Games. People are trying to put a programme in place so that we just don’t hope that an athlete or a sportsperson will win a gold, but we are able to work towards that in a very planned manner, so that the results are there in a time frame that we have chosen. I think that is a good way to go up against Google. However, you cannot compete with what Google is today. Because, it may take us, let’s say, five years to be where Google is now; and in five years, Google would have moved away from what it is today. So to be able to compete with Google, we will have to be where Google is going to be five years from now. That requires significant time to plan and execute our strategies. Then it is not a question of this or that — but doing both. If there are any antitrust actions globally, join those right now or provide overt support to ensure that dominant positions are not misused. At the same time, create a programme to ensure that we are able to create an Indian giant.  You cannot compete with what Google is today. Because, it may take us, say, five years to be where Google is now; and in five years, Google would have moved away from what it is today. So to be able to compete with Google, we will have to be where Google is going to be five years from now.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Hathras, a new phase in the caste atrocity narrative||The gang rape that took place recently in Bul Garhi, a tiny village near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, marks a new phase in the eventful history of rape-as-caste-atrocity in the 21st century. The idea of the caste atrocity is itself a product of the last quarter of the 20th century. The new republic took some time to realise that nothing is changed by granting passive legal rights to people who are actively treated as unequal. This is especially true when the responsibility for the enforcement of these new rights rests mainly upon those who believe that the old inequalities are part of their legitimate caste-inheritance. Criminalising the ‘legitimate’ A provisional answer to this dilemma emerges through the notion of the caste atrocity, and a new law — the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (https://bit.ly/2SCkW1Q) . The Act highlights the truth that an extraordinary law is needed to criminalise practices that were considered ordinary and legitimate not so long ago. The term “atrocity”, like its predecessor “untouchability”, is not defined in the law, which only refers to a list (under Section 3 of the Act) of practices — ranging from extremes such as being forced to eat excreta, to varied forms of routinised humiliation and discrimination, including economic boycott, social exclusion, sexual violence and political disenfranchisement. The difficult process of redefining (some) traditional practices as modern crimes is where we must begin in order to understand the place of rape within the larger spectrum of the caste atrocity. In rural society, the sexual “availability” of lower caste women to upper caste men is included in the intangible forms of caste capital that go with tangible forms such as land or wealth. Tensions arise when intangible caste entitlements begin to meet resistance rather than resignation. Upper caste outrage at being robbed of an inheritance is forced to adopt an oblique dog-whistle kind of language that must, paradoxically, deny the relevance of caste and highlight the agency of the lower caste woman, albeit in biased ways. In response, lower caste rage against accumulated humiliations is compelled to insist on the perennial presence of caste and its unique pathology above all other co-morbidities. These reactions are neither equal nor symmetrical. Patterns of denial Contemporary thinking on caste-rape was jump-started by the infamous 1995 judgment of the Rajasthan High Court in the Bhanwari Devi gang rape case, which held that upper caste men could never rape a lower caste woman because they would not touch her. By explicitly invoking caste to deny rape, the judgment provided an instructive and stark contrast to the persistent denial of caste in rape cases involving Dalit women, especially after the Prevention of Atrocities Act came into force. The classic instance of caste denial was the Khairlanji case of 2006. Anand Teltumbde’s ( The Persistence of Caste: The Khairlanji Murders & India’s Hidden Apartheid ) careful reconstruction establishes the undeniable centrality of caste in the ongoing enmity between Surekha Bhotmange, a Mahar woman, and her Kunbi opponents. Surekha’s assertiveness and the upward mobility of her family had narrowed the social distance between the two castes to a level that was unbearable for the dominant Kunbis. Following the horrific sexual assault and murders of Surekha, her daughter and two sons, the Nagpur High Court judgment insisted that it was a revenge killing that had nothing to do with caste. The ‘Nirbhaya’ impact The next phase in the evolution of caste denial arrives with Delhi’s ‘Nirbhaya’ fatal gang rape in December 2012. Between 2012 and 2013, neighbouring Haryana witnessed a relentless succession of rapes, gang rapes, sexual assaults and murders of Dalit women and girls, significant enough to be reflected in National Crime Records Bureau data. Public and media responses to the Haryana rapes were muted in the face of all the attention to the Delhi gang rape, but they were not silenced, as they had been initially in Khairlanji. Haryana did see local mobilisations by Dalit activist groups and support from some Delhi-based Dalit and women’s organisations. Several cases were successfully filed despite opposition from the all-powerful Jat community, to which most of the accused belonged. A common tactic of the accused was to try and turn every rape case into one of consensual sex, and every murder into suicide. This was accompanied by the denial of caste regardless of the identity of victim or perpetrator. When out of court settlements or compromises failed, caste details were invariably removed from the records, and the Prevention of Atrocities Act was not allowed to be applied. The recent Bul Garhi case seems to be breaking with earlier patterns. In an eerie coincidence, its as yet unnamed victim died on September 29, exactly 14 years after Surekha Bhotmange and her children were killed on September 29, 2006. In continuity with the past, we have a Dalit (Balmiki) young woman allegedly raped, battered, maimed, and left to die by dominant caste (Thakur) men, and the familiar initial attempts at cover-up and denial. But everything else is a contrast. The State’s response Instead of acting as passive facilitators for the accused as they have usually done, the police here take on the role of an active accomplice. In what later proves to be a decisive moment, they forcibly cremate the body and do not allow the family to conduct the last rites. This shockingly heartless act triggers a wave of revulsion, and conversely, a surge of support for the dead victim and her family. But the truly stunning performance is that of the State Chief Minister who stands caste denial on its head by claiming that protests against the incident are acts of sedition, part of a foreign-funded conspiracy to foment caste riots, motivated by jealousy of his State’s development record. Cases are lodged against every political party that organised a protest, but public meetings in support of the accused are allowed. Just as the Haryana cases were in the shadow of Nirbhaya, the Bul Garhi case is part of the larger context defined by the post 2019 Modi-Shah 2.0 regime. So it is surprising, but not unbelievable, that the tactics being used against the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests are being deployed here as well. Some hope This is a new trajectory. The caste-rape itself is brushed aside without comment, and it is the responses to it that are accused of instigating a caste war. There are, however, some unprecedented positives. An anonymous dead woman has invited mass identification with a Dalit cause for the first time since Rohith Vemula. Moreover, Dalit women’s voices have a prominent place in the protests. And finally, the Bul Garhi caste-rape-murder has triggered the first mass demonstrations since the anti-CAA movement. This is going to be a long and interesting century. Mary E.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Keeping vigil even during unusual times||The latest India-specific data on COVID-19 infections is alarming. With the nation spending substantial resources to manage the pandemic, what is the role of the supreme audit institution of India, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India? In this context, the move, in August, where the Karnataka State Legislature’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) directed the CAG to conduct a special audit into the purchase of COVID-19 equipment within 15 days, and where the PAC chairman H.K. Patil ‘chaired a meeting of the panel and instructed the CAG to constitute a special team of its employees to get the audit of all purchases of COVID-19 equipment’ highlights the role and significance of the national audit office in these unusual times. The panel also asked the CAG to ‘conduct an audit of expenditure incurred by the State government under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The government had used the SDRF amount for purchase of equipment in various districts’. Opportunity for graft The political allegation that funds (to the tune of Rs. 2,000 crore) were siphoned off to purchase inferior quality of personal protective equipment kits, sanitisers, ventilators, masks and other equipment at prices higher than those prevailing in the market is a serious one. The opportunity to indulge in corruption exists in disaster management. Emergency procurement to save lives and reduce sufferings are a chance to obfuscate rules and procedures, and can happen in all three tiers of governance — the Union, the States and Union Territories, urban local bodies, rural local bodies and government agencies engaged in procurement at all levels. Mr. Patil has also petitioned the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission alleging the violation of rights of people during treatment. If all the major purchases by government entities at all levels are audited by the CAG, there can be substantial improvement in disaster management. It will usher in better transparency, integrity, honesty, effective service delivery and compliance with rules and procedures and governance. A constitutional mandate The CAG has the inescapable constitutional and statutory mandate and responsibility to ensure public accountability, transparency, effective service delivery and good governance. The management of a pandemic is not an exception to this; though in the expediency of saving lives and alleviating suffering, there can be reasonable exceptions to compliance with established rules and standard operating procedures in procurement. People’s health is a priority audit theme and so is big-ticket public expenditure. The CAG has issued an order creating a new vertical — health, welfare and rural development on June 1, restructuring the office of the Director General of Audit, Central Expenditure. It is necessary that the CAG undertakes performance audits of COVID-19 related procurements, the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Employee State Insurance (ESI) hospitals. Audit objectives may include the procurement of equipment and drugs for CGHS wellness centres and polyclinics, laboratories and hospitals. For example, based on available reports, the CGHS provides health-care facilities to about 34.19 lakh beneficiaries, including government employees, pensioners and MPs, incurring an expense of Rs. 5,113 crore, almost half of its total expenditure on drugs from 2014-15 to 2018-19. A beneficiary survey will become part of the audit process to bring out efficacy of service delivery and the availability and quality of drugs. Auditing ESI hospitals and dispensaries is expected to provide the assured health-care services including infection control and hygiene. The government entities must have established and effective controls over expenses to purchase equipment. Since the lockdown, there has been substantial government expenditure. Audit recommendations can contribute improvements in various aspects of disaster preparedness, management and mitigation. As in the rules, all governments and government agencies must have established effective controls over disaster preparedness and management and related expenses (with proper documentation). As the CAG’s performance audits are driven by economy, efficiency and effectiveness, the audit will focus on expense tracking and achievement of outputs and outcome, in qualitative and quantitative terms. The entire process of procurement of COVID-19-related equipment and drugs, proper documentation, and compliance with rules and regulations can be streamlined with data analysis, valuable inputs and practical recommendations. Benefits of an inspection There are usually red flags in disaster management, emergency procurement and related expenditures. Though COVID-19 is an unparalleled disaster, it may also provide an opportunity for scamsters to siphon off public money where normal and prudential financial regulations cannot be fully enforced and questions of inconsistencies are likely to be overlooked. The statutory responsibility of CAG as an independent, objective, and non-partisan constitutional authority includes appraising disaster preparedness, ensuring that management, mitigation operations, procedures are complied with, and proper internal controls are in place; ensuring that there are proper records, documentation, authentic, accurate, reliable and complete information and data; providing assurance to people’s representatives, tax payers and the public at large that government resources, including funds and assets are being used prudentially as per the law and regulations and safeguarded; providing assurance that risks are assessed, identified and minimised with established disaster management process and procedures; and, finally, offering assurance that resources are being used economically efficiently and effectively for achieving the planned objectives and that benefits have gone to the targeted beneficiaries. The internal audit must also ensure compliance with applicable rules and procedures even in disaster-related disbursements and procurement processes and provide valuable inputs to the external audit conducted by the CAG. Generally accepted government auditing standards require that an audit is planned and performed with sufficient, appropriate evidence to the audit findings and conclusions based on the audit objectives and scope. All public entities management must be accountable and ensure that resources are managed properly and used in compliance with laws and regulations; programmes are achieving their objectives; and services are being provided efficiently, effectively, and economically.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Winning back trust in vaccines||While U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that a COVID-19 vaccine would be available by mid-October, days before the November 3 presidential election, the guidance for ‘Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19’, released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has dashed that possibility. The FDA has made it clear that “data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile.” However, the guidance for industry contains non-binding recommendations. Shutting the door With at least two months of follow-up data likely to become available at the earliest only by November or December, the guidance essentially shuts the door on vaccine manufacturers making their vaccines available for public use through the emergency use authorisation route before election day. Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO of Pfizer, had on earlier occasions said that the company may have vaccine data ready to submit to the FDA in October. The FDA guidance comes after the White House had blocked its release due to concerns that the guidelines would delay the arrival of the first dose until after election day. Even as Mr. Trump called the FDA guidance release as “just another political hit job”, Dr. Peter Marks from FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research told CNN that “being open and clear about the circumstances” under which emergency use authorisation will be issued for COVID-19 vaccines is “critical to building public confidence and ensuring the use of COVID-19 vaccines once available”. He added that the FDA hopes that the guidance on COVID-19 vaccines “helps the public understand our science-based decision-making process that assures vaccine quality, safety and efficacy for any vaccine that is authorised or approved”. The unprecedented speed at which COVID-19 vaccines have progressed to Phase 3 trials and the haste shown by the Trump administration to get a vaccine out before election day have eroded public trust in COVID-19 vaccines that are undergoing trials. A Gallup COVID-19 tracking survey carried out in the U.S. between July 20 and August 2 found that 35% of Americans did not want to be vaccinated even if an approved vaccine was available at no cost. Similarly, CNN polls found the percentage of people willing to be vaccinated dropping from 66% in May to 51% in October. People unwilling to be vaccinated include those who are otherwise inclined towards vaccines. Building trust The FDA’s initiative to build public trust in COVID-19 vaccines is one of the many steps taken by stakeholders to address the concerns about new vaccines developed and tested at speeds unknown before. In September, nine vaccine manufacturers came together to sign a joint pledge to assure the public that they would develop and test COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with “high ethical standards and sound scientific principles” and always keep the “safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the top priority”. They clarified that they would not seek premature approval from regulatory authorities. In an unprecedented move, three pharma companies — Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca — published the Phase 3 trial protocols to inform the public and scientists about the evidence companies will use to determine if vaccines are effective. Finally, in an open letter to colleagues, Pfizer’s Dr. Bourla said he “can’t predict exactly when, or even if our vaccine will be approved by the FDA”, and that the “world will be safer if we stop talking about the vaccines’ delivery in political terms.” He wrote: “Let’s continue to work together to build trust in science. Imagine the compounded tragedy if we have a safe and effective vaccine that many people didn’t trust.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Scissoring the DNA||That scientists who pioneered the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, the biggest game-changer in biology in recent years, will win the Nobel Prize was never in doubt; it was only a question of when and who would get recognised for the work done to develop the tool. The Prize awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna, just eight years after they developed the tool, has finally ended the speculation of who would win it. But most importantly, this year’s Prize for chemistry has created history by honouring an all-woman team. It all started when Dr. Charpentier discovered an RNA molecule that is part of bacteria’s ancient immune system — CRISPR-Cas — wherein clustered repeated sequences produced by bacteria can remember and destroy viruses by cleaving their DNA. Teaming with Dr. Doudna, she recreated the bacteria’s genetic scissors in a test tube and simplified the tool to make it easier to programme the system to precisely cut specific sites of interest in any DNA, including humans. While the tool is most often used to make a cut in the DNA, newer approaches are being attempted to add or make minor changes to the DNA. All these approaches may at some time in the future make it easy to “rewrite the code of life”. The gene-editing technology has opened up a vast window of opportunity. In the last six years, the tool has enabled scientists to edit human DNA in a dish and early-stage clinical trials are being attempted to use the tool to treat a few diseases, including inherited disorders/diseases and some types of cancer. Though in 2016 China began the first human clinical trial to treat an aggressive form of lung cancer by introducing cells that contain genes edited using CRISPR-Cas9, the use of the tool has so far been limited to curing genetic diseases in animal models. Last year, a Chinese researcher used the tool to modify a particular gene in the embryo to make babies immune to HIV infection, which led to international furore. Though no guidelines have been drawn up so far, there is a general consensus in the scientific and ethics communities that the gene-editing technique should not be used clinically on embryos. Unlike in the case of humans, the tool is being extensively used in agriculture. It is being tried out in agriculture primarily to increase plant yield, quality, disease resistance, herbicide resistance and domestication of wild species. The huge potential to edit genes using this tool has been used to create a large number of crop varieties with improved agronomic performance; it has also brought in sweeping changes to breeding technologies. The gene-editing tool has indeed taken “life sciences into a new epoch”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/scissoring-the-dna/article32808452.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Avoidable uncertainty||The Reserve Bank of India will release its third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2020-21 on October 9, instead of October 1 as originally envisaged. This will be at the culmination of a three-day review of the pulls and pressures in the economy by the monetary policy committee (MPC). The review began on Wednesday instead of September 29, after the RBI had to reschedule it on the eve of the meeting following the government’s failure to appoint its three nominees to the six-member committee. This is the first such instance of the RBI deferring its bi-monthly review in recent years. That the terms of the government’s first set of MPC nominees would expire at the end of August was known from the time it was constituted four years ago. Also, the MPC’s meeting schedule is released by the central bank in April. Even if the hunt for new members was disrupted by the pandemic, the government had ample time to expedite these appointments after August 6, when the last policy review took place. The new members — academic Ashima Goyal with interests in the interplay of fiscal and monetary policies, noted agriculture economist Shashanka Bhide, and former SEBI member and financial markets scholar Jayanth R. Varma — are unexceptionably good picks who would lend a holistic world view to the MPC’s deliberations. However, for their first meeting, they would have had effectively just 24 hours to prepare. In normal times, one could put this avoidable delay down to bureaucratic lethargy, but these are not normal times. A lot has transpired since the last policy review; official data revealed a 23.9% contraction in the economy in Q1, jobs and incomes remain under pressure, and inflation continues to reign above the 6% upper limit of the price stability mandate agreed to in 2016 by the RBI and the Centre, which entailed the setting up of the MPC. The government has for now stuck to its Rs. 12-lakh crore borrowing plan, which includes space for ‘unforeseen’ spending. Also, States need to borrow more in the coming months including to meet GST compensation shortfalls. An almost casual approach towards continuity in such an important policy review body, at a time when markets are keen to know India’s fiscal and monetary stance and the RBI’s inflation and growth projections for the year, is unacceptable and sends a clumsy signal to global investors. Some lateral thinking may be needed to conjure up fresh stimulus measures for the stuttering economy, but policy mandarins should not lose sight of routine decisions. With the last two RBI Deputy Governors’ vacancies being filled after protracted gaps of about six months each, appointment processes, especially for critical financial policy roles, are clearly in need of an urgent overhaul. And the government could surely burnish its standing among investors if it mandated explanations and strictures for missed timelines as part of such a revamp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/avoidable-uncertainty/article32808453.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Funerals under the barrel of a gun||“There were loud and persistent knocks on the door. They asked us to hurry while we were bathing my son for his funeral and preparing for namaaz . It was not dawn yet, but the police said we had no time,” said Nafeesa Parveen. Her son, 28-year-old Mohammed Mohsin, had succumbed to bullet injuries the day before in a brutal police crackdown in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, on those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), following Friday prayers. It was December 20, 2019, and anti-CAA protests were erupting across the country, nine days after Parliament passed the law. Horrifying accounts of police heavy-handedness were trickling in from U.P. By the time I went to Meerut, a number of Muslim youth had been killed in police action. Hundreds of young Muslim men were forced to go underground as the police brought out FIRs against nearly 2,000 unknown persons, which allowed them to nab anyone they suspected of participating in the Friday protests. I also met the families of Zahir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif. They too narrated stories of rushed funerals under the barrel of a gun and before the crack of dawn. “The police arrived late at night and said we had to bury Asif immediately. The family burial ground was a few kilometres away, but they said there was no time to go that far. They said we should take him to the nearest graveyard, which was barely a few 100 metres away. When we arrived at the cemetery, we saw police personnel with spades. A grave had already been dug,” said Asif’s mother-in-law, Shameem. At the time of the funeral of the three men less than 24 hours after the protest, the post-mortem reports were not available to the families. The police had also named the three dead men in an FIR, and the families had little expectation of a fair investigation by the police against their own. The parallels between what unfolded in U.P. last December and last week are hard to miss. The family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered by four Thakur men in Hathras was also denied permission to conduct rituals and prepare their daughter for her farewell. The police prepared the cremation site, installed a generator and flood lights, and brought logs and fuel. They consigned the young woman to flames in the dead of night without her family’s consent. Many Kashmiris on social media too have tried to remind the country that this is also their lived reality, but rarely discussed. As in Meerut, in Hathras too the state has been criticised for its failure to ensure a proper investigation of the ghastly incident and gather forensic evidence in time. A whisper campaign aimed at maligning the victim and her family, including by a BJP leader, and loose remarks that seek to absolve the four accused men indicate that justice will be an uphill battle in an environment where caste hierarchies are deeply entrenched. Sometimes present-day events allow journalists to see past stories in a new light and identify patterns. From the vantage point of Hathras, it is evident that caste, class, religion and ethnicity can dictate whether dignity in death is an equal right.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/funerals-under-the-barrel-of-a-gun/article32808463.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||The Government of Ireland||The “Nation” writes:- The government of Ireland by England has ceased to exist. Its title is gone. Governments live by their possession of all sorts of virtues and half-virtues; by dispensing justice, glory, wealth, or quiet days; by extorting submission or dividing power; by force or by art. Machiavelli thought the despot would succeed by combining these arts; the democrat would make the people judges of the quality of their rulers. But all agree that some tie of morals or expediency should unite governors and govern. When, therefore, all the citizens declare by act or by word the worthlessness of their government; when it resorts only to force, in its crudest form; and this method only informs the popular hatred, abdication becomes the only way out. If we left Ireland tomorrow, there would be physical strife between some Orangemen and some Catholics, as there is to-day. But there would be no murders, arson, pillage by soldiers and policemen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-government-of-ireland/article32808461.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Nixon’s 5-point plan||President Nixon last night [October 7, Washington] proposed a simultaneous “standstill ceasefire” in all the three Indo-China States with a view to breaking the “logjam” at the Paris peace talks. He coupled this with a call for an all Indo-China peace conference at which a political settlement covering Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia could be negotiated. President Nixon who said his peace initiative has the full support of the Governments of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, outlined a five-point plan. He said: “First, I propose that all armed forces throughout Indo-China cease firing their weapons and remain in the positions they now hold.” Mr. Nixon said his second proposal, for an Indo-China peace conference, was made because “this war in Indo-China has been provided to be one piece – it cannot be cured by treating only one of its areas of outbreak.” “The third part of our peace initiative has to do with United States forces in Viet Nam”, Mr. Nixon said. “We are ready to negotiate an agreed time table for complete withdrawals as part of an overall settlement.” Mr. Nixon said that fourthly, he asked the other side to join in search for a political settlement that clearly meets the aspirations of all South Vietnamese people. Finally, Mr. Nixon proposed the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of war held by both sides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/nixons-5-point-plan/article32808462.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||World Bank widens GDP contraction forecast to 9.6%||The World Bank expects India’s economy to contract by 9.6% in 2020-21, revising its earlier estimate in June that output will shrink by just 3.2% amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This revision reflects ‘the impact of the national lockdown and the income shock experienced by households and firms’, the Bank explained. In its South Asia Economic Focus report released on Thursday, the Bank reckoned there will be a rebound to 5.4% growth in 2021-22, but largely due to base effects and hinging on assumptions that the pandemic-related restrictions are completely lifted by 2022. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 23.9% in the first quarter of this year and official estimates for the second quarter are expected at end-November. The Bank mooted continuation of critical reforms to reverse the sudden and steep impacts of COVID-19. “Monetary policy has been deployed aggressively and fiscal resources have been channelled to public health and social protection, but additional counter-cyclical measures will be needed, within a revised medium-term fiscal framework. “Despite measures to shield vulnerable households and firms, the trajectory of poverty reduction has slowed, if not reversed,” the Bank said on India. It said significant disruptions to jobs likely boosted the poverty rate, with 2020 rates back to levels in 2016. “Policy interventions have preserved the normal functioning of financial markets thus far. However, the demand slowdown could lead to rising loan delinquencies and risk aversion,” it noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/world-bank-widens-gdp-contraction-forecast-to-96/article32808440.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Passenger vehicle retail sales grow first time since March||Passenger vehicle registrations rose 9.8% in September, the first retail sales growth since March, data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations show. Total vehicle deliveries, however, continued to shrink, sliding 10% to 13.44 lakh units. Overall registrations, however, increased 11.4% from August, raising hopes of a “high growth period” in October and November due to the upcoming festivals. PV deliveries rose to more than 1.95 lakh units last month, while two-wheelers registrations slid 12.6 to 10.16 lakh units and commercial vehicle registrations fell 33.7% to 39,600 units. Tractor deliveries surged 80.4% to 68,564 units. “With social distancing on customers’ minds, coupled with the government’s push to further normalise business conditions and banks becoming more considerate to finance vehicles, entry level passenger vehicles saw good demand thus indicating a preference for personal transportation over public,” FADA President Vinkesh Gulati said. New model introductions and last year’s low base had also aided growth in the PV segment, he added. Still, FADA had a caveat on the outlook. “With the festival season round the corner and elections approaching in Bihar, the risk of COVID spread resurging may play a spoilsport in specific regions. Inventory for 2W stands at 45-50 days and PV stands at 35-40 days. Any dampener in vehicle sales during the upcoming festivals will have a catastrophic impact on dealers’ financial health,” FADA warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-grow-first-time-since-march/article32808442.ece

The undisputed answer to all these questions is one – India,” he said, urging Canadian firms to consider collaborations with India in education and agriculture, apart from investments in manufacturing and services. “In the post-COVID world, you will often hear of various kind of problems – manufacturing, supply chain and so on.  ‘Shown resilience’ Problems are natural. However, India has not let those problems be. We showed resilience and emerged as a land of solutions… Today, our manufacturing is running at full steam,” Mr. Modi said. The PM said that the government was ‘pro-actively monetising assets across sectors such as airports, railways, highways and power transmission lines. Real estate investment trusts and infrastructure investment trusts had also been fully enabled for monetisation of public and private assets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/manufacturing-at-full-steam-pm/article32808438.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Google holding app developers to ransom’||Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma on Thursday stepped up his fight against Google as he sought government intervention to help create a level playing field so as to “not allow somebody [to hold] to ransom” Indian app developers and to ensure all stakeholders complied with Indian laws. He also alleged that Google was acting like a “toll collector instead of trying to enable the ecosystem”. Mr. Sharma has rallied about 100 homegrown firms in opposing Google Play Store’s new norms mandating the use of its billing system after March 2022, which would entail app developers needing to pay 30% transaction fee for all digital goods sold via their apps to Play Store. The group also plans to form a united front against global firms such as Google, Apple and Facebook, he said. Paytm aims to onboard one million apps on its new Android ‘mini app store’ in the next year or so, coinciding with the deadline for new Google Play rules, Mr. Sharma said, announcing aRs. 10 crore “equity investment” scheme for mini app developers in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/google-holding-app-developers-to-ransom/article32808444.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||No foreign flights at cost of Indian carriers: Puri||Foreign carriers will not be allowed flights into India at the expense of Indian carriers, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri asserted on Thursday. This comes at a time when India is in the process of negotiating and renegotiating special bilateral arrangements for allowing limited numbers of direct flights from and to India. “Foreign carriers are allowed to fly into India, but the time has come for the message to go out loud and clear that this will not be done at the expense of Indian carriers,” Mr. Puri said at a press conference. The remarks come in the wake of the first meeting between Germany’s Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation on the “air bubble” agreement which recently broke, forcing both Lufthansa and Air India to cancel October flights between the two countries. Another meeting is scheduled between the two sides on Friday. “Negotiations are on and we are hopeful of a resolution soon,” diplomatic sources said. Air India is the only Indian carrier that flies to both the U.S. and Europe.

09 October 2020||KOLKATA,||Change in roles paid off: Mills||Bowling coach Kyle Mills said the ploy to play an in-form Rahul Tripathi as an opener and Sunil Narine as a pinch-hitter helped Kolkata Knight Riders in its 10-run win over Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday. Keeping it tight Narine, who batted at No. 4 after failing as an opener in previous matches, scored a quick 17. Bowling late, he kept it tight and took the crucial wicket of Shane Watson (50). “We used Sunil as a pinch-hitter against CSK. A change is as good as a holiday, they say. We moved Tripathi to the top and it paid off for him. Sunil played a cameo, it gave us a little momentum,” Mills said at the post-match press conference. “With the ball, Sunil came in to bowl a little late, but the job he did at the back-end was comforting to see for us on the sidelines.” Mills said man-of-the-match Tripathi’s impressive 51-ball 81, which enabled KKR to post a competitive 167, was magical to see. “Not just in the (KKR) academy, the four weeks leading into the camp here, he was exceptional. He is an example to everyone. He is reaping the rewards.” Mills praised death-over specialist Andre Russell. “It’s a real specialist skill-set as to how we like him to bowl at the end of the things… He not only bowls very good yorkers, but he has the ability to bowl fast bouncers. He is a great hand at the back-end of the innings.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/change-in-roles-paid-off-mills/article32808819.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Bairstow’s onslaught and Rashid’s sorcery leave Kings XI gasping||Nicholas Pooran (77, 37b, 5x4, 7x6) scored the fastest fifty of IPL 2020. Youngster Ravi Bishnoi picked up three wickets, yet Kings XI Punjab couldn’t challenge Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. David Warner’s side won by 69 runs. Chasing 202, Kings XI lost its top three — Mayank Agarwal (9), K.L. Rahul (11) and Prabhsimran Singh (11) — inside the first seven overs. Pooran caused jitters for Sunrisers as he swung his bat with style and guile. The 17-ball 50 did raise Kings XI’s hopes before he fell to Rashid Khan, caught at backward point. The star leg-spinner had two other scalps as he ensured a comfortable victory. Batting first, Warner (52, 40b, 5x4, 1x6) and Jonny Bairstow (97, 55b, 7x4, 6x6) put on a 160-run opening stand that set the tone for Sunrisers. Sunrisers built on the momentum gained from the first over, when Sheldon Cottrell leaked 13 runs. Bairstow unsettled the West Indian with three boundaries — the first through cover-point, the next over extra cover, and finally a ferocious pull — in the left-armer’s second over. Rahul, who has not been ’keeping of late, dropped Bairstow on 19 off Mohammed Shami in the fifth over. The missed chance proved costly, with the Englishman smashing two sixes and a four off leg-spinner Bishnoi’s first over. While Bairstow was ruthless, Warner kept the scoreboard moving with quick singles, fours and ambidextrous improvisations. He scored his ninth consecutive fifty against Kings XI. Rahul looked clueless at one point as Sunrisers cruised at more than 10 an over. But Kings XI did pull things back in the 16th over. The 20-year-old Bishnoi forced Warner to miscue a slog-sweep off a googly. Three balls later, he trapped Bairstow in front. Bishnoi also dismissed Abdul Samad to return figures of three for 29 in three overs. Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman looked ordinary, but left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, playing in his first game of the season, impressed, as Kings XI appeared to put the brakes on Sunrisers. But despite Pooran’s knock, the target proved too far for Kings XI.   Fastest 50s    In 2020    17 balls: Nicholas Pooran (KXIP vs. SRH), Dubai  19: Sanju Samson  (RR vs. CSK), Sharjah  20: Kieron Pollard  (MI vs. RCB), Dubai  20: Marcus Stoinis  (DC vs. KXIP), Dubai  Overall    14: K.L.

09 October 2020||Chennai,||Varun takes flight as heart backs skills||We are in the 17th over of the innings on the chase. The game is in the balance. It’s M.S. Dhoni’s enormous power, experience and end-game skills against Varun Chakravarthy. The tension is in the air; a high-pressure situation in the IPL that could have left someone as raw as Varun bleeding. Things appeared ominous when Dhoni smashed a short ball to the fence. Was Varun losing his nerve? ‘No’ was the emphatic answer. Varun’s next delivery was gutsy. It was a deliciously flighted off-spinner, that lured Dhoni into a fatal slog-sweep. And the stumps were disturbed. Pivotal moment A pivotal moment of the contest between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders. Varun can turn games. This IPL has been one of self-discovery for Varun. It has been about redemption and life’s second chance. A ‘mystery’ spinner with a variety of deliveries, he has seen it all — from being bought at a whopping Rs. 8.4 crore by Kings XI Punjab in 2019 to developing a shoulder injury after just one game and spending the next few months wondering whether he would play cricket again to finding his path again. He has a lot going for him — he can turn the ball both ways, deliver from a high-arm action, achieve bounce and mix his deliveries. Dinesh Karthik, his captain in the Tamil Nadu teams for the shorter versions, has backed him in the IPL as KKR snapped him up for Rs. 4 crore against conventional wisdom, and Varun has not let his skipper down. Big strikes Sunrisers captain David Warner was flummoxed by a delivery, flicked off the middle-finger, that held its line when the batsman played for turn. And Rajasthan Royals southpaw Rahul Tewatia was done in by a delivery that pitched on leg and hit the top of middle-stump. Along the way, Varun has worked on his mind and game with Karthik and Abhishek Nayar and became fitter, teaming up with Shankar Basu. Apart from his skills, he now has the heart.  Three years back, I used to go to Chepauk just to see Dhoni batting. Now I bowled against him. It was a surreal moment for me    After the match I took a picture with Dhoni sir.

09 October 2020||VALENCIA,||Cheptegei sets 10,000m world mark||Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei smashed the men’s 10,000m world record on Wednesday at the Valencia World Record Day, crossing the line in a stunning 26 minutes 11.02 seconds to take six seconds off a 15-year-old record. Cheptegei, 24, broke the previous mark of 26:17:53, set by Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele, at a special event in a near-empty Turia stadium here as only 400 people including sponsors, journalists and staff were allowed in. Outstanding 12 months The achievement capped an outstanding 12 months for Cheptegei, who won the 10,000m gold at last year’s World Championships in Doha, and in August took Bekele’s 5,000m record at the Diamond League in Monaco. Last December, also in Valencia, Cheptegei smashed a decade-long record in 10km road racing by six seconds. Cheptegei’s outstanding display finished off a perfect event after Ethiopia’s Letesenbet Gidey broke the women’s 5,000m world record by more than four seconds, crossing the line in 14 minutes 6.62 seconds. The 22-year-old beat the previous mark of 14:11.15 set by compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba at Oslo in 2008. The event was organised by Cheptegei’s NN Running Team of the Netherlands and he and Gidey were helped to the finish line by pacers as well as Wavelight technology, which flashes lights on the inside of the track to indicate a specific pace.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cheptegei-sets-10000m-world-mark/article32808563.ece
09 October 2020||MUMBAI,||The ‘Surya scoop’||When a Jofra Archer knuckle-ball crashed into Suryakumar Yadav’s helmet during Mumbai Indians’ clash against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday, many would have been wondering how the batsman would respond. The Mumbaikar came up with a perfect riposte, scooping a yorker, bowled at nearly 150kmph, over third-man for a six. Suryakumar, whose unbeaten 79 off 47 balls set up MI’s first win against Royals in five years, revealed that his batting partner Hardik Pandya was of immense help while producing that extraordinary shot. Hardik’s take “Hardik was like, ‘this is the time, let’s try and do something different’. I asked him given his experience what he feels, what he [Archer] was going to try? He was like, ‘he may hit a yorker.’ I said let’s get prepared for that,” Suryakumar said during a media interaction on Thursday. “That was one of the shots I had been practising during lockdown. I just tried to execute it without thinking about anything else, and it worked. “The first few hours were a little disturbing. But the physios and doctors took good care of me and I am feeling better now,” said Suryakumar about the impact of the Archer delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-surya-scoop/article32808560.ece
09 October 2020||Chennai,||We could’ve used the batting resources better, says Fleming||Despite his struggles so far in the tournament, Kedar Jadhav was once again sent ahead of big hitters Ravindra Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo that proved costly for Chennai Super Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday. The India batsman could only manage seven runs off 12 balls as he failed to get the big shots going. Reasoning When asked about the thinking behind this, CSK coach Stephen Fleming said, “we were hoping that Kedar could play the off-spinner (Sunil Narine) well and also Jadeja to come and finish.” The team has often been found wanting in terms of using its batting resources smartly with the big-hitters coming too late. “We have got so much batting resources. We could have gone a whole lot of different ways. That is one of the things we will look at, could we have done it a little bit better... but it is all in hindsight,” he added. The former New Zealand skipper also added that one of the set batsmen should have seen the chase through. “If we had got one of the batsmen to get 75-plus and continued the partnership for five more overs, then the game might have been a lot different. “We are disappointed that we let it slip,” Fleming said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-couldve-used-the-batting-resources-better-says-fleming/article32808568.ece

09 October 2020||Nurburgring,||Kimi Raikkonen happy to swerve wide of record||Kimi Raikkonen is set to start a record 323rd Formula One race at this weekend’s Eifel Grand Prix but is happy if his landmark in longevity is overshadowed by the names Hamilton and Schumacher. The 40-year-old Finn, the oldest driver on the grid, famously loathes publicity and any invasions of his family or private life. So if Lewis Hamilton succeeds in equalling Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 victories, he will be delighted. “It’s not something I care about, not really,” he said of his own record. “If someone asked me about the number of races, I would have no idea. I’m here because I like to drive. I still enjoy it.” Familiar with circuit Raikkonen equalled Rubens Barrichello’s record of 322 starts two weeks ago and believes he knows his way around the circuit. “I’ve been here a few times and I think I should have won a couple of races, but we’ve been unlucky -- that’s how racing goes,” he said, with a familiar shrug. Fernando Alonso is third on the list of Grand Prix starters with 311 with Michael Schumacher just behind him on 306, winning five times at the Nurburgring. As ‘The Iceman’ defies his advancing years, Mick Schumacher, the fresh-faced son of seven-time champion Michael, will make his F1 debut alongside him on Friday in the Alfa Romeo garage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kimi-raikkonen-happy-to-swerve-wide-of-record/article32808565.ece
09 October 2020||SHARJAH,||Royals aim to halt Capitals’ march||Rajasthan Royals (RR) will need some quick-fix solutions to snap a three-match losing streak when it takes on a formidable Delhi Capitals (DC) here on Friday. The Royals were off to a flying start in the tournament, winning the first two games at Sharjah, but have struggled to adjust to the bigger grounds in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Now, back in Sharjah, RR will hope for better returns. The deteriorating numbers of skipper Steve Smith and Sanju Samson, who did the bulk of the scoring in the first two matches, is worrying. The silver lining is the return to form of opener Jos Buttler, who scored a fine 44-ball 70 against Mumbai Indians in the last game. Well-oiled machine DC, meanwhile, has looked a well-oiled machine, winning four out of five games. While captain Shreyas Iyer has been in fine form, Prithvi Shaw in the top order and Rishabh Pant lower down have done their jobs well. All-rounder Marcus Stonis has produced two smashing fifties to give the side great balance. In bowling, Kagiso Rabada has looked ominous, taking 12 wickets, while a fit-again R. Ashwin returned figures of one for 26 in his comeback game on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/royals-aim-to-halt-capitals-march/article32808532.ece
09 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Sailing all set to set the ball rolling||Sailing will be the first sport in Telangana to resume serious State-level competition with Telangana Sailing Association organising the Junior State championship from Oct. 9 at Hussain Sagar Lake. Interestingly, the training sessions had already begun on October 7 with all the safety guidelines implemented to counter the pandemic. An Online International Jury comprising Judges from Australia, Singapore and India will preside, with International Judge Brigadier GS Julka chairing the proceedings. Yacht Club president Suheim Sheikh says that traditionally the meet is an Open event but due to COVID-19, it is restricted to 11 districts this time around. For the record, the sub-junior championships will be sailed in the Optimist Class with some boys from MJPT School, including Nitin Ketavat and G. Mallesh being tipped as the dark horses given their performance in the practice sessions. India No.1 L. Jhansi Priya and No.2 V. Vaishnavi are the top-seeds but the former is yet to show top form while Vaishnavi is coming up with many wins during practice, Suheim said. And, the Junior championships will be held in the Laser Class with a record 18 sailors participating with 17 debutants. Lakshmi Chandram of Hyderabad is the top-seed alongside B. Jaikiran of Wanaparthy. “The Telangana Sailing Association is proud to conduct what may be the first State Level Championship in any sport across the country post lockdown, against all odds and we are happy to take the lead in opening up the sports arenas in India. I wish the sailors all the very best,” said Lt. Gen. K.S. Rao, president of the TSA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sailing-all-set-to-set-the-ball-rolling/article32809213.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Super Kings lose the plot||Chennai Super Kings squandered a good start and stumbled in its chase, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 10 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Chasing 168 for victory, CSK was 90 for one at the end of 10 overs before KKR fought back strongly, led by Sunil Narine, to record its third win of the season. Shane Watson continued his good run from the previous match, scoring 50 (40b, 6x4, 1x6) as he set a good platform with Ambati Rayudu (30). But once the two were dismissed in quick succession, first Rayudu followed by Watson — leg-before to Narine — the game slipped away. Out of sorts The CSK middle-order looked out of sorts, as M.S. Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav and Sam Curran struggled to get the remaining runs. It was a puzzling decision to see an out-of-form Jadhav (7 n.o., 12b, 1x4) bat ahead of powerful hitters such as Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja. CSK could not strike any boundaries between the 11th and 15th overs, scoring only 20 and slipping to its fourth defeat this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/super-kings-lose-the-plot/article32808530.ece
09 October 2020||Nurburgring (Germany),||Hamilton resumes record trail||Three names synonymous with glory will grab attention for contrasting reasons when the once-legendary Nurburgring hosts a Formula One race for the first time in seven years. Lewis Hamilton will be seeking, on the second attempt, to equal Michael Schumacher's record of 91 wins while his son Mick is set to make his F1 debut in Friday's opening practice with Alfa Romeo. Alongside them, Sebastian Vettel — the last winner at the historic venue in 2013 — will be bidding to avoid any banana skins as he embarks on his closing chapter with Ferrari, having admitted on Wednesday that his spell with the Italian team has been a failure. All three men and the rest of the travelling F1 circus are expected to face severely cold conditions with rain and low temperatures forecast for the weekend's inaugural Eifel Grand Prix.  Meanwhile, Mercedes reported that a member of its team had tested positive for COVID-19, but a spokesman said Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas were clear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-resumes-record-trail/article32808569.ece
09 October 2020||Paris,||France trounces Ukraine; Turkey holds Germany||France’s 7-1 thrashing of Ukraine was the pick of the European friendlies on Wednesday as Spain clung on for a draw in Lisbon and Turkey saved pride with a late goal against Germany in Cologne. At the Stade de France, it was teenager Eduardo Camavinga and veteran Olivier Giroud inflicting much of the damage for Didier Deschamps’ world champion on COVID-19 hit Ukraine. The 17-year-old Camavinga put himself on the map, becoming the youngest man to score for France in over a century, with an audacious overhead flick for the ninth-minute opener. Milestone Deschamps made Giroud captain for his 100th appearance and in return the Chelsea forward scored a first-half brace that left him on 42 international goals, just nine short of Thiery Henry on 51. Cristiano Ronaldo and Renato Sanchez both struck the woodwork for Portugal, which then should have won it in injury-time only for Joao Felix to miskick at the back post.   The results: Germany 3 (Draxler 45+1, Neuhaus 58, Waldschmidt 81) drew with Turkey 3 (Tufan 50, Karaca 67, Karaman 90+4); Portugal 0 drew with Spain 0; The Netherlands 0 lost to Mexico 1 (Jimenez 60-pen).

09 October 2020||KOLKATA,||Bhawanipur and Sporting begin well||Bhawanipur FC scored once in each half to down Bengaluru United 2-0 in the opening match of the I-League Qualifiers on Thursday. In another match, Mohammedan Sporting collected the full points against Garhwal FC, thanks to an injury-time winner from Munmun Lugun. Sanitation tunnels, temperature checks and social-distancing regulations were the additional features as sporting action resumed post COVID-19 hiatus in the specified bio-bubble that left out spectators and even media. Apart from this, there was not much excitement on offer as both the opening-round encounters failed to rise about mediocrity. Bhawanipur FC started on the defensive as Bengaluru United pushed for some nicely coordinated attacks initially. Bengaluru United got its first good opportunity in the 21st minute but Azharuddin Mallick muffed the chance, which happened because of a miscued clearance from the Bhawanipur FC captain and goalkeeper Shilton Paul, by nodding over the bar. Bhawanipur converted the lone chance that came its way in the final minute of the added time in the first half. Pankaj Moula found the target with a tap-in after a clearance from Bengaluru United custodian R. Srijith landed at his feet. Bhawanipur doubled the lead at the hour mark when Ghanaian Philip Adjah finished with a powerful volley.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhawanipur-and-sporting-begin-well/article32808572.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||National camp for core group from Oct. 15||The Sports Authority of India (SAI), in consultation with the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), has announced a training camp for core shooters from October 15 to Dec. 14. The coaches had sought a four to six weeks camp to monitor the schedule of the shooters, who have all been training at home during the lockdown. The camp, to he held at the Dr. Karni Singh Range in Tughlakabad, will be open for 32 shooters, including all the 15 who have won the Tokyo Olympics quota places. It is understood that all the shooters, eight Indian and two foreign coaches, and two support staff would stay in a hotel during the camp to ensure all the safety protocols. SAI has estimated the two-month camp would cost about Rs. 1.43 crore. Anjum Moudgil, who won the first Olympic quota for the Tokyo Games with a silver in the World Championship, and Divyansh Singh Panwar, the World No. 1 in men’s air rifle, expressed happiness about the camp and preparing together in a team atmosphere. “Regular shooting in a camp environment will give us a better idea of where we currently stand”, said Anjum. Raninder elated NRAI president Raninder Singh was elated with SAI sanctioning the camp. “Our shooters have been training at home during the lockdown. But, to train together at a camp is going to help them much more. “We are very happy that SAI has sanctioned this two-month training camp,” said Raninder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/national-camp-for-core-group-to-start-from-october-15/article32808581.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Ramayana the life saver||Not only was the story of Rama heard with joy, but it was also narrated with relish, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. When Indrajit captured Hanuman and took him to Ravana’s court, Hanuman narrated the story of Rama in Ravana’s presence. Ravana gave Sita an ultimatum, and said if she did not accept him within a stipulated period, he would kill Her. Sita was preparing to end her sorrow, when She heard Rama’s story being narrated. It was Hanuman who hit upon the idea of speaking about Rama to save Her. Thus Sita’s life was saved by Rama’s story. Rama on His return to Ayodhya, after rescuing Sita from Lanka, had to halt briefly at the ashram of sage Bharadwaja. Bharata had threatened to jump into the fire if Rama was not back at the end of the fourteen-year exile. Afraid that he might carry out the threat, Rama sent Hanuman to his brother. Hanuman told Bharata the story of Rama. Bharata was not aware of the abduction of Sita, the search for Her and the killing of Ravana. Hanuman was the one who informed him. Bharata’s life was saved by Rama’s story. When Rama’s avatara was about to end, Rama said to Hanuman that he could come to Paramapada, to be with Him. Hanuman asked if he could worship Rama in Paramapada, if he could hear the Ramayana there. Rama replied that in Paramapada, He could be worshipped only as Paramapadanatha, and not as Rama. Also there would be no recital of the Ramayana or Rama nama sankeerthana. Hanuman said that in that case, he would choose to remain on the earth. When we lose someone dear to us, we try to keep the memories alive, by listening to someone talking about them. Hanuman said that wherever the Ramayana was discoursed upon, or Rama was praised, he would be there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramayana-the-life-saver/article32808527.ece
09 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Can allow two bouncers per over: Gavaskar||Sunil Gavaskar believes T20 cricket doesn’t need much tinkering as it is in the “pink of health” but custodians of the game can consider allowing two bouncers per over, moving ahead. The shortest format, over the years, has witnessed dominance of batsmen. Does he foresee see a rule change to ease the pressure off the bowlers? “The T20 game is doing very well and there’s no need to tinker with it,” Gavaskar told PTI in an exclusive interview from the UAE where he is working as a broadcaster for the IPL. But he did put forth a few suggestions which could be seriously considered by the lawmakers of the game. “It is loaded heavily in favour of the batsmen for sure, so give a fast bowler two bouncers per over. The boundaries can be easily longer, if the ground authorities want it,” Gavaskar said.  “Also look at giving an extra over to the bowler who takes a wicket in his first three overs. But seriously there’s no need to bring any changes at all.” More powers Talking about rules, Gavaskar suggested that the TV umpire should be empowered to check whether a non-striker is backing up too far even before a bowler has delivered the ball.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-allow-two-bouncers-per-over-gavaskar/article32808566.ece

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Keep the snack ball rolling||Energy balls, nutri balls, bliss balls, protein balls... a snack ball by any other name tastes just as good and packs as much nutrition. The delectable, low-calorie pick-me-ups are also convenient — to both make and take — just pop one in at work or leisure. Abinas Nayak, winner of Masterchef India Season 6 this year, has fond memories of the rasi laddus (sesame balls) his grandmother used to make regularly when he was a kid. “Those days, we used to eat a whole variety of these, such as wheat balls and coconut balls with a smattering of amaranth seeds. Though the concept of snack balls always sustained, it is good to see them come back as healthier alternatives to junk food today,” he says. Abinas says they are quite versatile. “You can prepare them with a variety of cereals or millets as base. It’s also nice to have a combination of these or mix and match,” he points out. However, it is not just the easy-to-source traditional ones that he roots for, but also some offbeat varieties. “Perhaps the most exotic of these that I have come across were made from a mixture of desiccated berries and an assortment of nuts in Mumbai once,” he remembers. Praveen Anand, executive chef — South Indian cuisines at ITC hotels, says he has noticed more common ones like peanut jaggery balls and sesame jaggery balls finding favour during winter, possibly because, “they are believed to generate heat in the body and give you energy”. Praveen explains, “Adding dates or even making it the base ingredient is a great way to cut out sugar. The nutrient-rich additions commonly seen now are flax seeds, amaranth seeds, sunflower seeds, water melon seeds, pumpkin seeds and so on. These lend a difference in taste and enhance scope for experimentation.” Versatility and ease of preparation are also what chef and cookbook author Mallika Badrinath loves about such healthy snack balls. “A variety of cereals and millets commonly available, like ragi, jowar ( cholam ), fox-tail millet, pearl millet, barnyard millet and so on, that can be used for energy balls. In fact, tasty combinations of these give new flavours,” she says. A hack Mallika offers is making use of a candy stick. “You can have them like a lollipop,” she says. Despite the nutritional boost, she has a word of caution: “It is a salubrious substitute for junk food but our diet also has to be supplemented with foods containing Vitamin C, especially at a time like now, when natural immunity has never been so paramount before,” she adds. Hyderabad-based nutritionist and chef Sridevi Jasti feels our sensory and nutritional needs have changed over time. “Our soil is depleted of nutrition and consequently, our foods have less nutrition. As compensation, we have to look at a broader diet,” she says. Nutri laddus are a popular part of her organic food store Vibrant Living Foods. “For many, snacks are sweets and sweets are snacks. So they should be healthy. One of our popular items is coconut berry balls where palm jaggery, which has a lower glycemic index, is used along with soaked almonds and berries. Sometimes, amla powder is also added,” she says. Other snack balls on offer are carrot laddu, pumpkin laddu and pumpkin and pistachio custard laddu, to suit different palates. Healthy build Understandably, energy balls are a success with those who hit the gym. Nutritionist and home chef Priyanka Devika J., who runs The Nurturist in Thiruvananthapuram, says she often gets enquiries from body-builders for protein balls. “Such people look for simple food items providing better results. Healthy energy balls rightly fit that bill. It can be deemed a superfood and packs a fair amount of fibre too.” Some bakers, like Patric Johnson L. from Coimbatore, find more takers for the nutri ball versions than dry fruits and nuts per se. His online store The Nut On is focussing more on nut balls. “It comes with dates as base and has roasted almonds, cashew, pista, fig and black-grape raisin. All the ingredients are hand-chopped according to the required size to maintain the right proportion,” says Patric. He brings out the energy balls in two variations — without ghee and with A2 ghee from Indian cow breeds.  For many, these balls are the go-to home-made snack option while steering clear of fried favourites. Some, like Priya Ravikrishnan from Thiruvananthapuram, go the extra mile — she makes her own health mix that serves as the base for the nutri balls her family loves. “Along with my home-prepared multi-grain mix, which packs in 18 nutritious items such as bamboo rice, finger millet, foxtail millet, flaxseed, green gram, and horse gram, I add mashed dates, and coarsely powdered almonds, walnuts, cashew, white sesame seeds and a wee bit of honey,” she says. The scope for experimentation is wide, even for those trying them at home. Clearly, these snack balls are in your court.    Make it yourself  Chop dates. Heat kadai and with a sprinkle of water, roast the dates a bit. Mash it and add powdered mix of available nuts (almond, walnut, pista, sesame seeds etc). Mix well and, if needed, add a bit of coco powder (for kids who would love the flavour). Shape the mixture into balls.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||There’s something in your chocolate||When Prabhjot Singh Anand bit into the limited edition ‘Paan Jeer’ Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, he felt a twinge of pride. The off-beat combination of flavours was chosen by him, as part of a contest for the brand. “It tasted just as I thought it would,” he says over phone from Mohali. Prabhjot’s was a winning entry in the first edition of the Go Madbury for Cadbury campaign, which invited people from across the country to send in suggestions for desi flavours. The campaign was launched in 2019 by Cadbury and over 73 ingredients were listed, from which participants could choose and submit their entries. Anil Viswanathan, senior director – marketing (chocolates), Mondelez India, says, “Of course, we had to have the back-end ready with the wacky possibilities that could emerge.” And a few outlandish combinations did come in – chai and elaichi , kulfi and paan , popcorn and coffee, kulfi and badaam. The most common, however, were classics such as salted caramel, berries, coffee and hazelnut. In contrast, entries from the U.K. — where the campaign was called Cadbury Inventor Competition — had flavours like Crunchy Honeycomb, which includes chunks of actual honeycomb among other ingredients. Back in India, businessman Prabhjot says he dug into his childhood memories for inspiration — memories of eating meetha paan during visits to his grandmother’s house and the local anjeer (fig) ice cream that his father used to bring home. Apoorva Ranjan, a content writer based in Bengaluru, went for a different combination — her favourite mint and chocolate. Hers was the other winning entry. “I make mint and chocolate chip ice cream at home, so the idea came from there. But I wanted the mint flavour to be there like an aftertaste. Like when you are eating a piece of chocolate and get a tantalising hint of something that makes the entire experience interesting. When prepared well, mint and chocolate are a classic combination,” she says. Hint O’ Mint, as the chocolate is christened, is already bringing in appreciation, she says. The digital campaign received over eight lakh entries from India alone, where the final shortlisted candidates were as varied as chai latte , mishti doi and motichur among others. It was a task, sifting through a sea of creative entries. The R&D team, along with chef and chocolatier Varun Inamdar, shortlisted 100 entries, narrowing it down based on the marketability, creativity and feasibility of the flavours. The winning entries were chosen based on people’s votes too. ‘Paan Jeer’ may be a little bit of an evolved taste, and mint has not been one of the most popular flavours in India. But the response to the flavours has been overwhelming, says Anil. The limited edition bars will be available in the market through October and November. The 36-gram chocolate bars have been priced at Rs. 45. They can be bought online too, in select locations.  The second edition, Madbury 2.0, plans to go hyperlocal, to include flavours specific to the regions of India. “ Bhujiya , for instance. Or how about Mysore pak, desiccated coconut and banana?” asks Anil. “The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on business – gifting has come down drastically. But it also presents an opportunity. Snacking has increased and it is time for people to get creative about their snacks,” he adds.  Madubury 2.0 campaign, which was launched in September 2020, will be open till October 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-something-in-your-chocolate/article32808774.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||In harmony with Nature||Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary,   Arunachal Pradesh   With a distinctive fluty call, a diminutive bird with a striking olive green plumage flew out of the tree in the forests fringing Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, West Kameng district, Arunachhal Pradesh. Astronomer and bird watcher Ramana Athreya watched with quickening breath, as this bird, which is found only in these forests, had not been sighted since 1995. The indigenous Bugun tribe has ownership of these forests and, in their honour, the bird is named Bugun liocichla . This 17 sqkm community reserve is home to several threatened species including the red panda, golden cat and marbled cat. Youngsters of the tribe, along with the Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department, jointly patrol the forest and help with rescue and rehabilitation apart from promoting eco-tourism initiatives.  Yaongyimchen Community Biodiversity Conservation Area, Nagaland  In Nagaland’s Longleng district, 350 households of the Phom tribe from three villages — Yaongyimchen, Alayong and Sanglu — have transformed around 10 km of forest into a wildlife refuge. They are the catalysts for preserving and protecting the biodiversity without government assistance. The Yaongyimchen Community Biodiversity Conservation Area (YCBCA) is home to 85 species of birds, 15 species of frogs, leopards, barking deer, serow and otter. Today, it is the largest roosting area for Amur falcons.  Dugave, Karnataka  For the last three years, villagers in this village in the Konkan region of Ratnagiri district have taken it upon themselves to protect the pangolin. They worship it and believe it is blessed and protected by their goddess Waghjai. To them, the pangolin is the farmer’s friend and plays an important role in preserving the ecosystem. This year, they celebrated Khawalotsav on World Pangolin Day, February 15. The pangolin is under threat because of poaching, trafficking and international trade.  Chennai, Tamil Nadu  In this coastal city, efforts to save the Olive Ridley turtle began in the early 1970s. In 1988, the Student’s Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) was formed. The Tamil name Panguni aamai refers to the fact that the creature comes ashore to nest in the month of Panguni (mid-March to mid-April), when members of the SSTCN patrol the beaches at night, collect the turtle eggs, relocate them to a safer place and finally release the hatchlings into the sea. Interestingly, the hatchlings are released a few metres away from the waterline so that they can geo-map the location into their memories. This helps them come back to the same beach to lay eggs. Commercial fishing, large-scale trawling and dredging, changing beachscape and artificial lighting are some of the causes for the decline in turtle numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/in-harmony-with-nature/article32809563.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Time to celebrate||Gooooood morning, peeps. What an amazing day it is today! The sun is shining and the birds are chirping. Actually, that’s not true; it looks like it’s about to start pouring any second now, and the only bird I can see is this not-too-bright pigeon that keeps crashing into my bedroom window. But it sure feels like a sun-shining-bird-chirping day. Want to know why? No, online school has not been cancelled indefinitely. No, the pesky brother has not been given away to a travelling circus. No, my parents have not said yes to a second dog yet. My grandparents are coming. Now, for those of you who live with your grandparents, that doesn’t seem like such a big deal. But, for kids like me who see their grandparents once or twice a year, it is a pretty huge deal. On your side always When grandparents visit, your parents aren’t the oldest grown-ups in the house. Their parents are. Which means, you don’t really have to listen to everything your parents say. You can just do what your grandparents tell you and, because they haven’t seen you in nine months, they’re going to be saying really nice things like ‘Of course, you can have ice cream for dinner!’ Speaking of dessert, when grandparents visit, it’s like living in Willie Wonka’s chocolate factory. But filled with the best Indian sweets. Gulab jamuns, badam cakes, pitchers of payasam . If I tell my mother, I feel like having something sweet, she’ll give me a bowl of watermelon. But not my paati. She’ll whip up a batch of something delicious and sticky and sweet. Grandparents also know when to take your side — which is always! When you have your grandparents on your side, you get to stay up a little later, sleep in a little longer and skip math tuition. And your parents can’t say anything because, just like you have to listen to your parents, they have to listen to theirs. But really, the best thing of all is that grandparents always have time for you. They’re never too tired to play UNO with you, never shoo you away from the room because they’re on a Zoom call, and are always ready to play Candy Crush or Subway Surfer. And best of all? They never lecture. EVER. I know all this makes me sound super spoiled. But it’s just once a year, okay? And considering how awful 2020 has been so far, a little bit of spoiling is okay. Now, excuse me while I go make some space in my stomach for those badam cakes.  When grandparents visit, your parents aren’t the oldest grown-ups in the house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/time-to-celebrate/article32809539.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Escape to the wild||Movie: Madagascar (2005)  Genre: Animation, Adventure Marty, the bored and dejected zebra, and his friends — Alex, the contented lion, Gloria, the determined hippo, and Melman, the nervous giraffe — have spent all their years inside the concrete jungle that is New York City’s Central Park Zoo. Marty dreams about running free in the vast landscapes of Africa. On his 10th birthday, Marty, a quartet of penguins and two chimps escape from the zoo. Marty’s friends follow him, trying to make him see sense and give up on his dream but they too end up on the run along with him. On reaching Grand Central Station, the animals are mistaken to be aggressive and shipped off to a Kenyan wildlife preserve by the zoo authorities. The crafty penguins, however, hijack the ship and things take an unexpected turn when the animals find themselves on sandy shores of exotic Madagascar instead. Marty is thrilled that to finally be in the wild, but Alex, who is used to being treated like a king in the zoo, is desperate to go back to New York. On the island, the gang wins the trust of lemurs, led by the witty and self-centred King Julien. While they face many challenges, the toughest is faced by Alex, who is carnivorous. When he starts to crave for steak, what does it mean for the gang? Are they truly ready to embrace their wild side? Wild facts:  The lead quartet was originally supposed to be a lion, a zebra, a hippo, and an okapi. The last was changed to a giraffe to make it more familiar.  The Central Park Zoo does not house lions, zebras, giraffes or hippos. However, it does have penguins.  The airplane that the Lemurs hold court in is a Lockheed Electra, the same kind that Amelia Earhart was piloting when she disappeared on July 2, 1937.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/escape-to-the-wild/article32809557.ece

Rocky knew that if he misbehaved with Maya, Konica would get suspicious. “Can’t you knock?” he grunted. “Since when did friends knock?” Maya got an approving nod from Konica. “Konica di, do you have a Facebook account?” “Duh!” Konica glared at Maya. “Which teenager doesn’t?” “Di, can I play Temple Run? Please!” An unsuspecting Konica handed Maya her mobile. Maya settled down at the far end of the bed and opened Facebook. Her mouth fell open. “A strange thing has happened!” she said. When Konica saw what Maya had done, she snatched back her phone. “Why Facebook, you brat?” “Konica di, ghosts do Facebook.” Scepticism abounds “Nonsense!” snarled Konica. “Nana accepted my friend request and said ‘hi’  to me,” Maya said, excitedly bouncing on Rocky’s bed. Rocky’s face paled; that meant aliens were real! “What do you mean: Nana said ‘hi’?” frowned Konica. Maya now desperately wanted to chat with Nana, so she told Konica everything. “That’s crazy. This must be a joke. Ghosts don’t use Facebook,” said Konica. “Why not?” asked Maya. “That’s because ghosts can communicate without Facebook,” replied Konica. “Because they can be wherever they want. Meet whoever they want.” Rocky and Maya giggled. “What’s so funny, you imps?” snarled Konica. Rocky told her what Maya had said about them suddenly appearing and scaring people. Although Konica wasn’t convinced, it sounded plausible. So, she handed Maya her phone. “Hi Nana, how’s life in heaven?” Maya typed. Rocky and Konica giggled, but soon, their giggles disappeared. “Heavenly,” replied Nana. “How did your history test go, Maya?” “Awesome!” typed Maya. Konica snatched the phone back. “Are you nuts? It could also be a fake person.” “But why would a stranger want to know about my history test?” asked Maya. “It’s my Nana.” “We’ll soon find out,” replied Konica. “Rocky, let’s send a friend request to someone of ours. Our Nana or maybe your Nani!” Rocky thought it was a terrible idea. He was already having trouble hiding his test papers from his parents. Now, it would be impossible to do that with his grandparents’ ghosts. “We could create a whole ghost Facebook community, and become famous,” Maya’s eyes twinkled.  ... to be continued    That’s crazy.

While they shopped for groceries and vegetables, she walked along the aisles filled with junk food that she couldn’t have. Sometimes she played games on her mobile phone, which made her granny angry. “Can’t you do something useful with your phone?” she would chide. The mall was more fun when Shriya was with her cousins, eating ice creams and pizzas, watching movies and playing games at the fun arcade. One Sunday, Shriya decided that she would go to the book store and spend the money she had saved over the last three months, while her mom and granny shopped as usual. As she browsed through the best-selling childrens’ books section at the entrance, she spotted a girl standing outside. What’s wrong? One look at the tear-stained face and Shriya knew something was wrong. She watched the girl, who was trembling and crying, for a few minutes and then approached her. “Are you lost?” Shriya asked. “Let’s find your parents. What language do you speak?” The girl blinked but didn’t say anything. Shriya dragged her into the bookstore and browsed through the Geography books. She picked up an atlas and pointed to India. “India is my home. Where is yours?” The girl beamed. She grabbed the atlas from Shriya and pointed to South Korea. “Do you speak Korean?” The girl nodded. Shriya whipped out a phone from her purse and opened a website that would translate English to Korean and vice versa. “Are you lost?” she typed into the box. The girl saw the phone screen and nodded. Shriya turned the translation mode from Korean to English and passed the phone to the girl. “I got separated from my parents when we were coming out of the movie theatre.” “Do you remember your father’s phone number? Call him!” Shriya showed the translated message to the girl, who nodded and promptly typed the numbers. Her face lit up when someone answered. Shriya listened attentively, as she heard the girl speak; it was the first time she was hearing someone speak Korean. A few minutes later, a middle-aged couple emerged from the elevator. The little girl ran towards them with outstretched arms. “Thank you,” said the girl’s father. “We have spent the last hour searching. Lucy and her mother arrived from Seoul yesterday. She doesn’t understand a word of English.” The girl waved to Shriya. “Bye,” she said and went to look for her mother and grandmother in the grocery store.  She picked up an atlas and pointed to India. “India is my home. Where is yours?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/lost-in-the-mall/article32809534.ece

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are||What is a forest fire and how does it occur naturally?  Forest fires are uncontrolled and destroy everything that comes in their way. They can be both natural and caused by human beings. Natural forest fires can be caused by lightning, heat waves, volcanic eruptions or when dry leaves or sawdust catch fire (known as spontaneous combustion). Sometimes wind can carry burning debris far and wide and set fire to a forest area. Humans can also cause forest fires by being careless in not putting out camp fires or cigarettes completely.   How were phonesinvented?   In the 1870s, Alexander Graham Bell was trying to figure out how to send more than one message over a telegraph wire, at the same time. While doing so, he realised that he could use an electrical wire to send the sound of the human voice from one place to another. In 1876, he patented his machine, which is now called the telephone. However, there were other experimenters, like Charles Grafton Page, Johann Phillip Reis and Antonio Meucci, who had been working on similar lines through the 1840s.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article32809496.ece

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||The original mentors||It’s an old house in Mel Veedi, Thanjavur. A beautiful pulli kolam is drawn on the steps at the entrance. Inside, several black and white and sepia-tinted photographs of legendary nattuvanars of Bharatanatyam hang from the walls. Korai mats have been laid out on the red-oxide flooring. On a wooden bench in the narrow passage along the muttram (central courtyard) sits K.P.K Chandrasekhar, son of the famed Kittappa Pillai. “This is the sanctum of dance. This 200-year-old house is where the Thanjavur Quartet brothers—Ponniah, Chinniah, Sivanandam and Vadivelu—lived and created the Bharatanatyam repertoire,” says Anuratha Swaminathan, beginning to trace the history of the art form and the family’s lineage. Behind her is a painting of baby Krishna gifted to the family by the Maratha king of Thanjavur. This entire scenario is an episode from an Instagram series, anchored and curated by Anuratha, a Bharatanatyam dancer, who trained in the Thanjavur sampradayam , under the Malaysia-based Indira Manickam. Daughter-in-law of the well-known natyacharya B. Herambanathan, Anuratha, along with her mridangist husband Swaminathan, has come up with an interesting and insightful series that takes viewers back in time to understand how traditional practitioners taught the dance form and perfected its technique. In the process, she has been reaching out to some veteran dancers and talented disciples of the hereditary gurus, who recall the rigorous training and how their ‘ vadyar ’ (nattuvanars) or ‘teacher amma’ (female gurus) were unsparing of mistakes and mediocrity. It is fascinating to discover how in that era dancer-gurus from the Isaivellalar community used a certain extraordinary style to groom young disciples in this demanding art form. Teaching methods “My guru would ensure we were in the araimandi position throughout the adavu (footwork) session. She would insist that we tie a cloth belt to reduce stress on the hip and spine. And if we messed up an adavu, the next moment the thattukazhi (small wooden stick used to keep beat) would land near our feet. We were expected to take the art seriously and aim for excellence,” says Usha Balachandran, a disciple of Thanjavur Lakshmikantham Ammal. “Besides the many adavus, she taught us different hand gestures and eye movements to accompany diverse emotions. The aim was to make the entire body as expressive as possible.” Though these gurus were strict disciplinarians, their disciples say they were also caring and generous. “They were taskmasters only in the class because they taught with purpose — to pass on the rich treasure that they possessed. “The whole world might celebrate Kittappa Pillai as a nattuvanar, but to us he was a loving patriarch,” says Malathi Dominic, one of his earliest students. The training was systematic, relaxed and focussed on every aspect of natya. The students were not allowed to start dancing from day one. They had to first attentively listen to jatis being uttered by their gurus, then learn to keep beat with their hands, next would be footwork, followed by abhinaya and at the end of it, they would be introduced to compositions of the margam. “We continued doing the adavus till we could perform them flawlessly, which would not be less than two years. One could get to learn the alarippu only after a three-year training in the basic grammar. So strong was the foundation,” says Nandini Ramani, a well-known proponent of the Balasaraswati style. “Bala did not believe in over-dramatising emotions or glamourising movements. She made a mark with her honest and simple portrayals.” Uncompromising approach The gurus did not compromise even when it came to family. Kuttalam M. Selvam says his father Muthuswamy Pillai (a recipient of the French honour, Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres) insisted on his rigorous training before allowing him to pick up the cymbals to do nattuvangam. So it was with S. Palaniappan, grandson of Vazhuvoor Ramaiah Pillai. The conversations on the Insta presentation emphasise the timelessness of the traditional patantaram . And create awareness about the influential moments in dance history. They also make one realise how a dancer can develop a distinct approach and prepare the body for greater artistic challenges by gaining expertise in adavus, theermanams, kalapramanam and hand gestures. “If the series has managed to draw attention, it shows that tradition still holds sway,” says Anuratha. “For me, it has been a fulfilling experience as an artiste. It felt like going through my training all over again while speaking to the dancers, who brought to light the works of some hereditary gurus about whom the world doesn't know. For instance, Thanjavur Lakshmikantham Ammal and Duraikannu Ammal of Pichaiya Pillai School of Bharatanatyam, the first central government registered dance school in 1952. Veena Bashiniammal, Lakshmikantham’s grandmother, was known for her riveting abhinaya classes." Kalapramanam (tempo) is a significant feature of the Thanjavur bani. “And a relaxed kalapramanam lets the dancer bring out the beauty of every adavu and bhava and the changing sensibilities too,” says Anuratha.     The Instagram series takes viewers back in time to understand how traditional practitioners taught the dance form and perfected its technique||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-original-mentors/article32809123.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||The time to create||You describe your work in the film, ‘And indeed there will be time…’, as a conversation between space, time and matter. What moved you to create this work?  In the short span of six months, social distancing has left its mark on our bodies. We have become suspicious of our own hands, anxious about what we have touched, where we have leaned or sat, or who has passed by within a foot from us. Feeling alienated from our bodily selves, I wanted to ask what it means to move through space, to partner with surfaces and objects, to move around people without touching them, to feel their fear and shrinking… this film has been a small intervention in time, to perhaps ‘touch’ what is not yet. Tell us about the space where this work was created It is a house in the middle of renovation. The invitation to ‘walk through’ this site came to me from Prakriti Foundation. The site had been abandoned, with tell-tale signs of activity suspended midway — scaffolding, cement, tools and personal belongings like slippers and bottles. The film was shot as an impromptu response to the space — an in-between space, in an in-between time and, as such, a sign of the times we are all inhabiting. The conditions for the creation of art have radically changed in the past few months. What does it mean for you to be an artiste in these times and how has this found its way into this piece?  In one way, the film medium allows a sense of the timeless to make its way into the expression (I thank my colleague Sharan Devkar Shankar for his work here) and it can perhaps be a way to reflect the ambiguity and change. But aside from the piece itself, I find myself constantly occupied with the question of what it means to be a practitioner in these times. One of the most devastating changes I see is in regarding the arts as non-essential in the face of disease, hunger and death — conditions that existed before the pandemic. Artistes in most countries are faced with a denial of the arts as relevant and in need of state support and public patronage. While several online platforms have proliferated, I hold dear the certainty that we cannot replace the role and power of live performance in connecting people and healing a nation’s psyche. The title of the piece is beautiful, and I am curious to know about its provenance  The title ‘And indeed there will be time…’ is a line from T.S. Eliot’s ‘The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock.’ Written at the turn of the 20th century, the poem spoke of alienation, isolation and the diminishing power of authority… uncanny how it relates to the times we live in. And what of art? What of the staggering responsibilities that art is charged with? I dare say art cannot change the world… but a changing world can certainly benefit from the practice of art. A nation without its artistes is a nation that has stopped dreaming. You had said that the completion of the piece left in you a void. But if indeed there will be time, what wisdom would you like to share?  Perhaps it is to do with the times - this sense of hanging in the air, untethered to any reality, that often leaves me (and no doubt many others) unable to ascribe value or a sense of purpose to our ‘output’ as artistes. It all seems to disappear into a black hole. However, it soon occurs to me that we have always been engaged in that which is unquantifiable... and that perhaps it is meant for not just artistes but all of humanity to stay with this uncertainty and deal with the unknown a while longer and not be in haste to ‘fix’ a world that serves our interests once more. ‘And indeed there will be time…’ was filmed by photographer and film-maker Sharan Devkar Shankar and facilitated by Prakriti Foundation. The film is available on YouTube.  The writer is a professor   of Anthropology, IIT Madras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-time-to-create/article32809118.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Dramatic transition||From the koothambalam to the device screen, it has not been an easy transition for Koodiyattam, Kerala’s ancient Sanskrit theatre form, to adapt itself to the new normal. Besides its elaborate costume and heavy make-up, the art form is known for its lengthy scenes, an entire play may be staged in over 100 days and a single act in seven to 12 days with a performance duration of three to six hours. Traditionally performed as part of rituals in temples and later, on stage, Koodiyattam artistes, faced with an uncertain future in the wake of the pandemic, have been exploring the online world to reach out to the audience. And they have met with a fair amount of success. Initial attempts, mainly through Facebook, in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown were born more out of enthusiasm than certainty. But as the lockdown was extended, both artistes and cultural organisers stepped up their act with a stream of webinars, lec-dems and pre-recorded programmes. The live streaming that followed had the biggest impact, with both Koodiyattam and Kathakali, which draws a relatively larger audience, seeing a spike in views. Nepathya Moozhikkulam and Madhavamathrugramam, two popular Koodiyattam groups, say the feedback has been extremely encouraging. Nepathya was perhaps the first off the blocks has presented 12 live Koodiyattam and Nangiarkoothu performances and ten Chakyarkoothu sessions since May. According to its creative director, Margi Madhu, “I am happy about the increasing viewership online. Our monthly programmes used to get only a small audience, but on Facebook it is being watched by an average of 40 people. The videos of these performances, streamed later, have been garnering over 3,000 views. I believe our English subtitles have helped extend our reach outside India.” Technical glitches Madhu, however, also has some concerns. Though the quality of the video is good, he is not happy with the audio quality, especially of the mizhavu drums. Improving the standard of live streaming calls for a fine set of equipment, including video camera, microphone with audio mixing device, video switcher and encoder. “But that would require huge investment, which is difficult in the present circumstances when the focus is to help artistes monetarily due to cancellation of events and festivals,” says Madhu. Koodiyattam artiste Rajaneesh Chakyar of Madhavamathrugramam has attempted only Chakyarkoothu online till now. “Initially, we decided to wait it out. But as the lockdown was extended, we decided to try out the new medium. We converted a room in our house into a studio, put black backdrops, fitted LED lights, and used our mobile cameras to shoot. We know the quality isn’t ideal, so we have planned to invest in better equipment.” Despite the challenges, it is the positive feedback that has kept Rajaneesh going during this crisis. “For one, we get a larger audience as people sit at home and watch. Also, the video remains on the Facebook page, so anyone can go back and watch it.” Sound is an issue for Rajaneesh too. “We tried collar mic for Koothu, a speech-intensive art form, but it gets cut off intermittently when we move about on stage.” The scene is a little different in Kathakali. Here it is usually the organiser who arranges the venue. The last one month has seen an increase in live programmes, organised by various groups, but the streaming quality has not been consistent. The right ambience Shaji Mullookkaaran, an IT professional with a keen interest in art videography, says this is an opportunity to get the latest technology. Shaji confronts many problems in his work, from bright, overpowering backdrops to unsuitable lighting and inadequate bandwidth. He says that organisers must pay more attention to these factors rather than leaving everything to the lighting contractor. “They must insist on a clean black background, PAR lights that can focus a narrow beam and control brightness. They should also ensure high-speed fibre broadband. Going forward, all venues must ideally provide fibre connection. All these will add to the cost but will result in a good viewing experience,” explains Shaji. He feels that online presentations are here to stay as more people have begun to enjoy watching programmes from the comfort of their homes. Madhu agrees. He plans to continue streaming even after Covid. “But first we need to upgrade our equipment and sponsors can help us do it,” he says. It is time art lovers, corporate entities and the government came together to take Koodiyattam, the 2,000-year-old Sanskrit theatre recognised by UNESCO as one of the ‘Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’, and Kathakali, an art form synonymous with Kerala, to the next level.  The author, a retired journalist, writes on Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/dramatic-transition/article32809094.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Bringing the Ustad’s khayals alive||To celebrate Pt. Vijay Kichlu’s 90th birthday, Sangeet Ashram, Kolkata, organised an online event. Kichlu, a renowned musician and musicologist, is the founder-director of Sangeet Research Academy. During his 25-year tenure at the academy, he trained several classical musicians of repute. After relinquishing the post in 2002, he founded Sangeet Ashram, an organisation that grooms listeners of classical music. The event focused on Ustad Amir Khan – the path-breaking modernist and the founder of the Indore gharana. The essence of his music was highlighted through a critical appreciation of some of his favourite compositions. Instead of playing Khansaheb’s popular records, the bandishes were rendered by Supriyo Dutta, a young and talented follower of Khansaheb. Fine blend of styles This was a daunting task, but the vocalist’s deft handling can be attributed to his training under Acharya Ramakrishna Basu (a disciple of Ustad Amir Khan), Pt. Vijay Kichlu and Subhra Guha. His rich voice conveyed a fine blend of the nuances of the Indore and Agra gharanas. He was brilliantly supported by Indranil Mullick (disciple of Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri) and Jyotirmoy Banerjee (disciple of Pt. Ajoy Chakrabarty). Dutta commenced with ‘Baje niki ghunghariyan’ (Bilaskhani Todi). Despite the raga’s pathos-ridden character, Khansaheb would bring out the frivolous beauty of this composition with his taans; because this is apparently a love song. According to Sufi philosophy, the supreme being is an enchanting lover. The next bandish, ‘Mana ke panchhi’ (Gurjari Todi) created an ambience of calm, a quality that defined Khansaheb’s music. Dutta next moved to a devotional bandish in raag Bairagi followed by a rare Khansaheb composition that features his pen name, ‘Sur rang’. Most of his compositions such as ‘Jinke mana raam biraje’ (Malkauns) do not carry this moniker and are sung by musicians across gharanas. Despite being a traditionalist, Ustad Amir Khan did not hesitate to experiment. He incorporated minor changes in the lyrics of traditional bandish to suit his style and mood. To highlight this aspect, Dutta sang a Jog bandish, ‘Saajan more ghar aaye’. For the Agra gayaki’s bol-baant, the staccato-oriented ‘ata mana sukh paave’ suits best, but Khansaheb went on record with ‘jiyara at sukh pave’ because the word ‘jiyara’ suited his elaboration better. Apart from this sensitive approach to lyrics, he would interpret raags from a unique angle. One such example is raag Marwa. Traditionally an uttarang pradhan raag, Khansaheb’s persuasive style transformed it permanently into a poorvang-pradhan raag. He always mixed technique with emotion in such a way that a single raag could radiate different moods. Interesting session Dutta strived to showcase all these points while rendering slow and fast compositions in Marwa, Malkauns, Darbari, Miyan Malhar, Ramdasi Malhar, and Megh along with taranas. Khansaheb completely transformed taranas as he believed that ‘every syllable of a tarana is meaningful.’ The interesting session closed with a surprise item. Khansaheb sang only khayals on stage but as a playback singer in films, he had recorded a thumri and ghazal. The ghazal, Mirza Ghalib’s ‘Rahiye ab aisi jagah’, tuned by his prime disciple Pt. Amarnath, rendered at the concert made for a grand finale. Since the event has been professionally videographed, the audio quality is appreciably good.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Remembering guru ma||Annapurna Devi shunned the limelight in her lifetime. Now, for her second death anniversary (October 13), her nephew Ustad Aashish Khan and his School of World Music have organised a programme to pay tribute to the reclusive genius. To be held on October 11, the programme also celebrates the memory of Aashish’s late younger brother, Ustad Dhyanesh Khan, whose sarodist-son Shiraz Ali, is co-curator. California-based Aashish Khan trained periodically under his aunt. “When my grandfather was away, pishima (Annapurna) was in charge of our teaching and practice. She was systematic and used to herself play on the tabla bayan to help us maintain the laya. She used to teach us vocal dhrupad compositions, horis, taranas as well as instrumental gats. Teaching was according to the season — raags like Basant, Paraj in spring and Malhars in monsoon. I was first taught aalap by her; also the ‘da ra da ra’ bols which are not authentic sarod baaj. We miss her a lot.” Experience by hearing One of Annapurna Devi’s finest disciples is Jodhpur-based sarodist, Pt. Basant Kabra, who belongs to a family of businessmen and classical music connoisseurs. The laconic musician paints a heart-warming picture of his guru. “Guru ma was around 53 when I first went to learn from her. A surbahar exponent, she never played the instrument when teaching us. Maybe once or twice she picked up the instrument to demonstrate something that I couldn’t understand. Ma taught me a little surbahar baaj (technique) too, and the correct hold of the sitar. Her priority in life was to pass on the taalim she had imbibed from her father.” Annapurna Devi was particular about what type of music should be played on which instrument. Tayyari ke taan, zamzama, bol kaari are meant for sitar while aalap and gamak are meant for surbahar. “Ma used to always say, ‘Concentrate on what I am teaching you about a raag and note its usage, don’t go into technicalities. And don’t try explaining its structure to others; our gharana’s raags are handled differently. One can only experience them by hearing. You can’t verbalise what I teach you to play; it can only be conveyed through your music,” recalls Basant. One of her favourite raags was Manjh Khamaj, created by her legendary father, Ustad Allaudin Khan. “She would say the raag helps beat tiredness, but one hears it only in its lighter form now, as something to end a concert with. . She taught it fully only to a few disciples. She once told me she herself had not mastered how to play the raag the way her Baba had conceived it,” says Basant. Annapurna Devi also loved raags that are ‘madhyam pradhan’. Her father, in fact, created raag Kausi Bhairav for her. “She explained to me how this raag is similar to Adana and Darbari. And that raags Kausi Kanhra and Kausi Bhairav are not the same. She also told me that Ustad Allauddin Khan taught raag Darbari only to three of his disciples — Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and her. A demanding guru “My guru was very difficult to learn from; she would remember exactly what she had taught five years ago. She didn’t ever want to be recorded. Or even photographed; there is just one photo of hers in recent years. But I know she was recorded; because she wrote down what she recorded in a notebook that she wrote in Bangla. (This has now been translated into English by Swapan Kumar Bannerji in Unheard Melodies. ). These recordings were done in the 1940s. She recorded Ragas Puriya and Gara, which I have never heard.” Recalling her sharp ear, Basant says she would call out from the kitchen when cooking to check the ‘pancham tarab’. “Imagine, not even a note on the main wire but on the sympathetic wire. She was an amazing person, not just a fantastic musician. She never criticised other musicians. My last memory of her is on Guru Purnima, before she passed away. She asked me to sit by her bed and play raag Yaman. Despite knowing her so well, I never understood many things about her — why she never created raags and why she was so reclusive,” says Basant, as his voice peters off and he gets lost in memories.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Will theatre go back to the open?||Under the spotlight, the silhouette of a woman becomes visible. Clad in a silk saree, she is seated on a high armchair, one foot tucked under her, and the other on the footstool. The inner precincts of a lavish haveli come to life as she peers thoughtfully into an array of files, adjusting her spectacles and holding a quill. Actor Mita Vashisht plays the matriarch of a zamindar family in Maharashtra in a play set in 1948. Agnipankh , the Hindi adaptation of PL Mayekar’s epic Marathi play from the 1980s, has been revived in this teleplay version. “The play is relevant for all times,” says Mita, “It talks about people, their strengths and vulnerabilities, and for standing up for what they believe is right.” The play revolves around the character of Durgeshwari, known as ‘Baisaab’, who runs the zamindari estate with astute authority while her husband (played by Satyajit Sharma), unable to manage the business with his scholarly and artistic interests, has succumbed to alcoholism and debauchery. “It is one of the rare dramas from that era where the woman is at the centre. She came into the family as a young wife, cleverly brought in because of her intelligence in handling the fortunes of the estate, and even though she is a woman, she upholds the system’s patriarchy. She is also child-like since she hasn’t known any other man, and shares this love-hate relationship with her husband,” points out Mita, who has played the role of a strong woman many times before. For the actor, it was important to find her unique voice as Baisaab. “I took a long time figuring out how Baisaab would speak. The spoken word is often overlooked by actors. Working with the word is not just communicating the dialogues, but how you release the word, the pauses, the breath.” Stage to screen Mita has worked across different genres and medium — stage, cinema and television. The power of the teleplay lies in its simple stage aesthetics that do not alter the camera’s dramatic flow. After numerous live shows since 2017, the play was adapted for the OTT platform. “The set design, lighting and scenography remain unchanged. Initially, I was sceptical about televising it, but we were not overwhelmed by the camera. It was important to stay faithful to the format of the play and the energy of theatre as it is performed.” Mita disagrees that technology is key to presenting plays today. She feels it is important to return to simple aesthetics of stagecraft and layered performances. “Is digital theatre really theatre? I feel that in the coming years, technology will take a backseat and the performers will come to the fore.” Reflecting on the shifts in the theatre form because of the pandemic, the actor says, “Will we get to do theatre again? Maybe in the lawn, maybe we will sit on blankets, apart from each other and watch. I feel, in a strange way, that the present challenge is taking theatre back to where it came from. Theatre architecture was designed for being near nature. Maybe it is time again to return to a theatre in the open, instead of pushing it behind closed doors.” During the lockdown, Mita got into an introspective mode and tried to make peace with the uncertainty. “I want to ask the artiste community – even when things were normal did one always have work? I think it’s important to respect and be humble about this uncertainty. We think we are in control of our life but it’s not so. This is a chance to reflect upon this, to be free from fear and think of new ways of being.”  ( Agnipankh is    screening on ZEE5)   The Delhi-based author writes on culture.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||In search of the muse||When Anusuya Singh Estevez, the gifted daughter of Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, passed away last month in Merida, Venezuela at the age of 84, it created ripples in the literary circuit. Followers of Shiv Kumar Batalvi surfaced on the social media and described Anasuya as Batalvi’s unrequited love, who inspired him to write the timeless gem, ‘Ik kudi jida naam mohabbat gum hai’ (A girl, whose name is love, is lost). Composer Amit Trivedi used Batalvi’s verse to mesmerising effect in Udta Punjab . Sung by Shahid Mallaya with versions by Diljeet Dosanjh and Alia Bhatt, the song became the defining feature of the film and continues to be a hit with teenagers. Does a broken heart let one pen great poetry or is it just a myth circulated by fans, and, at times, by writers themselves. There are multiple narratives about how the passionate relationship between Anusuya and Shiv was killed before it blossomed in Preet Nagar, an estuary of liberal thoughts created by Gurbaksh Singh, where Eastern and Western ideas met and found a voice in the much-sought-after magazine Preetlari . Old-timers say it was a Nehruvian experiment against a conflict-ridden world where creative personalities such as Balraj and Bhisham Sahni, Sobha Singh and Balwant Gargi met and discussed their work. It is said that it was here that the platonic romance between Sahir Ludhianvi and Amrita Pritam also took shape. Read the text Senior critic of Punjabi literature. Prof. Krantipal. advises followers to read the text and to not go by the stories associated with it. “By doing so, you are limiting the vastness of the thought of the writer,” he says, adding that it’s usually teenagers on the cusp of adulthood who are drawn to the incredibly handsome Batalvi, whose stage presence remains unrivalled. Most writers of romance in Punjab, he says, were inspired by the unfulfilled romance of Shirin-Farhad and Sohini-Mahiwal and Shiv was no different. “According to me, he was not inspired by just one woman or just one situation,” says Prof. Krantipal, reminding me of Shiv’s interview with the BBC, which is available on YouTube. In the interview, when he is asked of love and heartbreak, he denies the idea of one image, one love and says, in fact, that it was a combination of experiences and the class structure of Indian society that influenced his poetry. He goes on to say he could not make a complete image of his muse. “It was somebody’s lips, somebody else’s feet that inspired me to write.” But he does admit that every intellectual is dying a slow death. The youngest to win the Sahitya Akademi Award, Batalvi died of liver problems at the age of 35. In the case of Sahir-Amrita, there is evidence that Sahir Ludhianvi did write at least one song for her that was later used in Bharat Bhushan-starrer Dooj Ka Chand (1964). Akshay Manwani, Sahir’s biographer, says that in her autobiography Raseedi Ticket , Amrita, who was besotted with Sahir for a long time, mentions the evening when she along with Imroz, her live-in partner, went to meet Sahir in his hotel in Delhi. That night, she says, Sahir called up at midnight and sang the nazm, ‘Mere saathi khali jaam’, referring to the empty glasses on his table in which the three had been drinking whiskey that night. Referring to the conversation, Amrita writes that Sahir told her over the phone, “There are still three glasses lying on the table. By turn, I am sipping from each one of them, and writing.” It resulted in the popular song, ‘ Mehfil se uth jaane waalon tum logon par kya ilzam, tum abaad gharon ki vasi main awaara aur badnam ,’ composed by Roshan and sung by Mohammed Rafi. The passing caravan As for stories around Sahir writing ‘Chalo ek baar phir ajnabi ban jayen hum dono’ ( Hamraaz , 1967) for singer Sudha Malhotra, Manwani says it is in the domain of gossip. “I asked Sudha Malhotra and she denied that the song was written for her. These are urban legends that fans hold on to with great relish and when somebody clarifies that there is no actual proof, the followers feel devastated,” he chuckles. On the same lines, it is said that poet Gopal Das Neeraj wrote, ‘Carvan guzar gaya gubar dekhte rahe’ when he felt desolate after watching the marriage procession of his beloved pass by. Years later, the song was composed by Roshan and sung by Mohammed Rafi in Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal (1966). When this journalist once asked the poet about the story behind the song, he only said that karuna (compassion) is an essential ingredient of his life and the song is one of the better examples of it. He was not too happy with its picturisation though. The story of poet Asrar Ul Haq Majaz is no different. As handsome as Neeraj and Shiv, he was also a darling of the stage with a huge female fan following. Like them, he also faced heartbreak and wrote the nazm, ‘ Ae gham-e-dil kya karoon, ae vehashate dil kya karoon ’ (Oh sad heart, what shall I do? Oh frustrated heart, what shall I do?), titled ‘Awaara’ by him. Many years later, it was composed by Sardar Malik and used in Shammi Kapoor’s Thokar (1953). The film flopped, but the song lives on, courtesy Talat Mahmood’s voice. Suhaib Sherwani who co-produced a feature film on the life of Majaz says the Lucknow-based poet had suicidal tendencies and found himself a misfit in Bombay where many of his progressive writer friends had migrated. It is said that Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa also had elements of his life. In fact, in the scene where Vijay (Guru Dutt) is serving drinks before a poetic soiree, a lanky young man with wavy hair recites a couplet:  Roodad-e-gham-ulfat unhe kya kehte aur kyoon kehte   Ik harf bhi na nikla honthon se, aur aankhon main aansoon aa gaye  (What sad love stories shall I tell her and how. Before I could utter a word, I saw tears in her eyes) The couplet is taken from a Majaz’s ghazal and sets the tone for ‘ Jaane woh kaise log the jinke pyaar ko pyaar mila .’ As Majaz was once friendly with lyricist Sahir and scriptwriter Abrar Alvi, it is said that the couplet and the image of the young poet was their tribute to the poet who passed away in 1955, two years before Pyaasa made it to theatres. Wine and woman Sherwani, who taught English Literature at Aligarh Muslim University, says the image of the poet was not necessarily of Majaz. “It reflected a global trend after World War II when creative souls were questioning where humanity was headed.” Wine and woman, he says, are metaphors in Urdu poetry which should not be taken literally. “Many eminent poets resisted the film world because it often does a literal translation of their words through images. It is like legends and myths which are essentially meant to explain human behaviour and have a spiritual value but the ignorant treat them as mere stories.” However, over the years, he says, it has been proven that images can wear off but verse continues to evoke new meanings for a new generation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/in-search-of-the-muse/article32809091.ece
09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||The lone piper of Kizhoot||The whooshing rains set the pitch for the teenager Kizhoot Nandanan when he blew the kurumkuzhal at a string of minor shows that entire monsoon. Paradoxical, given that such melam ensembles are typically a summer feature in his native Kerala. “These shows also worked as practice sessions. Our small band would halt at select houses and perform briefly,” says the kurumkuzhal artiste, recalling the ritualistic para processions from old temples south of Thrissur back in 1983. “I’d be the lone piper in the mini team that had drums, trumpets, a gong and the conch. We’d trail the oracle representing the deity... along roads, by-lanes and open farms.” The first chance Nandanan was 16 when he got his first such ceremonial assignment, courtesy an invitation from ilathalam cymbalist Maniyamparambil Mani. “One needed only minimum ease with the kurumkuzhal. That’s all I had then,” he says. “The biggest draw, though, was the food.” The feasts laid out during those three Malayalam months starting with Edavam (mid-May) were a happy interlude for the boy from a poor family. His father, Velappaya Unni Nair, was a kurumkuzhal player, too. The earnings were meagre. And his mother, Kamalakshi Amma, doubled up as a daily-wager. Once, when his father was teaching Nandanan the basics of kurumkuzhal, he found that the boy was not following a preliminary lesson well. “Hard came a slap on my thigh,” he recalls. “I ran away from home. My mother was working in the paddy field and she saw me and chased me down and brought me back.” Back home, he told his mother that he was running away to jump before a train. “My father’s punishment was rare, but I took it to heart,” says Nandanan. His impulsive reaction notwithstanding, he soon did get the exercise right. “Blowing the pipe requires strong lung power. Father had given me a papaya straw. I had to dunk it in a vessel of water and blow into it non-stop. For that you need to simultaneously inhale at intervals. When there were any breaks in the bubbles forming in the water, father got angry.” A couple of years later, Nandanan began to accompany his father to temple festivals. As a beginner, the boy found his slot at one end of the long row of pipers in the large percussion melams called panchari and pandi. Then, at 18, Nandanan got a break. A couple of senior pipers failed to turn up at a venue in Anthikad near his home. “You stand opposite me in the middle,” said chenda veteran Peruvanam Appu Marar, the chief percussionist for that night’s three-hour melam. “I will give you the signals for the turn of chapters. Fix your eyes on mine.” Overcoming his initial nervousness, Nandanan passed the litmus test. A pleased Marar referred him to kurumkuzhal exponent Kombath Kuttan Panicker, and the youngster became Panicker’s disciple at his house near Peruvanam, the home of melam. “The first half-year was spent solely in singing. The seven basic Carnatic notes and the related saptaswara patterns,” says Nandanan. Panicker, who was also a nagaswaram player, over the next three monsoon semesters, taught Nandanan the nuances of the two-reed kurumkuzhal with its wooden body that segues into a brass bell-bottom. Spanning 12 to 18 inches, it is similar to the Hindustani shehnai in looks and timbre. From Panicker (1929-2011), Nandanan learnt the solo kuzhalpattu concert presented customarily for one hour before the illustrious melams. A piece akin to ragam-tanam-pallavi is central to their school. Often tuned to the weighty Kamboji or Bhairavi ragas, it is presented after an invocatory Gambhira Nattai number and concludes with a breezy mangalam in Madhyamavati. Late scholar L.S. Rajagopalan notes that the kurumkuzhal’s eight holes are distanced in such a way that the instrument sounds like the Harikamboji parent scale of south Indian classical music. The pivotal role Nandanan was just 20 when he debuted at the grand Thrissur Pooram, Kerala’s grandest. And since 2010, he has been the key piper for the pivotal Paramekavu temple at its annual event, anchoring ensembles of 150 artistes with the acumen of a Western symphony orchestra’s impresario. Frontline melam leader Peruvanam Satheesan Marar lauds Nandanan’s conducting capabilities in tandem with the main chenda drummer. “His sophistication and solemnity spreads to fellow pipers,” he says. Life has been distrupted by Covid-19, but Nandanan finds comfort in the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi award that he has just received. Does he have big dreams? “No,” he says, from his house in Peramangalam, 10 km north of Thrissur. “Just a worry-free life for my wife and two daughters.”  The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.

09 October 2020||October 09 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s the words||When my spouse began playing Sanjay Subrahmanyan’s rendition of ‘Thunbam Nergayil’ for what seemed the 100th time that day, I sat up and took notice. I wanted to understand why he was so entranced with it. “Didn’t you listen to the words?” he asked . His somewhat cryptic response set me thinking. I’ve always believed that music transcends boundaries—of culture, language and religion. Which is why Pavarotti singing Verdi’s Rigoletto moved me despite my utter ignorance of the Italian language. Any of us who’ve been to films would have experienced our eyes tearing up when a somnolent violin accompanies the heroine’s break-up. Even a lone instrument playing with nary a beat is enough to set our feelings atwitter. When such music is set to even a simple rhythmic beat, it can trigger emotions. It is the beat in a Tamil or Hindi song that makes people dance, even if they don’t understand the lyrics. When I began learning Carnatic music as a child, rarely did my teachers stop to explain the meanings for either Tyagaraja’s Telugu songs or Purandaradasa’s Kannada songs. Even the Tamil songs were often in flowery and formal language and not in the simple vernacular spoken at home. It was, however, the ragas — a Sahana or a Simhendramadhyamam — that held me rapt. My teacher, the late Seetalakshmi Venkatesan, introduced me to the vachanas of the Kannada mystics Akka Mahadevi and Basavanna. As a Tamil speaker, understanding the vachanas was not easy, but over time as I began to understand these works, it began reflecting in the joy I experienced while singing or teaching them. My husband’s epiphany with Bharatidasan’s ‘Thunbam Nergayil’ brought me back to considering what role lyrics play in enriching the listening experience of Indian music. Role of lyrics Folk music pre-dates all classical forms and it’s interesting to look at the role lyrics play there. With their refrains, many folk songs encourage us to sing along, helping foster a sense of community and forget the realities of everyday life. The poignant ‘Mee Dolkar’, a Marathi song of the Koli fishing community, compares the sea to a lover waiting impatiently for her partner. The quirky ‘Sasural Genda Phool’ from Chhattisgarh describes a new bride adjusting to her various in-laws. While folk songs mirror the daily lives of people, ghazals often dwell on memories. The famous ‘Chupke Chupke Raat Din’ written by Maulana Hasrat Mohani and popularised by Ghulam Ali describes a love affair, the heartache of missing a beloved, and the encounter between the lovers. The words tug at one’s heartstrings and Ali’s sensitive rendition adds to the allure. Tyagaraja wrote his songs in emotive and accessible Telugu, mostly in first person. His songs reflect his state of mind whether it is grief (‘Endhudhaaginaado’), yearning (‘Tera tiyaga radha’) or joy (‘Intha Kannananda’). And his vast repertoire has diverse lyrical content and context—from simple songs to the complex Pancharatna kritis. In Hindustani music, the lyrics or bandish are looked at primarily from the lens of improvisation of melody and rhythm. The lines, usually two to eight, are paeans to gods and royal patrons or describe emotions or nature. The popular ‘Aeri Aali Piya Bina’ reflects a lovelorn woman’s state of mind while ‘Tu Hain Malik Mera’ is a call to the divine. More laidback While classical music is bound by rules of grammar, the lyricists for films have greater laissez faire. When ‘Kolaveri Di’ became a hit, it took many by surprise, but predictably, it revived the widely-held notion that lyrics were being short-changed by an excessive focus on melody and rhythm. Yet, without lyrics how do instrumentalists recreate a similar magic? Words, their power to move notwithstanding, can sometimes get in the way of our own imagination — as we’ve seen with many films, poorly adapted from books. Listening to instrumental music, however, gives the listener the freedom to imagine the lyrics on a blank slate. But, as my husband discovered, the power of lyrics is indeed transcendental. Bharatidasan wrote ‘Thunbam Nergayil’, a poem about how the travails of our lives can be lessened by Tamil poetry, song, dance and wisdom. The lyric was set to tune in ragam Desh by the poet’s friend Dandapani Desigar, enhancing the charm of the work. And Sanjay Subrahmanyam’s emotive rendition brought these lyrics to life in a manner that reinforced the magic of the words.

Inspired by many scholars such as Kanchi P.B. Annangaracharya, Puthur Krishna Swamy Iyengar, Karappangadu Venkatacharya and Velukkudi Vardacharya Swamy, he gained expertise in traditions and rituals. VVR Swamy pursued a career in chemical research and education. He was a faculty member in Annamalai University and later did a Ph.D from Tulane University, US. He worked as a professor in the University of Madras. His book on semi-micro qualitative analysis, published in the 60s, is used in colleges even today. After retirement, VVR Swamy was associated with a monthly spiritual magazine, Yathiraja Paduka , of which he was the editor for more than 25 years. The magazine was establised in honour of Mudaliandan Swamy, one of Sri Ramanuja’s disciples. VVR Swamy also brought out several books on spiritual traditions in English as well as booklets such as Krishnashtakam and Yajur Upakarma Kramam . His book ‘Emperunanaar Vaibhavam ’ was written to commemorate the millennial year of Sri Ramanuja, but VVR Swamy passed away before the book could be printed. The book has now been edited by M. Varadarajan, former professor of SV University, and issued as a souvenir to commemorate VVR Swamy’s centenary. An able administrator, Swamy was also the long-time secretary of Sishya Sabha of Swamy Mudaliandan Thirumaligai, and secretary of Swamy Manavana Mamunigal Sabha, Triplicane. On his centenary, he is remembered for his many contributions to the Vaishnava tradition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/in-memory-of-an-erudite-scholar/article32809104.ece

09 October 2020||Chandigarh,||Badal targets Punjab CM over Centre’s farm laws||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal accused Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday of deliberately delaying a legislation to negate the Centre’s agriculture sector laws. “We were the first to make this demand more than ten days back. We had asked the Chief Minister to call a special session and bring in a legislation making the entire State a single market yard. The farm organisation were making this demand too, but the Chief Minister was delaying it on one pretext or the other,” said Mr. Badal He said the Chief Minister should listen and understand the pain and anguish of the farmers and farm labourers. The State government should immediately scrap the provisions of the ‘anti farmer’ 2017 APMC Act, which was amended by the ruling Congress after assuming power.  AAP demands meeting The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), meanwhile, has written to the Chief Minister, asking for a meeting of all the stakeholders, including representatives of farmers’ organisations and agronomists, and all political parties to discuss the issue threadbare. The party’s State president and MP, Bhagwant Mann, said the special Assembly session must be at least for seven days for a detailed discussion. The entire proceedings could be telecast live so that the people of Punjab could see for themselves what was being done.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/badal-targets-punjab-cm-over-centres-farm-laws/article32808789.ece
09 October 2020||JAIPUR,||HC poser to Rajasthan govt. on additional Central food aid||The Rajasthan High Court has asked if the State government had made any additional demand for release of food aid from the Centre during the COVID-19 pandemic, while enquiring about the present status of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and the process for revision of their lists. The court’s query came during the hearing on a public interest litigation raising the issue of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) not providing sufficient quantity of foodgrains to the destitute and underprivileged people during the pandemic. Two law students, who filed the PIL, said the number of beneficiaries had increased exponentially after the data collection in 2013. A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty directed the State government, through the Chief Secretary, to be impleaded as a respondent in the case in view of its role in the matter. Additional Advocate General Rajesh Maharshi was asked to file an affidavit indicating the status of NFSA beneficiaries and the manner in which the State was proceeding to revise their lists. Petitioners Himakshi Alaria and Harsh Kumar pointed out that the migrant labourers, daily wage earners, people excluded from the purview of social security pensions and those not covered in the NFSA were important contributors to the change of demography in the State. None of them was getting any food assistance from FCI, according to the writ petition.  ‘All not covered’ While the food stocks being disbursed by the FCI in Rajasthan amounted to 2.23 metric tonnes for a total of 4.46 crore beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of the 2011 Census and data collection in 2013, the State government has collected the data depicting the number of NFSA beneficiaries to be 5 crore. “This clearly establishes a shortage for 54 lakh beneficiaries,” the petition stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-poser-to-rajasthan-govt-on-additional-central-food-aid/article32808791.ece
09 October 2020||guwahati,||Nagaland govt. calls consultative meeting on peace process||The Nagaland government has convened a “consultative meeting” with all mass-based organisations, extremist groups and NGOs on October 15 to discuss the Naga peace process. The move follows a deadlock in the negotiations between the Centre and the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (IM), which prefers to be called National Socialist Council of Nagalim. “All tribal hohos (tribe-based apex traditional bodies), mass-based organisations, civil societies, church organisations, political parties, NGOs, prominent persons, etc., are being invited to discuss the most important issue that our society is presently faced with,” an official statement said. The NSCN (IM) had declared a ceasefire in 1997 followed by other extremist groups since 2001. But a solution has eluded the ‘Naga political issue’ despite several rounds of talks over more than two decades.  Common platform The Nagaland government headed by Neiphiu Rio is believed to have sensed the growing impatience to address the issue by involving all sections of the Naga society. The meeting is expected to provide a common platform to various organisations and outfits for expressing their views on multiple issues and reach a consensus. The Centre has been holding peace talks separately with the NSCN (IM) and the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), a conglomerate of seven other outfits. The Centre is believed to have reached an agreement on all outstanding issues with the NNPGs while the demands of a Naga flag and Naga constitution have clouded the talks with the NSCN (IM). The road to a “honourable solution” to the Naga political problem has been bumpy because it involves the aspirations of the Nagas from Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh besides Nagaland. Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh are particularly worried about losing territory if the Naga peace accord is signed. The fear stems from the NSCN (IM)’s vision for Greater Nagalim, an administrative set-up comprising all Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast as well as adjoining Myanmar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nagaland-govt-calls-consultative-meeting-on-peace-process/article32808790.ece

09 October 2020||Guwahati,||Freeze Assam ST list for good, says tribal body||An umbrella organisation of tribal bodies has advised the Assam government to freeze the list of Scheduled Tribe (Plains) “for good” and satisfy six communities demanding tribal status in a way that does not infringe up the rights of the existing tribes. The six communities are Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai-Ahom and ‘Tea Tribes’, a vague term used to mean more than 100 communities brought from eastern and central India as plantation workers almost two centuries ago. “That the list of ST relating to the plains of Assam should be frozen for good and notified separately. But the government should take initiative to resolve the problem of the six communities and provide protection and privileges to all ethnic groups in any other manner without affecting the rights and interests and quotas of the plains tribal people of Assam,” All Assam Tribal Sangha secretary general Aditya Khakhlari said after a meeting with the Group of Ministers on Thursday. Mr. Khakhlari represented the Coordination Committee of the Tribal Organisations of Assam (CCTOA) as its chief coordinator. 2 categories of STs Assam has two categories of Scheduled Tribes (ST) – Plains and Hills. Data tabled in the Assembly in February 2019 say there are 14 ST (Plains) and 15 ST (Hills).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/freeze-assam-st-list-for-good-says-tribal-body/article32808792.ece
09 October 2020||Srinagar,||Kashmir Bar association decides to defer its polls||The Kashmir High Court Bar Association (KHCBA), a body of over 1,200 lawyers, on Thursday decided to defer its polls because the administration failed to grant them the required permission. “We had approached the Srinagar administration for permission to conduct the polls for office-bearers on October 5. The date of polling was October 8. However, we did not receive any order from the administration, which tantamounts to denial of permission. Polls have been cancelled for time being”, Mudasir Gulzar Vakil, secretary of the election commission of the Bar association, told The Hindu . Official sources said the district administration had sought the opinion of the Chief Medical Officer, Srinagar, whether such polls were feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the letter forwarded to the Srinagar administration, the HCBA promised that “all standard operating procedures (SOPs) as advised would be meticulously followed”.  ‘We are clueless’ Mr. Vakil said, “We are clueless about the denial, as traders' bodies were allowed to conduct elections”. The candidates, who were contesting for different posts, had done poll campaigning and canvassing in the Valley courts. The association is a very influential civil society body of the Valley that had challenged the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in the Supreme Court in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kashmir-bar-association-decides-to-defer-its-polls/article32808794.ece
