After the inauguration, he said the tunnel would provide new strength to the country’s border infrastructure. The 9.02 km-long-tunnel, built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), is the world’s longest highway tunnel and connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley. It provides all-weather connectivity to the landlocked valley of Lahaul-Spiti, which remains cut-off for nearly six months in a year as the Rohtang Pass is snow-bound between November and April.  Thanks to the tunnel, the people of the Valley will have round-the-year road connectivity. The tunnel reduces the distance by 46 km between Manali and Leh and the travel time by about 4 to 5 hours. It is expected to boost tourism and winter sports in the region. The tunnel, also significant from the military logistics viewpoint, will provide better connectivity to the armed forces in reaching Ladakh.  ‘Case of neglect’ Mr. Modi accused the previous Congress-led governments of not paying heed to border development projects, thereby compromising the nation’s security interests. “Projects related to improved border connectivity either never came out of the planning stage or those which did, got delayed or stuck. The same happened with Atal Tunnel,” he said.  “It was after 2014 that the project picked up pace. Every problem faced by the BRO was resolved. The result was that while earlier 300-metre tunnel work was being accomplished every year, it reached 1,400 metre a year. In six years, we completed the work of 26 years,” Mr. Modi said...........||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/worlds-longest-highway-tunnel-opened-in-himachal-pradesh/article32763629.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Rahul, Priyanka meet family of Hathras victim||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that no power could silence the voice of the family of the Hathras gang-rape victim. Addressing presspersons after meeting the family at Boolagarhi village, Mr. Gandhi said, “We stand with the family members in their hour of grief and continue to fight against injustice.” Mr. Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, accompanied by senior party leaders K.C. Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and P.L. Punia, spent almost an hour with the bereaved family. Family sources said Ms. Vadra had embraced the victim’s mother and wiped her tears. The victim’s father told the Congress delegation that the District Magistrate had threatened them. He also voiced his fears about their security as the relatives of the men accused of the assault are threatening to hold a caste panchayat in the village. Clash with police Earlier, the Congress leaders were stopped at Noida’s DND flyover by the Uttar Pradesh police. Hundreds of Congress workers, including at least two dozen party MPs, were present on DND as Ms. Vadra drove to Hathras. Police officials told them that ban orders under Section 144 of the Cr.PC were in place and their visit would be a violation of the Epidemic Act. Additional Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) of Gautam Buddh Nagar, Love Kumar, said the large number of party workers had led to a traffic jam. “When the Congress leaders persisted with their demand, they were allowed to go to Hathras in a group of five,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that unlike October 1 there was no order to stop political leaders from proceeding to Hathras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rahul-priyanka-meet-family-of-hathras-victim/article32763631.ece
04 October 2020||Mangaluru,||SWR commissions state-of-the-art signalling system in ghat section||More trains, passenger as well as freight, can ply between Hassan and Mangaluru with South Western Railway’s Mysuru Division commissioning a state-of-the-art signalling system between Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations in the Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road ghat section on Friday. The new signalling system, a release from Mysuru Division here said, will enhance the train handling capacity by 35% on the section. Mysuru Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg in August said that 20 trains could be operated through the section instead of the existing 13 in 24 hours, once the signalling improvement project was completed. The new system will facilitate crossing of trains at Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations on the ghat stretch. No train could enter the 55-km ghat section when another train was passing through earlier. The new system, however, facilitated movement of trains from both the directions with the provision of crossing at the two stations thereby enhancing the section capacity. The release said the project with multi-section digital axle counter technology, was executed at a cost of Rs. 4.4 crore, funded by the Hassan-Mangalore Rail Development Company. It also considerably reduces maintenance of track circuits in the inhospitable terrain of the ghat section. Restrictions on crossing of trains at the ghat section imposed by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, following non-availability of catch-siding at two stations, was the primary bottleneck to operate more trains to achieve higher productivity. Starting in June, the work was executed amidst hostile conditions including COVID-19 pandemic, very heavy rains, fear of landslips while digging trenches to lay cables, lack of road connectivity to move equipment, using diesel generator sets for power, and many more. As expected, it got over by September-end and was commissioned on October 1. Mysuru Division’s senior divisional signal and telecommunication engineer D. Sreenivasulu led the team executing the project. Ms. Garg complimented the team for working steadfastly to complete the work in three months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/swr-commissions-state-of-the-art-signalling-system-in-ghat-section/article32764282.ece
04 October 2020||Belagavi,||Strikes affecting COVID-19 management||COVID-19 management across the State has been affected owing to multiple strikes by doctors in government hospitals. The key departments of Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education have been hit by four strikes in the last few months. This has affected the documentation of records, management of patients in district and taluk hospitals, testing and tracing of contacts, and treatment of non-COVID patients, say officials. AYUSH doctors on contract, under the National Health Mission, have been on strike for more than a week now. This has affected COVID-19 and non-COVID treatment in district and taluk hospitals and general healthcare in primary health centres, child care centres, and other rural hospitals. They are demanding equal pay for equal work, better working conditions, COVID-19 insurance cover, and compensation for coronawarriors who died on duty. “This is the second time we are going on strike. The first time the government promised to hike our salaries. After four months, we are yet to get orders,” said Harsha Patil, secretary of the association of AYUSH doctors in Health and Family Welfare Department. Another strike under way is that by Allopathy doctors on contract, who are seeking regularisation of their services. They are demanding that their work experience be considered while the Department of Health and Family Welfare takes up recruitment of permanent doctors.  “We have completed strikes in nine districts. We will complete them by THE year-end,” said Janardhan Biradar, vice-president of the Contract Doctors’ Association of Karnataka. This is affecting ward duty, overnight duty, and intensive care unit watch in designated COVID-19 hospitals, and OPD duty and other healthcare services, say doctors. Assurances by the State government have ended two strikes by permanent doctors in teaching hospitals and in district and taluk hospitals. A strike by doctors and paramedical staff of teaching hospitals had affected all government medical colleges that had been declared as COVID-19 hospitals and COVID Care Centres in September. They were demanding pay parity and pension benefits comparable with doctors of the Health and Family Welfare Department. This was ended after assurances from the Medical Education Minister. Last month, doctors in the Health Department went on strike demanding salaries recommended by the Central government health services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/strikes-affecting-covid-19-management/article32763761.ece
04 October 2020||GUNTUR,||State ranks second in country in human trafficking||Andhra Pradesh has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked second in human trafficking in India, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau data. Maharashtra leads the country in human trafficking. In the year 2019, the State reported 245 cases of human trafficking under the Indian Penal Code. This formed 10.8% of the total number of human trafficking cases reported. The number of cases reported in the State increased by a small margin in the last two years, with 218 cases reported in 2017 and 240 in 2018. With close to 100% of trafficked persons being women, (398 of the 399 victims trafficked were women), and all of the 425 victims rescued were women, it was evident that the majority of the victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation or prostitution. Of the total victims being trafficked for this purpose, Andhra Pradesh has the third highest number. Conviction rate Of the total number of cases reported, 99.4% cases were charge sheeted. There was a conviction rate of 21.8% with only 52 cases resulting in conviction of the 238 in which trial was completed. This, however, was the highest number of convictions by any State. The number of persons arrested and convicted in Andhra Pradesh was substantially larger compared to the other States The data revealed that 18 victims were below 18 years, out of 425 victims, 316 women were sexually exploited, one forced into labour, 31 women forced to work as domestic help, 14 forced into marriage, 63 for other reasons. The worrying part is there are 159 cases, which have been charge sheeted, and in just 52 cases, there were convictions. Trial was completed in 238 cases. But the initial action seemed to be positive with 825 persons arrested in 425 cases and charge sheets were filed against 512 persons, and 136 persons were convicted. Demand “This phenomenon vindicates our demand for setting up anti-human trafficking units in all districts and giving them powers on par with police stations. We need a special unit of police to deal with trafficking,” says Ongole based HELP organisation secretary N.V Rammohan. The findings come in backdrop of October 5 being observed as International Day of No Prostitution and aims at increasing awareness about prostitution and is observed to oppose prostitution.  Majority of the victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation or prostitution||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-ranks-second-in-country-in-human-trafficking/article32763619.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Despite thousands of objections, consortium rules out technical glitches in CLAT||Despite receiving thousands of objections from students regarding technical glitches in the Common Law Admission Test 2020 that was held last month, the Consortium of National Law Universities on Saturday said that not a single complaint was valid. Candidates, however, have questioned how the consortium reviewed thousands of complaints in a span of three days. Sources said that over 40,000 objections were raised. The consortium refused to confirm the number, though admitted that it ran into several thousands. In a release it said that the expert committee had “randomly” examined the audit log of the number of candidates who had raised objections to the response sheet, and did not find any discrepancy between the two. “The audit log showed that one candidate had changed the response as many six times and the system recorded the 6th and the final response. Thus the apprehension that earlier response was not changed has no basis,” the release said. Candidates whom The Hindu spoke to are not satisfied with the consortium’s response and state that the answers they had chosen and submitted while writing the online test were different from what had been finally marked. For instance, if a candidate had chosen option ‘c’ in the test, in the answer sheet, he or she has been graded for option ‘b’. A candidate who raised an objection said, “Candidates are sure of the options they have marked and the consortium has ruined the prospects of meritorious students to get into these prestigious universities.” Another candidate, while demanding a retest, claimed that a bug in the software caused errors in her answer sheet. Still others allege that there were a range of problems which included questions being asked from out of the syllabus. The expert committee stated that the service provider who helped in the conduct of the test has a track record of successfully conducting various national level tests. “The audit trail of each candidate is the most authentic evidence of every click and mouse movement, in case of a dispute, service provider shall make available to the court the audit trail of the concerned candidate,” said Faizan Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor of NALSAR University of Law (NALSAR), Hyderabad, and permanent member of the governing body of the Consortium said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/consortium-rules-out-technical-glitches-in-clat/article32763762.ece
04 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Six held on the charge of stealing cash from petrol stations||A few days after a member of the District Petroleum Dealers’ Association expressed the association’s apprehension over thefts at petrol stations in the district, the city police have arrested six persons allegedly involved in seven cases of theft, at petrol stations and at other places, in Dakshina Kannada. Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash gave the names of the arrested as Mohammed Suhail, 19, Asheek, 19, Mohammed Irfan, 20, Faizal, 20, Irfan, 19, and Hafeez, 21. The arrest has been made following a theft of cash from the Suvarna petrol station in Ujjodi near Pumpwell Junction early on September 20. Mr. Vikash told reporters here on Saturday that a probe revealed the alleged involvement of the accused in the theft of cash from petrol stations at Dasakodi in Bantwal and at Adyar in Mangaluru Rural Police Station limits on September 20. On September 3 the accused allegedly stole cash from a petrol station in Punjalkatte police station limits. The arrested are also accused of stealing cash from two ‘Anytime Payment’ machines of MESCOM in Kotekar and from the office of St. Sebastian Church Institutions in Ullal on September 23. “We are searching for two more persons allegedly involved,” he said. Earlier, Satish Kumar, an office-bearer of the Dakshina Kannada Petroleum Dealers’ Association, in an e-mail on September 23 to Mr. Vikash said they doubted the involvement of the gang in the thefts at petrol stations off the national highways in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that thefts at petrol stations increased after the restrictions were relaxed, more so in the last 15 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/six-held-on-the-charge-of-stealing-cash-from-petrol-stations/article32764283.ece
04 October 2020||Mysuru,||MCC launches property tax collection drive||The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Saturday launched a drive to make people compliant in property tax payment by going to their doorsteps, and augment its revenue. The drive entails the MCC staff pitching camps in different areas of a particular ward and collecting the property tax at people’s doorsteps rather than the payee going to the MCC zonal offices. This also comes during the COVID-19 pandemic which is discouraging public to go to government offices as they risk contracting the virus. The drive was launched by Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda who said property tax was a major source of revenue for the MCC. The authorities have extended the last date to pay the property tax for the current financial year 2020-21, to October 31 after which the owners will be liable to pay penalty for delayed remittance of the tax. Though the MCC has already introduced the online payment of property tax, it enjoins on the property owners to make a visit to the zonal offices of the corporation once to procure their new property ID number which has been introduced after a survey. From next year people need not visit the MCC office and can pay the tax online as they know the property ID number.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mcc-launches-property-tax-collection-drive/article32763923.ece
04 October 2020||MYSURU,||SWR introduces upgraded signalling system||To enhance safety and overcome the critical infrastructure deficiency that was hampering train operational efficiency, the Mysuru division of South Western Railway has introduced an upgraded signalling system in the ghat section. This also meets the stringent protocols stipulated by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) for passenger services and freight trains on the 55-km ghat section between Sakleshpur and Subramanya Road. The Railway authorities said the non-availability of catch sidings — a mandatory safety protocol — at two of the four stations in the section that has a steep gradient was the primary bottleneck. As a result, introduction of additional passenger services and freight trains on the ghat section between Sakleshpur and Subramanya Road for achieving higher productivity was rendered difficult in view of the restrictions imposed by the CRS. Hence, the Mysuru division undertook modification and upgradation of the signalling system during June 2020 by installing what the authorities called a highly reliable and state-of-the-art signal and telecommunication gears at Kadagaravalli and Yedakumari stations. Executed at a cost of Rs. 4.4 crore, which is borne by Hassan Mangalore Rail Development Company Ltd., the Multi-section Digital Axle Counter (MSDAC) technology was installed between Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations on the Sakleshpur-Subramanya Road Ghat Section and was commissioned on October 1, 2020 in record time and this is expected to significantly enhance the sectional line capacity. A release said it was a daunting task in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with unprecedented rainfall in the area – of 6,000 mm — since the commencement of work which compounded the already delicate situation. There was difficulty in moving skilled manpower for specialised work in the ghat section while road connectivity to transport cables, location boxes and other equipment was non-existent. Besides, there was the added danger of landslips occurring in the fragile hilly terrain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/swr-introduces-upgraded-signalling-system/article32763925.ece
04 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||No let-up in pandemic progression||The COVID-19 pandemic is on its natural progression in the State and climbing exponentially. When 54,563 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, the number of cases recorded on Saturday was 7,834, taking the State’s cumulative case burden to 2,21,333. The test positivity remains a constant at 14.3%. Highest recovery The State also registered the highest number of recoveries on the day at 4,476. The total recoveries till date have been 1,39,620. At present, 80,818 patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals. Of these, 568 patients are critically ill and in ICUs, with another 127 on ventilator support. The death toll has reached 813 in the State, with the addition of 22 more deaths which occurred between September 9 and October 1. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for eight of these deaths, Kannur six, Kozhikode five, Kasaragod, Thrissur and Idukki accounted for one case each. Almost 97% of the new cases reported on Saturday – 7,598 out of the 7,834 new cases – are locally acquired infections, which include infections reported in 95 health-care workers. In 648 cases, there is no known source of infection. Thiruvananthapuram has the highest number of active cases at 12,361. Two districts have close to 10,000 active cases, Ernakulam (9,952) and Kozhikode (9,124) The number of hotspots now is 724.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-let-up-in-pandemic-progression/article32763803.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Sushant case: medical board rules out murder||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical board has ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, terming it “a case of hanging and death by suicide”. AIIMS forensic chief Sudhir Gupta said on Saturday: “We have submitted our conclusive report to the CBI and there are no injuries indicating struggle or scuffle. The body has marks of hanging. The presence of any sedative material was not detected by AIIMS toxicology lab. The complete examination of the ligature mark over the neck was consistent with hanging.” A team of forensic doctors have dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling”. Dr. Gupta refused to divulge any further details, stating that the case is sub judice.  Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The Central Bureau of investigation, however, maintained on Saturday that it is looking into all aspects of the death of the actor and that “investigation is still under way”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sushant-case-medical-board-rules-out-murder/article32763664.ece
04 October 2020||KASAULI,||Kasauli awaits tourists with fingers crossed||It’s half past noon on October 2, and a family of four has just walked into a small cafe on Mall Road in the heart of the tiny hill town of Kasauli. Navneet Sahu, who runs the little eatery, is elated to see customers again, even as he is concerned that his joy would be short-lived and limited to the ‘extended weekend’ that has brought a sizeable rush of tourists to the Queen of the Hills. “Tourists have started to visit after travel restrictions were eased recently. But it’s nothing compared to the numbers before the COVID-19 outbreak. Since March-end, the business has come to a standstill,” said Mr. Sahu, who was busy preparing the food orders of his customers, with just one helper. The hospitality industry in Himachal Pradesh has been severely affected due to the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. The State government allowed unrestricted entry into the State from mid-September, which has come as a big relief. The hoteliers, however, said that right now they are focusing on merely breaking even. Other sections of the industry, including taxi drivers, tourist guides, dhabas and small restaurants, are pinning their hopes on a revival of the hotels. “It will take some time to get things back to normal. So far there have only been ‘walk-in’ tourists. At this time of the year, we usually had good number of tourists from West Bengal during the Dasara-Durga Puja holidays. But this year, there have been no advance bookings,” said U. Sharma of Ros Common, a Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel. Rocky Chimni, vice-president of the Kasauli Hotels and Resident Welfare Association, said the State government had allowed hotels to open from mid-September, and since then most of the hotels had reopened in the town and surrounding area. “Tourists have started visiting over weekends and weekdays as well, and more are coming from Delhi and Punjab. The corporate business has taken a hit as conferences etc., are not taking place. We are hoping that we will be close to break-even point as the number of tourists increase. In comparison to the same period last year the hotels in Kasauli are having 40% less occupancy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kasauli-awaits-tourists-with-fingers-crossed/article32763633.ece
04 October 2020||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,||20 schoolchildren test positive in Vizianagaram||Twenty students of the Gantyada Zilla Parishad High School tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. Medical teams conducted tests for the children who have been attending school for the past 12 days following the instructions of the Vizianagaram District Medical and Health Officer, S.V. Ramanakumari. “Fortunately, all the infected children looked healthy without any complaints and symptoms of COVID-19. However, we have shifted them to the Vizianagaram Government General Hospital for treatment. COVID-19 tests are being conducted for the family members and the primary and secondary contacts of the children,” said Ms. Ramanakumari. “We requested the Education Department not to open the schools in containment zones. The issue has been brought to the notice of Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal and other officials concerned for necessary action,” she added.  Meanwhile, new infections have come down significantly in the district. From around 500 a day earlier, the cases dropped to 225 on Saturday. The death toll reached 188 but no fatalities have been reported in the last three days. The total positive cases in the district are 35,997, recoveries 33,103 and active cases 2,706. Confidence booster On the other hand, the total cases in Srikakulam district are 40,612 and active cases are 3,539. Srikakulam Government General Hospital’s COVID-19 wing in charge R. Aravind said that they were witnessing increased confidence levels among the patients now. “The speedy recovery of some patients has boosted the confidence of other in-patients, which is the real weapon to fight coronavirus. Continuous supply of oxygen from a centralised system and special care for critical cases helped us prevent deaths in the hospital. The drop in new cases is a big relief for everyone,” said Dr. Aravind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/20-schoolchildren-test-positive-in-vizianagaram/article32763620.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Traffic police collect over Rs. 2.35 cr. in fine in one week||The traffic police on Friday caught a doctor driving his Jaguar rashly on Hoodi main road. On further inspection, they saw that the car was registered in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, and that its licence plate was defective. “The driver, a doctor from a reputed hospital, told us that he had purchased the car from Guntur. He was penalised for driving in the wrong direction on a one-way road, using a defective number plate, and also for tinting the car’s windows black,” said a police officer. This was one among 55,717 violations booked by the city traffic police in the week between September 20 and September 26. With so many violations, the police collected a little over Rs. 2.35 crore in fines during this period. According to senior police officials, on an average, they usually collect anywhere between Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 1.5 crore. “However, we have increased our vigilance as restrictions have eased and more people are taking their vehicles out on the roads instead of using public transport,” the senior traffic official said. Fine collection has been consistently high in September. The police booked 43,141 cases of traffic violations between September 13 and 19, and collected Rs. 2.14 crore. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said that physical checks of vehicles have for the most part been stopped because of the risk it poses to traffic personnel. “During the lockdown, there was less vehicle movement and so the traffic police have relaxed the checks across the city, while focussing on other pandemic-related duties. However, we have seen an increase in vehicles on the roads this month, and as a result violations are also on the rise,” he said. Riding without a helmet remains the most violated rule. As per data from the traffic department, 29,590 of the 43,141 cases booked between September 13 and 19 was for helmetless riding. The following week (September 20-26), around 29,925 cases were booked for the same offence. “This is also because Bengaluru has one of the highest number of two wheelers when compared to other cities,” said a traffic official. The police have also recorded a rise in signal jumping and riding in the wrong direction on a one-way road. “This means that it is mandatory for us to be deployed at main junctions as motorists lack traffic sense and road discipline,” said another officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/traffic-police-collect-over-rs-235-cr-in-fine-in-one-week/article32764163.ece

04 October 2020||Patna,||Bihar grand alliance seals seat-sharing||The mahagathbandhan ,  or grand alliance, led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Saturday sealed a seat-sharing deal among its constituents for the Assembly election in Bihar to be held from October 28 to November 7. The alliance leaders appealed to the people to give them a chance to govern the State as “Bihar needs a change.” But at the end of the press conference, a “hurt” Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni stunned them by announcing a parting of ways with the alliance, saying that he had been “back-stabbed”. “By the agreement among our alliance partners, the RJD will get 144 seats; the Congress 70; the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) 19; the CPI (Communist Party of India) six; and CPI(M) four. The RJD will accommodate the other two partners — the Vikasheel Insaan Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha — from its quota of 144 seats,” RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said at the press conference at a luxury hotel in Patna. At the end of the press meet, Mr. Sahni alleged, “I was offered 25 seats along with the post of Deputy Chief Minister, but we are being back-stabbed. It is a cheating of the people of the Extremely Backward Class.” He then left in a hurry. VIP supporters raised slogans against Mr. Tejashwi and his older brother Tej Pratap Yadav outside the venue, and tried to gherao the RJD leaders. Slamming the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the State, Mr. Tejashwi said, “Every four hours, one incident of rape takes place, and every five hours, one murder happens in the State today.” “This government must go,” he said, and appealed to the people to give “one chance to mahagathbandhan for maan-sammaan (dignity and respect), security and development of the State.” “I am a true Bihari, and my DNA is also pure,” said Mr. Tejashwi Yadav, taking a jibe at the Chief Minister, against whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, earlier, raised questions over his “DNA” and create a political storm. “If we form the government, I will provide 10 lakh jobs to the unemployed youth of the State with my first signature at the very first Cabinet meeting of the government,” Mr. Tejashwi said. BSP leader quits Earlier, Bahujan Samaj Party State president Bharat Bind quit the party to join the RJD. Mr. Tejashwi gave him the party membership. Later, leaders of the Congress and the Left parties said they were satisfied with the allocation of seats. Avinash Pandey, chairman of the Congress’s screening committee for candidates, declared that Mr. Tejashwi Yadav would lead the alliance in the election. Confusion in NDA Confusion still reigns in the ruling NDA as senior Janata Dal(U) leaders were seen rushing to meet Bhupendra Yadav, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s State in-charge, here on Saturday. Leaders of the two parties were huddled in separate meetings to reach a consensus over the allocation of seats. Senior JD(U) leaders Rajeev Ranjan Singh, aka Lalan Singh, R.C.P. Singh and Vijay Choudhury met Mr. Bhupendra Yadav. The latter and the BJP’s election in-charge, Devendra Fadnavis, went to Delhi on Friday and returned to Patna on Saturday to conclude the seat-sharing deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-grand-alliance-seals-seat-sharing/article32763565.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Case fatality rate still low, says Ministry||Despite its escalating number of COVID-19 cases, India continues to maintain one of the lowest case fatality rates (CFR), the Union Health Ministry said in a release on Saturday. While the global CFR stood at 2.97% as on date, India’s figure was 1.56%. “The deaths per million population in India is among the lowest in the world.

04 October 2020||New Delhi,||Congress seizes the initiative on Hathras||The visit of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to the family of the Hathras rape victim on Saturday seeks to make multiple political points in times of the pandemic. Both leaders had set the stage for the event early in the morning with a series of tweets. While Ms. Vadra alleged insensitivity of the Yogi Adityanath government by asking the victim’s family to take a narco or lie detector test, Mr. Gandhi had tweeted that “no power could stop him from visiting the family”. Despite having been stopped at the Delhi-Noida (UP) border for a second time in 48 hours, the Congress leaders managed to reach the village and meet the family. The party’s message is clearly aimed at projecting Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra as determined leaders who are ready to take to the streets even in challenging times. Caught napping The contrast is sharp with the major Opposition parties in the State — the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) — yet to get off the ground even as the brutal incident sparked off national outrage. The visit seems to have immediate as well as long-term political goals. From projecting the Congress as a serious player in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls to portraying the ruling BJP as anti-Dalit just before the Bihar election, the party seems to have a clear strategy. “The BJP’s 2014 election manifesto promised: We will accord the highest priority to ensuring their (SCs and STs) security, especially the prevention of atrocities against SCs and STs. Is that why the posts of Chairperson of the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and National Commission of Scheduled Tribes have remained vacant for several months?” asked former Finance Minister P Chidamabaram in a tweet, keeping up the pressure. Moral high ground “The U.P. government is morally corrupt. The victim didn’t get treatment, police didn’t write her complaint, her body was burnt forcibly and the family is in captivity and is being pressured. Now, they are being threatened that a narco test will be done on them. This kind of behaviour is not acceptable to the country. Stop threatening the family of the victim,” Ms. Vadra tweeted in the morning. In U.P., where the Congress has been out of power for over three decades and does not have much of an organisation, the party is trying hard to occupy the political centrestage by consistently taking on the Yogi Adityanath government. In May, Ms Vadra had clashed with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over sending 1,000 buses to transport migrant workers who were walking home during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-seizes-the-initiative-on-hathras/article32763560.ece
04 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Amid spike in cases, Kerala enforces tighter restrictions||Tighter restrictions came into force from Saturday in the State as part of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. District Collectors have issued prohibitory orders by invoking Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) banning certain activities, including gathering of more than five people in public spaces. In 13 districts, except Kasaragod, the orders will be in place till the midnight of October 31. In Kasaragod, it will be in place till the midnight of October 9, as per the order issued by the Collector. The State government had on October 1 directed the Collectors to impose the restrictions, given the alarming spike in COVID-19 cases across the State. As per the orders, a maximum of 50 persons are allowed to attend marriages and 20 persons at funerals. Government functions and religious, political, social and cultural activities should restrict attendance to a maximum of 20 persons. Public transport, government and commercial institutions, industries, and hospitals can operate by adhering to social distancing and break-the-chain protocols. 11 arrested Eleven persons were arrested and 25 cases registered on Saturday for violation of the prohibitory orders, the police said. Meanwhile, it appeared that the orders also gave rise to some confusion as to what is allowed and what is not. Many people took to the Facebook pages of Collectors to air their doubts regarding a multitude of issues such as whether dining is still allowed in restaurants, whether shops are allowed to function or not, and whether cinema halls would open on October 15 as permitted by the Centre. Quite a few people wanted to know whether gymnasiums are allowed to open. The District Collector, Malappuram, for instance, had on Friday itself specified restrictions on sports activities/facilities, including gyms and swimming pools, but many Collectors had not. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Saturday that COVID-19 prevention measures would be enforced more stringently in the State. The government decided to impose a heftier fine for failure to wear masks and close down shops that disobey norms. In shops, especially, it was important to maintain social distancing, wear gloves and masks, and use sanitiser, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-spike-in-cases-kerala-enforces-tighter-restrictions/article32763545.ece
04 October 2020||Srinagar,||Bodies of 3 Rajouri youth exhumed, given to families||The bodies of three civilians from Rajouri, who were passed off as unidentified militants after an encounter in Shopian’s Amshipora on July 18, were exhumed and handed over to their families in Baramulla on Saturday morning “The bodies were exhumed at 8 a.m. in the presence of a magistrate and the families. The bodies have been handed over to the legal heirs,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar told The Hindu . The exhumation took place at Baramulla’s Gantamulla, 70 days after the youth’s burial, held 235 km away from Rajouri. The police investigation is yet to establish any link of the slain youth with militants. According to the families, the youth were working as labourers in Kashmir and were on their way to Rajouri when they went missing on July 18. The youth from Pir Panjal valley’s Rajouri were identified as Abrar Ahmed, 25; Imtiyaz Ahmed, 20, and Mohammed Ibrar, 16. On September 25, the DNA samples of the slain youth matched the family members. The police have arrested two locals, including a Special Police Officer from Poonch, so far. They are accused of “tipping off about the presence of militants in the area.” The Army has already initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima facie answerable. The police, in a statement on July 18, had claimed that they recovered “incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, at the site of the encounter”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bodies-of-3-rajouri-youth-exhumed-given-to-families/article32763567.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||U.S. Navy’s maritime patrol aircraft refuels at Port Blair||A U.S. Navy P-8A long range Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) landed at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the last week of September for refuelling under the bilateral logistics support agreement, two defence sources confirmed. This is the first time a U.S. P-8 has got access to the islands for operational turnaround. On Saturday, the second edition of the bilateral naval exercise between India and Bangladesh “Exercise Bongosagar” began in the northern Bay of Bengal which will be followed by a Coordinated Patrol (CORPAT) for the next two days, the Navy said. “The P-8A was in Port Blair on September 25 for refuelling under the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA). The aircraft came from Japan and was at Port Blair for few hours,” one of the sources said. More exercises Another Passage Exercise (PASSEX) between Indian Navy ships and a U.S. aircraft carrier transiting the region as in July is expected to take place later this month, the source added. While P-8s of India and the U.S. had exercised together in the past, practised locating submarines together and the LEMOA has been operational for few years now, this is the first time the U.S. got access to A&N under LEMOA. Several countries have expressed interest in getting access to the strategically located A&N islands which are close to the Strait of Malacca and global sea lanes of communication. In July, frontline warships of the Indian Navy conducted a PASSEX with the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz carrier strike group near the Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) islands as it was transiting the Indian Ocean. The USS Nimitz was returning from the South China Sea through the Malacca Strait where it undertook freedom of navigation operations. There has been a sharp increase in India’s maritime interactions with the Quad countries on a bilateral basis centred around information sharing for improved Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific. India has logistics agreements with all three Quad countries — Australia, Japan and the U.S. India has also signed maritime information sharing agreements with Australia and Japan and a similar agreement is in the works with the U.S.  With Bangladesh Ex Bongosagar, whose first edition was held in 2019, is aimed at developing inter-operability and joint operational skills through conduct of a wide spectrum of maritime exercises and operations, the Navy said in a statement. “In this edition of Ex Bongosagar, ships from both navies will participate in surface warfare drills, seamanship evolutions and helicopter operations,” the Navy said. The exercise will be followed by the 3rd edition CORPAT in Northern Bay of Bengal from October 4-5, wherein Indian and Bangladeshi units will undertake joint patrolling along the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). India has deployed anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and guided missile corvette INS Khukri for the exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-navys-maritime-patrol-aircraft-refuels-at-port-blair/article32763570.ece
04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||SCR new division put on the back burner||On every Gandhi Jayanti, the South Central Railway (SCR) also celebrates its anniversary. Celebrations are low key generally and the raging pandemic ensured it remained so this year too. Yet, the 54th anniversary is special since the zone has remained intact and is likely to remain so for sometime to come. If things went according to the political landscape prevailing a couple of years ago, the SCR would have been cut down to size with three of the six zones - Vijayawada, Guntur and Guntakal to be joined to the proposed South Coast Railway (SoCR) with Visakhapatnam as the headquarters. Ambiguous stance “If it happens, the SCR will have its hands and legs cut off leaving just the torso as it would have just Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Nanded divisions,” commented a senior official. However, as things stand now, the formation of the new division has been put on the back burner although the Railways Ministry continuous to maintain an ambiguous stance. For instance, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said that the proposal was still under consideration to a question raised in Parliament, and to another question, he said there was a plan to reduce the number of divisions from the existing 17! Doubts arise as the Indian Railways has already unleashed a frenetic set of reforms, including a major restructuring in the functioning, with the Railway Board itself cut to size to four from eight and a new management cadre about to be unveiled. OSDs posted out Secondly, two very senior officials appointed as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to oversee the transition phase of the formation of the new zone, and cutting the SCR to size have been posted out in the last couple of years. Vijayawada divisional railway manager is holding it as an additional charge these days giving sufficient hints about priority of the issue. The Indian Railways is already battling crises brought about by COVID-19 with limited number of passenger trains and huge dip in revenues this year although there is a concerted effort to give a push to the freight trains taking advantage of the relatively free lines, point out senior officials. SCR formation had its own twist and turns after it came into being in 1966 on October 2 when Hubli and Vijayawada divisions of the Southern Railway, and Sholapur and Secunderabad divisions of Central Railway were carved out and merged into a new zone. Later, Guntakal division of the Southern Railway was also merged with SCR in 1977 and Sholapur division was remerged with the Central Railway. Secunderabad division was further split into Secunderabad and Hyderabad divisions in 1978. Again in 2003, two new divisions like Guntur and Nanded were operationalised transferring Hubli division to newly formed South Western Railway. Forming the key link between North and South India, the zone used to have more than 700 passenger trains travelling up and down with another 100-150 freight trains, senior officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scr-new-division-put-on-the-back-burner/article32764382.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||2 decades on, smoke-free law still weak||After over two decades of the implementation of smoke-free rules on October 2, 2008 that banned smoking in all public places in the country, questions remain over its effectiveness. Experts claim that India it has been effective in certain areas but there are still many aspects that need to be amended and strengthened. Section (4) of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce Production, Supply and Distribution) Act COTPA 2003 prohibits smoking in all public places. ‘Public Place’ is defined as any place to which the public has access, whether as of right or not, and includes all places visited by general public. Boards containing the warning, “No Smoking Area - Smoking Here is an Offence”, has to be displayed prominently at their entrance. Chairman of the Max Institute of Cancer Care Harit Chaturvedi said, “What continues to remain matter of concern is the fact that COTPA 2003, presently allows smoking in certain public places [restaurants, hotels and airports], in the form of designated smoking areas. We should look at abolishing all designated smoking areas in hotels and restaurants and even airports to ensure a 100% smoke free environment since most of these designated smoking areas are rarely compliant as per COTPA requirements.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-decades-on-smoke-free-law-still-weak/article32763576.ece
04 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. doctors go on strike in Kerala||Protest has been mounting among the medical fraternity in the State over the suspension of a senior faculty member, who is also the COVID-19 Nodal Officer at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, over the alleged negligence committed in the care of an elderly patient. The medical faculty at the MCH had gone on a flash strike on Friday soon after the government issued the order suspending R. Aruna and two head nurses. Talks between the doctors and the Health Minister failed on Saturday, following which the entire medical faculty in all government medical colleges went on strike, boycotting OP and ward duties from 8 a.m. till 10 a.m. Doctors in the Thiruvananthapuram MCH are now on a 48-hour relay hunger strike, which is expected to end on Monday. ‘Govt. ignores realities’ “The government has chosen to ignore the ground realities of acute human resource shortage at the MCH, which has resulted in the poor care given to the patient. Rather than resolving the situation, the government has chosen the easy way of making a scapegoat of one of our most hard working and respected senior colleagues. This cannot be accepted. Unless Dr. Aruna’s suspension is withdrawn, we will stay away from all non-COVID duties from Monday,” R. Dileep, secretary, Thiruvananthapuram unit of the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA), said. Following a directive issued by the KGMCTA, COVID Nodal Officers in Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kozhikode and SAT Hospital here also submitted their resignation letters. They have said that they be relieved from the COVID additional duty that had been thrust on them, in protest against the manner in which Dr. Aruna had been suspended, even when a detailed inquiry by the Director of Medical Education was still pending. “The incident involving the patient was very unfortunate. Unless the government take steps to understand the administrative and systemic issues at the MCH and resolve it, more such incidents will occur,” Dr. Dileep said. Meanwhile, nurses’ unions are also on protest and they observed Saturday as “black day.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-doctors-go-on-strike-in-kerala/article32763539.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, S. Africa move WTO on COVID-19 prevention, care||India and South Africa, in a formal submission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on October 2, sought a waiver on certain provisions of the international agreements that regulate intellectual property rights to speed up efforts to prevent, treat and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In the communication, the countries said there were several reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products to COVID-19 patients and that a particular concern for countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity were the requirements of cumbersome and lengthy process of the import and export of pharmaceutical products. Many countries, especially the developing ones, may face institutional and legal difficulties when using flexibilities available in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). Beyond patents, other intellectual property rights may also pose a barrier, with limited options to overcome those barriers, noted the submission. Experts said that given this present context of global emergency, it was important for WTO members to work together to ensure that intellectual property rights such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information did not create barriers to timely access to affordable medical products, including vaccines and medicines, or to scaling up research, development, manufacturing and supply of medical products essential to combat COVID-19. “The waiver of TRIPS Obligation is a major initiative to ensure availability and affordability of medical products required for COVID19 fights. The medical products companies especially medicine and vaccine manufacturers want to profit from pandemic by keeping the monopoly rights through intellectual protection. This proposal shows the political will of India and South Africa to exercise a legitimate right under the Agreement Establishing WTO to ensure supply of medical products to fight COVID-19 at an affordable price”, said K.M. Gopakumar, legal advisor, Third World Network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-s-africa-move-wto-on-covid-19-prevention-care/article32763575.ece
04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Governor urged to order CBI probe into Nayeem’s cases||Forum for Good Governance (FGG) on Saturday appealed to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to order for a CBI investigation into the cases involving slain Naxalite-turned-gangster Nayeemuddin and his associates. In a memorandum to the governor, the FGG said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the government in 2016 to investigate the cases involving Nayeem is incapable of executing the task. FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy, later speaking to the media, said that names of 25 police officers, some of them of the rank of Additional Superintendents of Police, cropped up in the initial stages of probe. However, the SIT replied to an inquiry under RTI Act that no policeman was cited as accused in any of the 173 criminal cases involving Nayeem’s gang. That amounted to giving clean chit to all the 25 police officers, and no action was being taken against them, he said. FGG said that about 240 cases were registered after Nayeem was killed in an exchange of fire in 2016 based on his gang’s involvement in different crimes. Though it was said that chargesheets were filed in 173 cases so far, not a single case was taken to its logical end, he said. It was said that Nayeem used to write diaries in which he would meticulously incorporate details of all his contacts, whom he had helped and the favours he got from them. During the raid on his house following his death, police seized two of his diaries, he said. “...But the diaries were not used in inquiry and in a way some IPS officers and politicians were left off the hook,” the FGG said. The FGG said Nayeem’s was a deadly combination of police, politicians and gangster coming together and committing atrocities against innocent people. Unless the probe was completed fairly and quickly, general public would lose faith in democracy, it said. The FGG also expressed doubts over the figures of money seized by the police from Nayeem’s house. SIT had claimed to have used two counting machines to count money in his house but confirmed that only Rs. 3.74 lakh were recovered. “That sum can be counted in 15 minutes. Then what was the need for counting machines? We have a reason to believe that hundreds of crores were recovered and not accounted for,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/governor-urged-to-order-cbi-probe-into-nayeems-cases/article32763768.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Wary of public transport, commuters go after bicycles||The humble cycle has become increasingly popular among people who are hesitant to travel in public transport. Not only are retailers reporting a surge in bicycle sales, but repair shops are also seeing an increasing number of people bringing in their old two-wheelers for an overhaul. According to retailers, there has been a steady rise in bicycle sales in the city from May this year. Krishnasamy Devraj, director, Cycle World, which has 17 showrooms across the city, said that there was at least a 20-25% rise in sales in almost all the showrooms. “Compared to June 2019, we had a 300% increase in sales this June. As of now, the demand is outstripping supply. It will continue to be high for at least another six months. Adult and premier bicycles are seeing a huge demand and there are more takers for electric bikes too. Many are using these two-wheelers to commute to work,” he said. As a result of the demand, the supply has also been hit. Roshan Kini, founder of Bums on the Saddle, reported a dip in supply of components as well. On the trend of people turning to cycles, he said, “This is happening across the world and the trend will definitely continue. I have been promoting cycling for 14 years now, and have never seen such demand and response,” he said. Mr. Kini also said that people have started cycling for fun as well as for fitness. “I think there has been a shift in the mindset of people after the pandemic. People are more focussed on health and fitness,” he added. Initiatives by the authorities here in setting up cycle lanes have also given a boost to this trend. Repair shops busy It’s not just the well-heeled who have turned to cycles. Many cycle repair shops that The Hindu spoke to said their “days are packed” as people from all walks of life are coming to them. Venkatesh. K.B., who owns a bike repair shop in K. R Puram, said that there has been a surge in demand for spare parts and cycle pumps, apart from repair requests. “I have been in the business for over three decades and I have never seen such enthusiasm for cycles,” he said. And while buses and metro trains are not running at peak capacity, the same cannot be said for rental bike companies. Amit Gupta, CEO, Yulu, said that the average distance and time travelled on their two-wheelers has increased. “Soon after lockdown restrictions were eased, we deployed over 70% of our electric vehicles on the road, the response was good,” he said, adding that people have started using Yulu even for grocery shopping. There has been a steady increase in enquiries about bicycle tours and rallies. Bengaluru’s Bicycle Mayor Sathya Shankaran said that cycling clubs in the city are flooded with such enquiries.“Many apartment complexes are now starting their own bicycling groups,” he said.     Compared to June 2019, we had a 300% increase in sales this June. As of now, the demand is outstripping supply. It will continue to be high for at least another six months.Krishnasamy DevrajDirector, Cycle World   I have been in the business for over three decades and have never seen such enthusiasm for cycles.Venkatesh K.B.Owner of a bike repair shop in K.R.

04 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Extinct tree found after 180 years in Kollam grove||A tree species, long believed extinct, has been rediscovered after a gap of more than 180 years from a sacred grove in Kollam district. Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) at Palode, near here, have identified the tree as Madhuca diplostemon (family Sapotaceae), a threatened species of the Western Ghats whose specimen was first collected in 1835. Only one mature tree has been found so far, which makes this remarkable rediscovery extremely valuable from a scientific, environmental and conservation point of view. A paper on the finding authored by Shailajakumari S., Santhosh Kumar E.S., Sreekala A.K., and R. Prakashkumar of the JNTBGRI and Parthipan B. of S.T. Hindu College, Nagercoil, has been published in Rheedea , the journal of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy. The lone mature tree was located at the Koonayil Ayiravilli Siva temple at Paravur, Kollam. Locally, it was erroneously believed to be the common attilippa . Shailajakumari, one of the authors of the paper, had collected a specimen and brought it to the JNTBGRI two years ago as part of her Ph.D. dissertation. Other surveys However, surveys in other sacred groves in Kollam district failed to find another tree of the species. Since the species is represented only by one specimen in a single locality, it is eligible to be categorised ‘Critically Endangered’ by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature ) , the JNTBGRI has noted.  Madhuca diplostemon has an interesting history. In 1835, Robert Wight, a surgeon-botanist with the East India Company, collected three specimens. In 1848, he described it as Diospyros obovata in his famous work Icones Plantarum Indiae Orientalis . Later, C.B. Clarke corrected it as Isonandra diplostemon ,  and in 1960, P. Royen described it as Madhuca diplostemon . Interestingly, “since its original collection, specimens of Madhuca diplostemon were never collected again, neither from its locality nor elsewhere, and botanical explorations in the Eastern and Western Ghats failed to locate the species,” notes the paper on the rediscovery. The JNTBGRI is planning to undertake the ex situ conservation of this species through the institute’s species recovery programme, JNTBGRI director R. Prakashkumar explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/extinct-tree-found-after-180-years-in-kollam-grove/article32763543.ece
04 October 2020||NALGONDA,||Phishing gang played on sympathy for police officials||Most south Indians either fear or respect police officers — based on this premise four persons from Rajasthan, including a juvenile, made Rs. 4.5 lakh in about 75 days. They targeted 350 police officers from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and a few from Patna, Prayagraj and Himachal Pradesh and created Facebook accounts in the names of these police officers. “The accounts are a look-alike with personal and office photos, and updated bio-data. They would send new friend requests, and start conversations asking for money. Some officers did send the money as requested, over Google pay or Phone pay numbers,” Nalgonda SP A.V. Ranganath, who was a near-victim of such transaction, said, producing the accused before media on Saturday. On September 18, Mr. Ranganath’s friend alerted him, asking if he needed a mobile transfer of Rs. 20,000 to his wife’s number, as requested on Facebook. The number, data and the request appeared to have originated in Odisha, but was later proved false. An investigation team that went to Rajasthan, following the cyber-trail, suspected a few persons in Kaithwara police station limits. “Everyone was a suspect, but with the most-used SIM card in a phone, in relation with other suspicious numbers and tower locations, a few phones were narrowed down and suspects taken into custody. Breakthrough The breakthrough came when one of their phone galleries showed images of SP Ranganath and other police officers apart from screenshots of Facebook chats,” investigating officer S.M. Basha said. According to Mr. Basha, the youth took to Facebook, after their earlier tricks on e-commerce portals like OLX did not fetch results and the customers had turned cautious. “They are not victims of police abuse or do not have any such thing against the police officials. They said that they had picked up the group of police officers as there is sympathy among the public towards police because they serve people and further, the police officials also command fear, they believed that these reasons would work in their favour. And transaction amounts too were not high,” another officer A. Rajasekhar Reddy said. Police said the members of the gang had purchased pre-activated and account-linked SIM cards, bank accounts with passbook and ATM card, from rural areas at Rs. 3000 per set. The investigation team was able to seize Rs. 1 lakh cash, 30 SIM cards, phones and laptop, and fake documents. And further information is being extracted at a forensic science laboratory. Accused Mustaqeen, Sayeed and Saddam were booked for forgery, cheating, impersonation and under sections of the Information Technology Act. The minor would be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/phishing-gang-played-on-sympathy-for-police-officials/article32763548.ece
04 October 2020||New Delhi,||Army erects a memorial to the ‘Gallants of Galwan’||The Army has built a memorial in eastern Ladakh to the 20 personnel killed in the clash at Galwan Valley on June 15, a defence source said on Saturday. The memorial, which has the names of all 20 “Gallants of Galwan” inscribed on it, is located at Post 120 in eastern Ladakh and was inaugurated earlier this week. It details the actions of 16 Bihar and attached troops led by Col. B Santhosh Babu to evict the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Observation Post (OP) from the Y nala (junction) area under Operation Snow Leopard. They successfully evicted the post from and reached Patrolling Point 14 where a “fierce skirmish” broke out between the Indian Army and PLA troops, the inscription reads.  Hand-to-hand combat “Col. B Santhosh Babu led from the front and his troops fought gallantly in a hand to hand combat, causing heavy casualties to the PLA,” it says. Post 120 lies along the Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) road. China has so far not revealed the casualty numbers on its side. A senior government official said China, through diplomatic channels, had acknowledged five of its soldiers were killed, including a Commanding Officer. The stand-off along the boundary in Ladakh has been going on since early May. Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to reach an agreement on disengagement and de-escalation.

04 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Farm laws to benefit Kerala: Muraleedharan||Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan has said the agriculture market reforms laws passed by Parliament have at a stroke eliminated farmer exploitation in the country and will benefit Kerala, among other States. Defending the Bills here on Saturday, Mr. Muraleedharan cited the experience of mango growers at Muthalamada in Palakkad district. They had no easy access to the Azadpur Mandi mega bazaar in New Delhi. The notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) wholesale market offered the best price for mangoes in the country. Farmers in Kerala and elsewhere were constrained to ferry their produce to the bazaar over long distances to get a reasonable price for their harvest. A network of agents and transporters exploited their vulnerability. Moreover, a substantial amount of the produce spoiled en route given the delay in transportation and sale. Finally, farmers received only 15 to 18% of the actual price of the crop. The rest went to agents who operated in at least eight tiers. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and allied laws allowed farmers to sell their harvest outside the notified APMC market without paying any State taxes or fee. They empowered the farmer to sell their produce to the highest bidder at any market or place of their choice. In the event, the market price of the crop plummeted, the Central government would step in with a minimum support price offer for the crop to prop up farmers through the lean season. Cashew farmers Comparably, cashew farmers in Kerala often smuggled their crop to markets in Karnataka to get the best available price. They usually got charged for dodging local levies and their produce impounded by local authorities. They were also at the mercy of ruthless agents. The new laws would eradicate the need for such surreptitious transactions. They allowed contract farming and direct marketing. The laws have thrown opened the door for private investment in the moribund farming sector and catalysed the modernisation of food production, storage, movement and sale. The rules offered farmers a wider choice and freed them from decades of servitude and bondage. The Congress and the CPI(M) had opposed the law for political reasons. They did not even seek a vote or participate in the discussions in Parliament. The protests against the reforms have petered out. Farmers had realised that the Opposition had misled them, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-laws-to-benefit-kerala-muraleedharan/article32763893.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Derecognition of school harsh: Karnataka HC||The Karnataka High Court has held that harsh punishment like withdrawal of recognition to a school cannot be imposed citing a road accident that occurred during an educational excursion conducted without permission from the authorities and not using State-owned public transport. “Section 39 of the Karnataka Education Act, which empowers the government to withdraw recognition, by any stretch of imagination cannot be interpreted or stretched to such an extent that it would encompass such untoward incidents occurred outside the school premises,” the court said while making it clear that recognition could be withdrawn for specific deficiencies in maintaining standard of education, infrastructure, etc. as per the Act. Justice R. Devdas passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravati, which had questioned the May 13, 2019 order of withdrawal of recognition passed by the Deputy Director (Administration), Department of Public Instruction, Shivamogga. A tenth class student died and 22 others were injured when one of the two private bus in which students and teachers were travelling overturned in N.R. Pura police station limits in Chikkamagalur district in November 2018. The educational authorities had said that the tour was conducted without prior permission and private buses were used contrary to the January 27, 2011 circular, which advised the use of State-owned public buses for school tours and avoiding private buses. ‘Deliberate attempt’ “An unfortunate road accident has been held against the petitioner-institution and a deliberate attempt is being made to punish the school authorities by withdrawing the recognition granted,” the High Court said. The court noticed that the school and its management had so far spent Rs. 22 lakh towards medical expenses of children, besides cooperating and assisting the parents before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal for securing compensation as per the law. Also, the court observed that, “On the whole, it seems that the authorities are carried away by public opinion and vested interests making wild allegations against the petitioner-institution” without considering the institution’s explanations given to all the notices issued by the authorities. One of the students of the school, which is well recognised in Bhadravati, was a State topper in the SSLC exam of 2016 by securing 100% marks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/derecognition-of-school-harsh-karnataka-hc/article32763767.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Moratorium loans up to Rs. 2 cr. may get relief||The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it will continue to “hand-hold” small and vulnerable borrowers and waive the compound interest (interest on interest) accumulated against their loans during the six-month moratorium. The waiver of compound interest is only applicable for loans up to Rs. 2 crore, an additional affidavit filed by the Finance Ministry told the Supreme Court. The relief of waiver of compound interest during the moratorium will be for MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans, all up to Rs. 2 crore. “The government has decided to continue to hand-hold the small borrowers,” the affidavit said. The government made it clear that “any individual or entity whose loan amount is more than Rs. 2 crore will not be eligible for waiver of compounding of interest”. The 20-odd page affidavit reasoned that banks would suffer a loss of Rs. 6 lakh crore if the government agreed to a complete waiver of loans to all borrowers of all categories for the entire moratorium. “It would wipe out the substantial and major part of the banks’ net worth, rendering most of them unviable,” the Ministry said. A blanket waiver across the spectrum would “raise a very serious question mark over their [banks] very survival”. Govt. to bear burden Even for the State Bank of India, a sweeping waiver would wipe out over half its net worth accumulated over nearly 65 years of its existence. “The only solution is for the government to bear the burden of waiver of compound interest,” the government said categorically. It said even this limited waiver may have an impact on “pressing commitments to the nation, including meeting direct costs associated with pandemic management, addressing basic needs of common man” and so on. The government reasoned that “moratorium” never meant “waiver”. It only had meant “deferment”. “Borrowers had understood the difference between waiver and deferment of payment of instalments for that loan — therefore a majority of borrowers did not take the moratorium. More than 50% of the borrowers did not avail of the moratorium,” the government said. Deposit interest Most importantly, payment of interest to depositors was essential for banking. Small depositors, pensioners, etc. survive on the interest from their deposits. Going any further than a limited waiver would be detrimental to the overall economic scenario. “Jobs need to be safeguarded and every attempt made to bring back economic growth. Use of public resources for any one category of stakeholders must be carefully calibrated. Unintended consequences can arise and financial stability itself could be imperilled,” the affidavit cautioned. On concerns addressed in court about the downgrading of loan accounts from ‘Standard’ to ‘Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), the government said the resolution framework announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides that loan accounts which slip into NPAs between invocation and implementation may be upgraded as ‘Standard’ on the date of implementation itself. The government assuaged apprehensions that credit rating may record a downgrade to NPA for defaults during moratorium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/moratorium-loans-up-to-rs-2-cr-may-get-relief/article32763581.ece

Manoj Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will visit Myanmar on October 4 and 5, the External Affairs Ministry said on Saturday. The visit is being viewed as a crucial outreach to Myanmar after months of pandemic when direct interactions were limited. Gen. Naravane and Mr. Shringla are scheduled to interact with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung-Hlaing, a press release said. “The visit will provide an opportunity to take stock of the existing bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual interest,” it said. With the January 2000 Myanmar visit of the then Army Chief Gen. V.P. Malik, the military ties have come a long way. In July 2017, a military agreement was sealed during a rare official visit by General Min Aung-Hlaing. Apart from counter-insurgency operations in India’s northeast, the agreement also provided for training of Myanmar’s personnel in the defence training units. The visit is important for multiple reasons but especially because of the recent reported mobilisation of Myanmar’s military forces near the border with Chittagong.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-chief-foreign-secretary-to-visit-myanmar/article32764158.ece

We will announce the procedures and the dates after the final review of each test,” he said. Earlier, some confusion prevailed after the EAMCET convenor’s office said a test would be conducted on October 3 for such candidates but withdrew it later. The date was apparently given to candidates who applied to the convenor for an opportunity. Since it was not publicised officially, the TSCHE has decided to cancel the October 3 test. Mr Reddy said the Council was not in favour of giving opportunity to those who missed the test in September without medical reasons.

04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Assam wants stage 2 trial vaccine to be allowed||Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has asked the Central government to make available any likely vaccine candidate against COVID-19 after validation of stage 2 human trials for front line medical workers at the very least. Mr. Sarma had written a letter to Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan last month, requesting that regulatory permits for vaccine candidates being developed in India be expedited as the challenges of dealing with COVID-19 were mounting. “We are trying to convince people to abide by COVID-19 norms. The evolving situation is a matter of great concern. I will request the Centre to please allow the vaccine even at stage 2 trials. If you wait for stage 3 trials, the waiting period will be too long. If efficacy is established in stage 2, please allow the vaccine for at least front line staff, and that itself can be the stage 3 trial”, said Mr. Sarma to The Hindu over the telephone. The fact that the disease is currently being treated symptomatically and not aetiologically has weighed on this opinion. The letter written to Dr. Vardhan clearly states that despite efforts at controlling the spread of the disease, a quick vaccine development and large scale dissemination appears to be the only way to restore a semblance of normalcy to everyday life and the economy. The Union government has already set up a task force for the storage, distribution and implantation of the vaccine programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-wants-stage-2-trial-vaccine-to-be-allowed/article32763579.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Rahul, Priyanka meet family of Hathras victim||The police decision to permit only five persons to proceed led to confusion among the Congress workers leading to a lathi charge by the U.P. Police to control the situation. Former Bharaich MP Kamal Kishore and Delhi Congress President Anil Choudhary were among those facing police ire. Ms Vadra then stepped out of her car and caught hold of a policeman’s baton. She could be heard asking the police not to hit party workers. She also explained the situation to the party workers and asked them to return, before driving on. Mr Gandhi was also seen climbing atop an SUV and telling party men to return after the permission was granted. Denying Ms Vadra was manhandled , Mr Kumar said Ms. Vadra and Mr. Gandhi helped to calm the party workers but some “over-excited” workers broke the barricade and pushed the policemen. “We will take legal action,” he said. Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters Mr Gandhi had offered to go alone two days back. “But the UP Police stopped him.” He described the lathi charge as the “dictatorial” attitude of the State government. Earlier on Saturday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi and Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, DGP U.P. met the family of the victim in Boolagarhi and assured strict action against the culprits. Later, at a press conference in Hathras, Mr Awasthi said public representatives would be allowed to visit the Hathras victim's village provided they come in a group of five persons. He said SIT would consider all aspects raised by the family and security in the village would be increased. Asked on whose order the victim was cremated in the dead of night on September 30, Mr H.C. Awashti said, “It was the decision of the local administration.” After two days, the media was allowed to enter the village on Saturday. Joint magistrate Prem Prakash Meena said the media was stopped because the SIT investigation was on and four policemen had developed COVID like symptoms. During the day, the brothers of the victim collected the ashes of their sister from the cremation ground. “We are still not sure whether these are ashes our sister but for the sake of humanity, we have collected them.

04 October 2020||Lucknow,||U.P. govt. silent on phone tapping charge||A day after a television channel reporter alleged that her phone was being tapped over the Hathras incident, the Uttar Pradesh government was yet to come out with an official statement on the issue on Saturday. However, when asked about the allegation, a senior government official described it as “rubbish”. “No phone of anybody, any journalist is tapped. We are not doing anything. This is total rubbish,” Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Navneet Sehgal told The Hindu . On Friday, the India Today channel said the audio of a call between its reporter Tanushree Pandey and the brother of the rape victim in Hathras was leaked on social media. In an official statement, it asked if the phone of their reporter was being tapped or the numbers of the grieving family had been put under surveillance. Under what provisions of the law was the audio recording leaked by the officials who had access to it, it asked. “The audio has been released with mala fide intentions”, it said. Joint Magistrate Hathras Prem Prakash Meena on Saturday rejected allegations that the administration confiscated phones of the rape victim’s kin and blocked their movement in the village. He said the charges were “absolutely absurd and baseless”. Since the special investigation team had completed its investigation, restrictions on movement of media towards the residence of the victim’s kin have been lifted, he said. “At no point, phones or anything had been confiscated nor have they been held captive. They are absolutely free to move in and out of the village,” Mr. Meena told a television channel. Limitations had been put on everybody, including the media, for two days to ensure the SIT probe was not hampered, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-govt-silent-on-phone-tapping-charge/article32763558.ece

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||World’s longest highway tunnel opened in Himachal||Mr. Modi said the delay in completion of key infrastructure-related projects such as the ‘Atal Tunnel’ would only harm the country’s interests. “The delay not just causes inconvenience to people but the country also has to bear the loss on economic front. In 2005, the estimated cost of this tunnel was projected at Rs. 950 crore, but due to continuous delay, the tunnel has now been completed after spending over Rs. 3,200 crore,” he noted. There was a direct relationship between connectivity and the country’s development, the Prime Minister said. “More connectivity means more development. But unfortunately, the seriousness surrounding the connectivity of border development was never shown by previous governments due to lack of strong political will,” he stated. Just like the ‘Atal Tunnel’, many other important projects across the country had been ignored for long, Mr Modi said. “In Ladhak’s Daulat Beg Oldi, the airstrip, which is strategically very important, was closed for over 40-50 years. What was the compulsion? What was the pressure? I don’t want to go into details... The truth is that it was due to the strong will of the Air Force that the airstrip started to operate, and there was no ‘political will’ seen behind it,” he said. “There had been several other such projects that were very important from security and convenience point of view, but for several years they were ignored by previous regimes... these projects were of not just of strategic importance but would have ushered in economic prosperity as well. However, in the last six years, the situation has started to rapidly change. Specially, for connectivity development in the border areas, we have been working with full force ,” he added. The horse-shoe shaped, single tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 meters, is built through the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas, according to a government statement. Its South Portal is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the North Portal is located near village Teling at Sissu in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/worlds-longest-highway-tunnel-opened-in-himachal/article32763549.ece

Fatepara had issued a cheque of Rs. 1,48,50,000 to one Prabhatsinh Thakor as a part of a land deal. However, the cheque was dishonoured on the ground of lack of sufficient balance in his account.

04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||India backs n-weapons abolition||India on Saturday reiterated that nuclear weapons should be abolished in a step-by-step non-discriminatory process. Addressing the High-level Meeting to Commemorate and Promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also said India remains committed to “No First Use” against nuclear weapon states. “We believe that nuclear disarmament can be achieved through a step-by-step process underwritten by a universal commitment and an agreed multilateral framework. India remains convinced of the need for meaningful dialogue among all States possessing nuclear weapons, for building trust and confidence,” Mr. Shringla said in the virtual message. The comments indicate that India has not revised its key principles regarding the weapons in its arsenal. Following the election victory in 2019, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had hinted at a possibility of changing the No First Use (NFU) principle by declaring that ‘circumstances’ will determine the “No First Use” stance. However, Mr. Shringla said on Saturday, “India espouses the policy of ‘No First Use’ against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states. India is a key partner in global efforts towards disarmament and strengthening the non-proliferation order.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-backs-n-weapons-abolition/article32763582.ece

Justice D. Krishnakumar also took cognisance of the fact that a police complaint had been preferred against the petitioner in Chennai. The court directed the status report to be submitted to the court on October 14. The court was hearing the petition filed by K. Jayapandi of Aravakurichi in Karur district who said that he had completed his MBBS and was running a clinic which was sealed by the authorities on the grounds that he was not an MBBS graduate.

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||10 major firms show interest in Metro Rail phase II tunnelling||Nearly 10 firms, including those from China, have expressed interest in executing carrying out the tunnelling work on a crucial stretch of Chennai Metro Rail phase II project. Among the companies evincing interest are China Railway Tunnel Group, Shanghai Urban Construction Group, L&T, Hindustan Construction Company, Tata Projects, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., and Turkey-based Gulermak. Their representatives attended a pre-bid meeting held. Now, in a few weeks, the companies have to submit their bids, sources said. The mammoth 119-km Rs. 69,000-crore phase II project of the Metro Rail will have underground network and elevated ones. But the focus will be to start the tunnelling work because it takes a long time to finish it. Initial tender At first, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) had floated two tenders for two underground sections — the 9-km Venugopal Nagar-Kellys stretch and another 12-km Kellys-Taramani stretch. According to CMRL officials, the tender should be finalised and awarded in two months. “We are hoping to start the tunnelling work in these two stretches by early next year. The work will commence in different locations simultaneously but we will plan it in such a way that commuters are not put to inconvenience,” an official said. But sources said, owing to COVID-19 pandemic, some companies were apprehensive about coming down to the city and carrying out the construction work. Meanwhile, CMRL will float tenders for building the stations in this 21-km Venugopal Nagar-Taramani stretch. Unless CMRL plans the construction well for this 119-km project and finishes it on time, commuting through key localities of the city will be a major issue for thousands of residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/10-major-firms-show-interest-in-metro-rail-phase-ii-tunnelling/article32764184.ece

In her petition, Ponnammal said on July 16, 2016, when she was walking along the R.G. Salai near Tharamani SRP tools, an MTC bus hit her. As a result, the petitioner said she was injured and alleged that the bus driver was responsible for the accident and sought compensation from MTC. In its reply, MTC denied the allegations and said the bus driver tried to alert the pedestrian by sounding horn and applied brakes, in vain. The transport utility claimed that the driver was not responsible for the accident. The tribunal ruled that the petitioner had proved her case while the MTC driver had not produced proper evidence and not taken steps to quash the said FIR filed against him. Based on the medical records and FIR it said the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the MTC bus and awarded the compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tribunal-asks-mtc-to-pay-rs-205-lakh-compensation-to-flower-vendor/article32764185.ece

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Despite COVID-19, startups draw funding||Startups in Tamil Nadu raised $439 million in the first nine months of 2020 across 22 deals. During the same period last year, State-based startups attracted Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investments to the tune of $1,331 million across 39 deals, according to data provided by Venture Intelligence, a research service focused on private company financials, transactions and their valuations. Despite uncertainty in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this quarter (Q3) witnessed six deals amounting to $108 million. “While the PE-VC investment figures are down on a year-on-year basis, recent weeks have shown that both foreign PE-VC investors (notably, U.S.-headquartered investors like Falcon Edge Capital – which led the $4.5-million investment in Hippo Video) as well as well-established India-dedicated funds are keen to make new investment bets. This general ‘loosening of purse strings’ is likely to improve funding access for Chennai/Tamil Nadu-based companies as well,” said Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence. For the first nine months of this year, Tamil Nadu managed to get 17 angel investments. In 2019, the State had 11 angel investments for the same period. During this third quarter, the State saw seven angel investments while there were only 3 that came in during the same time last year. Mr. Natarajan explained that right now, owing to the impact of the pandemic, digitally native companies in edtech, fintech, entertainment and e-commerce sectors are attracting a lion’s share of PE-VC investments. “Tamil Nadu-based companies in the financial services and fintech space are likely to attract more attention in the current environment. "As investor confidence improves, startups in this region which are especially strong in the enterprise software and deep tech segment are likely to witness more investments flowing their way,” he added. According to Mr. Natarajan, the vibrancy of the capital markets (including the very successful IPOs of Chennai-based CAMS and Bangalore-based IT Services firm Happiest Minds), should also encourage more mature companies from the region to look at the IPO route to raise capital. The analysis done by the Venture Intelligence team shows that at the national level PE-VC firms invested $26.3 billion across 547 deals in the first nine months of 2020.

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Court rejects Sivasankaran’s plea against notice||The Madras High Court has refused to entertain a writ appeal preferred against a look out circular (LOC) preventing businessman and a promoter of Aircel, C. Sivasankaran, from travelling abroad due to an ongoing inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) into allegations of having caused a loss of over Rs. 600 crore to IDBI Bank. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy held that Justice P.N. Prakash had rightly dismissed a writ petition filed by the businessman, a Seychelles national who also claimed to be a diplomat, to quash the LOC issued by the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer, Bureau of Immigration, Ministry of Home Affairs. The Bench pointed out that an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre in 2010, and amended in 2017, permits the FRRO to prevent individuals from travelling abroad if such departure had to be curbed in public interest. It also rejected contentions that the petitioner enjoyed diplomatic immunity and that his civil rights could not be curtailed. “This may involve guarantee of liberty to a person under Article 21 of the Constitution but the genesis of the action is connected with pending criminal prosecution, the umbilical cord whereof has not yet snapped,” the Bench said and added that a writ appeal could not be preferred against orders passed on a writ petiton arising out of a criminal matter. “The contention that it involves civil rights of the appellant is, also, not correct because the relief revolves around consequences arising or likely to arise as a result of criminal prosecution... His movement inside this country being put under surveillance for the purpose of his participation in the criminal prosecution,” the Bench concluded. Cases listed In his order, Justice Prakash had listed out details of the cases booked against the petitioner. He said the CBI had found IDBI Bank to have sanctioned a loan of Rs. 322.40 crore to Finland based Win Wind Oy in which the businessman’s son S. Saravanan was one of the directors. The entire loan had become a non performing asset (NPA). Despite knowing well about the poor financial status of Siva Group of Companies led by the businessman, top officials of IDBI Bank colluded with him and extended further credit facilities of Rs. 523 crore in favour of group company Axcel Sunshine Limited, a company based in British Virgin Islands, for repaying loans of other associate companies. The CBI team in Bengaluru had registered a case against Axcel Sunshine and 38 others, including some public servants, under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988. The case was registered on the basis of directions issued by the Central Vigilance Commission in New Delhi. Subsequently, the ED also registered a separate case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002 and attached properties worth Rs. 224.60 crore. The single judge further rejected the claim of the businessman that he was an Ambassador at Large of the Republic of Seychelles and hence enjoyed diplomatic immunity. ‘Not accredited’ “The petitioner is not accredited to India. He claims himself to be a diplomat of Seychelles Republic. He is not the Ambassador of the Seychelles Republic in India,” the judge said and held that immunity under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention would not apply to him in view of the definition of the term ‘diplomatic agent’ under the convention. “Article 31 of the Convention will not apply even in respect of a diplomatic agent in the receiving State if he were to indulge in any professional or commercial activity outside his official functions. It is no part of the official functions of the petitioner to take loans from the IDBI Bank and then engage in money laundering,” the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-rejects-sivasankarans-plea-against-notice/article32764189.ece

The deceased has been identified as G Jeevanandam, 22, a graduate in agricultural science and a native of Ariyalur. The girl, aged 21, is a final year student of the same course. Last year, they met at a cultural event in Gujarat and became friends. Jeevanandam visited her house whenever he came to the city. He came to her house a few days ago and continued to stay without any plan of leaving. On Friday night, when the girl’s parents asked him to vacate, he told them that he would leave the next morning. He later told them that she should not marry anyone else and added that he would also remain single. At 3.15 a.m., he woke up and pulled out a gas cylinder from the kitchen to the hall and attempted to kill them by opening it and setting it on fire. The girl and her parents came out from their bedroom on hearing a noise and had a scuffle with him. They finally pushed him out of the house and locked the door. The girl and her mother had minor burns on the head, the police said. The family contacted the city police control room for assistance. Before the arrival of police personnel to the spot, Jeevandham inflicted injury on himself and was lying unconscious near the house. He was sent to Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead.

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dalit activists, thinkers slam VCK’s Adi Dravidar demand||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) general secretary D. Ravikumar’s recent demand that 60 castes in the Scheduled Caste list (except Devendrakula Vellalars and Arundhathiyars) be brought under the ‘Adi Dravidar’ identity has run into criticism from Dalit activists and thinkers. Punitha Pandian, editor, Dalit Murasu , said it was a ‘misnomer’ to use this term to claim caste identity. “Though Mr. Ravikumar states that they are not claiming the sub-caste identity, by failing to include the Arundhathiyars and the Devendrakula Vellalars, they are subtly entrapping the casteless ‘Adi Dravidar’ term into representing only the Paraiyar caste, merely for the sake of politics. The names such as Pallars, Paraiyars and Arundhathiyars were imposed on us and are derogatory. It is to set aside this name calling that ‘Adi Dravidar’ was introduced, but to use it against its very purpose is ludicrous,” he said. He said: “Just like how the word ‘Dravidar’ does not refer to a caste, ‘Adi Dravidar’ does not refer to any caste either. It is on this basis that the term ‘Adi Dravidars and Tribals’ encapsulates all the 76 Scheduled Castes and Tribes. It was created to give precedence to the Adi Dravidians as seniors to Dravidians. Today, there is no excuse for a few to abbreviate it as a caste for political reasons,” he said. G. Jakkaian, founder, Adi Tamilar Katchi, which represents the interests of the Arundhathiyars, reiterated that political mobilisation of the Arundhathiyars did not seek to establish a caste-based superiority of the community, but for political representation and social justice. Call for social justice “First of all, political mobilisation of the Devendrakula Vellalars and the Arundhathiyars should not be treated as the same thing. The Devendrakula Vellalars argue that being in the SC list is demeaning to them, while the Arundhathiyars sought representation. One is the voice of superiority and the other is a call for social justice...,” he said. He also warned against alienating thousands of Arundhathiyars and Pallars in northern districts of Tamil Nadu, who consider themselves ‘Adi Dravidars’. “In northern districts, the Arundhathiyars and the Pallars are counted as Adi Dravidars. There are many Pallars and Arundhathiyars in the VCK. Are they trying to say that the VCK is a party for one community alone? On the one hand, they say they are not a ‘caste party’ and they are a party for Tamils as a whole and on the other, they identify themselves as a party of ‘Adi Dravidars’. Only Mr. Thirumavalavan [VCK leader] should clarify it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dalit-activists-slam-vcks-demand-on-adi-dravidar-identity/article32764206.ece

GPS-based system A senior official of MTC said the project aims at providing passenger information system (PIS) using global positioning system (GPS) technology for the commuters to access the availability of buses through a mobile app. “The app is almost ready with the fixing of GPS in 3,200 buses. The live tracking of buses is available under a beta version in Chalo app and once fully completed, it will be migrated to the LAMB app," he said. The COVID-19 lockdown has been used to fix the GPS equipment in all buses when they were idle. “At present, under the beta version, the accuracy of the arrival time of buses is being checked and once the accuracy rate is under one or two minutes, LAMB would be launched,” he said. The MTC officials said that under the LAMB mobile app, more than 3,500 bus stops and 700 routes have been geo-coded. Users can track the arrival of five buses with route numbers in real time at any bus stop, locate the bus route and list nearest bus stops. Live tracking The live tracking of buses would be available for the commuters on the MTC websitewww.mtcbus.tn.gov.inonce the LAMB app is launched.

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Renowned physician K.V. Thiruvengadam is no more||K.V. Thiruvengadam, renowned physician and teacher of medicine, passed away on Saturday due to illness. He was 94. According to T.V. Devarajan, senior consultant physician, Apollo Hospitals, who was closely associated with him, Dr. Thiruvengadam was ailing for the past few days, following which he was admitted to a private hospital in the city. A physician and a specialist in chest diseases, asthma and allergies, Prof. Thiruvengadam, who is fondly known as Prof. KVT, is widely known for his teaching, clinical acumen and patient-centric approach. He graduated from the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) in 1950. He served as a professor of medicine in SMC and Madras Medical College. Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, in a press release, said he was a teacher for nearly 31 years and moulded several students into good doctors. He underwent training in chest diseases abroad. He was the recipient of prestigious awards. He received Padma Shri for his contribution to the field of medicine and the Dr. B.C. Roy Award. ‘Teacher of teachers’ Many of his students recalled their association with the “master physician”. A student of SMC from 1964 to 1974 (MBBS and MD), Dr. Devarajan said Prof. KVT was a teacher of teachers, very kind, polite, soft-spoken and considerate towards the poor. “He has taught thousands of medical students. He was an excellent clinician and academic, his diagnosis of patients was great and he used to spend nearly an hour for a patient. He mastered both medicine and English literature,” he said. He always laid emphasis on history-taking of patients, said M.A.C.S. Rajendran, general surgeon. “He used to tell us that history-taking would take you to diagnosis and clinical examination would complete the diagnosis. He always insisted that we patiently listen to what a patient is saying, allow him/her to talk,” he said. A student of the 1957-batch of SMC, he recalled the “bedside clinics” during Prof. KVT’s ward rounds. “He used to stop at the bedside of all patients and discuss their condition. If a patient had a heart problem, he used to teach us the heart murmurs and do a clinical examination. These clinics were an integral part of teaching in the wards,” he recounted. R. Surendran, former director, Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology, SMC, said, “He always gave importance to research in medicine. During my MBBS days (1969 batch), we had two textbooks of medicine, and he was so knowledgeable that we used to say that Prof. KVT was equal to Price’s Textbook of Medicine, plus Harrison’s Textbook of Medicine.” According to Subramanian Srinivasan, a consultant in infectious diseases, Prof. KVT was a larger than life figure in the medical careers of many of his students at SMC and Madras Medical College. “I was fortunate to have been a student in the early 70s. It is refreshing to have grown with him, to listen and examine the patient, to arrive at a diagnosis and to learn the methods used at bedside...,” he said. Dr. Thiruvengadam’s wife Dr. Malathi passed away recently. He is survived by his two sons and a daughter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/renowned-physician-kv-thiruvengadam-is-no-more/article32763690.ece

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers brainstorm on school-reopening strategy||Bringing together teachers from across the State, Unicef and the Solar Trust on Saturday hosted an e-consortium to discuss the impact COVID-19 has had on school education. In the first webinar, teachers discussed the findings of a participatory review conducted by Unicef and the Forum for Child-Friendly Schools (FCFS) on the areas that will need attention once schools reopen. The review indicated that 95% teachers felt that sensitising parents and school management committees, and seeking their cooperation and support was a must before reopening schools. “As far as safety, health and protective measures are concerned, we need to think about the steps that need to be taken right from the time a student leaves his house for school. This includes separate buses for students, handwashing facilities in schools and ensuring adherence to physical distancing norms in classrooms. Parent-teachers’ associations at schools should be roped in to provide inputs and give feedback on the measures implemented,” said Poongodi, a government schoolteacher. Teachers like her, who participated in the e-consortium, shared similar views on measures that schools could take. Akila Radhakrishnan, social policy specialist, Unicef- Tamil Nadu, said this was a strategic opportunity for reflection among teachers. They could come up with effective solutions for implementation, she said. For the webinar series, teachers are being motivated to take an evidence-based approach, looking at issues that are impacting teaching and learning. Ms. Akila said the plan was to have one webinar every month, and based on them, suitable inputs for policy and action would be shared with the State government. Delivering the inaugural address, N. Panchanatham, honorary vice-chancellor, Tamil Nadu Teacher Education University, said teachers need to be ably aided by parents as well as other stakeholders when schools eventually reopen. “At present, it is important that teachers try to bring in creativity and take a holistic approach, with regard to the online classes that they are handling,” he said. Pinaki Chakraborty, chief, social policy, Unicef State office for T.N. and Kerala, stressed the importance of continuity in learning, and said that digital learning during the pandemic, was, therefore, the best alternative.  As far as safety measures are  concerned, we need to think about the steps that need to be taken right from the time a student leaves his house Poongodi Government schoolteacher||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-brainstorm-on-school-reopening-strategy/article32763687.ece
04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea seeks GST compensation for State||A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Union Ministry of Finance to implement Section 7 of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act of 2017 in letter and spirit, and consequently release Rs. 12,250 crore to Tamil Nadu towards compensation for shortfall in GST collections from April 1 to August 31. Activist G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal has filed the case through his counsel M. Radhakrishnan. He contended that the failure of the Centre to comply with the statutory requirement and release the money, to compensate the shortftall in GST collections in the State, would amount to violation of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. He pointed out that GST was introduced in the country through the Constitution (one hundred and first Amendment) Act of 2016 and Section 18 of that Act stated that Parliament would, by law, on the recommendation of the GST Council, provide for compensation to the States for loss of revenue, for a period of five years, on account of implementation of GST. It was in view of such a guarantee, the 2017 Act was notified by the Centre on July 1, 2017. As per Section 7 of this Act, the compensation payable to the States should be calculated provisionally and released to them at the end of every two months. The quantum should also be calculated for every financial year, after the receipt of final revenue figures, and settled. However, the Centre had not paid the compensation to Tamil Nadu since April, he said and referred to a letter written by the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister last month. The contents of the letter were released to the media on August 31 and it was stated therein that Tamil Nadu had agreed to the implementation of GST only on assurance of compensation for any loss of revenue. “It is also released from the press release dated August 31 that a total sum of Rs. 12,250 crore is due to Tamil Nadu as compensation for the shortfall in GST collections of which Rs. 11,459.37 crore has accrued from April to July,” the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-seeks-gst-compensation-for-state/article32763686.ece
04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anna varsity to start hiring for 250 positions||Anna University has announced recruitment for positions of faculty and other academic staff at its four campuses. This comes almost three years after the State government announced a ban on recruitment by universities to accommodate excess employees from Annamalai University in 2017. Despite protests, the government had insisted that even faculty from the erstwhile private institution would be posted at other government institutions, as it had been taken over by the government. Two faculty — one each for the chemical engineering and civil engineering departments — were posted from the Annamalai University, besides eight non-teaching staff, at the Anna University. Vacancies at the university began to swell. Ban lifted On October 30, 2019, the government lifted the ban on recruitment, paving way for filling the vacancies. Earlier this year, the finance committee of the university approved the recruitment of around 245 persons, including for the position of librarians. There could be as many as 70 vacancies for professors, for which a notification has not been issued, university sources said. Online registration commenced on September 30, and the last date for filing online applications is October 21.

We decided to go ahead with the drive for those three months. Now, we want to continue doing it and have set up this mobile kiosk,” he said. The food is cooked in two community kitchens at Parry’s Corner and nearly 50 volunteers distribute them.

04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Some courses available only in English despite PSTM Act||It was in 2010 that Tamil Nadu’s State legislature enacted a law to fill up at least 20% of vacancies in public employment on a preferential basis with those who had obtained educational qualifications through Tamil as the medium of instruction. However, even after 10 years, the provision eludes many as not all courses are offered in Tamil medium. A case in point is a recent judgment passed by Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy of the Madras High Court with respect to the recent appointment of 148 Forest Apprentices without a single Tamil medium candidate. This was because the Bachelor’s degree in Forestry was being offered only in the English medium in the State . Aspirants who had obtained alternative qualifications, such as a Bachelor’s degree in Botany and Chemistry through Tamil medium had approached the High Court seeking preference in accordance with the provisions of Tamil Nadu Appointment on Preferential Basis in the Services under the State of Persons Studied in Tamil Medium Act (PSTM) of 2010. However, the court turned down their plea, citing the Tamil Nadu Forest Subordinate Service Rules, which allow filling up the post of Forest Apprentice from two different categories of candidates. The first category comprised candidates who possess a Bachelor’s degree in Forestry, and the second category had candidates with alternative qualifications. Only if the number of candidates in the first category was not enough could the posts be filled with those from the second category. As far as the present recruitment process was concerned, sufficient number of forestry graduates had applied for the 148 vacancies, and hence, there was no question of considering those with alternative qualifications. Further, agreeing with the State government that the 2010 Act does not provide for “reservation” of 20% of vacancies in public employment, but only requires that “preference” be given to Tamil medium candidates in 20% of posts, the judges said the litigants before the court need not be given any preference since they fell under the second category of applicants. “The preferential rule for PSTM (Persons who had studied in Tamil Medium) candidates could not be given effect to even amongst the first category candidates because unfortunately the course of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Forestry is not taught in the Tamil Medium in any institution,” observed the first Division Bench led by the Chief Justice. Previous order In another judgment delivered in June, the same Division Bench had held that a person who had studied in Tamil medium up to the undergraduate level could not claim preference under the PSTM category if the requisite educational qualification for the post was a postgraduate degree or above, that was not offered in Tamil medium at any institution. That judgement was passed while dismissing a writ appeal preferred by J. Prabhu, an aspirant for the post of Assistant Professor in Chemistry in government arts and science colleges. Though the appellant had done his schooling and undergraduate course in the Tamil medium, he had obtained his M.Phil and Ph.D qualifications through English medium. He had contended before the court that he could not pursue higher studies in Tamil medium because those courses were offered only in English medium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-vacancies-not-filled-under-pstm-act-as-not-all-courses-available-in-tamil/article32764349.ece
04 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lack of cleanliness in harbour irks fishermen||It’s just been a month or so since the Kasimedu fishing harbour was cleaned by the Fisheries Department but the wharfs and empty spaces are already littered with broken boat parts and rubbish. This is due to the lack of no cleaning regimen for the harbour that gets close to 30,000 visitors daily. “There is no cleaning mechanism. People just sweep up their spaces whenever they can. But without bins to dump the waste, sweeping or removing the waste does not matter,” said Vinod, who along with the police and a band of youngsters, had removed 300 tonnes of waste from the fishing harbour last year. Arasu, president of a boat owners’ association, said the harbour was under the control of the Chennai Port Trust and that they were collecting wharf charges regularly. “Nobody knows what happens to that money. The port does not want to take charge of the cleanliness, lighting or water supply inside the harbour. Control must be handed over to the Fisheries Department,” he said. No exports M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said due to the lack of cleanliness, fish exports do not happen here. “We have been banned by the European Union due to a lack of hygiene. We send fish to Cochin from where they are exported, which is unfair to the fishermen here since they don’t get good rates for their catch.” He also added that unless regular cleaning was taken up, crores of money invested by the State government to improve infrastructure would be ruined. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said a system would be put in place soon to clean the fishing harbour. “We will maintain our assets,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kasimedu-harbours-lack-of-hygiene-irks-fishermen/article32764191.ece

04 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||R.K. Naidu Layout residents urge GCT to repair compound wall||Residents of R.K. Naidu Layout, Venkitapuram, seem to be worried more about what happens in the rear of their houses than on the street, in front. Their source of worry is the damaged compound wall of the Government College of Technology, which is south of the area. Through the damaged stretches of the wall, anti-social elements and mischief-makers enter the college ground, make merry, consume liquor, threaten the peafowl and also the safety of residents, complains C.K. Banumathy, a resident and president of the R.K. Naidu Layout Association. It is not just people from the nearby slums and even those from afar enter the college ground to create nuisance. The intruders disturbed the peafowl, set fire to bushes and after consuming liquor flung around the bottles, she adds. The presence of such elements pose a threat to the Layout residents as they scaling the wall is only a matter of time, adds another resident K. Karthikesh. Ms. Banumathy says the residents have twice taken up the matter with the college authorities but were yet to get relief. Sources in the college and Public Works Department, which takes up construction and maintenance of government establishments, say the compound wall is damaged and that the college has sent a proposal to the Higher Education Department to strengthen and rebuild the wall, wherever necessary, for Rs. 1.50 crore. The proposal is for a 850 – 900m stretch of wall from the east on Thadagam Road to north touching Venkitapuram and R.K. Naidu Layout till the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The sources say the entry of unwanted elements also poses a threat to the students’ and faculty’s safety as well and therefore the college has reminded the department officials about the proposal. The PWD sources say the reason for the damage to the wall has to do with the Coimbatore Corporation not having a proper outlet for the sewage collected from the R.K. Naidu Layout. At present the sewage stagnates on the northern side of the college, abutting the Layout and the stagnant water has led to the weakening of the wall. Though the residents and college authorities want the corporation to construct a proper sewage disposal system, the civic body has not acted yet. Sources in the corporation promised to look into the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rk-naidu-layout-residents-urge-gct-to-repair-compound-wall/article32764211.ece

Her counsellor told her about handmade, knitted prosthesis and she opted for it. Using the prosthesis since January this year, she says she finds it very useful. “I found it difficult to interact with people (after the procedure) and now I am able to move about freely and interact with confidence,” she says. The knitted breast prosthesis is supplied by Saaisha India Foundation, a charitable organisation. Jayashree Ratan, founder of the organisation, learnt about the product and started knitting it four or five years ago. Saaisha India is registered with Knittedknockers.org of the US and is active in India since 2018. Srividya Gopinath, a Chennai-based volunteer of the Foundation, says that since 2018 Saaisha has supplied about 1,800 knitted prosthesis to beneficiaries across the country. As many as 175 volunteers in India and the UAE knit the prosthesis and send it the Foundation’s centre in Mumbai. While most of the volunteers are experienced in knitting and crocheting, some have learnt it to be part of the cause. “We have tied up with a cotton yarn supplier. The volunteers buy the yarn from him, knit the prosthesis and send it to the Centre. It is filled with poly fibre and supplied to beneficiaries,” she says. “We check the weaves and there is a pattern guide. We have made Youtube tutorials too on how to knit these,” she says. The average time taken is three to four hours for a knitter, some of whom are working women too. “Of late, with better awareness, there are two or three volunteers who want to come on board almost every day. Some of them are beneficiaries. We want these products to reach women in rural areas,” she says. The prosthesis, which is reusable, is distributed free of cost to beneficiaries who are referred by hospitals, cancer counsellors or the volunteers. Ms. Gopinath and Ms. Ratan point out that the treatment for breast cancer is expensive and not all can afford a prosthesis after that. The handmade, knitted products will benefit such women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/knitting-up-confidence-for-women-who-undergo-mastectomy/article32763732.ece
04 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Cameras installed in Kallar corridor to monitor jumbos||The Forest Department has installed cameras to monitor elephants in five locations on the busy Mettupalayam-Udhagamandalam road where the ghat section of the National Highway-67 passes through the ecologically important Kallar elephant corridor. The joint initiative by the Forest Department and WWF-India is to assess the number of elephants using the corridor, its functionality, seasonal movements and the difficulties elephants face. Though lone tuskers are found to have been crossing the road without much difficulty, vehicular movement to and from the Nilgiris through Coonoor remains a major obstruction for herds comprising calves. “The cameras were placed for increased monitoring of elephants using the corridor. We are expecting to collect various data, including the number of herds using the corridor, the time they take to cross the road, changes in the patterns of movement and other difficulties the animals face,” said I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle. According to the studies done by researchers in the past, the Kallar corridor is significant as it connects the Brahmagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats elephant population range with the Nilambur-Silent Valley-Coimbatore population range. The movement of elephants between the two ranges facilitates genetic exchange, dispersal and access to a variety of seasonal foraging grounds, according to researchers. Furthermore, researchers have assessed that the corridor is the only possible transit route for large mammals to move between the forests of the Silent Valley National Park-Mannarkad-Palakkad Forest Divisions and the Nilgiri North Forest Division-Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. “Traffic intensity, over 8,000 vehicles per day, on the NH passing through the elephant corridor is the biggest problem. The changes in the use of private lands in the corridor... have further narrowed the elephant passage. The green tax toll booth set up on the corridor needs to be relocated to help in the smooth movement of elephants,” said D. Boominathan, landscape coordinator of WWF-India, Coimbatore. Various Departments and stakeholders put forward a proposal for a 1.6-km flyover from the Kallar bridge to the second hairpin bend of the ghat section at a cost of Rs. 160 crore a few years ago. But it did not get budgetary sanction from the State government, said officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cameras-installed-in-kallar-corridor-to-monitor-jumbos/article32763679.ece
04 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Devotees sent back from Karamadai temple||Despite the district administration closing the Aranganathaswamy Temple at Karamadai for Puratasi Saturdays to prevent the spread of COVID-19 large number of devotees, who thronged the temple, were sent back by the police. The Karamadai police said that over a hundred devotees arrived on Saturday morning as they were not aware that the temple was closed. Some of them chose to offer their prayers from the main road. Barricades were erected in front of the temple entrance and police personnel were deployed. Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said that although the temple was closed for devotees, the Puratasi Saturday rituals were carried out. District Collector K. Rajamani announced on Thursday that the temple will remain closed for all the remaining Puratasi Saturdays (October 3, 10 and 17) citing the possibility of being unable to completely adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOP). He requested the public to not visit the temple in large numbers in the other days of the week too. Ukkadam temple An HR&CE Department official claimed that the Lakshmi Narashima Temple in Ukkadam within the Coimbatore Corporation limits saw only around 500 devotees as of Saturday evening. This was half of the number of devotees used to visit the temple on Saturdays apart from the Puratasi month, he claimed. All COVID-19 precautionary measures were put in place at the temple, according to the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devotees-sent-back-from-karamadai-temple/article32763728.ece

Natarajan and members of Kongu Mandala Vivasayigal Valvathara Padhukappu Kuzhu submitted a petition to the District Collector K. Rajamani on Saturday demanding that the proposed Karur - Coimbatore bypass road project should be dropped. The farmers’ forum also sent their memorandum to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. They pointed out that the proposed project runs parallel to an existing highway (old number NH 67) within a few kilometres connecting Karur and Coimbatore. The proposed road is shorter by just six km. Further, the entire project is through lands where farming activity is on. The forum said that the government should look at widening the existing highway. The proposed greenfield project has serious opposition from the affected people and there are several roads that provide connectivity as an alternative to the proposed eastern ring road. Further, the National Highway has started widening and improving several roads, including the rural roads. The MPs representing Coimbatore and Pollachi have also made similar requests after perusing the project with the NHAI authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-oppose-karur-coimbatore-road-project/article32764223.ece

The residents’ are likely to see an increase from 75 litres per capita a day (lpcd) to 135 lpcd as the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board will commission the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water augmentation scheme, say sources familiar with the project.

It had already completed the Rs. 108.16 crore Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water supply augmentation scheme that draws 6.52 MLD water from the Ramakrishnapuram master balancing reservoir (over-head water tank) on Sathyamangalam Road. Three added areas The addition of 18.02 MLD to the 10.48 MLD that the residents have been getting under the old Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli scheme and 3.18 MLD that the residents get under the Siruvani scheme takes the total water that they will get to 31.62 MLD, which is more than twice the water supply that the residents are getting at present, the sources say and add that the water supply improvement project will directly help 2.56 lakh persons in the three added areas – Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam. And, this 31.62 MLD will take care of the residents' need till 2036, they add. As a part of the water supply improvement project, the board has also widened the width of pipes supplying water to 26,659 houses in the aforementioned areas so that they get adequate water and at good pressure at that, the sources add. Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation say there were another 25,000-odd houses and other establishments that are waiting for new water connection, which the civic body will issue in due course.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kavundampalayam-vadavalli-residents-to-get-more-water-by-november/article32764216.ece

04 October 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Demand to reintroduce two-way traffic system on Mettur Road||Motorists, traders and the public want the district police to reintroduce two-way traffic system on Mettur Road as the increase in vehicle flow on Nachiappa Street is causing inconvenience to all. The district police had in May this year introduced one-way traffic on the 750-m stretch of Mettur Road from GH Roundabout to Swastik Corner to reduce congestion and help the 108 ambulances reach hospitals without delay. Police personnel were posted on Mettur Road to prevent vehicles, including two-wheelers, proceeding from Swastik Corner to GH Roundabout. Motorists have to take Sathy Road, Nachiappa Road and Meenatchi Sundaranar Road to reach GH Roundabout and proceed towards their destination. The system has not gone well with the motorists, who say that frequent traffic congestion on Nachiappa Street is causing hardship to the road users. “While the entire one-way stretch of Mettur Road is not used, the entire stretch of Nachiappa Street is busy throughout the day with vehicle movement,” says M. Santhosh, an employee at a private company. He says the one-way traffic system serves no purpose to anyone. “Instead, two-wheelers and cars can be allowed on the stretch,” he adds. Residents of Chinnamuthu Street, Sampath Nagar, Municipal Colony and Edayankattu Valasu say that they are forced to take additional four km due to the one-way system. “Our house is just 500 m from Mettur Road. But, due to the system, I am forced to travel for four km more,” says Deivasigamani of Chinnamuthu Street. Commercial establishments on both sides of Mettur Road claim that their business is affected much because of the one-way syatem. Also, hundreds of workshops, shops and other establishments present on small streets in the area want steps taken to reduce congestion on Nachiappa Street. The residents of Nachiappa Street submitted a petition to Superintendent of Police P. Thangadurai urging the district police to reduce congestion on Nachiappa Street. They said that they were facing hardship due to frequent vehicle movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-to-reintroduce-two-way-traffic-system-on-mettur-road/article32763739.ece

04 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Only Pocso courts can hear anticipatory bail pleas, says HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the Special courts designated under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act alone are empowered to entertain anticipatory bail petitions in respect of offences under the Act. The Sessions Court cannot entertain such applications, the court said. The court was responding to the Karur District Judge who had sought a clarification with regard to the jurisdiction of the District and Sessions Court in entertaining anticipatory bail applications for the offences committed under the Pocso Act. A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and V. Bharathidasan observed that even in cases where pre-arrest bail was sought before the First Information Report (FIR) was registered, only the Special Court designated under the Pocso Act can entertain the application. Mahila Courts As per a government order issued in 2013, the State government, in consultation with the High Court, designated the Fast Track Mahila Courts as Special Courts under the Pocso Act and Additional Sessions Judges presiding over the Fast Track Mahila Courts were functioning as the judges in Special Courts under the Act. Section 28(1) of the Pocso Act states that a court of session already in existence in a district can be designated as a Special Court to try offences under the Act. Under section 33(1) of the Act, the Special Court may take cognisance of any offence, without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon receiving a complaint or a police report. Section 33(9) of the Act states that the Special Court shall have all the powers of a court of session and shall try offences under the Act. In such circumstances it has to be treated as a court of original jurisdiction and it has all powers of the court of original criminal jurisdiction. Under Section 31 of the Act it is clear that the provisions including bails and bonds shall apply to the proceedings before the Special Court. Therefore the provision of anticipatory bail is applicable to the Special Court. The Special Court is exclusively empowered to deal with the offences under the Pocso Act, the judges said. The object of the Act is to provide protection to children from offences of sexual assault, harassment and pornography and safeguard the interest and well being of the child at every stage of judicial process, the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-pocso-courts-can-hear-anticipatory-bail-pleas-hc/article32763694.ece

Based on a tip-off that two container trucks and a cargo auto rickshaw carrying banned tobacco products were parked near Madurai railway junction, the Delta team of Madurai City Commissioner of Police raided the spot and found the contraband. Based on confession from the drivers of the vehicles, the police raided two lorry sheds on North Masi Street where 16 bags of tobacco products were seized, Deputy Commissioner of Police R. Shiva Prasad said. “Preliminary investigations have revealed that the tobacco products were brought from Bengaluru and packed in white bags in the guise of bundles of saris and spices and brought to Madurai,” he added. From Madurai, the goods are stealthily taken in smaller cargo vehicles to various districts as far as Kanniyakumari. “We have picked up four suspects and interrogation is under way,” he added. As the lorry shed personnel were also involved in the smuggling, the police conducted an inquiry with M. Balamurugan and A. Surya Prakash of two lorry sheds. It was revealed that V. Balasubramani alias Palani, 50, of Bharathiyar Street and his son Karthik, both owners of trucks, had booked the parcels and they only knew the exact movement of the contraband. The police have also nabbed drivers Duraipandi, 63, and his son Balasubramani, 35.

04 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Train services suspended on Pamban bridge||Train services were suspended between Rameswaram and Mandapam railway stations on Saturday after the continuous health monitoring system raised an alarm of a “strain” in structural member of Pamban railway bridge. “It could be a false alarm and our engineers are attending to the issue. However, we operated only the empty rake of the special train without passengers as a precautionary measure,” a senior railway official said. Thirty-six passengers who had reserved accommodation with boarding at Rameswaram railway station were taken by road to Mandapam railway station from where they boarded the train, he added. Southern Railway had installed sensors to assess the behaviour of the structural member under the traffic condition by fixing strain gauges and accelerometers. The project, executed by IIT-Madras, was tested in June-end during the lockdown. “Since the Pamban bridge is more than 100 years old, we are taking all precautions. Train services with passengers can resume only after clearing the doubts to ensure safety of the bridge,” the officer said.

Chinna Durai, a retired orthopaedic surgeon belonging to the 1969-batch of Madurai Medical College, said it was only because of the treatment provided at Government Rajaji Hospital was he able to recover from COVID-19. “I had a 70% lung infection and the doctors gave the best treatment for my complete recovery,” he said. He was addressing the media persons as part of an event during which the MMC’s 1969 alumni batch felicitated the doctors of GRH for their work in saving lives from COVID-19 infection. C. Ramasubramanian, a renowned psychiatrist, another alumni of 1969 batch to get treated for COVID-19 at GRH, said the hospital had good infrastructure, experienced doctors, medical equipment, medicines and provided good food for the patients. “Recently, a mentally ill patient, who had tested positive for COVID-19, was provided a separate room for treatment at GRH,” he said. Counselling for COVID-19 patients was provided in the hospital right from the initial months of the outbreak of the pandemic, Dr. Ramasubramanian said. S. Narmadha, a general medicine practitioner from Tirunagar, and G. Gunaseelam, a doctor from Palani in Dindigul, shared their experiences of recovery from COVID-19 after treatment at GRH. The COVID-19 infection was unique as the morbidity was higher and mortality highly unpredictable, said R. Raveendran, another alumni. “Despite all these challenges, the doctors of GRH performed well to save many lives,” he added. Dean J. Sangumani; K. Senthil, Treatment coordinator for the COVID-19 wing of GRH; M. Natarajan, Head of the Department of Medicine; K. Barathi Babu, Assistant professor of Thoracic Medicine; S.

Deputy Director of Health Services K.V. Arjun Kumar said only three dengue cases had been reported in the district in September. “There is no outbreak of dengue yet. Butwe have started with the dengue-control measures, while simultaneously working to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. A total of 305 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) have been deployed in the 13 rural blocks of the district. Ten DBCs have been deployed for each of the town panchayats and around 140 DBCs have been deployed in the municipalities in the district. City Health Officer P. Kumaraguruparan said that 530 DBCs have been deployed for identifying spots where dengue-spreading Aedes aegypti mosquitoes breed and undertake control measures. “There have not been any major dengue hotspots in the city. But we have prepared a separate schedule to ensure that fogging will take place in all the wards once in every 15 days,” Mr. Kumaraguruparan added. Mr. Arjun Kumar said mosquito density was unusually high in rural parts like Othakadai, areas near Tirupparankundram, Melur and Tirumangalam. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, people had become more sensitised to ensure that there was no water stagnation that allows breeding of dengue mosquitoes, said M.Kaleeswari, a DBC with the Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dengue-control-measures-start-ahead-of-monsoon/article32763700.ece

04 October 2020||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Babri Masjid demolition case: demo held||Protesting the acquittal of all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case by the designated CBI court, the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath staged a demonstration here on Saturday. Led by party’s State secretary Syed Ali, the agitators raised slogans against the acquittal of the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case in the demonstration organised in front of the Collectorate. Raising slogans against the “injustice” meted out to Muslims, the protestors said the Supreme Court, while rejecting all the evidences submitted in support of the ownership of the disputed site at Ayodhya, gave the verdict in support of the construction of Ram Temple on the place where Babri Masjid stood for centuries. Even as the Muslims were yet to recover from the first blow landed by the apex court, the CBI court, by acquitting all the accused who played pivotal role in the demolition of the mosque, had buried democracy and justice. “Both the verdicts have unequivocally declared that the minorities would not get justice anymore in India even though the entire nation had witnessed the demolition of the masjid by a well-trained and well-planned mob, led by a group of leaders. This is nothing but burial of justice,” said Mr. Syed Ali.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-against-acquittal/article32763696.ece

04 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Doctors’ strike hits outpatient services in Puducherry PHCs||Healthcare workers on Saturday refused to provide outpatient services at government hospitals, seeking the inclusion of non-bailable sections against Mettupalayam inspector of police S. Shanmugasundaram for allegedly assaulting a duty doctor and a nurse at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Research Institute. A case was registered on Friday against the inspector under Sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 294(b) (punishment for using obscene words), 332 (punishment for assault on government servant), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 356 (punishment for attempt to theft), read with Section 149 (punishment for unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was registered after a complaint was filed against the inspector and others for assaulting a duty doctor and a nurse over alleged medical negligence, which caused the death of the inspector’s father. According to the government hospital authorities, the inspector’s 80-year-old father was brought to the hospital in a serious condition. Medical interventions did not save him and he died on Thursday night. Mr. Shanmugasundaram got into an argument with the duty doctor and after abusing him, physically assaulted him too. He took away the mobile phone of the nurse. Abusive language “He is a law enforcement officer and not an ordinary citizen. Even if he had a grievance about the treatment provided by doctors, he has enough avenues to complain about the same. Instead, he assaulted the duty doctor and the nurse and used filthy language against them. This has become a routine affair at the GH, especially at night,” a senior doctor said. A nurse said the government should install surveillance cameras at the hospital and the medical college to identify the criminals who create trouble. A Bill was passed by the Assembly to ensure that strict punishment was given to those attacking healthcare workers, but it was yet to be implemented in the Union Territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-strike-hits-outpatient-services-in-puducherry-phcs/article32763724.ece

The residents protested in front of the Aavin dairy plant on Steel Plant Road urging authorities to take measures to prevent effluents discharge from the plant and dispose it properly. The protesters said that the problem arose mainly during rain. Thangaraj, a farmer, said, “my farm lands near the plant have been severely affected due to discharge of effluents from the plant. Crops have submerged due to this. People in the five villages near the dairy are affected.” K. Raja, president of Thalavaipatti panchayat, said they had been complaining with the authorities of the plant and other officials, but no action had been taken. Mr. Raja alleged that during rain, the rainwater mixed with effluents leaked through the walls of the plant to the vacant lands and farm lands. Over 200 acres of farm land had been affected due to this. The authorities must take immediate action on the issue. However, Narmadha Devi, General Manager of Aavin dairy, denied that effluents were being discharged.

04 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers call for prompt procurement of ‘kuruvai’||Farmers who had taken up ‘kuruvai’ cultivation in Thanjavur district on a large extent of area with confidence after nearly a gap of nine years complain of procurement delays in Thanjavur district. Kuruvai paddy cultivation was taken up on around 59,900 hectares (ha) in Thanjavur district this season as against 37,000 ha last year. The timely release of water from Stanley Reservoir in Mettur on the scheduled date of June 12 this year had enthused the farmers to take up `kuruvai’ cultivation on a larger extent of area this season. According to official sources, the crop raised on about 40,000 ha was harvested by the end of September and nearly 7,71,000 metric tonnes of paddy was procured from the farmers through 166 direct procurement centres opened in the district till last month-end. As the ‘kharif’ season 2020-21 has commenced from October 1, another 60 DPCs had been opened in the district for procuring paddy from the farmers, official sources said. However, a section of farmers had a different story to narrate and counter the claims made by the officials with respect to the procurement of ‘kuruvai’ paddy. S. Rajendran of Kannankudi Kizhaiyur in Orathanadu block laments that he was unable to sell the paddy harvested from his field at the DPC in view of the erratic functioning of the facility over the past few weeks. “Paddy is procured for two or three days in a week and at the same time farmers are advised to bring their produce for measuring on the date fixed by the DPC staff. Thus we are finding it difficult to protect the produce from the vagaries of nature”, he added. Endorsing Mr. Rajendran’s statement, Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, claimed that the change in procurement process adopted by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation this season had pushed the farmers to a piquant situation. Asking the farmers not to bring the produce directly from their fields to the DPC and stock them at their houses/own godowns for inspection and issuance of tokens by the Corporation staff was unacceptable since individual farmers lack proper facilities to store the grains. The grains get drenched in rain or spoiled due to vagaries of nature which could not be avoided, he pointed out. Further, only 600 to 700 bags of paddy are being procured per day at a DPC though the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation has to “instruct” the staff to step up the daily procurement to around 1000 gunny bags. Hence, there is a delay in the procurement process at the DPCs, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-call-for-prompt-procurement-of-kuruvai/article32763691.ece
04 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Analysis done to trace patients with viral pneumonia symptoms||The district administration has conducted an analysis to find and trace patients with symptoms of viral pneumonia detected through chest CT- scans. The aim is to supplement the RT-PCR tests in detecting COVID-19 and reducing the fatality rate in the district, officials say. Officials reviewed the CT - scan reports taken across 21 scan centres in the district from July to September. Using the data, health officials, including village health nurses (VHN) and block medical officers, trace and test them for COVID-19 and provide treatment, M. Govinda Rao, Collector, told The Hindu . S. Maruthudurai, Dean, Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, said that of all CT scans taken between June and September, 50 to 60% of the patients showed symptoms of viral pneumonia. The number of patients whose CT scans showed lung involvement in the moderate and severe range was 10 in July, by September, there were 100 patients in the moderate range and 150 patients in the severe range. Steps to trace and treat these patients were taken following this report, he said. The study has helped patients save valuable time as it allows doctors to monitor the blood oxygenation levels in patients, and treat them before COVID-19 symptoms, if at all, manifest. “VHNs and health officials are provided with the data taken from the scan centres, so that they may trace the individuals whose CT-scans show signs of oxygenation levels below 95%. The patients are informed of their ill health and are given the option to choose to be admitted to Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, or any of the 10 empanelled private hospitals,” he said. While most patients agree to get admitted to a hospital, there are some who disagree and later begin to show symptoms of COVID-19, including cough and breathlessness and by then, their blood oxygenation levels drop to below 85 and the patients require immediate medical attention. At the TMCH, a separate ‘Suspected COVID-19’ ward has been set up where patients with lung involvement and symptoms of viral pneumonia detected through CT-scans are admitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/analysis-done-to-trace-patients-with-viral-pneumonia-symptoms/article32763669.ece
04 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Lack of facilities at G. Corner grounds||With the northeast monsoon just about two weeks away, the vegetable and fruits traders, who operate out of the temporary wholesale market, are worried about continuing trade at the market once the monsoon sets in as the G. Corner grounds lack adequate infrastructure. As part of the precautionary measures in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 and to prevent the people from assembling in large numbers, the Tiruchi district administration closed the Gandhi Market in the last week of March and subsequently shifted its operation initially to the Chennai Bypass Road and later to G. Corner, an open ground owned by the railways. The stopgap arrangement was expected to serve the purpose for one or two months. But, the traders continue to function in the open space for more than 6 months. There is absolutely no basic infrastructure for the traders to stock and store the fresh arrival and unsold vegetables and fruits. The traders allege that they have been undergoing trying times in the absence of facilities to safeguard the money, keep the weighing machines, place to take rest and for other purposes. According to a rough estimate, there are about 180 wholesale and 200 retail shops at the temporary market. It attracts about 4,000 wholesale and retail traders, grocery traders and loadmen. Except a few mobile toilets and drinking water containers, there is nothing to protect the traders from heat, rain and wind. Toilets are said to be highly inadequate to meet the requirement of 4,000 and odd traders. When the retail traders, who operate at Uzhavar Sandhai at Anna Nagar, were given a makeshift shed, no such provision was made at G. Corner, apparently due to the reservation expressed by the Southern Railway to erect or build any solid infrastructure. Troubled over the frequent rains, a few traders erected makeshift sheds a few weeks ago, but only to be removed by the railway authorities. Though the traders manage to continue their trade despite of a few spells of rain between June and September, they are worried about the prospects of the trade during the northeast monsoon, which is expected to set in in the third week of October. Many of them vie for moving back to the Gandhi Market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lack-of-facilities-at-g-corner-grounds/article32763666.ece

04 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI/THENI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK cadre resort to poster war||Even though the party high command has gagged its office-bearers from airing their views in public on the party’s next Chief Ministerial candidate in the wake of heated face-off in the recently held party meet, posters in support of Chief Minister and AIADMK’s joint coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami have cropped up in some places. Minister for Cooperation Sellur K. Raju stirred up the Chief Ministerial candidate issue a month ago in Madurai during an interaction with reporters and Minister for Dairy Development Rajenthra Bhalaji reacted against his views. Posters surfaced in Theni, the home district of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in his support, necessitating the party high command to step in to stop the poster war. Though the party functionaries remained silent for a while after the dictum, posters in support of Mr. Palaniswami have surfaced in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai, apparently as the cascading effect of the reported heated argument in the recently held party’s executive council meet over the choice of next Chief Ministerial candidate. The posters had three different messages, all backing Mr. Palaniswami as the Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Assembly polls. While two of the posters did not carry the photo of AIADMK’s Tirunelveli east district secretary Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, the remaining one, purportedly jointly released by three lower-level party functionaries, carried his photograph also, suggesting that they had his approval too. “After understanding the sentiments of grass-roots level party workers and the common man, who support Mr. Palaniswami because of his tireless work even during the pandemic, a few cadre have released these posters. There is no harm in it as it will not dent the image of the party where there is no place for traitors,” said Sudha K. Paramasivan, chairman, Aavin - Tirunelveli and party’s organising secretary, whose photos can be seen in the posters. Interestingly, one of the three posters has been released by P.S. Muthuraj, former president of Keezhapaattam panchayat, is from the native place of O.P. Ravindranath Kumar’s father-in-law. His poster, terming Mr. Palaniswami as ‘friend of farmers,’ appeals to him to lead Tamil Nadu as CM again. Mr. Ganesa Raja, party’s district secretary who termed the poster campaign as an “unapproved and isolated incident,” said every cadre should respect what the party high command says and there is no room for discussing anything in public. “I don’t endorse campaign of this sort as I feel everyone should strictly follow the high command’s instructions. The party, which is strong now, will emerge victorious thanks to the able administration,” he said.  OPS in Periyakulam  Meanwhile, the Deputy CM arrived in Periyakulam on Friday evening from Chennai. After meeting some of his loyalists, he participated in the birthday celebration of his grandson. On Saturday, Mr. Panneerselvam received a steady stream of visitors from various parts of the State at his farm house in Kailasapatti near Periyakulam. Media persons were not allowed inside. The Deputy CM will be here till Tuesday, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-cadre-resort-to-poster-war/article32763716.ece

The Highways Department has to hand over 775 metres of land along Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road to the Airports Authority of India to complete the airstrip. To ensure smooth flow of traffic, a 1-km-long parallel mud road is being built. This will run along the airport compound wall and join the SH 122. “The process of handing over SH 122 to the airport is still in progress, and will be done soon. But we will start work on making a mud road, adjacent to the Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road, motorable by October 15. However, it will take time to complete the permanent road on that stretch,” said an official. An official from the Vellore Local Administration said that obstacles on both sides of the runway will be removed. “Trees, electric poles and other structures with an elevation of 15 metres will be removed on both sides. We expect the airport to be commissioned by March 2021,” the official added. After the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issues an airport licence and the Civil Aviation Ministry completes inspection, the Vellore airport will host 20-seat plans that will fly to Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. The Vellore airport was sanctioned under the second phase of the UDAN-RCS (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik- Regional Connectivity Scheme).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/highways-dept-begins-work-on-parallel-road-to-vellore-airport/article32764429.ece
04 October 2020||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Tribal man, child murdered||The bodies of a 50-year-old tribal man and his seven-year-old daughter were found in a farmland at Rangappan Kottai village near Veppankuppam in Vellore district on Saturday.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Over 525 DPCs opened in delta region||Since October 2 was a holiday, there was no procurement, he said, adding the DPCs would function on Sunday. When his attention was drawn to complaints from farmers that the paddy waiting for procurement at some DPCs had sprouted, Mr. Kamaraj denied that there was any delay in procurement. The pile-up was due to the heavy arrival of paddy simultaneously owing to mechanisation of harvest, unlike in the past when manual harvesting would result in staggered arrivals. Procurement had been stepped up to 1,000 bags a day at each DPC. Previously, only 600-800 bags were procured a day, he said. On the farmers’ demand for procuring paddy with higher moisture content due to the unexpected rain, Mr. Kamaraj said it was the Centre’s norm that only paddy with moisture content of up to 17% could be procured. “However, we will ensure that farmers are not affected and none will be turned away,” he said. Pointing out that last year, the TNCSC had procured a record 32.41 lakh tonnes of paddy, benefiting six lakh farmers, Mr. Kamaraj said that this year too, the government would procure the entire paddy arrivals from farmers who had raised the kuruvai crop even on a larger extent of area than normal owing to the timely release of water from the Mettur dam, desilting of canals and moderate rainfall. Answering a question, he said stern action would be taken on specific complaints of irregularities. There was no question of paddy being brought from other districts for sale in delta districts as DPCs had been opened in all parts of the State. Later in the day, Mr. Kamaraj inspected DPCs in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-525-dpcs-opened-in-delta-region/article32763677.ece

04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Tense moments in BJP||The exercise to decide who gets the Bharatiya Janata Party ticket to contest the upcoming R.R. Nagar bypoll appears to has turned into a platform for factionalism and lobbying with the central leadership. As Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has been strongly favouring giving the ticket to defector Munirathna — who quit the Congress to join the BJP and helped the former in forming the government — those leading the party organisation, reportedly in concurrence with party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh, have been favouringTulasi Muniraju Gowda. Mr. Gowda, a local BJP leader, had not only fought against Mr. Munirathna in successive elections but also challenged his 2018 victory on the grounds of election malpractices. The BJP State core committee that met two days ago recommended both the names, putting the ball in the high command’s court. “Not just the Chief Minister, even the BJP had promised defectors tickets and ministership in the government and neither of them can afford to go back on that promise. The BJP has not let down any defectors across the country,” a strategist close to the Chief Minister argued. Munirathna’s baggage However, there has always been resistance within the party to Mr. Munirathna joining them. “Mr. Munirathna, while he was a Congress MLA, had harassed our councillors and faced several corruption cases. The BJP had fought against him bitterly, exposed election malpractices and challenged his election as well. That baggage is still there and many in the party are not happy with his possible candidature,” a senior leader in the organisation said. Many point out that though R. Roshan Baig had also resigned, his entry into the party was blocked over similar concerns and R. Shankar was denied ticket in the bypolls and later made and an MLC. Given the support for Mr. Gowda by the party organisation, the Chief Minister’s camp is keeping its fingers crossed, sources said. “If Mr. Munirathna is not given ticket, it will be another major embarrassment to the Chief Minister,” a senior leader close to Mr. Yediyurappa said. Recently, the party Central leadership chose dark horses late Ashok Gasti and Eranna Kadadi for Rajya Sabha elections even though the Chief Minister had sent a different set of names. Meanwhile, three defectors who are now MLCs — A.H. Vishwanath, Mr. Shankar and N. Nagaraju (MTB) — are already putting pressure on the Chief Minister to induct them into the Cabinet. It is uncertain if it will happen soon in the light of the bypolls.  While Yediyurappa has been favouring giving the ticket to Munirathna, party is backing Tulasi Muniraju Gowda||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tense-moments-in-bjp/article32763791.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic hits cancer, renal patients hard||COVID-19 infected patients with comorbidities, especially renal issues and cancer who need specialised care, are finding it hard to get admission in hospitals as not all have the required facility to treat them. With only a few government hospitals having dialysis facilities for COVID-19 patients, triaging of positive renal patients has become difficult, say BBMP staff involved in triaging patients. Although most private hospitals now have a few dialysis machines set aside for COVID-19 patients, only a fraction of them are available under the government quota. People who cannot afford private treatment are forced to wait till they get admitted under government quota. “While it is a big challenge to get admission for a patient who needs dialysis, it is even more difficult to triage a positive patient who needs both dialysis and an ICU bed as very few hospitals have both. Recently, we struggled to get admission for a 75-year-old male patient, who was brought from Hassan to Bengaluru for treatment. He required dialysis and ventilator and he had Hepatitis B. Although we managed to admit him in St. Martha’s Hospital, he did not survive,” said Tauseef Ahmed, a volunteer from Emergency Response Team (ERT), a group working in coordination with the BBMP and 108 in triaging patients. Mr. Ahmed said it is all the more difficult in case of cancer patients as Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology is the only government cancer hospital. “Some private hospitals that have oncology facilities refuse to take patients if there are complications,” he said, adding that there is no clarity on which hospitals have nephrology and oncology services available. A senior doctor from Kidwai said surgeries and other procedures, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy in positive patients, are being put off till they test negative. “Cancer surgeries are long duration ones and in any surgery there is a need to insert an endotracheal tube through the mouth into the trachea (windpipe) to help the patient breathe. This is risky and anaesthetists refuse to intubate a positive patient. With around 70 of our staff members, including the director, getting infected, we have made it a rule to wait till the patient tests negative,” said the doctor. Admitting that this was delaying timely treatment to cancer patients, the doctor said: “We are attending to all emergencies, including surgical. The out-patient department is fully functioning and the number of patients walking in have increased after the lockdown eased.” Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said that although there was a problem initially, most large hospitals have dialysis facilities now. “Dialysis units are the lifeline of renal patients. It is important that they do not miss their regular dialysis,” he said. “COVID-19 patients with pre-existing kidney disease are a vulnerable group and it is risky for them if dialysis is delayed,” he said. R. Ravindra, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said some hospitals have reserved dialysis beds for government patients. “The government has agreed to pay us extra for dialysis of COVID-19 patients referred by the government. We have told our member hospitals to not refuse any dialysis patient,” he said.  While it’s a challenge to get admission for a patient who needs dialysis, it is even more difficult to triage a positive patient who needs both dialysis and an ICU bed, as very few hospitals have both.

04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘COVID-19 insurance’ to reassure travellers||As the tourism sector is seeing signs of recovery, some companies – travel and insurance – have started offering COVID-19 insurance to encourage travellers to venture out despite the pandemic. MakeMyTrip, for instance, has started offering a COVID-19 specific insurance for travellers. “People are putting their trust back in travel, one step at a time. The pandemic has changed consumer behaviour in many ways and when it comes to travel, safety naturally tops the priority chart. The uncertainty of these times has pushed travellers to opt for the insurance options more than before. Mapping this trend, MakeMyTrip rolled out an option for COVID-19 insurance, which benefits travellers with coverage of Rs. 2 lakh per customer, while air insurances typically have lower cover for health issues,” a spokesperson of MakeMyTrip told The Hindu.  The insurance covers hospitalisation for 16 days post-travel in case of COVID-19 infection as it usually takes around 14 days for the virus to surface, unlike air insurances which cover illness for the day of travel or up to 72 hours, the spokesperson explained. Other benefits covered under the COVID-19 insurance include zero restrictions on room rent, consumables, post-hospitalisation diagnostics, etc. “A health crisis like COVID-19 demanded special attention and benefits that extend support beyond the normal. To address this need, the company has introduced special insurance of this nature for the first time. We are seeing a good uptake for this insurance,” the spokesperson added. Sanjar Imam, president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum, said most of those who are travelling are opting for travel insurance that covers emergency hospitalisation and medical expenses incurred on the treatment of COVID-19. “A couple of travel companies are offering the insurance for free when a package of a certain amount is booked. However, it is really not a value-add as the premium amount gets built in the package or is considered instead of discounting,” he added. Meanwhile, the sector is reporting “encouraging signs” since travel restrictions were eased, bringing major relief to months of lull, and most players are pinning their hopes on the upcoming holidays. “Within Karnataka, weekends are doing fairly well, especially in the higher segment, as hotels are almost full. Weekdays are suffering still with 20% to 30% occupancy. Travel beyond Karnataka has not picked up yet. But the premium sector is seeing some recovery. In the higher segment, people are driving out of Bengaluru for weekends, especially if they are extended,” Mr. Imam said. According to MakeMyTrip, there is a surge in the number of searches and bookings for short-haul trips, more so to destinations located within 300 km from metro cities. “Even as demand for outbound tourism will stay soft, we are seeing good traction for Dubai and Maldives,” a spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-insurance-to-reassure-travellers/article32763779.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hospital managements allege harassment by BBMP officer||Alleging harassment by the zonal BBMP nodal officer for hospital management, heads of nearly 25 private hospitals in Bommanahalli zone have threatened to shut their hospitals and stage a protest in front of Vidhana Soudha on Tuesday. The hospital owners will meet BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Monday and submit a written complaint. “We will also submit a complaint to the health department and stage a protest on Tuesday,” said C. Vishwanath Reddy of Prashanth Hospital. “Although we have been the first to offer our entire 100-bed hospital for COVID-19 management in the city, the BBMP nodal officer has been harassing us over the last one month. He has been making unreasonable demands asking us to submit various documents within 24 hours, which is practically impossible,” he said. Vinay B.G., who runs Supra Hospital, said, “While we are not objecting to the show cause notices issued to our hospital regarding COVID-19 deaths, the officer has been asking us to submit discharge summary and death summary of patients from July 2015 onwards within 24 hours. How is this possible?” Denying the allegations, the nodal officer Narayanswamy said he is only following the decisions made by the Bommanahalli BBMP command centre. “We are taking up a death audit as we learnt that many doctors, who are not qualified, treated patients resulting in their death. Moreover, these hospitals have defaulted on property tax payment. Hence, I have asked for these documents. It is not harassment,” he said.

04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Soon, students will rate teachers in schools run by the BBMP||Students of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) 156 schools and colleges will soon be asked to rate their teachers performance. This is part of the civic body’s exercise to not just identify good teachers, but also the poor performers. According to a senior official in the BBMP’s Education Department, this is an attempt to improve the quality of education in their educational institutions. While there were around 616 outsourced teachers, only 220 are directly employed by the BBMP. “Poor performers will be made to undergo training. The rating system will also bring in some competition among the teachers,” the official said and justified the move by stating that the children were the best judges. The civic body has also taken up verification of the educational qualifications of its outsourced teachers. The official claimed that this is a regular exercise. “There may be many teachers who would have completed B.Ed or M.Ed courses. For instance, such teachers who may be deputed in primary schools can be transferred to high schools. They may also be transferred to schools with more student strength,” the official added. Both these exercises will help the civic body identify teachers who have added to their educational qualifications, those who may be tasked with more responsibilities, and teach more than one subject. The BBMP maintains a student-teacher ratio at 30:1 in primary schools and 40:1 in high schools. Failure of Project Roshni The official conceded that ‘Project Roshni’ that was launched in 2018 amidst much fanfare to upgrade the BBMP-run institutions into “world-class education centres” has not had the desired effect. The BBMP had entered into a memorandum of understanding with a city-based firm for the project. However, the project that was to be implemented over a two-year period has not made much headway, but for the few training sessions that had been held for teachers by the firm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/soon-students-will-rate-teachers-in-schools-run-by-the-bbmp/article32764174.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Experts stress need to further probe asymptomatic patients||Although a large number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 are categorised as “asymptomatic”, doctors and medical experts say many of them are not “truly asymptomatic”. They may not have listed their symptoms accurately, and experts point out that there is a need to ask more questions and probe further. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said: “After probing, many patients reveal that they had fever for one or two days and it had gone away after they took medicines. So, it is important for doctors to probe and diagnose their symptoms accurately.” Sources in the Department of Health and Family Welfare pointed out that many the patients who were classified as “asymptomatic” were under home isolation and not reporting their symptoms accurately to avoid hospital admission. Overworked staff He also admitted that in many cases, healthcare professionals who are overworked and are facing burnout may not be reporting the symptoms accurately as the number of positive cases reported are on the rise. Another doctor working in a government hospital in the city pointed out that with doctors seeing multiple patients a day, the time spent with each patient has reduced. “As a result, there is very little scope for taking down detailed patient history or conducting detailed investigation,” the doctor said. H.M. Prasanna, president-elect, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said many patients under home isolation delay coming to the hospitals as they feel they do not have symptoms. “When people are under home isolation, they need to pay attention to symptoms and report accurately. They also need to do basic investigations even if they are unable to report symptoms. We often find that patients have pneumonia when we do a CT scan. But they come to the hospital late and this increases fatality rate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/experts-stress-need-to-further-probe-asymptomatic-patients/article32763786.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Post-lockdown, property sales bring relief to real estate sector||Amidst a pandemic marked by job losses, pay cuts and health scare, the real estate sector was ailing. Added to this was a labour shortage following a mass exodus of migrant workers from big cities back to their hometowns. But the last quarter, people in the sector said, has brought major relief. Property sales, particularly in the big cities, have reportedly picked up, mainly buoyed by the housing sector. Kishore Jain, president, CREDAI Bengaluru, said the last quarter was ‘very good’, considering April to June was a ‘disaster’. “Things have picked up. Serious buyers are in the market. There is renewed interest in ready to move in properties,” he said. According to property consultants ANAROCK, the housing sector made a “decisive comeback” in the third quarter of 2020 - June to September. “The top 7 cities witnessed housing sales of approximately 29,520 units in Q3 2020 as against 45,200 units in the pre-COVID-19 quarter of Q1 2020. Sales were significantly higher than the preceding quarter, when the coronavirus pandemic had brought sales down to just 12,730 units,” a report from the company said. Its chairman, Anuj Puri, said Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Bengaluru, NCR and Pune accounted for 84% of the sales in the quarter. “MMR saw maximum sale of 9,200 units, followed by Bengaluru with 5,400 units, NCR with 5,200 units and Pune with 4,850 units. In terms of new launches, the top seven cities witnessed supply of approximately 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as against 41,220 units in Q1 2020 – reaching over 79% of the pre-COVID-19 quarter levels. Most new launches in the quarter happened virtually,” he said. The seven cities recorded new launches of around 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as opposed to 41,220 units in pre-COVID-19 quarter of Q1 2020, reaching nearly 79% of the pre-COVID-19 quarter. However, there is a massive jump over the previous quarter of Q2 2020 that saw merely 1,390 units being launched. Key cities contributing to Q3 2020 new unit launches included MMR, NCR, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, the report added. Mr. Jain said multiple reasons have contributed to the development. “Before this, few people gave importance to their residence; it was like bed and breakfast. After work from home, for the first time, some things may have been noticed. People started looking for a sense of belongingness and comfort, savings and investment. Secondly, it is the best time to buy a property. The prices are rock bottom and interest rates as low as probably in 2003,” he explained, adding that commercial real estate deals were also beginning to get renewed. Property consultants and realtors expect the trend to continue, especially for residential real estate, even predicting a supply-demand mismatch next year due to fewer new launches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/post-lockdown-property-sales-bring-relief-to-real-estate-sector/article32764166.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah warns of stir if caste census report is not accepted||The State government has to accept the socio-economic survey report (popularly known as caste census) prepared and submitted by the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said on Saturday, and warned the government that the Congress would support the agitation of the backward classes if it did not do so. The report was submitted to the commission’s then member secretary Mohammed Mohsin (Backward Classes Welfare Department) on September 21, 2019, by the then chairman H. Kantharaj. Report ‘leaked’ In the run-up to the 2018 Assembly elections, the report’s “leaked” data had created a flutter in political circles by suggesting that the numerical strength of castes could be significantly different from what was traditionally assumed. The report’s content was never officially made known. At a press conference organised by the Karnataka Backward Classes Federation here on Saturday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said his government had ordered the commission to conduct the survey in 2015. A whopping Rs. 167.77 crore was spent to conduct the survey and identify the socio-economic conditions of the backward classes. The government seems to have not accepted the report, said Mr. Siddaramaiah and urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu to accept it. Interestingly, Mr. Sriramulu recently said the report was never officially submitted to the government. Backward classes people would come to the streets and launch an agitation against the government if the report was not accepted and implemented, the former Chief Minister warned. ‘Constitute commission’ The Congress leader also demanded the re-constitution of the commission. Commission’s chairperson and members have not been appointed by the government after Mr. Kantharaj’s resignation, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. The Centre had already constituted the commission. The Supreme Court too had given a ruling for permanent constitution of the commission, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-warns-of-stir-if-caste-census-report-is-not-accepted/article32763801.ece
04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Update details on app or else face action, govt. tells private hospitals||The State Health Department has directed private medical establishments to update all COVID-19 related details of their institutions in the government’s Facility App, failing which action will be initiated against them. An order to this effect has been issued by Health Director Om Prakash Patil. “Some private medical establishments are cooperating with the government in admissions and clinical case management of the positive patients referred by the government or the local body. But not all are updating details on the app on a regular and timely basis. This is causing hardship and delays in total data harvesting for planning and implementing screening, referral, treatment, and follow up,” the order said. Hence, all private medical establishments should mandatorily update all COVID-19 details on the app or face action, the order added. In another order, the Health Department directed private hospitals to compulsorily test patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for COVID-19. Although private hospitals have been entering details of ILI/SARI patients who are coming to their clinics on the prescribed portal, they are not sending the patients for testing to swab collection centres. ‘Late identification’ Delay in testing such patients would result in late identification of COVID-19 in them, the order said. The hospitals should test such patients for COVID-19 in their facility if they have in-house testing facility or draw their swab and send to the ICMR-approved private or government labs. The private establishments can charge Rs. 200 per patient, while the testing is free in government labs, the order added.  In another order, the Health Department directed private hospitals to compulsorily test patients with Influenza-like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/update-details-on-app-or-else-face-action-govt-tells-private-hospitals/article32763784.ece

An order to this effect was issued on Saturday by Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare). The authorised plasma banks can collect the amount towards processing the plasma, the order stated. HCG Plasma Bank U.S. Vishal Rao, who heads HCG Plasma Bank set up in association with the State government, said the bank was charging Rs. 9,500 per unit that includes antibody testing of the patient. “We have given plasma to over 750 patients so far from our bank and have recorded 60% recovery rate,” he said. However, the charges in some hospitals range between Rs. 9,000 and Rs. 11,500, he said.  9,886 new cases Meanwhile, the State on Saturday reported 9,886 new COVI-19 cases taking the total number of cases to 6,30,516.

04 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two elephants die near Bannerghatta park||Amidst a raging debate over reduction of the Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), two elephants were found dead in the Kodihalli range adjacent to the park on Saturday. Prashant Shankhinamath, DCF, Bannerghatta National Park, told The Hindu that the two elephants were found in a water body bordering the park’s Kodihalli range. “Preliminary investigations indicate electrocution. We will have to wait for the postmortem report,” he said. Police officials said they were not aware of the incident. The spot where the elephants were found is outside the park’s area. “Both elephants are female, and they look like adults, but the bodies are bloated,” he added. Members of the Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust allege that illegal electric fencing on private properties outside the park caused the death. “Proper elephant fencing will only repel the animals. Ones with strong current will cause death. This is a crucial elephant corridor, which is under threat due to reduction of the eco sensitive zone, and wildlife is suffering,” said a member. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) approved reduction of the ESZ of the BNP by around 100 sq. km. The March 11 gazette notification had notified an area “to an extent varying from 100 metres to 1 kilometre around the boundary of Bannerghatta National Park, in Bengaluru and Ramanagara districts as the Bannerghatta National Park Eco Sensitive Zone.” The area of the ESZ was mentioned as 168.84 sq.km. while the first draft notification issued in 2016 had marked an ESZ area of 268.9 sq.km. Though the Central government had issued a second draft notification reducing the area by around 100 sq.km. in October 2018, in August 2019, the ministry asked Karnataka to reconsider the 2016 notification. The Trust has argued that reduction in the ESZ will allow stone quarries and crushing units to continue, and that there are key corridors with Cauvery North Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and Cauvery Sanctuary in Karnataka around.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-elephants-die-near-bannerghatta-park/article32763780.ece

04 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Congress no longer giving positions on basis of recommendation, says DKS||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar has said that the Congress in Karnataka had put an end to granting positions in the party through recommendations and would be identifying and grooming new-generation leaders. Launching the Youth Congress membership campaign at R.N. Shetty Kalyan Mantap here on Saturday, Mr. Shivakumar said the focus was on building a cadre-based party now and all the activities and works of the office-bearers, from the booth level to the leaders, were being documented. “If any party member has to get a position, his or her work and sacrifice will be considered, and it will be decided through an internal election. As per the vision of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, if the country has to survive and prosper, more representation should be given to students, youngsters and women,” he said. The KPCC president said that in order to strengthen the organisation of the party from the booth level, a mobile application — Praja Pratinidhi — was being developed and tested on a pilot basis in his constituency. “From the booth level, one can get various positions. Politics is like agriculture. If and only when one works at various levels can one get the crop named position. We have dropped the tradition of appointments through recommendations. At the booth level, a ‘digital youth’ will be appointed,” he said. Mr. Shivakumar also said the party was where it was because of too much “individual worship”. “From here onwards, only those who do party worship will survive. From activists to leaders, the focus should be on strengthening the organisation. One should be a member and organiser first, and then a leader,” he said.  On Hindutva Taking a dig at the BJP, Mr. Shivakumar said that Hindutva was not any one person’s property; it was the property of the nation. “The country has more statues of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar than of Lord Sri Ram because he was the voice of the oppressed who were exploited and ill-treated for centuries. Now, the people of the country have started raising their voice against governments. If at all the Constitution of India has to be protected, agitation is inevitable. And everyone should be ready to fight,” he said. Referring to the changing times and the need for the party to change, he called on leaders and members to be amidst the people and become their voice. “Only those become the voice of the people willbecome leaders.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-no-longer-giving-positions-on-basis-of-recommendation-says-dks/article32763771.ece
04 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Workers stage demonstration||As part of the “all-India agitation week” call given by the All-India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), workers of various government programmes, including anganwadi and midday meals, and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) staged a demonstration in Dharwad on Saturday. The all-India agitation week is being observed in opposition to the BJP-led Union government’s moves on privatisation of public sector companies, including the Railways, recent amendments to farm Bills, and anti-labour policies. The objective is to press for various demands of the workers of the unorganised and other sectors. On Saturday, a protest was taken out by the workers seeking fulfilment of various demands and a demonstration was held at Vivekanada Circle under the banner of Scheme Workers’ Federation of India (SWFI), affiliated to the AIUTUC. Addressing the protesters, district convenor of SWFI Bhuvana Ballari said that across the country, nearly one crore workers, mainly women, were working as anganwadi teachers, assistants, ASHAs, midday meal workers, and in other capacities. “Most of them are those who have to support their families, widows, and those without shelter. They are being paid Rs. 1,100 to Rs. 10,000, which cannot be compared to the minimum wages of Rs. 21,000 fixed by the International Industrial Tribunal. What is shocking is that even the meagre wages are not being paid on time,” she said. Ms. Bhuvana said that these workers lacked social security and they would have no support at all,especially after retirement. “All these schemes are run by the government, which is the owner of all the schemes. And during the lockdown, the government did not behave like a model owner,” she said. AIUTUC district president Gangadhar Badiger urged the government to fix minimum wages of Rs. 21,000 for scheme workers and said they should be treated as government employees. He urged the government to give honorarium to midday meal workers throughout the year. A memorandum containing 10 demands was then submitted to the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/workers-stage-demonstration/article32763774.ece

04 October 2020||HUBBALLI/BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Cong. decision today: DKS||President of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) D.K. Shivakumar has said that the decision on Congress candidates for the bypolls to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Legislative Assembly constituencies will be taken on Sunday. After launching a membership drive of the Youth Congress in Hubballi on Saturday, Mr. Shivakumartold presspersons that there were several aspirants. “The party has set up a committee, led by the former Minister Ramalinga Reddy, to take a decision on the issue. We will take a final decision after Sunday’s meeting,” he said. Regarding reports about Congress considering the name of Kusuma Ravi, wife of late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, for ticket to contest in Rajarajeshwarinagar, he said discussions were still on. Later in Belagavi, he said several senior Congress leaders had favoured her candidature. “Around seven to eight MLAs and former Ministers have suggested her name. Her father, Hanumantharayappa, was in the Congress, but left it for some reasons. I am, however, yet to speak to her or to other persons concerned about this issue. The party has also not taken a final decision on this matter as there are eight to 10 aspirants,” he said. He said that a “multi-layered system” had been created to gather opinions of party workers and leaders on such issues. “First, Congress leaders in Bengaluru such as Mr. Reddy will hold a meeting of local workers and seek their opinions. Then they will update me. I will discuss that with State-level leaders and elected representatives of the party. A final decision will be taken after that, in consultation with the high command,” he said. A similar system will be followed to decide the candidate in Sira. The opinion of local leaders would be discussed at the State level and sent to Delhi for approval, he said. Flood relief Earlier in the day while speaking to presspersons after visiting the party office in Dharwad, Mr. Shivakumar lambasted the State government for its failure to take up flood relief measures and compensate farmers for the loss they had suffered. He said the government was yet to release compensation for the crop loss suffered during last year’s floods and this year the Union Finance Minister had already expressed her helplessness on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-decision-today-dks/article32763794.ece

Sadananda Gowda said on Saturday that the Union government has reserved Rs. 500 crore, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, for the promotion of apiculture. People, especially youth, should avail themselves of its benefits by going for beekeeping, he said. He was speaking at a function at Puttur in Dakshina Kannada after inaugurating the new administrative building and a hall of the South Kanara Beekeepers’ Cooperative Society Ltd.

The Minister said that honey has amazing medicinal power and it is a must for preparing some Ayurvedic medicines. Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar said that a cooperative society of beekeepers owning an administrative building and a hall indicated that it had grown over the years and functioned transparently. The cooperatives in Puttur have come together to promote the cooperative spirit. The amendment to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act will help farmers as they can sell their produce wherever they want without any restriction. They will not be imposed any penalty. Mr. Somashekar said that the government was not helping multi-national companies by amending the Act. The Minister released the 42nd issue of Madhu Prapancha , an in-house journal of the cooperative society on the occasion. Minister in charge of Dakshina Kannada and Minister for Ports, Fisheries, Inland Water Transport and Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary, Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor spoke.

04 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Report on landslips to be submitted by Dec.’||Karnataka Biodiversity Board will submit its comprehensive report on the causes for landslips during the monsoon in the Western Ghats districts and the measures to be taken to prevent them by December, according to board chairman Ananth Hegde Ashisara. Addressing presspersons after a meeting in the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Saturday, he said a 10-member committee, constituted by the government under the board, visited the districts which reported landslips in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The committee comprised experts from the Indian Space Research Organisation, the Indian Institute of Science, the Geological Survey of India), Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the Department of Mines and Geology, and the Forest Department. It also had disaster management experts. He said that COVID-19 had caused a delay in the submission of the report and now it will be done either in November or December. The government constituted the committee three months ago. He said that biodiversity committees under gram panchayats in the State have completed the documentation of biodiversity in their panchayats. But committees under all urban local bodies are yet to complete their documentation. The process is under way in some urban local bodies and in some areas the committees should be made active. Mr. Ashisara said that the biodiversity committee of Sullia Taluk Panchayat in Dakshina Kannada has identified four forest areas in the taluk as the natural biodiversity heritage site for “ramapatre” ( Myristica Malabarica ). He said that there is a need to identify more natural biodiversity heritage sites for fish and conserve them. Mr. Ashisara said that the board has recommended that the State Wildlife Board declare “Tudavi” honeybee as the ‘State insect’, as it is is on the verge of extinction. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa hasagreed for the same. The chairman released the final technical report on the ‘establishment of a herbarium and botanic museum of the plants of Western Ghats at the Dr. Shivaram Karanth Pilikula Nisargadhama’ on the occasion. The chairman also released another report ‘survey, identification and preparation of report on sacred groves in coastal Karnataka of Western Ghats region’. The board had sponsored this project. Both the reports were prepared by the nisargadhama and were submitted to the board this July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/report-on-landslips-to-be-submitted-by-dec/article32764291.ece

The incident occurred when she had kept her petty shop, which is attached to her house, open to sell essential items during the lockdown and also offer water to customers. “I bent forward to give the biscuit packet to the customer. He pulled my necklace and sped away on a scooter. I am happy to get the necklace back from the police,” said Ms. Seeta, who was among the many who received stolen property following the property parade held by Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash here on Saturday.

The demonstration was part of the call given by the Karnataka State and Medical Education Department Contract and Outsourced Employees’ Association. As many as 700 doctors, staff nurses, and other contract and outsourced employees from Dakshina Kannada are among the 30,000 employees in the State who have stayed away from work since September 24. They are demanding wages and service benefits on par with permanent workers. As the State government has failed to take any action in the last nine days, the demonstration was held on Saturday. Addressing the protesters, Mohammed Ashraf, president of the district unit of the ssociation, said while the State government immediately agreed to revise the salaries of government doctors, it was dilly-dallying on their demand. “We have also worked tirelessly in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. So far there is not been any announcement from the State government for our genuine demands,” he said. A staff nurse working in a government hospital said that she was receiving Rs. 10,000, while her counterpart, who is a permanent employee, was being paid Rs. 33,000 per month. “How can we run our families with such paltry salaries,” she asked.

04 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Abduction of beggar’s child sets off fresh probe into trafficking racket||The abduction of a beggar’s three-year-old daughter in Nanjangud earlier this week, about four years after her elder son was similarly kidnapped from the pavement near the Srikanteshwara Temple, has set the police on the path of a fresh investigation into a possible case of child trafficking. The investigation into the abduction of Parvathi’s eight-month-old son in April 2016 had helped the police uncover a well-organised child trafficking racket, which also involved the sale of newborns from two private maternity hospitals in Mysuru to childless couples. Unidentified man In her complaint to the Nanjangud police, Ms. Parvathi said she was approached by an unidentified man on Thursday asking to give her daughter away to a childless couple. Minutes after she reproached the stranger, she found her daughter missing. She lodged a complaint after she was unable to locate her. Refusing to rule out the involvement of child traffickers in the abduction, the Nanjangud police’s investigation also involves looking for the whereabouts of the accused involved in the 2016 case in which a chargesheet had been filed and trial is under way. The trial has not been continuing in view of the impact of COVID-19 on the courts. A special team has been formed to check the whereabouts of the accused, said Deputy Superintendent of Nanjangud police Prabhakar Rao Shinde. According to preliminary investigation, the unidentified man was brought to the complainant by a local tea seller. “We have not arrested anybody, but are questioning the suspects and checking the CCTV footage,” he said. Previous case Meanwhile, Ms. Parvathi’s elder son, who had been kidnapped in 2016, had been rescued along with 15 other trafficked children. Most of the other trafficked children had been sold from the maternity hospitals in Mysuru where unwed mothers had been brought for delivery. Mysuru District Child Protection Officer S. Diwakar said the elder son of Ms. Parvathi was now in their custody in a children’s home. Though a DNA test had proved that Ms. Parvathi was his biological mother, he was not handed over to her as she was unable to convince the authorities that she would be able to provide food and shelter to him. The Women and Child Welfare authorities had asked Ms. Parvathi to even entrust to the authorities her daughter, who is suspected to have been kidnapped on Thursday. “Such children are vulnerable to abduction and trafficking,” Mr. Diwakar said. Even though the trafficked children and the caregivers to whom they had been sold had developed a bond, the law did not recognise the same as the children had not been adopted in the legal manner.      Some have been adopted   After an elaborate rescue of the trafficked children, two were handed back to their biological mothers while six others were given in legal adoption to childless couples who were registered for adoption as per the guidelines of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), functioning under the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development. Caregivers managed to secure the custody of three children through court orders while the others who had not been put up for adoption remain in different children’s homes in view of the visitation rights the caregivers had secured through courts.  Such children are vulnerable to abduction and trafficking S.

04 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Crowdfunding launched to shore up school infrastructure||A crowdfunding campaign to shore up infrastructure in government schools of rural Karnataka has been drawing good response if the initial response to the concept is any indication. The Happy School programme not only aims to upgrade the existing infrastructure and co-scholastic facilities in government schools, but also aims to make them a secure and attractive learning place for students and teachers. A. Suresh of Rotary Bengaluru Junction, who is backing the initiative, said the concept envisages providing handwash stations, water purification systems, and e-learning kits to the schools to help provide better education to children. The cost to equip one school has been pegged at Rs. 70,000 and the campaign launched through the crowdfunding platform “fuel a dream”, has raised Rs. 9.5 lakh within a few days. The immediate goal is to raise Rs. 15 lakh which will help cover about 20 schools each with about 300 students and is expected to impact over 6,000 students, Mr. Suresh added. With the amount raised so far, at least nine schools and nearly 2,300 students stand to benefit. The e-learning kit includes a 43-inch smart TV with in-built android, WiFi etc., and this will be loaded with contents for coaching students as per the syllabus prescribed by the State government in the local language, and all subjects are covered. The first such facility was inaugurated recently at Doddaballapur where a new school building was constructed by L&T. The campaigners aver the timing is perfect as once the schools reopen, students can return to a better environment. The long-term plan is to equip at least 100 government schools with better infrastructure, library, clean toilets, playarea, and greenery in the campus, according to the fundraisers.  The concept envisages providing handwash stations, water purification systems, and e-learning kits to schools to help provide better education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/crowdfunding-launched-to-shore-up-school-infrastructure/article32763788.ece
04 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Former VC on AIIMS advisory body||Former Vice-Chancellor and scientist K.S. Rangappa has been nominated to the top advisory body of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has chosen him as a member of AIIMS PGIMER in Chandigarh and AIIMS in Bhubaneswar, Bathinda, Guwahati and Srinagar. Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Prof. Rangappa said the nomination for a period of five years had been made in recognition of his contribution to the field of biological sciences and development of science in the country. “Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has appreciated my research work and publications, particularly on cancer drug research, in various journals and my work as the chairman of the Indian Science Congress. The AIIMS is a prestigious central institution and I have been nominated to offer my opinion on research and other areas of science,” he said. The former V-C of University of Mysore said he has been selected as CSIR-Emeritus Scientist (ES) by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi. “The CSIR-ES scheme was launched to recognise and encourage meritorious scientists who are above the age of 62. I believe it’s an honour for the University of Mysore to have a CSIR-Emeritus Scientist on its campus.” COVID-19 vaccine race On the COVID-19 vaccine race, Prof. Rangappa, who is into cancer research, said several vaccine candidates are in various clinical evaluation stages and some are undergoing clinical trials in India, China and Europe. Usually, a vaccine takes at least two years to be available considering the evaluation processes involved in its development. In the case of COVID-19, which is spreading rapidly with a high transmission rate, many top-rated universities and research institutions have expedited their vaccine development and some are said to be close to achieving a breakthrough, the scientist explained. A time-frame for availability of the vaccine cannot be fixed as it has to go through various trials before it is made available, he said, adding that the vaccine development has not been slowed down as seeming as researchers are moving thoughtfully to ensure no side-effects of the vaccine are felt on normal human health. On cancer research with China About his research collaboration with China, the former VC said he had entered into an understanding with a Chinese University which wanted to conduct clinical trials on six of his patents pertaining to cancer research. The mega research project had been kept in abeyance after the COVID-19 outbreak despite more than 10 video conference sessions between scientists from India and China on the project so far. “The project has not taken off yet. It is in a deferment mode.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/former-vc-on-aiims-advisory-body/article32763929.ece

The police booked 43,141 cases of traffic violations between September 13 and 19, and collected Rs. 2.14 crore. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said that physical checks of vehicles have for the most part been stopped because of the risk it poses to traffic personnel. “During the lockdown, there was less vehicle movement and so the traffic police have relaxed the checks across the city, while focussing on other pandemic-related duties. However, we have seen an increase in vehicles on the roads this month, and as a result violations are also on the rise,” he said. Riding without a helmet remains the most violated rule. As per data from the traffic department, 29,590 of the 43,141 cases booked between September 13 and 19 was for helmetless riding. The following week (September 20-26), around 29,925 cases were booked for the same offence. “This is also because Bengaluru has one of the highest number of two wheelers when compared to other cities,” said a traffic official. The police have also recorded a rise in signal jumping and riding in the wrong direction on a one-way road. “This means that it is mandatory for us to be deployed at main junctions as motorists lack traffic sense and road discipline,” said another officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-235-crore-in-fines-in-one-week/article32764177.ece

Govindraj, chief accounts officer, for alleged dereliction of duty and violation of rules in paying bills to contractors. The office of the chief accounts officer has been sealed and an inquiry has been ordered. The BBMP Contractors’ Association had complained to authorities saying that Govindraj was violating rules and not prioritising those who had completed the works while paying their bills. According to sources, the officer had cleared bills of crores of rupees without bringing them to the notice of the special commissioner (finance) and the commissioner. “Such transactions regarding payment of bills should be made through IFMS software to only those contractors who have completed the work. But the officer directly paid it offline,” said a senior civic official. Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said, “Based on primary inspection, it has been found that the officer violated various rules. We have immediately repatriated him to his parent agency. We are investigating the matter and based on the report, we will take further action,” He added that from September 1 to 15, around Rs. 7.6 crore was paid under commissioner category without even bringing it to the notice of the commissioner.

04 October 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||MCI says ‘no’ to medical college||The Medical Council of India (MCI) has denied permission to Government Medical College, Idukki, to admit students citing lack of infrastructure and other facilities as mandated by the MCI at its last hearing on September 25. This has a far-reaching effect as the MCI has been replaced by the National Medical Commission (NMC) with new guidelines for giving permission to medical colleges. In a letter to the medical college, R.K Vats, Secretary General, MCI, Board of Governors, says seven deficiencies have been found at the college and the attached hospital, including in faculty, bed occupancy, residents, clinical lab, and radiological investigation. It says there is no approach road to the hospital and an old district hospital building is being used for the medical college and para-clinical and clinical departments are under construction. An official at the medical college told The Hindu that permission had been denied without considering the facilities completed there. “It is without considering the arrangements made since June and all deficiencies found in last year’s verification have been rectified.” He said there was an approach road now and all criteria had been currently fulfilled. However, it was not considered at the last hearing. Due to COVID-19, there was no physical verification by the MCI and the medical college had lost the last chance to admit students in the current academic year. The medical college was established in 2014 with an intake of 50 students. However, the college had not admitted new batches after the first and second year MBBS students were shifted to other medical colleges after the MCI denied permission in 2017 due to ‘lack of clinical facilities’. The medical college was started at the district hospital building near the district headquarters at Cheruthoni with minimal facilities in 2014. The district is dependent on Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, and Medical College Hospital at Theni in Tamil Nadu for emergency and specialised treatment. The Chief Secretary had given an undertaking to the MCI last year that all facilities would be arranged prior to admitting students in the current academic year. Infrastructure and clinical facilities were being upgraded from June to admit students in the current academic year.  An official says permission denied without considering the facilities completed at the college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mci-says-no-to-medical-college/article32763919.ece

Dinesan was inconclusive on Friday. A series of landslips had occurred on the stretch since the road widening works began as part of the national highway in 2017. It is alleged that unscientific road works caused landslips leading to large-scale damage to road and agriculture land on the slope of the hilly stretch. The Devikulam Subcollector had given a report that the road-widening works had been taken up without soil analysis and ecological impact assessment and large-scale blasting might have caused irreversible ecological damage. An official, who attended the meeting, said the amount of compensation offered by the contractor to farmers who suffered losses was not acceptable to the latter. Power Minister M.M. Mani, road contractor, NH officials, Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan, Dean Kuriakose MP, Devikulam MLA S. Rajendran, and affected farmers attended the meeting held online. Issue of compensation At the meeting, the contractor offered Rs. 2 lakh per acre as compensation to the affected farmers. But the farmers sought Rs. 10 lakh per acre as compensation. The MP and the Devikulam MLA will conduct a direct meeting to decide on the compensation amount, the official said. The District Collector will submit a report to the government on the condition of the Gap Road stretch and the damage due to the landslips. It will be based on the report submitted by the Devikulam Subcollector, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gap-road-widening-may-be-delayed/article32763894.ece

04 October 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Meppadi to have fully automated water distribution system||Meppadi grama panchayat in Wayanad district is gearing up to establish a fully automated public water distribution system. The project is being executed with technical support from Asian Soft MC Grade InfoTech Private Limited, a Mangaluru-based software firm. The panchayat has been supplying drinking water to around 600 beneficiaries from a perennial source on a nearby hill using gravitational force, said K.K. Sahad, president, Meppadi grama panchayat. “However, we have been incurring huge financial loss every month owing to water leakage, recurring maintenance coast, over-usage of water due to dearth of proper a measuring system. Incidentally, the firm approached us with their innovative technology called ‘Digital Water Supply’,” he added. Digital Water Supply was developed by the firm to address shortcomings in the public water supply system and to save water in this era of increasing water scarcity, said Mohammed Munazil, managing director, Asian Soft MC Grade InfoTech. He said the system helped in accurate assessment of leakage, overuse, delivery time, availability of operator, and inappropriate billing. Through the web application, users will be able to change the existing drinking water scheme to a fully automated system and request water on demand as well as disconnect if they do not need water for a few days. The system is designed in such a way that the service provider can collect water tax both online and offline, and the provider can block connections after a certain period of time if anyone fails to pay tax. Bill collection can be streamlined, making drinking water supply profitable. The project will be completed at a cost of Rs. 58 lakh in six months, and one year free maintenance service will be offered by the firm, Mr. Sahad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/meppadi-to-have-fully-automated-water-distribution-system/article32763819.ece

04 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic diversion at Palarivattom from today||Traffic on Civil Line Road that links Ernakulam with Kakkanad will be diverted through a pair of U-turns on either side of the Palarivattom flyover from Sunday morning, as part of safety measures being introduced while reconstructing the damaged parts of the structure. Simultaneously, the area beneath the flyover’s central span, which was being used by vehicles, will be closed using barricades. This is to ensure safety of motorists when the deck, girders, and pier caps of the structure are dismantled and rebuilt, the traffic police said. Vehicles from the city proceeding to Kakkanad will have to turn left from the Palarivattom NH Bypass Junction and take the first U-turn to cross the junction. Similarly, vehicles from Kakkanad proceeding to the city must turn left from the junction and use the first U-turn to proceed further, the traffic police said in a press release. Aimed at avoiding congestion at Palarivattom, light vehicles coming to the city from Kalamassery could avoid the junction by opting for the Seaport-Airport Road-Eachamukku-Palachuvadu-Vennala-Puthiya Road-NH Bypass stretch. Vehicles from Edappally can use the Edappally-Thripunithura Road, which runs parallel to the NH Bypass, to reach their destinations, the police said. They added that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), the stakeholders engaged in reconstructing the flyover, would have to repair potholes on alternative roads used by motorists, in case the PWD and the Kochi Corporation did not repair them. This will be crucial, since several portions of Puthiya Road are pothole-ridden. A major bottleneck on the Seaport-Airport Road-Vennala stretch will be Vennala Junction, which is even otherwise bottlenecked due to extremely narrow bellmouths on its northern and southern sides. Residents associations and others have been demanding a total ban on parking in the vicinity of the flyover and on service roads of the NH Bypass nearby, to ensure safe and streamlined flow of vehicles when the flyover is rebuilt. More portions will be barricaded and tall nets erected when concrete cutting extends to more areas atop the flyover, to safeguard against debris and dust falling on motorists and pedestrians. Water, used while cutting, too may fall on them if barricades are not in place, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-diversion-at-palarivattom-from-today/article32764263.ece
04 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Penalty breather likely for corpn. and five municipalities||The Kochi Corporation and Kalamassery, Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara and Thripunithura municipalities may be relieved from paying up the total environment compensation of Rs. 25.4 crore for their failure to comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, at the solid waste processing plant in Brahmapuram. Instead, the environment compensation will be assessed for non-compliance from April this year onwards based on the population in each local body as suggested in an order dated July 3, 2020 by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The compensation of Rs. 13.31 crore assessed by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board for the Kochi Corporation was for a duration of 618 days starting from November 22, 2018 to July 31, 2020. The corresponding figures of Rs. 2.77 crore for Kalamassery, Rs. 1.72 crore for Aluva, Rs. 1.96 crore for Angamaly, Rs. 2.92 crore for Thrikkakara, and Rs. 2.72 crore for Thripunithura were arrived at based on the environment compensation for 480 days from April 9, 2019 to July 31, 2020. A meeting convened by the Chief Secretary in Thiruvananthapuram on September 22 to discuss the follow-up action to be taken on the basis of the tribunal’s directives recommended that the compensation might be assessed based on the population criteria specified in the NGT’s order on July 3 and it might be deducted directly by the Finance Department from the account of the local bodies. The Kochi Corporation will have to pay Rs. 5 lakh per month from April onwards as per the formula while the five municipalities will have to pay 1 lakh only per month as environment compensation. The corporation’s assessment will be Rs. 25 lakh for non-compliance from April 1 to September 30 while it will be Rs. 5 lakh each for the five municipalities. The continuing lack of clarity in estimating environment compensation for erring local bodies violating provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, saved them from paying up higher penalty. On the Brahmapuram case, the Local Self-Government Department pointed out that it was advisable to go with the compensation regime fixed by the National Green Tribunal instead of the assessment procedure evolved by the Central Pollution Control Board. There was no definite provision for calculating the compensation and it could be challenged in legal forums by local bodies, whereas the compensation directed by the tribunal would be binding, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/penalty-breather-likely-for-corpn-and-five-municipalities/article32764267.ece

The auction broke the crop calendar and was in violation of the COVID-19 lockdown, said the district administration on a complaint by Chanthu Manjadiparambil, a pokkali farmer. Pokkali fields are cultivated in a fish-and-rice cycle in which rice is cultivated between May 15 and November 15, tapping the summer sun for field preparations and monsoon rain for the growth of paddy saplings. However, sowing was done only in less than four acres of the 260 cultivable acres in Maruvakkad this season because of the delay in field preparations, which should have begun in the middle of May, said Francis Kalathungal of Pokkali Samrkashana Samiti. There are 420 acres of pokkali fields in the Mavuvakkad collective. The shrimp culture lobby had been trying to sabotage rice cultivation, he alleged. “Only less than 10 acres of the pokkali fields have been brought under sowing over the past decade,” he added. The rice season in 2020 was lost because the fields could not be drained from April 15 as the fish culture prolonged.

Named so for his ability to stealthily break into homes and pull of thefts without even waking the occupants, Suresh aka Dracula Suresh, fled the police custody on Saturday, which, incidentally, was his third in the past ten days since his arrest on September 22. After testing positive for SARS-COV-2, the accused, known for violent behaviour when the police close in for capture, was moved into the psychiatric cell at the Government Medical College, Kalamasserry, on September 30. On Saturday, around 10.30 a.m., he managed to escape through a crack on the overhead roof, and like the families in the houses he target, police guards outside had no clue whatsoever. Dracula’s hide-and-seek with cops started on the night of September 23 when he was first nabbed and brought to the jail department’s detention centre at Karukutty where the accused are temporarily put up till their COVID test results are available before being sent to prison. Those testing positive are sent to the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at the convention centre of the Kochi airport. He fled using the cover of night the moment his handcuffs were unfastened. Though Dracula drew first blood, cops managed a strong comeback by arresting him within 24 hours from a house at Vengola near Perumbavoor. No sooner than cops locked him up in the same detention centre and heaved a sigh of relief on September 24, Dracula returned the favour by escaping within 24 hours, this time with a co-accused. He ended up in police custody the very next day while attempting a break-in. Only this time, it took him a week to leave cops with egg on their face yet again. He had 20-odd cases against his name, including two registered by the Angamaly police for recent escapes from the custody. Lack of facility Already, exasperated policemen bemoan the lack of a dedicated facility for keeping the ones testing positive among the arrested. The FLTC at Kochi airport has far too many exits for the liking of the police who have to keep an eye on the accused from afar owing to the pandemic protocol. “The Aluva jail was vacated and all the inmates were moved to Mattancherry and Kakkanad jails to turn the former into an exclusive facility for accused testing positive. But till day not a single positive case has been admitted there,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam rural) of the Kerala Police Association. In the meantime, cops have launched yet another hunt for Dracula, who is having the last laugh, at least for the time being.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dracula-gives-cops-nightmares/article32764268.ece

Work on geotube bags as temporary sea walls has been an utter failure,” said a spokesman for Paschima Kochi Theera Samrakshana Samiti on Saturday after the Chief Minister unveiled a Rs. 200-crore programme for coastal protection.

District Collector S. Suhas made this public in a post on his official Facebook page that also carried a picture of the event. The image showed the purported winner of the pageant being kissed on both cheeks by two other participants, who probably emerged runners-up. “At a time when the pandemic is raging, close interactions as shown in the image and violation of COVID protocol were improper. The message conveyed by such images could detrimentally affect the general alertness of society,” the post read. K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) said details of the event were being collected to verify whether there was any violation of physical distancing norms and the COVID-19 protocol. The event was organised by a private company on September 30. “The picture was captured just a moment towards the end of a two-hour-long event.

Surveillance was intensified in all containment zones under the supervision of newly constituted Quick Response Teams. The Collector’s order banned all types of social gatherings and public assembly of more than five persons till October 31.

04 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Call to exclude inhabited villages from buffer zones||Grama panchayats sharing borders with the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary have decided to pass separate resolutions urging the Union government to exclude inhabited villages from the proposed buffer zones. The Kozhikode District Panchayat and the Kattippara grama panchayat have already made the call through their resolutions. Leaders of Karshaka Raksha Samiti, a coordination committee of farmers in the proposed buffer zones, said Chakkittappara, Koorachundu, Panangad and Puthuppadi panchayats would pass their resolutions soon in support of the farmers’ cause. Such resolutions will be crucial in registering the position of various local bodies on the issue, they added. A samiti coordinator said the Forest Department’s assessment of the existing geographical area of the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary was inaccurate in the absence of solid geospatial data. “If we go by their data, there are around 250 families still staying within the sanctuary. Chakkittappara panchayat will be the worst-hit if the proposed draft notification is implemented as such,” he added. Samiti leaders also took strong exception to the “finding” of the Forest Department that there were no inhabited areas in Kattippara panchayat which was included in the proposed buffer zones. The finding was based on inaccurate geospatial data with no clear markings of the geographical coordinates, they claimed. A number of other farmers’ organisations too have stepped in with similar claims about the department’s “unscientific” calculation of the sanctuary borders. According to them, the flaws in the marking of boundaries will again drag rural farmers into crisis with the final notification on ecologically sensitive areas. To convince the Union government of the farmers’ apprehensions, some leading farmers’ action councils are also planning to send their leaders to hold talks with Union Ministers. They are now in touch with a few senior BJP leaders to finalise appointments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-exclude-inhabited-villages-from-buffer-zones/article32763812.ece

04 October 2020||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Defiant tribespeople begin roadwork||The tribespeople of Alli Moopan hamlet at Thekkady in Nemmara forest division have begun constructing a road through the jungle, challenging the resistance posed by the Forest officials. The tribespeople began the work on Gandhi Jayanti day after their decades-long demand fell on deaf ears. Marooned in Parambikulam Tiger Reserve in the Muthalamada village of Palakkad district, the people of Thekkady cannot reach their village office at Muthalamada without entering Tamil Nadu. They travel nearly 60 km from Parambikulam via Tamil Nadu to reach Muthalamada for any civic-related matters. A road through the forest will reduce the distance drastically. “We have been demanding this road for ages. But no one cared. With the forest road, the distance to Muthalamada will only be 6 kilometres,” said tribal youngster Muthu. T.N. denies permission The six-kilometre stretch from Thekkady to Chemmanampathy will resolve the long-pending issue faced by the tribespeople living at Parambikulam. The COVID-19 lockdown had caused hardships to them as Tamil Nadu refused to give permission for their travel. “To go to our panchayat office to get a certificate or to pay tax, we have to get the permission of Tamil Nadu. We are forced to construct a road on our own,” said tribal leader Chandran. He said the tribespeople were protecting the forest from encroachers. “But for us, thieves would have plundered this woods,” he said. They said successive governments and the people’s representatives had made tall promises about the road, but no one pursued it in earnest. “We chose Gandhi Jayanti day for this noble act as Mahatma had earned India freedom. Although India got freedom 73 years ago, the people of Thekkady are still in bondage,” said Chandran. Case filed The tribespeople carried the photos of Mahatma Gandhi while constructing the road. Although the authorities tried to dissuade the people from “illegally constructing the road”, the tribespeople did not withdraw.

04 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Schools’ reopening unlikely soon||Schools in the State will open when the conditions are conducive, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was speaking after inaugurating through videoconference 90 schools transformed as centres of excellence as part of the Mikavinte Kendram project on Saturday. Mr. Vijayan said COVID-19 was not here to stay forever. The focus was on containing its spread. When the situation returned to normal, schools would reopen. Online classes were progressing well and the loss of an academic year had been averted. He said the aim of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission was to transform schools into centres of excellence. This had been made possible to a large extent with concerted efforts of people’s representatives, local self-government institutions, parent-teacher associations, former students, and individuals. However, any reluctance from any quarters to support these efforts should be set aside for public good. If this were to happen, schools would be assured of fund inflow much greater than what the government would be able to sanction. The people should also pay close attention to schools and their development. The changes brought in as part of the mission were aimed at the future generations. There was still much to be done for improvement of the public education sector. Changes should continue in tune with changing times. Any detractors should keep in mind that from a situation where schools were on the verge of closure five lakh new students had entered public schools in the past three years, Mr. Vijayan said. Of the 90 school buildings inaugurated, two each were in Pathanamthitta and Kasaragod, three each in Kottayam and Ernakulam, four in Wayanad, five in Idukki, six each in Kollam and Palakkad, seven in Kozhikode, nine in Malappuram, 10 each in Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha, 11 in Thrissur, and 12 in Kannur, Mr. Vijayan said. Four school buildings were built using Rs. 5 crore from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), 20 using Rs. 3 crore again from KIIFB, 62 buildings using Plan fund, and four using NABARD funds. Stone laid The Chief Minister also laid the foundation stone for 54 schools in 10 districts through videoconference. Two of these will come up in Ernakulam, three each in Kollam, Kottayam, Palakkad and Kasaragod, four in Pathanamthitta, seven in Malappuram, nine in Kozhikode, and 17 in Wayanad.

04 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Officials attribute sloth bear ‘visit’ to lockdown lull||The lack of human activity during the recent lockdown could have led the sloth bear that was captured near Varkala a day ago to stray close to human habitations, according to forest officials. The preliminary assessment came shortly after the Forest Department released the animal in the interior forests of Pulikayam in the Kanayar forest range that is part of the Achencoil forest division. Caught in trap cage Around three months after it was first sighted at Kulathupuzha in Kollam, the female bear, assessed to be around eight years old, was finally captured in a trap cage after it wandered in a rubber plantation at Palavacode, near Pallickal, early Friday. The wild animal had created panic in places close to the Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam border including Chathannur, Navaikulam, and Pallickal. Following its capture, the animal that figures in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 was examined and steps were initiated for its release into its natural habitat. On the reasons for the unusual occurrence, the department held the view that it could be closely linked to the near-total fall in human interference, especially in the forest fringe areas, of late. The lack of vehicle movement on forest roads had earlier been attributed to the sightings of an Indian civet in Kozhikode district and elephant and bison herds in Munnar. Another in Punalur According to Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar, the presence of human beings generally deters wild animals from venturing close to human habitations. In this case, the sloth bear could have strayed too far away from the forest primarily with people largely staying indoors and vehicle flow restricted during the lockdown. Another bear was recently found around 10 km away from the forest in Punalur, he said. While dismissing claims that the animal could have wandered in search of food, the officer pointed out that the unregulated tapping of wild honey could, however, pose a problem in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/straying-sloth-bear-captured-at-varkala/article32763897.ece
04 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Not much to cheer on Elephant Day||The State is set to mark Gaja Dinam (Elephant Day) on Sunday in muted observance amid concerns over the well-being of captive elephants in the aftermath of the COVID-19-lockdown. The occasion also comes against the backdrop of a steady fall in the State’s captive elephant population from 521 (during a census in 2018) to 484 now. The last death was reported late Friday when 75-year-old Maniyan, one of the senior-most elephants in the State, died in a State-run facility at Konni after losing a protracted battle with difficulties arising due to constipation. Besides old age, the worrying number of deaths is largely attributed to their unscientific management. The recent lockdown has had a cascading effect on the pachyderms with low economic activity, partly fuelled by the COVID-19-induced curbs on festivals, taking a toll on the welfare of captive elephants. Elephant owners have claimed hardships in ensuring their maintenance under the circumstances. Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar says elephant owners cared less for the pachyderms as these animals could not earn them income during the lockdown. The scenario began to affect their health. While the Forest Department ensured that elephant owners largely complied with the norms relating to elephant shelters, several issues persisted in their management, he adds. Kerala Elephant Owners Federation general secretary P. Sasikumar says the extended lockdown, when several festivals including the famed Thrissur Pooram were held as low-key affairs, burned a deep hole in their pockets. Expenses rise “While the restrictions were necessary to contain the pandemic, the situation has created immense difficulty in maintaining elephants. It costs an average of around Rs. 5000 a day. We hope normalcy would be restored during the next peak festival season to tide over the crisis,” he says. P.S. Easa, former director, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), points out that the stagnant lifestyle of most captive elephants in the State under the current circumstances could lead to both physiological and mental ailments. The dwindling income is also bound to affect the manpower that cares for the elephants, he says. The elephant expert rues the State’s failure to establish the Kerala State Elephant Welfare Board that was actively considered by the previous United Democratic Front government to cushion in the fallout of similar economic slumps and exigencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/not-much-to-cheer-on-elephant-day/article32763914.ece

The accused were identified as Subu, 43, of Palayamkunnu in Varkala; Jasmeerkhan, 36, of Karakulam; and Sreejith, 30, of Pazhakutty in Nedumangad. While Subu is a doctor at the Dental department of the MCH, Jasmeerkhan used to act in television serials. They were caught by a team led by Fort Assistant Commissioner Prathapan Nair and station house officer Rakesh. Attempt to islead They have been arrested for allegedly maligning a woman from Varkala, who is also a relative of Subu. In a bid to create differences between the victim and her husband, the gang morphed her images and sent them to her husband, sister, and relatives on a social networking application. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint submitted by the victim’s sister who hails from Manacaud. Notably, Subu had accompanied the complainant to the police station to mislead the investigators. Sreejith, who runs a photocopy shop, allegedly bought a SIM card using the identification documents of a Vattappara native. The SIM card was then used to circulate the morphed images in a bid to evade detection, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/3-including-mch-doctor-held-for-circulating-morphed-images/article32764396.ece
04 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Prohibitory orders take effect in capital||Bolstering efforts to contain the pandemic, prohibitory orders came into effect in the capital district on Saturday. The district administration focussed on sensitising the public on the first day of the curbs on Saturday. The City police initiated legal action against the doctors of the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, who agitated against the government’s decision to suspend a doctor and two nurses for alleged negligence in tending to a patient. Around 50 identifiable doctors have been charged by the Medical College police under charges pertaining to unlawful assembly and violation of the prohibitory orders clamped under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Resembling scenes reminiscent of the total lockdown, the district witnessed a sizeable police deployment in various parts of the district. Police personnel were stationed at shopping areas and major junctions. The district administration had a day ago chalked out specific plans for the Thiruvananthapuram City and Rural police districts to focus on areas that usually witnessed heavy rush.  Clear directions Referring to the confusion over the prohibitory orders, District Collector Navjot Khosa told the media that clearly defined directions had been laid down for the containment and non-containment zones. While tight restrictions have come into effect in containment zones, heightened alert also prevailed in other areas mainly owing to the failure in ensuring social distancing. While public life will not be affected by way of the restrictions, unnecessary crowding will not be permitted. Gathering of over five people will not be permitted in public places, but the norm shall not apply inside commercial outlets and offices. Up to 20 people will be allowed inside shops depending on the area, Dr. Khosa said. She added that Gazetted officers will be designated as executive magistrates in various places as part of enforcing the restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/prohibitory-orders-take-effect-in-capital/article32764395.ece

Ms. Rajan, belonging to the SC community, suspended the protest, albeit temporarily, after SC Development Department Deputy Director Joseph John met her at the protest venue in the presence of Aluva MLA Anwar Sadat on Friday evening. The child had died on the night of August 2 even though he was rushed to three hospitals — Aluva Taluk Hospital, Ernakulam General Hospital, and Alapuzha Medical College — during the course of the day. Ms. Rajan started her indefinite dawn-to-dusk strike in front of the Aluva Taluk Hospital citing lack of faith in the forensic report, which attributed the death to an acute asthmatic condition called status asthmaticus and not to the swallowed coins. Forensic experts had also cited the child’s history of pneumonia, though Ms. Rajan claimed that it was a long time ago, and that at the time of the death, the child was healthy. “I will resume my protest, if need be, and in the meantime, I will launch a legal fight for justice. It is now two months since my baby’s death, and I want an independent medical board to find the truth behind it,” said Ms. Rajan. She is about to file a writ petition in the High Court next week. Her lawyer Sunil C. Kuttappan has applied for relevant documents, including forensic and post-mortem reports, from the Revenue Divisional Officer, Fort Kochi. “The writ will challenge the post-mortem report and pray for an independent medical board while pointing out many slip-ups in offering timely health care,” said Mr. Kuttappan. Legal expenses The SC Development Department has offered to bear the legal expenses if Ms. Rajan is unsatisfied with the findings of the medical board formed by the Health Department.

Led by ACB Tirupati Deputy Superintendent of Police V. Allabaksh, six teams arrived here on Saturday and are searching the houses of Manoj Kumar, his wife, his driver Nagalingam, his workplace (treasury office), and the house of a friend Nagarjuna. A sixth ACB team is taking the custody of all materials seized by the Anantapur district police and stored at Bukkarayasamudram. Disproportionate assets The police had unearthed gold, silver, cash promissory notes, investment bonds, four-wheelers and two-wheelers, all amounting to more than Rs. 2.8 crore, allegedly belonging to Manoj Kumar, who works as a senior auditor in the government treasury in Anantapur. Six boxes containing Rs. 15.55 lakh in cash, 2.42 kg of gold ornaments, three 9-mm gas pistols, one air gun, 18 blank rounds, 84.10 kgs of silver articles, bank deposit papers worth Rs. 49.10 lakh, promissory notes worth Rs. 27.05 lakh had been handed over to the ACB. Two SUVs, seven two-wheelers, including three Enfield and one Harley Davidson bikes, and four tractors were also seized from Manoj Kumar.

04 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cases on the rise in Chittoor again||For a brief while, it seemed that the coronavirus spread had slowed down in the district, but the last week’s numbers have renewed fear in the people, crushing their hopes in the bud. As per official figures, the daily average of cases remains at 800 plus, with the tally moving towards the 68,000-mark, while the deaths have crossed the 650-mark as on Saturday. The urban areas of Tirupati and Chittoor municipal corporations hold the lion’s share of the daily cases, followed by Srikalahasti and Madanapalle municipalities. The rural side of Chittoor district, which had made news for controlling the spread, has registered over 500 cases during the last 24 hours. The COVID task force personnel attribute the phenomenon to the “lack of cooperation” from people in both urban and rural areas. On a sidenote, the consumption of the sanitizers at the commercial outlets and at the domestic front has also come down drastically, a medical officer in Chittoor said. Rural areas The resumption of passenger traffic between Chittoor district and the neighbouring States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is also viewed as one of the contributing factors in the recurrence of cases in the border areas. The tri-State Kuppam division, which used to record single digit cases till last month, is now witnessing a rise in cases with increasing movement of public at the border villages. Madanapalle municipal limits, where the public movement towards Karnataka, particularly towards Bengaluru, Chikmagalur and Kolar has seen a spike, are witnessing close to one hundred cases daily. The villages of Puttur, Nagari, Varadaiahpalem, Nagalapuram and Satyavedu mandals at the eastern side bordering with Tamil Nadu have also been steadily registering double digit figure for a couple of weeks, causing concern to the officials. High death rate explained District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M. Penchalaiah told The Hindu that the incidence of virus cases “are neither coming down, nor going up.” “The high death rate in Chittoor district is mostly due to the fact that, unlike other districts in the State, we also include those cases to the list wherein the persons are brought dead to the hospital. When such a case comes, we first take swab samples to know if they had been infected,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cases-on-the-rise-in-chittoor-again/article32764310.ece
04 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vegetable prices take flight early in Chittoor||Generally vegetable prices shoot up from mid-October ahead of the Deepavali festive season, followed by Karthika and Dhanur months, coupled with the Sabarimala season. This year it has happened quite early in Chittoor district in spite of its substantial contribution to vegetable cultivation in the western mandals. The rise in prices is attributed to a sudden slump in production due to the heavy rains since July. The prices of beans, brinjal, ladies’ fingers, radish and several gourds have nearly doubled in a week. Onions at Rs. 60 a kg seem to be reviving the last year’s bitter experience for consumers, while tomato at Rs. 25 a kg is proving tough on many. The size and quality of onions in the markets is unsatisfactory despite the sudden jump in the price. The arrival of onion stocks from the production belt in Maharashtra has been hindered by heavy rains. The same is the case with regard to the Kurnool variety, which is said to have suffered rain damage too. Eggs in demand Meanwhile, the demand for eggs and chicken has been rising. There seems to be a general feeling among the average consumer that instead of buying half a kg of vegetables, it is better to go for a quarter of a kg of chicken and get benefited with its protein value. “A dozen eggs hardly cost Rs. 60 even when in high demand whereas the regular vegetables are selling double their prices, making the former a better choice,” says Dhana Lakshmi, a homemaker from Santhapeta locality here. The prices of chilli and ginger have also seen a steep hike in recent weeks as their yield suffered due to rains in the respective production belts. Prabhakar, a vegetable trader from Palamaner, expects the trend to continue till January as another spell of heavy rain is likely during the northeast monsoon in winter months. “However, the likely lean Sabarimala pilgrimage season owing to COVID-19 threat could bring some relief in prices from next month,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vegetable-prices-take-flight-early-in-chittoor/article32764312.ece

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has recently notified that vehicle drivers would now be able to present digital/electronic copies of their vehicle documents, including driving licence and registration certificate, thanks to a plea by Member of Parliament, Narsaraopet, Lavu Srikrishnadevarayulu. The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019 has brought in several new changes, but also has put in place hefty fines for violators. In 2019, the MP wrote to Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari suggesting digitisation of vehicle documents after recognising the plight of students and young vehicle drivers who were regularly stopped and harassed by traffic police. Drivers not carrying physical copies of valid documents had to pay up hefty fines or wait for a family member to fetch the physical copy. Now if the electronic versions of the documents presented to the officials are validated, there is no need to produce physical documents. “I welcome digitisation of driving documents as it will ease compliance for lakhs of drivers. This incident goes to show the power of youth coming together and approaching responsible public representatives to bring about positive developments,” said Mr. Krishnadevarayulu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/digital-proof-of-driving-licence-valid-from-now/article32763636.ece
04 October 2020||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Parents prefer online classes to reopening of schools in Vizag||Not many students of Classes IX and X are attending schools for clarifying their doubts due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation. In the first week, the schools saw poor attendance in the district. With the government encouraging online mode of classes, parents are reluctant to send their children to schools. They are favouring online classes as of now. Parents say that schools should not be reopened on November 2 as announced by the State government and the date should be postponed by a month at least. Parents cite transportation issues, fear of children gathering in groups and the spread of the coronavirus, as some of the reasons. “The COVID-19 cases have slightly come down in the district, but they have not yet come under control. So it is better to continue with the online classes for two more months. It may not be possible for the children to stay all the time with masks and not forming groups to discuss something,” said N. Ramesh, a parent from the city. K. Harika, a Class X student from the city, said that she had gone to the school on second and third day and got her doubts clarified. “Transportation is the issue and my parents do not allow me to board RTC buses or auto-rickshaws,” she said. “The classroom was completely sanitised. Physical distancing was maintained with one person allowed to sit in a bench,” she said. Harika’s mother Sailaja said that the school authorities have not forced them to send her daughter. Some schools have collected opinions from parents whether to hold classes for doubts. “I gave my nod to send my son studying Class X to school. It needs special attention to get doubts cleared and it is not possible online. We are taking all precautions. However, out of around 200 parents, only 33 are favourable to send their children to school. So the idea of conducting classes for doubts’ clarification is dropped as of now,” said Ravi Kumar, a parent from Seethammadhara. Meanwhile, several child activists accuse schools of not following safety norms on the campus properly. “We had conducted random checks in some schools in the city and found that washrooms are not properly maintained. Moreover some schools are forcing students to stay from 10 a.m. to 4.45 p.m. Are the schools unaware that government had given permission only to clarify doubts?,” said Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) president Gondu Sitaram. The Central government in its Unlock 5.0 directives has also left it to the States to reopen schools in a graded manner after October 15, based on the prevailing situation.

The members called attention to the growing atrocities against women in general in the last few years. They carried steel plates with saris, bangles, flowers and fruits, as a symbolic gesture to condemn police inaction in the Hathras case. State general secretary of the Federation P. Durga Bhavani launched a sharp attack on the Central government. “Under the NDA government, cows are safer than women and Dalits. The Hathras case is a reflection of the breakdown of law and order in the country. ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ has been reduced to a mere slogan as there has been a spurt in cases of sexual assault and rape in the last six years,” she said. She alleged that while women were being targeted, the Modi government was busy implementing its ‘Hindutva’ agenda. The protesters recalled that Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani had presented bangles to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Nirbhaya case, and said that they were repeating the act today to show the mirror to the ruling party at the Centre. They demanded immediate suspension of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and stringent action against the culprits in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-decry-inaction-in-hathras-incident/article32764438.ece

Foul smell Officials who grew suspicious over the contents of the thermocol boxes due to the exceedingly foul smell opened them with the help of railway staff and found body parts of goat and sheep in a decomposed condition. The consignment was believed to be sent either from West Bengal or Odisha. Officials traced the parcel recipient to one Kaza of Machilipatnam and were unable to contact him as the phone number given was not reachable. The meat, weighing around one tonne, was buried at a dumping yard in Pathapadu near the city. Officials launched an investigation into the illegal trade and import of stale meat from other States. They suspect that the meat was imported to be sold in the district markets where prices are higher compared to that in northern States. A further investigation is on into the matter, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/consignment-of-stale-rotten-meat-seized-at-railway-station/article32763634.ece

Ramakrishna has condemned the “rising crimes” against women and Dalits, and said a roundtable will be organised in Vijayawada on October 5 in protest against the atrocities. The attack on a 20-year-old girl at Hathras in U.P. reflected the sordid state of affairs, he said in a release on Saturday, asserting that the manner in which the police got the victim’s body cremated exposed the conspiracy to hush up the case. On the other hand, the YSRCP turned a blind eye to the attacks on Dalits, he alleged. “They are being falsely implicated in cases and roughed up. Some were tonsured,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-decries-rising-crimes-against-women-dalits/article32764325.ece

04 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Unauthorised’ structures at Sabbam’s house razed||Officials of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) demolished a boundary wall and a constructed portion at the house of former MP and former Mayor Sabbam Hari, stating that they were unauthorised structures, in Visakhapatnam on Saturday morning. After demolishing the boundary wall, the GVMC officials erected a fencing and said that around five to 10 feet of the space inside the house premises belongs to the corporation. A large number of workers, and around 30 policemen along with the Town Planning department of GVMC, started the demolition activity from 4.30 a.m. on Saturday. It was learnt that the structure that was demolished by the GVMC was built for the use of workers at Mr. Hari’s house. GVMC officials present at the spot claimed that they had already attached notices regarding the demolition at Mr. Hari’s house. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Hari said that he did not receive any notice from the GVMC. “It was at around 4.30 a.m. when my workers woke me up and said that the boundary wall is being demolished. When I questioned the GVMC officials, they did not show me any notice, but claimed that they have received orders from senior officers,” Mr. Hari said. “The government is targeting me as I am questioning the governance of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his failures. This is how the government is functioning in the State. As a law-abiding citizen, I will take up this issue in court,” the former Mayor said. Responding to Mr. Hari’s allegations, Chief City Planner of the GVMC, R. Vidyullatha, said that the civic body has received representations from a number of citizens that the former Mayor had encroached upon a park. When the GVMC verified land records, it was found that around 12 feet of the park space was encroached upon by Mr. Hari, she said. “When we tried to serve a notice, no one was available. It may be noted that when any government land is encroached, the department can take action immediately. However, the GVMC has attached the notice 24 hours before the demolition and had informed the residents,” she told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/unauthorised-structures-at-sabbams-house-razed/article32764330.ece

AIARLA national secretary P.S. Ajay Kumar, in a letter to the Principal Secretary, alleged that the two survey numbers 4 and 5 were created in Compartment number 800 of Cheemalapadu Reserve Forest block and the then officials of the Forest, Mining and Revenue Departments colluded with the granite mining company Stone Plus and created new revenue survey numbers in the RF. He pointed out that the then Divisional Forest Officer, Visakhapatnam, had asked the Assistant Director (Mines) of Anakapalle not to issue transit permits to the Stone Plus company, but the AD went ahead and issued permits. The DFO had also reported the matter to Director, Mines and Geology, Amaravati, requesting that the mining lease be cancelled and requested the District Collector to take action to cancel the mining lease and to initiate action against officers who created new revenue survey numbers in the RF. Mr. Ajay Kumar pointed out that DFO is an IFS officer and first-class magistrate and is a responsible and competent authority to protect the forest.

04 October 2020||CHEGUNTA (MEDAK DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Pensioners, farmers looking at TRS||For the first time in ecent past, election campaign has commenced without declaration of candidates of any political party. This is the interesting aspect of the byelection for Dubbak Assembly constituency to be held on November 3. The election is necessitated by the death of ruling party MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy. The TRS has already taken the lead in campaigning with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao touring the constituency extensively and inaugurating a series of development programmes and announcing sanction of various development projects to the tune of several crores. However, he has been cautious enough to float the name of S. Sujatha, widow of Ramalinga Reddy. Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of late minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy has been trying his luck to get party nomination with not much response from the party leadership so far. It is not clear what path will be chosen by Srinivas Reddy, who has good following in the constituency due to the works done by his father. The name of Collector P Venkatarami Reddy is also doing the rounds but he was not available for comment. During 2018 general elections, he had reportedly tried for Lok Sabha ticket but missed the opportunity due to last minute changes. M. Raghunandana Rao of the BJP, who contested previous two elections, has been extensively visiting the villages and meeting people with a promise to grill the government on the compensation being offered to oustees of Mallannasagar coming up in Toguta mandal. While the response to BJP candidate is quite positive from youngsters, the aged seem to be in favour of the TRS given the welfare schemes. “We are getting pension and six kg of rice from ration. We will be happy if double bedroom houses are also given to us,” says Laksmamma, who sells corn candles on the roadside at Chegunta. “Farmers are with the government as they are getting Rytu Bandhu and Rytu Beema,” said Srinivas from Rukmapur village. “Youngsters are looking at BJP as they wish change. They are not happy with the present government,” said Satyanarayana, a government employee at Chegunta. The Land Regularisation Scheme has also been getting severe criticism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pensioners-farmers-looking-at-trs/article32764245.ece
04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC demolishes Lingampally market, traders protest||Demolition of the old Lingampally market complex in Narayanguda by the GHMC authorities led to a spontaneous demonstration on Saturday by small traders who had been running their businesses in the complex for decades. Traders engaged in businesses such as vegetables, fruits, mutton, chicken, groceries, flowers, puja essentials, among others said the GHMC’s decision to demolish the existing complex and construct a new one in its place is leading to displacement of over 70 small-time businesses. “This is unexpected blow during COVID-19 times when already the businesses are down. These shops were initially given to our parents, and later we have taken them over, and been paying the rent regularly,” said Ramu Naik, seller of cool drinks. Starting from Rs. 8 to 9, the traders are now paying Rs. 870 per month inclusive of all taxes, he said. Representations have been made to the GHMC officials, requesting for re-allotment to the same traders after construction of new complex, but the authorities would have none of it. “They said the rent would be decided through fresh auction,” Mr. Naik said. Construction of new complex is a ploy to evict the traders, as the authorities had failed to do it despite multiple efforts in the past, owing to resistance from people and politicians, another trader Srinivas said. In 1997, when the complex was vacated for renovation, the space in the new complex was given to the same traders, and GHMC is discarding its own example now by throwing out the hapless traders and workers dependants on them, the traders said. However, Additional Commissioner, Estates, Yadagiri Rao said the structure has become dilapidated, and is prone to collapse any time endangering several lives. Due procedure has been followed for demolition and re-construction of the complex, and once completed, the space will be auctioned, Mr.Rao said. “As per rules, the lease cannot be extended beyond 25 years without fresh auction. In case of this market complex, it has been over 33 years,” he said. However, the present occupants will be given the first right of refusal. If they are ready to pay the highest price derived from the auction, they will be given the space, he informed. Construction of the new building with cellar, stilt, and four floors is under way with an expenditure of Rs. 4 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-demolishes-lingampally-market/article32764237.ece
04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt. to consider lowering LRS fee||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was said to have assured TRS MPs, MLAs and MLCs on Saturday that the State government was contemplating reduction in fee for land regularisation scheme with a view to avoid financial burden on common public. At a meeting with some of them representing districts going to polls for Dubbak Assembly constituency, Legislative Council from graduates constituencies, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and a few other municipal corporations, Mr. Rao enquired from them public reaction to LRS. They told him that they received several representations seeking reduction in LRS fee, sources said. They added that Mr. Rao expressed interest in a two day session of the Assembly shortly to discuss LRS and the new revenue and municipal laws. Mr. Rao launched a tirade against the BJP, accusing the party of ditching the State. A number of leaders of BJP spoke to him seeking TRS support for farm sector Bills in Parliament but he refused. The State government decided to oppose the Bills keeping in view the agriculture scenario in Telangana. He expressed the hope that the TRS would win 104 of the 150 divisions in GHMC. Thereafter, all TRS leaders would have responsibility division-wise. The surveys had shown that TRS was favourite in Dubbak Assembly bypoll also. He also announced orientation classes for first-time TRS MLAs. He addressed them specially for nearly two hours in the midst of the meeting, it was said. They were told to mould their functioning towards public. Sources added that Mr. Rao asked the participants to rebut campaign that the unemployed, youth and graduates were not happy with the TRS. Replying to their concern that the deadline of October 15 for survey of properties to incorporate information into Dharani portal may not be sufficient, Mr. Rao said the government would take a decision on extension of time based on need.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-to-consider-lowering-lrs-fee/article32764243.ece
04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Patients with depression pushed to the brink||There is barely any relief for hundreds of mental health patients struggling with chronic depression and psychosis as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or shock treatment is not being offered at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda here. Lack of access to medicines during the lockdown had resulted in relapse of psychosis, a disorder referring to a loss of contact with reality, in scores of patients in Telangana. Sources at IMH said they are not administering ECT as they do not have an anaesthetist at present. The institute had only one anaesthetist for years, but she was transferred to Gandhi Hospital in the recent past. “Since the specialist (anaesthetist) is not available, we are not able to administer ECT which is offered as the last resort. Imagine the kind of agony that patients with psychosis and their attendants are experiencing. Those who take care of the patients at home fully understand what it means to not have the treatment option. Also, we offer this therapy to patients with chronic depression,” the doctors said. The institute is the State government’s tertiary care centre where all forms of treatment exclusively for people with mental illnesses is supposed to be offered. A majority of the patients who opt for the government facility belong to economically disadvantaged backgrounds. One cycle of ECT at private hospitals costs up to Rs. 10,000. IMH remains their sole hope. Role of anaesthetist According to the Mental Healthcare Act 2017, ECT cannot be administered without use of muscle relaxants and anaesthesia. Consultant psychiatrists, seeking anonymity, said that general anaesthesia is administered so that a patient loses consciousness. “An anaesthetist supports oxygenation in the patient. All of this is done so that seizures are experienced only in brain for a brief while,” a consultant psychiatrist said. The therapy lasts only for a few seconds. Only adult patients are attended at IMH. Minors are provided treatment at Niloufer Hospital, Red Hills. Relapse and trauma Doctors who attend patients with psychosis said that some might hallucinate that people around them, including family members, are plotting to attack them. In act of self-defence, some patients might become violent. “Patients had limited stock of medicines till March this year. During lockdown, those in faraway villages were unable to refill their prescription and ran short of medicines leading to relapse of psychosis and chronic depression. We have seen scores of such cases in the past two months. We often have people pleading us to admit a family member who has become uncontrollable, but we are not in a situation to offer ECT. Hundreds of patient and their family members will be partially spared of the agony if an anaesthetist is allotted to IMH,” sources said. Till March, the specialist who was shifted to Gandhi Hospital used to visit IMH once a week or 10 days to assist in the ECT procedure. After COVID-19, she got busy with coronavirus patients there. IMH Superintendent M. Umashankar confirmed that they are not offering ECT as an anaesthetist is not available, and will resume after the specialist is allotted. Currently, doctors at IMH are relying only on medicines to help patients recover. They said that when dosage of medicines is increased, some patients have side-effects.

04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP plans awareness drive on farm Bills from booth level||State president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar has reiterated that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has brought in the three new Acts only as part of its plans to double the farmers’ income over the next couple of years. Speaking to mediapersons through video conference on Saturday he stated that the new laws were purely aimed at the welfare and development of the farming community. They would also put an end to the middlemen’s control over prices by enabling the farmers to sell their produce anywhere they want or wherever they get a good price. In spite of all the hard work in crop production withstanding the unfavourable weather conditions, pest and insect attacks and other adversities, the farmers had no right to fix the price for their produce. However, after the enactment of the new laws they would have a considerable say in deciding the price for their produce, Mr. Sanjay Kumar stated. As the new Bills bring in more traders before the farming community for purchase of their produce at their farm the chances of farmers getting better price would increase and the transportation charges of taking their produce to markets would also be saved for them. ‘Blind opposition’ Further, the new laws would provide for purchasers entering into agreement with farmers on procuring their produce at a pre-fixed price. Line-up of traders to rural areas would also increase employment opportunities at village level. Even if farmers take their produce to markets outside their market committee area they would not be required to pay any cess as per the new laws, the MP said. However, some political parties, including Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), were opposing the new laws blindly and trying to mislead the farming community on them. The BJP was preparing an action plan to explain benefits of reforms in the agriculture sector from polling booth level. Round-table meetings would also be convened at mandal and district levels to create awareness on the new laws among people, particularly the farming community, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-plans-awareness-drive-on-farm-bills-from-booth-level/article32764240.ece

04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR new division put on back burner||On every Gandhi Jayanti, the South Central Railway celebrates anniversary. Yet, the 54th anniversary is special since the zone has remained intact and is likely to remain so for sometime. If things went according to political landscape a couple of years ago, the SCR would have been cut down to size with three of the six zones - Vijayawada, Guntur and Guntakal to be joined to the proposed South Coast Railway with Visakhapatnam as headquarters. “If it happens, SCR will have its hands and legs cut off leaving just the torso as it would have just Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Nanded divisions,” said an official. However, as things stand now, the formation of the new division has been put on the back burner although the Railways Ministry continuous to maintain an ambiguous stance. For instance, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said the proposal was still under consideration to a question raised in Parliament, and to another question, he said there was a plan to reduce the number of divisions from the existing 17! Doubts arise as the Railways has already unleashed reforms, including a major restructuring in the functioning, with the Railway Board itself cut to size to four from eight and a new management cadre about to be unveiled. OSDs posted out Secondly, two senior officials appointed Officer on Special Duty to oversee formation of new zone, and cutting the SCR to size have been posted out in the last couple of years. Vijayawada divisional railway manager is holding it as an additional charge. SCR formation had its own twist and turns after it came into being in 1966 on October 2when Hubli and Vijayawada divisions of Southern Railway, and Sholapur and Secunderabad divisions of Central Railway were carved out and merged into a new zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-new-division-put-on-back-burner/article32764249.ece

04 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Tough task ahead for Congress||A tough task lies ahead for the Congress fighting to make an impression in the Dubbak bypoll, and more so for new All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge Manickam Tagore, who was appointed recently. Nothing much seems to be working in favour of the party in Dubbak as it is struggling to find the right candidate to give a decent fight. The party has lost senior leadership to the TRS before the last elections and has not found replacement despite the decent voter base. It lost its most notable face Cheruku Muthyam Reddy, who represented the constituency earlier, after the ruling party lured him into its fold a few days before the 2018 Assembly elections. Though he passed away, his son Srinivas Reddy continues his political legacy. Sources said an effort was made to bring him back to the Congress, offering him the ticket but in vain. “He preferred to continue in TRS with the hope to bag its nomination for the bypoll, or at least some political position later if denied the ticket now,” a senior leader revealed. Siddipet District Congress Committee (DCC) chief T. Narsa Reddy, Padmini Reddy, wife of former Deputy Chief Minister Damodar Rajnarsimha and Komatireddy Narsimha Reddy, who contested in the 2018 elections are now being considered. None of these has expressed keenness so far on taking on the TRS in a bypoll that always favours the ruling party. Not a write-off The Congress vote bank isn’t worth writing off either. In the last elections, swept by the TRS, the Congress candidate polled over 26,000 votes and that too without putting much effort as he was the last minute arrangement after the party offered the seat to the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) in the poll alliance. “We continue to have the base and can improve our position further to prepare ground for the 2023 elections,” a senior leader said, adding “But no one wants to spend money now.” “The might of the ruling party, sympathy for Ramalinga Reddy’s family and Finance Minister, T. Harish Rao personally managing the poll campaign are too strong factors for a decent political fight now,” he says. The party has convened several meetings so far and is holding another one on Sunday as well. But it may not announce the name soon as the election date is a month away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tough-task-ahead-for-congress/article32764244.ece

Many in the village mourned her. Except some age-related ailments, she had no serious health problems. But for the past 10 days or so she had no proper sleep or food. She was worried about the demolition of the house being constructed by her children. The house was dismantled by revenue officials with police protection. Her children had spent a few lakhs of rupees on the house. Yadamma family had been using the land as cattle shed for the past several years and they decided to construct a house. On September 22, revenue officials dismantled more than a dozen houses, stating that they had been constructed on government land. Though some house owners showed receipts for tax they had been paying to the local panchayat and the allotment letters issued by the authorities in the past, the revenue officials did not care for them. “The locals are showing tax receipts for some other assets. They were given sites at one place and they occupied some other place. That is why we dismantled the houses under construction and notice were issued to some others who are staying in them,” revenue officials said. “My grand mother was worried about the house and she cried day in and day out. We are unable to console her and in the morning she had cardiac arrest and died. Who is responsible for her death? Why was our house dismantled despite having all valid documents?” asked K. Sandeep Kumar, grandson of Yadamma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/old-woman-dies-after-demolition-of-their-house/article32764373.ece

04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||A month after resumption, Delhi Metro yet to catch up||Nearly a month after resumption of services, line utilisation on the Delhi Metro network has reached only 9-10 lakh daily, as opposed to the approximately 55-60 lakh journeys that the network was recording before the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). Line utilisation is the measure by which the number of journeys, performed by each passenger in completing his or her journey by using one or more lines, is recorded. Metro operations were halted on March 22 due to the pandemic following which operations remained suspended for over five months. The nearly 400-kilometre long Delhi Metro resumed services in a graded manner with staggered timings from September 7. Ridership on the network and line utilisation data provided by the DMRC have seen a steady rise. On September 11, when the entire network apart from the Airport Express Line was operational, the DMRC recorded a ridership of 1,79,457 with a corresponding line utilisation of 3,28,968 and on September 12, when the entire network became operational, a ridership of 2,00,607 was recorded with a corresponding line utilisation of 3,80,720. Between September 12 and September 18, the line utilisation increased to 7,46,071. Curtailed capacity While officials said that the line utilisation figures have reached 9-10 lakh per day, with a curtailed capacity inside coaches to maintain social distancing, the number of journeys being undertaken currently are way below the pre-pandemic numbers. In the first week of March, the number of journeys on the Delhi Metro network ranged between 55-60 lakh per day. Discontinuation of tokens, restricted entry to stations, wearing of masks at all times, alternate seating inside metro coaches are some of the guidelines that were put in place by the public transporter. As a precautionary measure, the DMRC also introduced facilities by which commuters can recharge their smart cards online at the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates. ‘Break the Peak’ With certain sections recording an uneven ridership, the DMRC has also advised commuters to “Break the Peak” and stagger their journeys to avoid crowding. “In recent days, it has been observed that certain sections of the metro network are showing a trend where occupancy is touching the 100% mark during monitoring and evening peak hours. Whereas, during off-peak hours, the occupancy in the same sections is in the range of 30%-50% only, leaving ample scope for the people to stagger their travel from peak hours to the extent possible and have hassle-free travel with social distancing in place,” DMRC officials said. However, despite a strict protocol in place, several commuters continue to be apprehensive of taking the metro amid the ongoing pandemic. Ahana Dasgupta, who was a daily commuter to Central Secretariat before the lockdown said, “I have not yet started travelling on the metro because I believe that in an enclosed space, the chances of getting infected increases manifold with a general unwillingness to wear masks. Further, in the evenings, there is a long queue outside the station where there is hardly any social distancing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-month-after-resumption-delhi-metro-yet-to-catch-up/article32763944.ece

Children will be encouraged to check their houses for signs of stagnant clean water and to motivate their friends to do the same, the Delhi government said. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had kick-started the anti-dengue campaign on September 6. Last week, Mr. Kejriwal had asked all the RWAs of Delhi to come forward and spread awareness to prevent dengue. “In the fifth week of the dengue campaign, schoolchildren will be encouraged to do their homework by inspecting their houses at 10 a.m. for 10 minutes for signs of stagnant clean water,” the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dengue-campaign-to-engage-children-now/article32763941.ece

04 October 2020||New Delhi,||Capital’s AQI may turn ‘poor’ tomorrow||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “moderate” category on Saturday and is likely to turn “poor” in two days due to lowering temperatures and slow wind speed. Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index was recorded at 189 on Saturday. “As predicted, the PM2.5 contribution (in pollution) is increasing, which is a characteristic of winters. The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the lower end of poor quality on Monday,” the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research said. It said an increase in farm fires was observed on Friday around Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions and is likely to impact Delhi in the coming days. Also, there is a marked dip in minimum temperatures recorded in Delhi. Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/capitals-aqi-may-turn-poor-tomorrow/article32764227.ece

04 October 2020||Mumbai,||‘Ram temple foundation laid, but it’s jungle raj in U.P.’||The Shiv Sena on Saturday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the Hathras gang rape incident, saying that “jungle raj” prevails in Uttar Pradesh even as the foundation stone for a Ram temple has been laid in the State at Ayodhya. The Sena, which is part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, alleged that the recent incidents of atrocities against women in U.P. have failed to move the government in that State as well as the Centre. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. But there is no ‘Ram rajya’ (ideal governance) in Uttar Pradesh. ‘Jungle raj’ prevails in U.P. in terms of the law and order situation,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana.  “Atrocities against women continue to happen and the incidents of rape and murder of young women are on the rise in that State,” it said. “A 19-year-old woman in Hathras was raped and murdered, which triggered an outrage across the country. In her dying declaration, the victim said that she had been raped. But the U.P. government now says that she was not raped. Soon after, an incident of gang rape also took place in U.P.’s Balrampur,” the editorial added. “But despite all this, neither the rulers in Delhi nor the Yogi Adityanath government were moved. The government itself says that when there was no rape, why is the Opposition crying hoarse. But if the woman was not raped, why did the police cremate her in the dead of the night?” it asked. “Earlier, when the U.P. government led by Akhilesh Yadav withdrew Yogi Adityanath’s security cover, the latter had cried in Parliament. Now he himself is the Chief Minister, but women in his State are not safe,” the party said. The U.P. Police also stopped Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting the grieving family in Hathras, it said. “Gandhi was caught by the collar and pushed to the ground. Humiliating a leader of a prominent political party in such a manner is a gang rape of democracy,” it said. “The body of the Hathras victim was burnt by the police by pouring petrol on it. In which Hindu tradition does this inhuman act fit?” the editorial asked. “When two sadhus were lynched in Palghar [in Maharashtra in April this year], we saw the statements of Yogi Adityanath and the BJP blew the conch of Hindutva. But why is it silent now?” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party asked.  ‘Lifeless and helpless’ The editorial said that BJP spokespersons went to town on TV channel debates in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. “But the same people are now saying that the Hathras victim was not gang raped. The victim’s dying declaration has no value!” it said. The Sena said the country has never been so “lifeless and helpless”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ram-temple-foundation-laid-but-its-jungle-raj-in-up/article32763884.ece

04 October 2020||Nagpur,||CBI should make public probe report, says Anil Deshmukh||Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should make public its inquiry report into the Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case so that people know whether it was a case of suicide or murder. Talking to reporters in Nagpur, the minister said the Maharashtra government was waiting for the CBI probe report in the case. Replying to a question about reports which said that Rajput’s death was a case of suicide and not murder, Mr. Deshmukh said, “We have not received any official information regarding that. It won’t be appropriate to comment on it until we get official information. We will give a statement as and when we receive any official information about it.” The minister added, “We want the CBI inquiry report into the case to soon come before the public so that they get to know whether it was a suicide or murder.” Earlier this week, the CBI had said it has not reached any conclusion in the death case and that all aspects were under investigation. The Mumbai Police had earlier registered an Accidental Death Report and launched an investigation. However, the CBI took over the probe into the high-profile case in August following the Supreme Court’s nod. Rajput’s father K.K. Singh had on July 25 lodged a complaint with the Bihar Police against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family members accusing them of abetting the actor’s suicide. Mr. Deshmukh has in the past defended the Mumbai Police’s investigation into the case, saying the force conducted the probe in a “professional manner”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cbi-should-make-public-probe-report-says-anil-deshmukh/article32763886.ece
04 October 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Seven, including three students, arrested for highway robberies||The Sanpada police have arrested seven people, including three students, for allegedly being involved in several robberies on the Sion-Panvel highway. Of the three students, two are minors, the police said. On September 30, Nandkumar Subhash Daate (25), a resident of Karanjale in Panvel who had a fish business, was robbed on the highway in Sanpada. The incident occurred at 2 a.m. when Mr. Daate, along with his partner Ajinkya Padval, were returning from Sassoon Dock in Mr. Padval’s car. After reaching Sanpada, they stopped the car to answer nature’s call. While Mr. Daate stepped out, Mr. Padval stayed inside the car. Later, when Mr. Daate was getting back into the car, an autorickshaw approached them. Three people came out of the auto and attacked the duo. Later, four more people got out of the auto and assaulted Mr. Daate and Mr. Padval. The assailants stole a mobile phone and Rs. 32,000 in cash. The duo then managed to snatch the key of the auto, but the accused started pelting stones at them and they returned the keys. Mr. Padval memorised the last four digits of the autorickshaw’s licence plate number and mentioned it in his police complaint. “We got the details of five autorickshaws with the same last four digits, verified each one and finally traced the accused,” said assistant police inspector Keshav Dinde. The accused have been identified as Sachin Lakshman Kale (21), Vyankatesh Vijay Chavan (21), Bonney Shankar Salunkhe (21), Vishal Vinod Kolhe (20), and Siddhant Praveen More (18). All the accused are residents of Nerul. Following the arrest, it was found that the accused had also conducted two highway robberies at Nerul and one within the APMC limits using the same modus operandi. “The accused have been handed over to the Nerul police for interrogation in the robbery case. We suspect the accused might have committed many such robberies and we are investigating the matter further,” Mr. Dinde said  The accused have been handed over to the Nerul police for interrogation Keshav Dinde Assistant police inspector||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/seven-including-three-students-arrested-for-highway-robberies/article32763882.ece
04 October 2020||Navi Mumbai,||‘Suspend investigating officer in Ashwini Bidre murder case’||Raju Gore, the husband of murdered policewoman Ashwini Bidre, has written to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar demanding suspension of the investigating officer in the case. In his letter, Mr. Gore accused Assistant Commissioner of Police Vinod Chavan of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch, of aiding the accused. Mr. Gore said, “Senior advocate Pradeep Gharat, who is the Special Public Prosecutor in the case, is a senior citizen. During such times, stepping out is dangerous for him. Yet, he has been attending all the hearings. Mr. Chavan is expected to inform Mr. Gharat about the dates of hearing and the bail applications filed by the accused beforehand so that Mr. Gharat gets enough time to prepare.” ‘Lack of cooperation’ Mr. Gore said there was a hearing on September 28 on the bail application filed by one of the accused, but Mr. Chavan informed Mr. Gharat about it only on Sunday night. Mr. Gore said Mr. Gharat managed to prepare for the matter and the Bombay High Court issued an order extending the trial period in the case by another year. The trial began at the Panvel sessions court in November 2019 and the court had initially directed that the trial be expedited and completed within a year. Mr. Gore also demanded that Assistant Commissioner of Police Sangeeta Alphonso, who had been appointed last year by the Maharashtra Director General of Police to assist Mr. Gharat in the trial, be transferred to the Navi Mumbai Police and made the investigating officer in the case. ‘Unsatisfactory conduct’ Mr. Gharat said, “There has been unsatisfactory conduct at the police’s end in this murder case.” Mr. Chavan, who has been hospitalised after testing positive for COVID-19, was unavailable for comment. Bidre, an assistant police inspector posted with the Protection of Civil Rights Unit in Konkan Bhavan in Belapur and resident of Roadpali in Kalamboli, went missing on April 15, 2016. A case was registered on July 14, 2016, by her brother Anand Bidre. On January 31, 2017, a kidnapping case was registered following which the key suspect, police inspector Abhay Kurundkar, who was attached to the Thane Rural Police, was arrested on December 7, 2017. Three more accomplices have been arrested in the case. According to the police, after killing Bidre, the accused dismembered the body and dumped it in Mira-Bhayander creek.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/suspend-investigating-officer-in-ashwini-bidre-murder-case/article32763881.ece
04 October 2020||New Delhi,||Sushant case: AIIMS medical board rules out murder||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical board has ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, terming it “a case of hanging and death by suicide”. AIIMS forensic chief Sudhir Gupta said on Saturday: “We have submitted our conclusive report to the CBI and there are no injuries indicating struggle or scuffle. The body has marks of hanging. The presence of any seductive material was not detected by AIIMS toxicology lab. The complete examination of the ligature mark over the neck was consistent with hanging.” A team of forensic doctors looked into the case and they have dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling”. Dr. Gupta refused to divulge any further details stating that the case is sub judice. The Central Bureau of Investigation said on Saturday that it is looking into all aspects of the death of the actor and that “investigation is still under way”. ‘Attempt to defame’ Meanwhile, the Congress in Mumbai accused the Centre of conspiring to defame the Maharashtra government in the death case and demanded the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to nab the conspirators. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) denied the allegation and said it wanted justice for Rajput. State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged, “The official confirmation by the AIIMS panel proves that the investigation by Mumbai Police was genuine and honest. It is also clear that it was a conspiracy of the Modi government with the help of their fake media allies to defame Maharashtra.” “We demand that the Maharashtra government form an SIT to nab the conspirators, the mastermind and the originators of the social media racket by the BJP IT team,” he said.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||On the front lines of rights and rows||Just past 10am on September 29, a notice went up on global human rights agency Amnesty International’s India webpage. The notice said that owing to the fact that the government had frozen all its funds through an order earlier in the month, Amnesty was shutting down its India operations, laying off about 150 people and ending its presence in the country, 55 years after it had set up its first office in India. Amnesty’s closure evoked concern from the U.K., where Amnesty is headquartered, the 27-nation EU and the U.S. Both the EU and the U.K. said their officials had met Indian officials in Delhi and in Brussels and London, and said they hoped that Amnesty could continue its work in the future, but the government has firmly told them not to interfere. Prior to this, other international groups like Ford Foundation, Greenpeace and Compassion International have faced similar restrictions, part of a list of at least 20 foreign NGOs on the government’s scanner. While Amnesty’s notice said the actions by the government were part of an “incessant witch-hunt” that had failed to produce evidence of wrong-doing, the government said it had a long list of charges pertaining to the funding of the group and its interference in India’s internal affairs, dismissing its claims of conducting humanitarian work as “glossy statements”. Over the past decade, the Ministry of Home Affairs has conducted an investigation into the workings of the group, and even raided its offices in Bengaluru in 2018, summoning various officials and staff members for questioning, and sending income tax notices to its Indian donors. It also pointed out that Amnesty International’s India chapter had been given clearance to accept funds as an NGO under the Foreign Contributions Regulatory Act (FCRA) only once, in the year 2000, but had “circumvented” laws to receive foreign funds through commercial means since then. Eventually, the government said, it had had to block foreign funds of about Rs. 8 crore to Amnesty India due to their “dubious” routing, in “bipartisan” actions taken by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government and the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, and the Enforcement Directorate served a show-cause notice to the human rights body for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), involving a total of Rs. 51.72 crore. “Human rights cannot be an excuse for defying the law of the land,” said the government. Amnesty shot back that the government had carried out its crackdown due to its anger over Amnesty’s reports on alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, and more recently, on what it called “police complicity” in the Delhi riots of February 2020, in which 53 people were killed. “Amnesty has never been particularly welcome in India even under previous governments,” said former Amnesty International India’s executive director Aakar Patel, who has himself faced many enquiries and interrogations. He said that raising contentious issues like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Jammu and Kashmir, the 1984 Sikh massacre, land rights in coal mine areas and journalist protections had always made it difficult for the group to engage with the state. The West factor Given a self-proclaimed mandate to raise such issues, Amnesty is not particularly welcome in many of the countries it works in, and is often accused of working for western, interventionist powers, and of gathering intelligence and fomenting trouble in the countries it reports on. In Nigeria, it faced massive protests over its report on sexual violence by the military. In Turkey, its top officials were arrested in 2017 on charges of links to the Fethullah Gulen group accused of attempting a coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Amnesty does not have offices in Pakistan, nor has it been able to set up offices in mainland China (it operates from Hong Kong), but its reports on enforced disappearances, minority rights and the blasphemy law in Pakistan, and the treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, and democracy activists in China have put it on collision course with those countries. In Russia, in 2016, Amnesty’s offices were sealed and then seized, over a series of reports on human rights violations in the North Caucasus, as well as in Syria and Ukraine, leading to the only other time the group has been forced to close its country operations besides in India. Amnesty now operates in about 150 countries, and claims a global membership of 7 million, which would make the number of its concerned citizens larger than the populations of Denmark or Lebanon. Its original mandate, when it was set up by British lawyer Peter Benenson in 1961, was to campaign for the freedom of “prisoners of conscience”, or political prisoners around the world. Benenson’s first campaign, for two Portuguese students arrested for raising a toast “to freedom” in a public restaurant during the reign of dictator António Salazar, led to a major newspaper campaign for other political prisoners, many of whom were released as a result of the international spotlight on them. Once set up, Amnesty broadened its mandate to deal with torture, executions, and other human rights issues, where its volunteers would bombard governments with letters until they were forced to pay attention to the issue. Among its successes, Amnesty counts its efforts towards the setting up of the International Criminal Court to try war criminals, as well as the end of capital punishment in more than 100 countries, among a total of about 24,000 campaigns it lists on its website. In 1977, when Amnesty won the Nobel Peace Prize, its citation called the group a “light in the darkness”, in a reference to its logo of a candle surrounded by barbed wire. Controversies within However, there were questions on the group’s own operations and the organisation has also had its share of controversies internally. Benenson himself resigned from the organisation in 1966, claiming it had been infiltrated by the British Foreign Office and MI-6, a charge that lingers to this day, despite repeated denials from the group. In the 1990s, the group was accused of helping prepare the U.S. case for the war against Iraq, with a report on Kuwaiti hospitals ravaged by Saddam Hussein’s Army that later turned out to be false, and faced a major controversy over its partnership with a British Taliban sympathiser, jailed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan for al-Qaeda links. Other challenges have come from within the organisation, with accusations of financial mismanagement and overspending on senior staff, inequality and bullying within the workplace, as well as discrimination and ‘selection bias’. The accusation of “western bias” within the organisation has persisted too, despite the fact that since 1992, its Secretaries-General have belonged to Africa and South Asia, including Salil Shetty, a human rights activist from Bangalore, who ran the organisation from 2010 to 2018. But it is the accusation levelled by the government this week, of Amnesty’s “interference in domestic political debates funded by foreign donations”, that remains the biggest challenge the organisation faces globally, 60 years after it was created.

04 October 2020||Washington,||Trump doing very well, says WH doctor||U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus during early Friday morning, is doing “very well”, according to his physician Sean Conley. The President’s treatment includes a five-day course of remdesivir and a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, an experimental therapy. The doctor’s comments also have raised questions on the timeline of Mr. Trump’s diagnosis. A number of others who had been in contact with the President at the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on September 26 have also tested positive for the virus. “At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the President has made,” Dr. Conley said, as he stood with other members of the President’s treatment team outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Dr. Conley said on Saturday afternoon that it was “72 hours into the diagnosis”, which implied a Wednesday afternoon diagnosis. The President travelled to a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday. The White House informed the press of the diagnosis on Friday morning at 1 a.m. When questioned on the timing of the diagnosis, Dr. Conley said, “Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given kind of clinical indications and a little bit more concern and that’s when that... and late last night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.” A White House official said, after the medical briefing, that the doctor had misspoken about when the diagnosis was made, as per a Washington Post report. ‘Abundance of caution’ Dr. Conley also declined to say when Mr. Trump last tested negative. He also did not answer a question on whether Mr. Trump had ever been on oxygen (which is often needed when blood oxygen saturation levels drop to unsafe levels). Instead, he reluctantly revealed the President was not given any on Thursday, Friday (while at Walter Reed) or Saturday morning prior to the briefing. This does not rule out the possibility that he received oxygen at the White House, before being transferred to Walter Reed out of “an abundance of caution”. Dr. Conley said the President was walking around and in “exceptionally good spirits” on Saturday and had not had a fever for the last 24 hours. Mr. Trump had earlier had a fever, cough, congestion and fatigue, as per reports. A prolific tweeter, the President was quieter than usual on the Twitter on Friday and Saturday morning. “Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!” he tweeted close to midnight on Friday. On Saturday, he thanked the doctors and nurses in a tweet, saying that with their help he was “feeling well.” Mr. trump also wrote that “tremendous progress” had been made in fighting “this plague” over the last six months.” First Lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive, showed “no indication for hospitalisation”, as per Dr. Conley. Current and former Trump advisers Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien were among those who have tested positive. Meanwhile, the virus continues to take its toll on Americans, with around 2,09,000 deaths and 7.36 million infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-to-spend-coming-days-at-hospital/article32763530.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Enemy of the state||On April 5, 2010, a 39-minute video was released by a website, called wikileaks.org, that showed gun-sight footage of two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters in action during the Iraqi insurgency against the U.S. occupation in 2007. The video showed the helicopter crew firing indiscriminately and killing civilians and two Reuters war correspondents. The release of the video by WikiLeaks was made possible by the leak of nearly 400,000 documents called the Iraq War Logs from the U.S. Department of Defense databases by the intelligence analyst Bradley Manning (who later referred herself as Chelsea), who acted as a whistle-blower. Ms. Manning had copied these files into a CD-ROM and uploaded them onto a WikiLeaks dropbox. The War Logs’ release was followed by the publication of several news stories based on thousands of leaked diplomatic cables that were also released by Ms. Manning, leading to significant public exposure of the ways, lifestyles and attitudes of the elite in various countries. The WikiLeaks model — using crytographic tools to protect sources and allowing for anonymous “leaks” of sensitive information (that could also be in public interest) to be published — suddenly bought forth a new model of extensive investigative journalism into areas that were relatively shielded from the public eye. It is difficult not to associate WikiLeaks with the efforts of one individual — Julian Assange, the 49-year-old Australian by birth and who personified and organised it, even if the portal was maintained and sustained by hundreds of volunteers across the globe. Asylum in Embassy Ten years since the release of the Iraq War Logs, Mr. Assange is undergoing trial in the U.K. on whether he should be extradited to the U.S. to face charges related to the leaking of classified documents that exposed U.S. war crimes. Seven of those years were spent in asylum in the small Ecuador Embassy in London, after Mr. Assange refused extradition to Sweden to face charges of rape, which were later dismissed by Swedish prosecutors. The then Ecuador President Rafael Correa had extended asylum to Mr. Assange, but he could not guarantee safe passage for travel as British authorities threatened arrest as soon as he left the Embassy premises. Mr. Assange had always indicated that extradition to Sweden was a ploy for him to be handed over to the U.S., where Ms. Manning was convicted by court martial in July 2013 for violating the Espionage Act and underwent rigorous imprisonment before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in January 2017. Mr. Assange continued to front the activities of WikiLeaks even during his refuge in the Ecuador Embassy. WikiLeaks published emails sent and received by U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and went on to release Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails that were obtained allegedly by Russian intelligence agency hackers. The DNC email releases hinted at bias by the committee against Bernie Sanders. Mr. Assange denied that the source of the hack was Russian agencies. In April 2017, the Trump administration’s Justice Department had charged him in a sealed indictment. On May 23, 2019, 18 federal criminal charges under the Espionage Age of 1917 were brought by the Justice Department against Mr. Assange for his involvement in “computer intrusion” and leaking of classified information. In June 2020, the charges were further expanded for conspiracy with hacker groups. Mr. Assange, in his younger days, was a prodigious teenage hacker who was charged and later let off for activities related to invasion into private computers. He later went onto become a “cypherpunk” — an activist who uses cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to promote social and political change — a path that led him to found WikiLeaks. The site went on to become a key outlet for whistleblowers. This propelled him into becoming a “global hacktivist” of sorts but his ploy to use WikiLeaks as a means to influence the bipolar U.S. politics has complicated his public image. It remains to be seen whether the U.K. court will consider his plea not to be extradited on merits of his role as a publisher of sensitive information, something that has been performed by news organisations the world over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/enemy-of-the-state/article32763509.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Battle for the black mountains||The story of Nagorno-Karabakh, the landlocked, mountainous territory that has been at the centre of the clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has been that of imperial conquests, ethnic violence, civil strife and mass uprisings. Once a part of the Armenian Kingdom, Nagorno-Karabakh (literal meaning, mountainous black garden) has seen all empires — the Romans, the Persians, the Ottomans, the Russians and the Soviets — that came to Transcaucasia establishing their rule over itself. When empires retreated or collapsed, Nagorno-Karabakh, located between the southern part of the Lesser Caucasus range and the eastern edge of the Armenian Highlands, and largely populated by ethnic Armenians, was left within the borders of Azerbaijan, igniting a protracted conflict that’s still raging. The roots of today’s conflict go back to the time when Transcaucasia (or South Caucasus) was part of the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia took over the region in the early 19th century after the Russo-Persian wars from the Persian Empire, which had suzerainty over the region for centuries. After the 1917 revolution, the Russian influence receded in the South Caucasus, which allowed the formation of an independent Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Karabakh became a part of this republic. But the federation crumbled under its own contradictions and then emerged three separate republics — Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Nagorno-Karabakh was incorporated into Azerbaijan by the Azeri authorities. This was also the time when the Ottomans were attacking the region, mainly targeting Armenian militias, in an alliance with Azerbaijan. When the Ottomans, in the face of defeat in the First World War, withdrew from the South Caucasus, the British temporarily filled the vacuum. But they, too, failed to calm the ethnic tensions, which led to an open war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1920. The war was disastrous, especially for the ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani forces, after repelling an Armenian offensive, burnt down parts of Shusha, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital. When the war was raging, the Bolshevik revolutionaries took over Azerbaijan and Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh at that time was 90% Armenian. But the Soviet leaders (Joseph Stalin was the acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union under which the Caucasian Bureau, or the Kavburo, was created) decided to give Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (province) to Azerbaijan, despite protests from Armenia. The Soviets also redrew the map between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which left the Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast within the boundaries of Azerbaijan. Ethnic frictions As long as the Soviet Union remained strong, the region had been relatively peaceful. But with the Soviet power receding in the late 1980s, the ethnic frictions started resurfacing. In 1988, the regional assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh passed a resolution to cancel its autonomous status and join Armenia. Azerbaijan opposed this move, leading to violent clashes. When Azerbaijan and Armenia became independent countries, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, in 1991, the tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh led to an open war. The ethnic Armenian rebels of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by the Armenian government, fought Azerbaijan for years. When a ceasefire was reached in 1994, the rebels had not only ensured their rule over what was the Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast, they had also extended their control to the Armenian borders, re-establishing territorial continuity with Armenia. Despite the ceasefire, Armenia and Azerbaijan failed to reach a peace agreement. Azerbaijan continues to claim sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh. In July this year, violence erupted, which left some 16 people dead. Since then, the border has remained tense. In the current spell of clashes, which broke out on September 27, dozens have already been killed. Azerbaijan, with direct support from Turkey, seems to be emboldened now. Nagorno-Karabakh is dependent on Armenia for security. Armenia, in turn, is dependent on Moscow, which enjoys good relationships with both Baku and Yerevan. That’s why Russia has called for a ceasefire. But for now, Azerbaijan and its backers in Ankara seem to be in a mood to fight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/battle-for-the-black-mountains/article32763511.ece
04 October 2020||Yerevan,||Intense fighting in Karabakh after ‘Azerbaijan offensive’||Armenian and Azerbaijani forces are engaged in intense fighting over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after Azerbaijan launched a large-scale new offensive on Saturday, Armenian officials said. Armenia said that 51 more separatist soldiers had died in clashes with Azerbaijani forces in the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region as fighting over the disputed territory entered a seventh day. The government published a list with the names of the 51 dead servicemen on its website, hours after the leader of the separatist region, Arayik Harutyunyan, said a “final battle” was under way with Azerbaijani forces and that he was joining the fighting on the Karabakh frontline. “The nation and motherland are under threat. Time has come for the entire nation to become a powerful army,” Mr. Harutyunyan told journalists before joining troops at the battlefield. Baku and Yerevan have defied international calls for a ceasefire and accused each other of starting clashes that began last Sunday and have seen the heaviest fighting since a 1994 ceasefire.  “Heavy fighting is ongoing on other flanks,” Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said wrote on Facebook.  ‘Heroic resistance’ Karabakh Army spokesman Suren Sarumyan said Azerbaijani forces, who were using aviation, drones, and tanks met “heroic resistance” from separatist fighters. The Azerbaijani Defence Ministry claimed its forces had “captured new footholds (in Karabakh) and cleaned up the territory from enemy troops.” Nearly 200 people have been confirmed killed since the fighting erupted last Sunday, including more than 30 civilians. There are fears the fighting could expand into an all-out, multi-front war involving regional powers Turkey and Russia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/intense-fighting-in-karabakh-after-azerbaijan-offensive/article32763521.ece
04 October 2020||Beirut,||Syrian rebels sign up to fight for Azeris||Desperate to help his family displaced by Syria’s war, pro-Turkey rebel fighter Abu Ahmad is waiting to be deployed to Azerbaijan hoping to earn almost 80 times his current salary. “I signed up to fight more than a week ago to go to Azerbaijan... for three months in exchange for $2,000 a month,” the 26-year-old told AFP. Clashes erupted on Sunday between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over Nagorno-Karabakh. Ankara is backing Baku and has been accused by Yerevan of sending its Syrian proxies to bolster Azerbaijani troops. From a camp for the displaced in north Syria controlled by Turkey-backed rebels, Abu Ahmad said he was heading to Karabakh hoping to better provide for his wife and children. “We lost our villages and our homes, and we have nothing left to eat,” said Abu Ahmad. With reports of Syrians killed in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abu Ahmad realises he is taking a risk. But “we have no other option,” he said. “We’ve reached the point where we’re ready to sacrifice ourselves to provide for our children.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 850 Syrian fighters are already headed to Azerbaijan via Turkey, and hundreds more are preparing to follow suit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/syrian-rebels-join-azeris-to-feed-families/article32763522.ece
04 October 2020||LONDON,||British PM Johnson upbeat on EU trade pact before key talks||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that “there’s a good deal to be done” with the European Union on post-Brexit trade, as he prepared for scheduled talks with European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen. Mr. Johnson told reporters that the U.K. wants a free trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada, but is also prepared for negotiations to fail. “We’re resolved on either course, we’re prepared for either course and we’ll make it work, but it’s very much up to our friends and partners,” Mr. Johnson said. The two parties are trying to strike a rudimentary trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on December 31, to avoid a barrage of uncertainty, tariffs and red tape that would hurt economies on both sides. Deadlock remains But while negotiators have inched close to agreement in many areas during six months of talks, they remain deadlocked over European fishing boats’ access to U.K. waters, and over the level of support governments can give to industry. The EU is concerned that British plans to subsidise sectors such as technology will amount to unfair competition. “We should not forget that we have made progress on many, many different fields. But, of course, the most difficult ones are still completely open,” Ms. von der Leyen said on Friday. “We want a deal because we think it is better to have a deal as neighbours - also, on top of these COVID times with devastating impact on the economies,” she said. “But not at any price.” Mr. Johnson said an October 15-16 EU summit is effectively the deadline for a deal if it is to be ratified by year’s end, though EU officials think talks may drag on beyond then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-pm-johnson-upbeat-on-eu-trade-pact-before-key-talks/article32763532.ece
04 October 2020||Noumea,||French Pacific outpost decides on independence||The French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia votes in a referendum on independence on Sunday, with voters expected to reject breaking away from France after almost 170 years despite rising support for the move. The referendum is part of a carefully negotiated de-colonisation plan agreed in 1998, known as the Noumea Accord, designed to put an end to a deadly conflict between the mostly pro-independence indigenous Kanak population, and the descendants of European settlers known as “Caldoches”. Violence in the 1980s culminated in a drawn-out hostage crisis in 1988 that saw 19 separatists killed on one side, and six police and special forces on the other. It will be the second time the archipelago goes to the polls to decide on its fate in two years, after a first referendum in 2018 resulted in status quo with 56.7% of the vote. But the result still marked a shift towards pro-independence sympathies, raising campaigners’ hopes that this time it could manage to break free. Political observers say a majority “Yes” to independence is unlikely, although there have been no opinion polls to help provide guidance. “I would be surprised if the Yes-vote won,” said Pierre-Christophe Pantz, a Noumea-based expert in geopolitics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/french-pacific-outpost-decides-on-independence/article32763527.ece

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Back to 85% of pre-COVID-19 transaction levels at CUB’||Private sector lender City Union Bank’s business transactions have reached 85% of the pre-COVID-19 levels. The use of non-banking channels like Internet banking and mobile banking by customers was one of the reasons, said managing director and chief executive officer N. Kamakodi . Edited excerpts:  How did you tackle the challenges during the pandemic? As banks come under essential service, we had to work even during the lockdown. Most of our staff members faced challenges in attending work due to lack of road transport and public transport system. We had asked our customers to make transactions via Internet and mobile banking. By coming to the branches, they were putting themselves and staff members at risk. It was a challenging period and the team rose up to the occasion and managed the situation. Have you returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in transactions? The business transactions have reached 85% of last year’s level. It is improving month-on-month as our customers are doing transactions through non-banking channels too. How many of your clients availed the moratorium? We extended the option to all the borrowers. At the end of June, [customers] accounts covering about 70% of the loan book, paid amount in full or in four instalments. Only 12% of our exposure [customers] used the moratorium fully and did not pay even a single instalment during that period. How did you manage to keep staff in attendance while ensuring their safety? We followed all government norms. Wearing masks was compulsory. We disinfected all Automated Teller Machines and strictly followed social distancing. We strictly followed government norms of allowing 35% and 50% of staff to work on rotation and others worked from home. We encouraged customers to use non-banking channels like Internet banking and mobile banking. So, all these measures to a great extent protected our people. Out of the 700 branches, 110 staffers got affected by the virus. Unfortunately, we lost one person, while the rest of our staff recovered. What is the new normal like? Customer utilisation of Internet banking and mobile banking has increased. Regular meetings and staff meetings are happening through video-conferencing. Most of the customer meetings and investors’ meetings have also started to happen through video-conferencing. Physical travel has reduced to a great extent. Looks like the adoption of technology will be increasing as we pass the lockdown. CUB focuses mainly on retail sector lending. Is that why the NPA levels are low? It [retail lending] helped in a way by protecting us against increase in bad assets. As of June 30, 2020, our gross NPA stands at 3.90% and net NPA at 2.11%. What were the CSR activities done through this period? We donated to the PM Cares Fund and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Fund. More than that, we supported the Thanjavur administration by donating bedsheets and blankets to COVID-19 patients. We continued our usual services on a few of our water conservation projects like deepening of lakes in the Cauvery delta during the lockdown. What were the innovations during this period? Among private banks, CUB is known for introducing innovations. Earlier, people used to come to the bank to open accounts. Now, we have introduced Video Know Your Customer (V-KYC). It is picking up. Almost all transactions are happening via digital or non-banking channels and it stands at 90% today. What about network expansion? Last year, we opened 50 branches. For the current year, we have decided to put branch expansion on hold. We will evaluate it once the pandemic is over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/back-to-85-of-pre-covid-19-transaction-levels-at-cub/article32763497.ece

Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that India was organising a conference on AI, RAISE 2020, which would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday evening. National e-Governance Division (NeGD) and MyGov CEO Abhishek Singh said that the ministry of information technology (Meity) would soon approach the Cabinet for a policy to introduce AI-based programmes. Within 60 days Mr. Kant said that details of the proposal could not be discussed but added that he expected the policy to be in place within 60 days. “It will not be appropriate to talk at length at this stage because it is going to the Cabinet but hopefully we should have approval within a month or so. We have already got approval of the expenditure finance committee and [Meity] will drive the proposal. Give us another 60 days,” Mr. Kant said. Problem solving Meity Secretary Ajay Sawhney said that the AI would bring tremendous opportunity for India if the talent pool that the country has is used to solve various problems by using the technology. Mr. Singh said that AI would be used for natural language processing which could end the problem of communication by ending the language barrier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/meity-to-seek-cabinet-nod-for-policy-on-ai-based-solutions/article32763503.ece

He exhorted exporters and the industry as a whole to target $1 trillion worth of shipments. “Why can’t we aim for $1 trillion exports from India. We certainly can. I see no reason, [why] we cannot. For that we need to be clear on actionable items [and] subsidies are never going to get us there, I am very very clear about that,” he said. “At least in my six years of engagement, I have not found subsidies to be the solution for India’s problems. I think it’s quality, technology, growth, scale; and sometimes for a short period you may need to give a little thrust or support. But if they are looking at literally running a long term engagement with the world on subsidy, it is not going to work,” he said, speaking at a webinar on strategies for alleviating policy constraints for exports in select sectors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/quality-scale-will-help-lift-exports-not-subsidies/article32763505.ece

Later Dominic Calvert-Lewin became Everton’s first player to score in the opening four matches of a Premier League season as it beat Brighton 4-2 on Saturday to keep its perfect start intact. The result left Everton top of the standings on a maximum 12 points from four games. Stubborn defence  It was Chilwell efforts that broke down Palace’s stubborn defence at Stamford Bridge. Chilwell’s thumping finish put Chelsea ahead soon after half-time and he provided the assist for Kurt Zouma’s header as the Blues doubled their lead. Jorginho added a pair of late penalties for Chelsea to complete the rout, although the second caused some angst for Tammy Abraham as the Blues striker argued with Cesar Azpilicueta about who should take it before losing the heated debate with his captain.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Capitals win power-hitting battle||Kolkata Knight Riders’ Eoin Morgan (44, 18b, 1x4, 5x6) and Rahul Tripathi (36, 16b, 3x4, 3x6) turned a stiff chase into an exhibition of power-hitting, but their side fell 18 runs short of Delhi Capitals’ 228 in an IPL encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday. With KKR reeling at 122 for six, Morgan and Tripathi brought the team back into contention with a pulsating 78-run stand. Morgan was particularly severe on Kagiso Rabada (one for 51), hitting him for a hat-trick of sixes in the 18th over, after Tripathi had collected 22 off Marcus Stoinis in the previous over. However, Anrich Nortje's dismissal of Morgan followed by Tripathi's wicket in the final over bowled by Stoinis saw DC home. Losing Narine early KKR suffered an early setback when it lost opener Sunil Narine in the second over. But Shubman Gill (28, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) and Nitish Rana (58, 35b, 4x4, 4x6) were unfazed and accumulated 59 runs in the first six overs. Rana was dropped on 27 by Amit Mishra off his own bowling. But the leggie made amends in his next over, getting Gill caught by Rishabh Pant. Andre Russell briefly entertained, hitting a four and a six off Rabada before the latter got rid of the all-rounder. Harshal Patel then removed Rana and Dinesh Karthik off successive deliveries in the 13th over to make things difficult for KKR. Earlier, after KKR opted to bowl, Shreyas Iyer’s 38-ball 88 (7x4, 6x6) and Prithvi Shaw’s quickfire half-century (66, 41b, 4x4, 4x6) had powered the Capitals to the highest total of this edition. Capitals got off to a brisk start with Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan (26, 16b, 2x4, 2x6) adding 56 for the first wicket. Delhi had raced to 50 in the fifth over before the Kolkata side broke through when Varun Chakravarthy removed Dhawan in the last over of PowerPlay. On the go  However, Shaw continued to flourish. The opener sent a Shivam Mavi delivery over extra-cover for six, and brought up his half-century — his sixth in the IPL — with a six over long-on.  Shaw and Shreyas then waded into Varun in the 12th over, scoring 16 runs. But just as they looked to switch gears, Shaw fell. Pant then scored a quick 38 (17b, 5x4, 1x6) even as Shreyas got his fastest fifty in the IPL (26 balls). The 20 runs the skipper blasted off the last over was worth its weight in gold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shreyas-and-shaw-on-song/article32763607.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Chahal, Padikkal and Kohli star for RCB||Virat Kohli (72 n.o., 53b, 7x4, 2x6) and Devdutt Padikkal (63, 45b, 6x4, 1x6) guided Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a facile eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR), in an IPL encounter at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. The duo helped RCB reach the modest 155-run target with five balls to spare, giving the side a third win in four matches. Kohli, after three failures in this tournament, struck form with a steady knock. With two clean sixes off leg-spinners Riyan Parag and Rahul Tewatia, Kohli showed that he had regained his old touch. Growing reputation Padikkal added to his growing reputation with a third fifty in four matches. The southpaw scored a bulk of his boundaries on the leg-side, with sweetly timed pulls and flicks. The 20-year-old battled cramps late in his knock, before losing his stumps to a fiery yorker from Jofra Archer. Earlier, RR recovered from a shaky start to record a respectable total. Jos Buttler, Steve Smith and Sanju Samson – the three key batsmen – fell cheaply, leaving the side tottering at 31 for three. A low diving catch at slip by Padikkal got rid of the dangerous Buttler (22, 12b, 4x3, 1x6), while leggie Yuzvendra Chahal showed great athleticism to take a tough return catch to dismiss Samson.  Robin Uthappa (17, 22b, 1x4) and Mahipal Lomror (47, 39b, 1x4, 3x6) rebuilt the innings to a small extent with a 39-run fourth-wicket stand. Chahal then showed his class, taking out Uthappa and Lomror with enticing, flighted deliveries. Neither batsman was able to get under the ball, resulting in catches in the deep. Tewatia (24 n.o., 12b, 3x6) smacked it around, providing vital acceleration at the death. He survived a scare, getting hit flush on the chest by a fast beamer from Navdeep Saini. But Tewatia shook it off, and smashed Saini for sixes off the next two deliveries. Chahal emerged as RCB’s most successful bowler (4-0-24-3), while off-spinner Washington Sundar once again returned miserly figures (4-0-20-0). With an impressive tournament economy rate of 4.72, Washington has emerged as an invaluable part of the RCB bowling attack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chahal-padikkal-and-kohli-star-for-rcb/article32763610.ece

Stokes missed the initial matches as he was in New Zealand to be with his ailing father Ged. The 29-year-old had left for Christchurch in the middle of the Test series against Pakistan in August after his father, a former All Blacks International, was diagnosed with brain cancer.

04 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Warner impressed with Garg, Abhishek and Samad||Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner said on Friday it was nice to see youngsters back themselves after his team defeated Chennai Super Kings. On the fighting partnership of 77 between Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma for the fifth wicket, Warner said, "I asked them what was a good score and they said 150 and we got 164. “These guys assessed the conditions and played really well.” Warner said he had to back 18-year-old Abdul Samad in the final over when they had to defend 27 runs. "I had no option. We tried to kill the game in the 19th over. Could have given it to Abhishek but Samad, with his height, had to bowl the last one," he said. Garg said his confidence had grown after the knock. "The plan was to play my shots and their bowling helped," he said "There was positive energy on the field after such an innings" he said. "I felt very good in there, because it was a big stage with the senior players. “I wasn't thinking too much, just played my natural game," he said. "I think the best thing is the team management backed me after I failed in the first game."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/warner-impressed-with-garg-abhishek-and-samad/article32763656.ece
04 October 2020||London,||United needs to win||Manchester United needs a response on the pitch when Jose Mourinho returns to Old Trafford as Tottenham manager on Sunday to calm the unease of supporters frustrated by a lack of movement in the transfer market. Dutch international midfielder Donny Van de Beek is the only player United has signed in the transfer window so far with Monday’s deadline leaving precious little time for more deals to be concluded. The outcry for new players has not been quietened by United’s poor start to the Premier League season. A 3-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace dampened optimism of a title challenge this season before it escaped a 3-2 victor at Brighton last weekend after the host hit the woodwork five times. Failure to beat a Spurs side playing its fourth game in eight days this weekend will have alarm bells ringing that United risks going backwards this season. Mourinho, meanwhile, has said he has already moaned enough about the club’s packed fixture list and will not use it as an excuse against United Sunday. Eric Dier, Toby Alderweireld and Steven Bergwijn have all started twice in 48 hours this week, while United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fielded a much-changed lineup for Wednesday’s League Cup victory at Brighton. “It’s the last one, the last match,” he told a news conference on Friday. “I don’t want to moan. I moaned enough and I moaned with real things on my hands and I don’t think anyone disagreed with me, even when I was moaning about the situation.” Mourinho said forward Son Heung-min could play a part at Old Trafford after the South Korean recovered from a hamstring injury, which was not as bad as first feared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/united-needs-to-win/article32763659.ece
04 October 2020||DUBAI,||Desperate CSK takes on KXIP||Hit hard by a start that least defines it, Chennai Super Kings would be desperate to find answers to its predicament when its takes on Kings XI Punjab here on Sunday. A misfiring top-order, save Faf du Plessis, combined with inadequate run-flow in the middle overs and the habit of leaving way too much for the climax, has proved to be CSK’s bane in the three consecutive defeats. The team has the resources to turn it around but everything has to come together. The desperation was palpable on skipper Dhoni’s face at the post-match interview. “Long time back once we lost three-in-a-row. We need to get a lot of things right. It is the professionalism. We need to take our catches, not bowl no-balls. Those are the controllables and maybe we are getting too relaxed,” he said. CSK will need one of its top-order batsmen to put runs on the board and run-rate in the middle overs need to be taken care of, too.KXIP skipper K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal have been in top form and the team has scored in excess of 200 twice. But the Punjab side has lost because of limited bowling resources. No one, expect Mohammed Shami, gives an impression of stopping the rival batsmen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/csk-desperate-to-turn-it-around/article32763604.ece
04 October 2020||Sharjah,||MI has the edge over SRH||Boasting an explosive batting line-up that complements effective death-bowling, Mumbai Indians will have the edge in the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Sunday. Adding to SRH’s concerns were the doubts over lead seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s participation. Bhuvneshwar picked up an injury on Friday night and was unable to complete his final over against Chennai Super Kings. Winning combination Mumbai Indians, having humbled a strong Kings XI Punjab in the last game, is unlikely to make any changes to the winning combination. The biggest positive for Mumbai is that its middle-order has finally delivered with Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard launching into opposition attacks. Confidence boost SRH will also take a lot of confidence from its seven-run win over CSK. The team would be hoping that skipper David Warner, Jonny Bairstow and Manish Pandey are among the runs again. Kane Williamson also is a certainty, given his ability to take the innings deep and hold one end up. If Bhuvneshwar misses out, T. Natarajan, Khaleel Ahmed and Rashid Khan will have their task cut out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-indians-has-the-edge/article32763613.ece
04 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Kishan seems to have come of age||He may look younger than most in the Mumbai Indians line-up but Ishan Kishan is a seasoned pro, not just in the defending champion’s set-up but even in the Indian Premier League bandwagon. The former India Under-19 captain is featuring in his fifth IPL season, third with MI. Thanks to his heroics against Royal Challengers Bangalore, a 57-ball 99 that helped MI tie a gargantuan chase, followed by a sedate knock against Kings XI Punjab that set the stage for the big-hitters, Kishan seems to have finally come of age. The left-handed batsman has given indications of having learnt to play according to the situation. “I was not good at playing shots through covers and all but I have worked a lot this off season and if I get the ball over there, I will go for it because it is something that every team plans for you,” Kishan said ahead of Mumbai Indians’ weekend clash against Sunrisers. Practice is key “They have meetings before the match, they know what is the weak spot and where they have to bowl to us, but it is important for us to practise about that in the off-season.” Kishan admitted that being around the likes of Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya has helped him learn how to peg a bowler back and rotate strike but hoped that the smaller boundaries at Sharjah would mean boundaries will continue to be higher on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kishan-seems-to-have-come-of-age/article32763653.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||CSK fails in chase again||A week’s break seemed to have made little difference to Chennai Super Kings, as it slumped to its third straight defeat in four matches, losing by seven runs to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday. Chasing a target of 165, the CSK batsmen looked all at sea against a disciplined Sunrisers attack. It got off to a poor start with Shane Watson (1) and Ambati Rayudu (8) falling cheaply. Rashid Khan and Abdul Samad then applied the squeeze in the middle overs to suffocate M.S. Dhoni's men. Only Faf du Plessis looked like forcing the issue, hitting four boundaries in a 19-ball 22, but he was run out.  Kedar Jadhav, Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja struggled against the spinners with the score reading 44 for four at the halfway stage. After taking 18 balls to get his first boundary, Jadeja did produce a late blitz (50, 35b, 5x4, 2x6) with skipper Dhoni remaining unbeaten on 47 off 36 balls. But it was too little too late.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/csk-fails-in-chase-again/article32763600.ece

They are the first Lakers duo to score 60 points in a Finals game since O’Neal and Bryant achieved the feat in 2002 . James recalled watching the Kobe-Shaq pairing when he was a high school star. James said that his and Davis’s roles in the team can’t be precisely compared to those of Shaq and Kobe. Davis agreed that any likeness was more to do with attitude than style of play.  The result: Heat 114 (Butler 25, Olynyk 24) lost to Lakers 124 (James 33, Davis 32). Lakers 2-0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/encore-by-james-davis/article32763651.ece

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The camera sees all||A strip of cloud cut across the sun, over a grand old dormant volcano in Mauritius — a beautiful setting for a picture, thought Pranav Lal, on honeymoon with his wife Sacheta. Being born blind has not stopped this Delhi-based cybersecurity specialist from choosing photography as his hobby. Pranav is in fact one among a surprising number of amateur photographers with visual impairments in India. “The thrill of taking photographs for me is my desire to perceive what I can’t touch. Landscapes, the sky and its clouds, faraway hills and mountain peaks with snow,” says Pranav. He perceives beauty through the sense of sound, using a software, vOICe vision technology, whcih facilitates an augmented reality on his pair of glasses. “It is like an artificial eye, and it works on two levels. First, it takes live camera views and translates them to a defined set of sounds,” explains Pranav. So images are converted into stereo sound by scanning them from left to right — the brighter the object, the louder the sound; the greater the elevation, the higher the pitch. “The second level uses neuroscience. The sound gets converted into electrical impulses in the brain. Your brain cells don’t care where they are getting that data from. When it receives that data, the specialised neurons re-recruit themselves for vision,” he says, explaining how he sees in illusory flashes. “Once I see what I like, I press click on my smartphone camera,” says Pranav. The contrast in light is why he loves taking pictures of landscapes and structures. “Water especially gives you a lot of scope to play with reflections. If the light falls on it differently, it will be an entirely different picture,” he says. Current bionic eyes place such microelectrodes near the optical nerve to create visuals inside the brain. Mumbai-based Bhavesh Patel, however, uses no such advanced equipment for his photography. Yet, he is India’s only fully blind photographer to have shot commercial projects. Bhavesh has always been interested in the creative fields, especially art. “I studied in a school in Worli until I was 15, and I remember there was this art gallery nearby. I would go with my uncle and he would visually describe what was there in those paintings.” In 2009, he had his first tryst with photography, thanks to a group, Blind With Camera, helmed by photographer Partho Bhowmick. “He introduced me to a basic Kodak camera. We clicked pictures of the pigeons in Dadar. Whenever they flapped their wings, we would point and shoot,” he says. Capturing imagination When Bhavesh had those developed pictures described to him, it took him back to his childhood memories with his uncle. “It captured my imagination,” he says. From that first photo of the pigeons taking flight, he moved on to take pictures of actor Katrina Kaif, and got paid for it. “That was mostly done with the help of other sighted photographers, who adjusted the lighting and the environment. I had to sense where she was positioned and what she was doing, and click according to that,” he says. However, with an Oppo, the shoot was more dynamic. “We travelled to different locations in Delhi to capture different scenarios with an Oppo smartphone,” Bhavesh says. Under Blind With Camera, many others like Bhavesh have been experimenting with photography as a hobby. Its founder, Partho, claims to have introduced the camera to over 1,500 Indians with visual disabilities. The group also raises awareness by holding workshops for the sighted in which they are blindfolded and taught to use the camera by people with vision impairments. One such workshop conducted in Hyderabad was with automaker Mercedes-Benz, for potential buyers. Vivek Yeralkar, from the group, acted as the mentor, instructing students to use their sense of sound to capture pictures of cars zooming on tracks at a speed of 90 kilometres per hour.  Staying focussed  Completely blind in one eye and with 10% vision in the other, Vivek used to be a photographer — he recalls the local awards he won with great joy — before he lost his vision due to retinal detachment in 1992. “Back then I was in Thane, working as an engineer. I would use Vernier callipers and micrometers, but one day I couldn’t see the readings properly.” Several visits to the doctor and a surgery did not help, and he moved back to his parents’ home in Pune. After getting back on his feet with some computer training and learning to use screen readers, Vivek heard of a Blind With Camera workshop in Goa in 2010. Since then, he has been reacquainted with the lens. His favourite memory is that of the Kaas Plateau in Satara, where he went two years ago with his son. “There were flowers of so many colours, yellow, violet, orange,” Vivek says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-camera-sees-all/article32763830.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Becoming a child||The pandemic, the passing on of people we know or have heard about, the uncertainty that is gripping us, is surely beginning to dent our faith. Yet the truth is we can do little to arrest the fear, but we can help ourselves and those around us through these ‘dark days’ with some amount of equanimity. How can we do that? When talking to a friend who has just lost his mother, as I have my mine, he said to me, quoting his young daughter, “Pa,if God is alive so is grandma, for she has gone to God.” I was touched. A saying from my childhood reminds me that ‘To enter the kingdom of Heaven we must become little children’. The realistic interpretation of this comment is not about being innocent; it is about the ability to play. Children seem to concentrate wholeheartedly and unselfconsciously on doing things for fun. Being young at heart to me therefore does not mean a refusal to admit what is happening. It means being able to enter into the happy spirit of play. It means regaining light-heartedness which age and worry does not compel us to outgrow. To cope or better still tide over what each of us is going through, it may be sensible to ‘make good’ what is around us, the little joys. For this we need faith, and faith is freely available if we choose to embrace it. The writer is an organisational and behavioural consultant.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Suicide has come home?||Trigger warning: The following text is about suicide, which may be upsetting to some people.  When the COVID-19-induced lockdown began, and we were still getting used to working from home, a friend told me they were in a dark space. “Did I ever tell you,” they said, “that I once attempted suicide?” Journalists are trained to listen, and so I did, to a successful writer who engages with the world readily, whose eyes come alive when they speak, who is always enthusiastic, loves the family dearly, and will go out of their way to get a quality kebab. I will not give you the details of their attempt, because we’re not supposed to, under the World Health Organization’s guidelines on writing about suicide, lest it sets off copycat suicides in people. For many of us, suicide may be restricted to a thought, a habit to lapse into, to fantasise about, each time a situation is too difficult to find a solution to. And therein lies the problem. From the time we are very young, we are told to find solutions. Our society is solution-driven, like somehow if you don’t find one there is something wrong with you. The maths problem, the financial situation, the alcohol addiction — they all needed solutions, often with minimal support and little empathy. Suicide does not have a single cause — it is not about a girlfriend swindling you of some money, or a friend supplying you with drugs, or even a mental health condition alone. Sure, the careful contemplation of someone with depression, or the impulsive decision of someone with a personality disorder may be the ultimate cause of a person taking their life, but it is really an erosion of resilience over a long period, of not being heard, of a deep sense of loneliness. Suicide is about you, me, our parents, children, teachers, governments, neighbours, friends, schools and colleges, workplaces, religious and financial institutions — the systems and relationships on which we build our lives. It is not about ‘fixing’ anything. It is about listening, acknowledging, and simply asking the question: what can I do to change this reality, so no one is pushed to the edge? It is not about saying, “Oh but he was always smiling.” Because people — even those who contemplate suicide —have moments where they enjoy life, and many more where they wear masks. It is about offering a friendly ear of course, but equally about acknowledging that each of us is a part of the problem. India, we have been told repeatedly, is a collectivist society, always offering support. It’s time to live out our claims. Then, the ‘solution’ will take care of itself.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Are you ready to kolam podu for CSK?||If you are a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fan then you would certainly be aware of “whistlepodu” – a catchphrase and a battlecry for fans cheering for their team. This IPL season, a Chennai-based group is giving this slogan a twist — kolam podu it is. Fresh from the oven, this catchphrase seeks to achieve two purposes — extend support to CSK and while doing so, draw attention to the traditional art form of Kolam drawing. With fast-paced urban life leaving people strapped for time, the enthusiasm for kolam drawing is waning in metros. (For the uniformed and initiated, kolam drawing is carried out with rice power or chalk). Initiated by Kolam Podu — a YouTube channel established to revive, demystify and educate people about the art of drawing kolams — its latest campaign is smart and peppy, and drawing people to take a fresh look at the designs in front of houses. The strategy is obvious — use the IPL fever and the love for CSK to get people to think and talk about kolams . The significant part is that it encourages CSK fans to go beyond thinking about kolams and actually draw one to demonstrate their support for the team. The ultimate goal is that it would want people doing whatever they could to revive kolam drawing in the ways they deem fit  Chennai Super Kingskku periya kolam podu/ Tamil Naatu stylela sikku kolam podu/ Namma ooru baaniyila valaichu valaichu podu/ Namma singham dhonikku sokka kolam podu… so goes the first four lines. “We have picked words from kolam and cricket to create a video; it has music by Swaminathan Selvaganesh, son of Vikku Vinayakram,” says Bhargavii Mani, who leads Kolam Podu. For example, sikku is a style of kolam that the YouTube channel presents in much detail. Taking us through the campaign, Bhargavii says that after the song was ready, it was about figuring out how to engage audiences. “Through my circle of friends, I reached out to a few dance schools and asked them to come up with their own dance version of the song. The brief was simple: download our song and choreograph it the way you want to and send us your version,” says Bhargavii. Kolam Podu plans to upload a new video every week based on the responses they get. “If cricket brings people together then let’s also try it through kolams ,” she says. They are also creating GIFs to promote the traditional art form. There is a strong motivation for Bhargavii to promote kolams . Following a medical emergency two years ago, she started drawing kolams as therapy, physical and psychological. She had a stoke which led to loss of mobility for a few days. “I lost a significant part of my memory too,” she says. Turning to kolams slowly helped her bounce back. “Kolam Podu was more like a happy project that I had started to get out of it and I want others to enjoy the benefits it has to offer,” she says.

The non-profit is in need of monetary and material help to support the scale of work it is undertaking in various states. Urgently-required material include clothes, woollen blankets, dry ration, school material, toys, utensils and usable electronic device like mobiles, laptops and desktops. Goonj encourages communities to take the lead in organising a collection drive. The volunteer is required to create awareness through posters, spread the word, allot a day when a truck can be parked in front of the society gate for a few hours.         Thepandemic has driven home the necessity of keeping our homes and surrounding areas absolutely clean. Bhumi shows how this can be achieved, through what it calls ‘Cleanup Drive with a Twist’. It wants the volunteer to choose a spot near their street or home, mobilise a small group of volunteers and and spruce up the place. Remember to wear masks, follow social distancing and for tips on how raise a small team for the clean-up, seek Bhumi’s help. Plastic2brick is another campaign, and it comes with the option of individual or group effort. Collect the plastic items from the home to build something useful. Or, help the team ‘Empower a local street vendor’ by pining their location in Google, getting them a Paytm account, creating a catchy placard, share in local social media networks or give them simple marketing tips. **     Started by a group of citizens in Mumbai, Pad Squad is an initiative that aims to distribute sanitary pads across the respective cities where the drive has been initiated. It wants residents to take charge of the initiative from the stage of campaigning to distribution. “We have 56 squads across the country since we started this initiative in June this year, Bengaluru being one of the active cities. We do not accept cash but only want donation to be in the form of sanitary pads,” says Chhitra Subramaniam, co-founder. She says an apartment complex or community could volunteer by setting up a ‘Pad Peti’, collect donations of sanitary pads and distribute them to economically weaker sections of society during the Daan Utsav. **       Pledge your support to United Way Chennai that is organising a virtual marathon fundraiser. Participants can walk, run or cycle over a specific distance during the Daan Utsav week to help street vendors that are affected by the pandemic. All that is required of the volunteer is to pledge a distance and cover it. You can track your progress using any fitness app and submit the details via email (info@unitedwaychennai.org). As part of the #UnitedForStreetVendors campaign, United Way Chennai has been providing financial assistance to these families.         The festival of giving is open to all, and everyone can celebrate it the way they deem fit. If your apartment complex or neighbourhood has organised a drive then we would like to hear from you.

In fact, grandparents are thriving as storytellers, getting more “air time” than ever before. Now, as parents grapple with the challenges of working or working from home in a pandemic situation, stay-at-home children are often left to their own “devices” — actually, their parents’ devices. The fact that classes are now parked online does not help matters — there is too much screen time and it is doing little Johnny no good. And a roll of storytelling honour at a gated community in Sholinganallur gives a reason to believe that grandparents are stepping up to the plate. “Though grey hair is no criterion for choosing our storytellers, it so happens that in recent weeks, when we had revived our storytelling programme, nearly ninety percent of the storytellers have been seniors,” says Supriya Santhanam, a resident of The Central Park South (TCPS) and volunteer-in-charge of a library at the community. The programme in question is “Stories Beneath The Clouds”, an in-person open-air storytelling component of TCPS’ library outreach, that has now been partially revived, stringent safety protocols in place, to tackle children’s gadget addiction during the pandemic. Besides, grandparents at the community have raised their hands seeking to be included in a listening circle on parenting. This programme takes place once in two weeks on the terrace, following safety protocols. Bindu Unnikrishan, who handles this programme as facilitator, in association with the library team, explains, “Initially, we started off with parents, and then we had grandparents also expressing their interest to participate in the circle. We felt that this was important, and that it would help every parenting discussion if grandparents brought their own generational light to it. We have grandparents who have shared their experiences, particularly about how parenting has changed — for a grandparent, how their children grew up and how their grandchildren are growing up are different. So, when they listen to parents (other than their own children), these grandparents become aware of new perspectives. Similarly, parents participating in the listening circle, get the perspectives of grandparents (other than what they have heard from their parents).” Supriya points out that the listening circle has so far had five meet-ups, and its scope has now considerably widened. Says Bindu, “The listening circle offers a safe space for parents and grandparents to discuss various topics related to parenting and learn from each other. It is a non-judgemental space where participants go back home with takeaways that they can customise for their family. What is discussed in the circle stays within the circle.” Meet these storytellers Now, let us get back to the open-air storytelling space — sometimes the poolside, andsometimes the terrace. There, a few senior storytellers from the community would tell you why it is necessary to continue telling those stories to children, in the middle of a pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-fine-art-of-community-grandparenting/article32763981.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Life looks up after encounter with COVID-19||Eight one-year-old V. Parvathy is having a busy Monday, but she complains of unfinished work. “I usually complete writing a page of the narayaneeyanam by late evening, but today I have managed only half of what I would have achieved by this hour,” says the retired librarian. If she was upset that the telephonic interview was eating further into her routine, she would not show it. “Today I had so many calls enquiring about my health and also my fellow residents,” says Parvathy aachi as she is known by those close to her. Parvathy aachi is one of 29 residents of Anandam, a free home for senior citizens, who were in the news recently for how they beat COVID-19, having recovered from it after treatment at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. What is remarkable is that 25 of them are aged above 70 and have multiple comorbidities. At present, these 29 residents are isolating themselves, staying at a student hostel a short jog from Anandam in Ambattur. Anandam has 105 residents. Parvathy aachi recites a list of activities she has been a part of, and they include kanji preparation for the group and helping wash clothes. Those asked if the COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent hospitalisation caused them anxiety answer in the negative. “There is nothing to worry about; be positive. We have seen many things in life and this phase will also pass. Keep yourself occupied doing things you like,” says N.Saraswathi, who is 76 years. She is in-charge of planning and coordinating the kitchen activities, including choosing the menu. Away from the home now, she is missing this role. At the student hostel they are staying at, they can’t do any major cooking. At Anandam, residents are encouraged to take care of the home, assisting in a variety of chores, including cooking, managing the kitchen garden and cleaning. “We have four to five people above 90 years with us and those of us who are healthier than others, take care of these residents. We avoid discussing the latest news, and instead choose to talk about the good old times,” says Parvathy. Ram P. Mony, manager (admin), says, “Earlier, not all of them would take the instructions seriously, now they do. They would not tell me if they are having body pain, now they have understood the importance of timely intervention. The fussy eaters have also changed, post-hospitalisation, as they know they have to eat healthy.” Between managing the activities at the Home, Ram would sometimes forgets to take his kashayam . “Now they are behind me, ensuring I take it,” he says. Every one-and-a-half hours, residents prepare some health drink — buttermilk, lemon juice and kabasuru kudineer . “We persuade those who don’t particularly like to take these health drinks to do so,” says Parvathy. She says evening coffee has been replaced with sukku malli coffee. There is also greater interest in acupressure. Bhageerathy Ramamoorthy, managing trustee of Andanam, says the seniors have been able to come out of the crisis because of the healthy habits they have been following, and healthy food habits among them. “Now, we have employed a nurse to check on them regularly. Thrice a day I call them, plus they have the doctor calling them. It’s a big joint family and this continues at the new place we have rented for a month,” she says. These seniors point out that they have always taken the necessary precautions, but now they wouldn’t mind erring on the side of caution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/life-looks-up-after-encounter-with-covid-19/article32763983.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A tank all set for monsoon duty||On the last leg of a restoration exercise, a Corporation-maintained tank near at the intersection of Kazura Garden First Street and East Coast Road in Neelankarai signals the logical end of a 15-year-long struggle by Kazura Garden Welfare Association. Ellai Kuttai, being restored now by Greater Chennai Corporation, was plagued by encroachments — tea stalls, mechanic workshops, an old paper mart and a meat shop among them — which were pulled down by the Revenue Department in 2019. Ellai Kuttai is one of the 20 waterbodies identified by the Greater Chennai Corporation for restoration, ahead of the north-east monsoon. By rejuvenating these waterbodies, the civic body hopes to check flooding in these areas. According to Zone 15 officials, the tank’s restoration began in December 2019. And it has been de-silted and deepened up to 15 feet. Walls have been constructed around the tank. A walkway and benches will be provided. Besides, tree saplings will be planted. The work should get completed by the end of October. Excess rainwater from East Coast Road will flow into the waterbody, recharging the ground water table. The road leading from Kazura Garden First Street and connecting to East Coast Road has a incline which will ensure the water flows into the tank. There is a proposal to create an outlet channel and linking it to the Buckingham Canal. If this provision is created, excess rainwater from the waterbody will flow into the Canal, add Zone 15 officials. “Exploring the causes behind flooding in the locality led us to Ellai Kuttai. Encroachments had robbed it of its function as a natural storage facility for rainwater. In fact, the tank was ‘missing’. Our efforts to revive the tank began in 2005, and we succeeded in the mission by taking the issue to the court and after a protracted struggle,” says 73-year-old Srilakshmi Mohan Rao, vice-president, Kazura Garden Welfare Association. With its restoration almost complete, this tank should finally serve its main purpose, this monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-tank-all-set-for-monsoon-duty/article32763973.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Madipakkam North East residents carry out a survey of stormwater drains||Madipakkam North East Residents’ Welfare Association (MNERWA) has placed three requests with Zone 14 (Perungudi) of Greater Chennai Corporation. One, desilting existing stormwater drains (SWDs) made sluggish by dumping of garbage, before the onset of the North-East Monsoon. Request number two can’t be brought to fruition before the monsoon, but nevertheless residents can’t keep from highlighting it. They report that many areas in Madipakkam lack stormwater drains, a factor adversely impacting the process of rainwater being carried from Madipakkam North East to the Pallikaranai Marsh through Kaiveli. “Only Ram Nagar and Kuberan Nagar have stormwater drains. The rest of the localities, which include Madipakkam Enfield Avenue, Anna Nagar, Karpagambal Nagar, Lakshmi Nagar, Thanthai Periyar Nagar, Ramamurthy Nagar, Vishal Nagar, Krishna Nagar and Arul Murugan Nagar don’t,” says M. Anbalagan, president, MNERWA. The third request has to do with the home stretch, about taking the SWDs to all the homes, and thereby making the SWD network complete. Now. the network is patchy, lacking interconnectedness. “In Rajaji Nagar and Sadasiva Nagar, only some streets have SWDs, which means there is still waterlogging in these neighbourhoods,” says Anbalagan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/madipakkam-north-east-residents-carry-out-a-survey-of-stormwater-drains/article32763970.ece

The section stretches from the intersection of Lattice Bridge Road, Sardar Patel Road and Durgabai Deshmukh Road to Adyar Telephone Exchange. Residents allege that the road work has been carried out without adhering to expected milling standards. The height of the road has increased and consequently, the pavement on the western side of the road has ‘sunk’. “Motorists will now find it convenient to park their vehicles on the pavement. Motorcyclists will misuse it by riding over it,” says T. D. Babu, a long-time resident and founder of citizens’ forum Spark. “Thanks to this road-laying work, the median has become shorter and pedestrians will feel encouraged to step on to the median and cross the road at undesignated spots.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/road-rises-median-dips/article32763968.ece

However, it is being reported that in some of these places, while carryiny out its work, Tangedco ends up unwittingly damaging existing sewage and water pipes of Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). Besides, power cable connections for individual houses have been damaged.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A peek into the workings of a group formed to help seniors||Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association has constituted a team of dedicated volunteers who would attend to the everyday concerns of senior citizens, during the pandemic. And Association would fight the seniors’ battle. There has been sufficient evidence of both. Through Google Groups, the volunteers stay connected to beneficiary-seniors. The seniors can easily contact the 15 volunteers, which include Archana Hari, Krishna Mohan, Krithika Vishwanathan, Vaishnavi Acharya, Akshar Jaikumar, and Ankit Mohota, as the latter’s addresses, phone numbers and email IDs are shared on Google Groups. The seniors can contact the volunteers any time of the day, says Association general secretary Shanthi Krishnan who heads the group. These volunteers have been helping senior-citizens and super-senior citizens get essential provisions, medicines and vegetables. They spend out of their pocket to buy what the seniors need, and the seniors would repay them when the bills are presented. Whenever a senior needs certain work to be carried out with a government agency, this group does the coordination work. “I coordinate with Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). We have been receiving excellent support from the GCC. Deenadayalan, assistant engineer, Ward 181, and sanitary inspector Naveen, are particularly in regular touch with us, rendering all the required help. Many a time, with the help and support of GCC, we have guided senior-citizens, maids and security guards to nearby COVID-19 testing centres,” says Shanthi Krishnan. When the functions of a bank located on the premises of Kalakshetra Colony were going to be merged with those of two other branch banks — the savings account going to a branch located at Besant Nagar, and locker facility to a branch located East Coast Road — the Association took up the issue. This bank at Kalakshetra Colony was a boon to senior citizens. As many seniors were operating their accounts there, they would have to travel to the branches to draw cash, bring jewels from the locker and for other bank-related works. “Upon hearing the proposed move, we took up the issue with the authorities concerned at the higher-level, and stalled it. At present, we are helping the bank staff identify a new premises for the branch, inside the colony,” points out Krishnan. “Ever since it was formed, KCWA has kept helping seniors citizens and super senior-citizens as one of its main objectives.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-peek-into-the-workings-of-a-group-formed-to-help-seniors/article32763998.ece

Ramachandran did not quite relish the thought that he would have to continue staying all alone in a room except when medical personnel and support staff would attend to him. What COVID-19 could do to him did not grip him as intensely as the fear of loneliness. “Having been placed in a separate room with no one to see and talk to, I was frustrated. The hospital took utmost care of me, making my stay extremely comfortable, but the thought of having to spend the days without anyone's company was disturbing,” says Ramachandran, who is 86 years old. Knowing how much he loved to be around people, friends and relatives knew exactly how hard it was for him. At his apartment complex in Vadapalani, Ramachandran is known as ‘photo maama’ for his passion for photography, and also his efficiency in it. Thanks to this skill and his amiable nature, he would invariably get invited to a birthday party any neighbour at the complex would be organising for their child. Ramachandran was famous for striking up a conversation with strangers. After every evening walk in the neighbourhood, his circle of acquaintances would get wider. “ Tatha loves to socialise and he would engage even with random persons,” says his grandson Rohith Kannan, a house surgeon. From the word go, it was obvious Ramachandran would not be able to adjust to a private-room arrangement. “In my frustration, I told a nurse ‘I think I will die’ and what I had said had been discussed. As the oldest among the COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, there was already enough attention coming my way. Now, there was more attention. The next day the doctor who came to check on me opened the topic. The doctor chuckled and asked me my birth star and declared that I would live for 100 years,” Ramachandran laughs recalling how the doctor tried to cheer him up. Within the next couple of hours, Ramachandran was shifted to a three-sharing room. “My oxygen level that was fluctuating had stabilised by then,” says Ramachandran. The fact that one of the two was his grandson's classmate, Reshma, brought a cheer in him. Two days after Reshma was discharged, Ramachandran also left the hospital, having recovered from COVID-19. “But I was asked to be in home quarantine, and so I locked myself up in my room. This time, I did it voluntarily to avoid the risk of my wife and grandson getting infected,” he says. Of course, he still found company, this time in books and classical music. The octogenarian says he has returned to following his usual routine, but with greater cautiousness. Ramachandran says, “My apartment complex has no lift, so I have always been used to climbing the 72 stairs multiple times. I think all this keeps me fit and healthy, along with my will power, has helped me fight the virus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/an-octogenarians-diary/article32763986.ece

They also report the problem of low-hanging overhead cables on the footpath where the traffic flow is towards Pallikaranai. Besides, motorists point out that the surface of the carriageway — towards towards Pallikaranai and Velachery — is uneven. “Years ago, the State Highways Department relaid the road overbridge.

What is interesting is that parents, students and the dance teacher collaborated optimally, though the time at their disposal was short, to submit the video to Kollam Podu, which is running a campaign to promote the art of kolam . “An average Bharatanatyam recital is four minutes long and here we had to shorten it to around 1 minute 14 seconds which was a huge challenge for us in the three days given to us,” says Vanishree Ravishankar, who runs Natya Samarpanam, located in Besant Nagar. She choreographed the dance with her daughter Madhuvanthi Muliya. Since the lockdown, the school has not been conducting classes on its premises and they had to quickly assemble a team for the shoot. Seven students were ready for the rehearsal. On Sunday morning, they short the video on the terrace of a student’s house in Kasturibai Nagar. Two of the parents shot the video and Vanishree’s daughter did the editing. Vanishree says, “On Sunday night it was uploaded and we are happy with the results of this collaborative work.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-collaborative-effort/article32764000.ece

She often turns to painting and tailoring to beat the lockdown blues. There is now a social element to her pursuit of tailoring as a hobby. She has stitched and distributed three-layered cloth masks to relatives, friends and conservancy workers for free. Earlier, she would use her tailoring skills primarily for stitching herself blouses. At Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, where she lives, she is known as “Kovil Pati”, as she frequents this temple, not a day passing without a visit in the morning and another in the evening. She helps out in the temple. Due to the pandemic, this routine has taken a beating. Being a senior-citizen, she had been confining herself to the safety of her home. Only since September 1, when lockdown restrictions were significantly relaxed, has she been visiting the temple. Considering her safety, her family ensures these visits are not frequent. Nor is she allowed to spend as much time at the temple as before. Passion for painting Her son S. Kumararaja, a civic activist, says, “Now she spends much of her time drawing, painting and stitching. Even at this age she does Tanjore painting and glass painting. She learnt the art of drawing from her father who was a drawing master in a school and a freedom fighter.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Are you ready to kolam podu for CSK?||If you are a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fan then you would certainly be aware of “whistlepodu” – a catchphrase and a battlecry for fans cheering for their team. This IPL season, a Chennai-based group is giving this slogan a twist — kolam podu it is. Fresh from the oven, this catchphrase seeks to achieve two purposes — extend support to CSK and while doing so, draw attention to the traditional art form of Kolam drawing. With fast-paced urban life leaving people strapped for time, the enthusiasm for kolam drawing is waning in metros. (For the uniformed and initiated, kolam drawing is carried out with rice power or chalk). Initiated by Kolam Podu — a YouTube channel established to revive, demystify and educate people about the art of drawing kolams — its latest campaign is smart and peppy, and drawing people to take a fresh look at the designs in front of houses. The strategy is obvious — use the IPL fever and the love for CSK to get people to think and talk about kolams . The significant part is that it encourages CSK fans to go beyond thinking about kolams and actually draw one to demonstrate their support for the team. The ultimate goal is that it would want people doing whatever they could to revive kolam drawing in the ways they deem fit  Chennai Super Kingskku periya kolam podu/ Tamil Naatu stylela sikku kolam podu/ Namma ooru baaniyila valaichu valaichu podu/ Namma singham dhonikku sokka kolam podu… so goes the first four lines. “We have picked words from kolam and cricket to create a video; it has music by Swaminathan Selvaganesh, son of Vikku Vinayakram,” says Bhargavii Mani, who leads Kolam Podu. For example, sikku is a style of kolam that the YouTube channel presents in much detail. Taking us through the campaign, Bhargavii says that after the song was ready, it was about figuring out how to engage audiences. “Through my circle of friends, I reached out to a few dance schools and asked them to come up with their own dance version of the song. The brief was simple: download our song and choreograph it the way you want to and send us your version,” says Bhargavii. Kolam Podu plans to upload a new video every week based on the responses they get. “If cricket brings people together then let’s also try it through kolams ,” she says. They are also creating GIFs to promote the traditional art form. There is a strong motivation for Bhargavii to promote kolams . Following a medical emergency two years ago, she started drawing kolams as therapy, physical and psychological. She had a stoke which led to loss of mobility for a few days. “I lost a significant part of my memory too,” she says. Turning to kolams slowly helped her bounce back. “Kolam Podu was more like a happy project that I had started to get out of it and I want others to enjoy the benefits it has to offer,” she says.

Nearly a month ago, two-way movement of vehicles on this service lane of Jawaharlal Nehru Road (J.N) Main Road was temporarily discontinued to facilitate Metrowater’s water pipeline work. The existing one-way traffic arrangement on the service lane is resulting in congestion of interior roads and lanes, where vehicular flow seems continual. The interior roads most affected on account of unregulated traffic include 13th, 14th, 15th Main Road, Sixth Avenue Road and Fourth Avenue Road. These roads connect the residential sections of the locality with the Anna Nagar roundtana via Second Avenue Main Road. As part of the pipeline-laying work, existing decades-old pipelines are being replaced with new pipelines that can carry more volume of water to the neighbourhood including its tail-end areas. The new pipelines are being laid along the footpath on the service lane towards Koyambedu from Thirumangalam for a distance of around 350 metres. “Traffic violations on these narrow lanes, especially those involving motorcyclists driving on the wrong side, are putting pedestrians at risk of accidents. Continual movement of vehicles including MTC buses also restricts residents from going from one street to another for their shopping needs,” says K. Vasanthi, a resident of Anna Nagar. In the past, residents of Anna Nagar East had put up with the work undertaken for Metro Rail stations.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Giving and caring in the midst of a pandemic||If you are staying in a society and ready to organise a drive to collect material resources for the benefit of the underprivileged, then Goonj is ready to arrange a pick-up of the collected material from your place between October 10 and 30. The non-profit is in need of monetary and material help to support the scale of work it is undertaking in various states. Urgently-required material include clothes, woollen blankets, dry ration, school material, toys, utensils and usable electronic device like mobiles, laptops and desktops. Goonj encourages communities to take the lead in organising a collection drive. The volunteer is required to create awareness through posters, spread the word, allot a day when a truck can be parked in front of the society gate for a few hours.         Thepandemic has driven home the necessity of keeping our homes and surrounding areas absolutely clean. Bhumi shows how this can be achieved, through what it calls ‘Cleanup Drive with a Twist’. It wants the volunteer to choose a spot near their street or home, mobilise a small group of volunteers and and spruce up the place. Remember to wear masks, follow social distancing and for tips on how raise a small team for the clean-up, seek Bhumi’s help. Plastic2brick is another campaign, and it comes with the option of individual or group effort. Collect the plastic items from the home to build something useful. Or, help the team ‘Empower a local street vendor’ by pining their location in Google, getting them a Paytm account, creating a catchy placard, share in local social media networks or give them simple marketing tips. **     Started by a group of citizens in Mumbai, Pad Squad is an initiative that aims to distribute sanitary pads across the respective cities where the drive has been initiated. It wants residents to take charge of the initiative from the stage of campaigning to distribution. “We have 56 squads across the country since we started this initiative in June this year, Bengaluru being one of the active cities. We do not accept cash but only want donation to be in the form of sanitary pads,” says Chhitra Subramaniam, co-founder. She says an apartment complex or community could volunteer by setting up a ‘Pad Peti’, collect donations of sanitary pads and distribute them to economically weaker sections of society during the Daan Utsav. **       Pledge your support to United Way Chennai that is organising a virtual marathon fundraiser. Participants can walk, run or cycle over a specific distance during the Daan Utsav week to help street vendors that are affected by the pandemic. All that is required of the volunteer is to pledge a distance and cover it. You can track your progress using any fitness app and submit the details via email (info@unitedwaychennai.org). As part of the #UnitedForStreetVendors campaign, United Way Chennai has been providing financial assistance to these families.         The festival of giving is open to all, and everyone can celebrate it the way they deem fit. If your apartment complex or neighbourhood has organised a drive then we would like to hear from you.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The fine art of community grandparenting||The pandemic may have upended priorities, but grandma’s tales — and grandpa’s too — have dodged the virus. In fact, grandparents are thriving as storytellers, getting more “air time” than ever before. Now, as parents grapple with the challenges of working or working from home in a pandemic situation, stay-at-home children are often left to their own “devices” — actually, their parents’ devices. The fact that classes are now parked online does not help matters — there is too much screen time and it is doing little Johnny no good. And a roll of storytelling honour at a gated community in Sholinganallur gives a reason to believe that grandparents are stepping up to the plate. “Though grey hair is no criterion for choosing our storytellers, it so happens that in recent weeks, when we had revived our storytelling programme, nearly ninety percent of the storytellers have been seniors,” says Supriya Santhanam, a resident of The Central Park South (TCPS) and volunteer-in-charge of a library at the community. The programme in question is “Stories Beneath The Clouds”, an in-person open-air storytelling component of TCPS’ library outreach, that has now been partially revived, stringent safety protocols in place, to tackle children’s gadget addiction during the pandemic. Besides, grandparents at the community have raised their hands seeking to be included in a listening circle on parenting. This programme takes place once in two weeks on the terrace, following safety protocols. Bindu Unnikrishan, who handles this programme as facilitator, in association with the library team, explains, “Initially, we started off with parents, and then we had grandparents also expressing their interest to participate in the circle. We felt that this was important, and that it would help every parenting discussion if grandparents brought their own generational light to it. We have grandparents who have shared their experiences, particularly about how parenting has changed — for a grandparent, how their children grew up and how their grandchildren are growing up are different. So, when they listen to parents (other than their own children), these grandparents become aware of new perspectives. Similarly, parents participating in the listening circle, get the perspectives of grandparents (other than what they have heard from their parents).” Supriya points out that the listening circle has so far had five meet-ups, and its scope has now considerably widened. Says Bindu, “The listening circle offers a safe space for parents and grandparents to discuss various topics related to parenting and learn from each other. It is a non-judgemental space where participants go back home with takeaways that they can customise for their family. What is discussed in the circle stays within the circle.” Meet these storytellers Now, let us get back to the open-air storytelling space — sometimes the poolside, andsometimes the terrace. There, a few senior storytellers from the community would tell you why it is necessary to continue telling those stories to children, in the middle of a pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-fine-art-of-community-grandparenting/article32764025.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Life looks up after encounter with COVID-19||Eight one-year-old V. Parvathy is having a busy Monday, but she complains of unfinished work. “I usually complete writing a page of the narayaneeyanam by late evening, but today I have managed only half of what I would have achieved by this hour,” says the retired librarian. If she was upset that the telephonic interview was eating further into her routine, she would not show it. “Today I had so many calls enquiring about my health and also my fellow residents,” says Parvathy aachi as she is known by those close to her. Parvathy aachi is one of 29 residents of Anandam, a free home for senior citizens, who were in the news recently for how they beat COVID-19, having recovered from it after treatment at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. What is remarkable is that 25 of them are aged above 70 and have multiple comorbidities. At present, these 29 residents are isolating themselves, staying at a student hostel a short jog from Anandam in Ambattur. Anandam has 105 residents. Parvathy aachi recites a list of activities she has been a part of, and they include kanji preparation for the group and helping wash clothes. Those asked if the COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent hospitalisation caused them anxiety answer in the negative. “There is nothing to worry about; be positive. We have seen many things in life and this phase will also pass. Keep yourself occupied doing things you like,” says N.Saraswathi, who is 76 years. She is in-charge of planning and coordinating the kitchen activities, including choosing the menu. Away from the home now, she is missing this role. At the student hostel they are staying at, they can’t do any major cooking. At Anandam, residents are encouraged to take care of the home, assisting in a variety of chores, including cooking, managing the kitchen garden and cleaning. “We have four to five people above 90 years with us and those of us who are healthier than others, take care of these residents. We avoid discussing the latest news, and instead choose to talk about the good old times,” says Parvathy. Ram P. Mony, manager (admin), says, “Earlier, not all of them would take the instructions seriously, now they do. They would not tell me if they are having body pain, now they have understood the importance of timely intervention. The fussy eaters have also changed, post-hospitalisation, as they know they have to eat healthy.” Between managing the activities at the Home, Ram would sometimes forgets to take his kashayam . “Now they are behind me, ensuring I take it,” he says. Every one-and-a-half hours, residents prepare some health drink — buttermilk, lemon juice and kabasuru kudineer . “We persuade those who don’t particularly like to take these health drinks to do so,” says Parvathy. She says evening coffee has been replaced with sukku malli coffee. There is also greater interest in acupressure. Bhageerathy Ramamoorthy, managing trustee of Andanam, says the seniors have been able to come out of the crisis because of the healthy habits they have been following, and healthy food habits among them. “Now, we have employed a nurse to check on them regularly. Thrice a day I call them, plus they have the doctor calling them. It’s a big joint family and this continues at the new place we have rented for a month,” she says. These seniors point out that they have always taken the necessary precautions, but now they wouldn’t mind erring on the side of caution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/life-looks-up-after-encounter-with-covid-19/article32764026.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Auto driver calls Corporation, and workers arrive to fix deadly patch||Recently, while waiting at an auto stand near Chintamani junction on Kilpauk Garden Road in Anna Nagar, autorickshaw driver B. Shankar witnessed an accident. A motorcyclist along with a pillion rider had a fall with their skidding on impact with a protruding manhole. Along with a few pedestrians, Shankar rescued the two. Shankar would not leave the spot, but alert the civic officials of Zone 8 of the Chennai Corporation about the accident, more particularly what caused it. He did this with the help of a traffic constable at the junction. He had a strong reason to do this, as this was the fourth such accident he had witnessed at the spot since September when lockdown restrictions were significantly eased. “Sometimes, you have to go beyond just helping people. As I wait for customers near the junction, I often see such accidents and help the victims. But, on that day, I knew I had to something more than, so that an issue gets resolved,” explains 42-year-old Shankar. In half an hour’s time, a team of three civic workers from the Bus Road Route (BRR) Department of Greater Chennai Corporation reached the spot. They dug the carriageway around the manhole, up to one feet, and ensured that the manhole was brought on par with the road. The damaged manhole was plastered with the uneven carriageway around the manhole and was bitumen-topped, as a temporary measure. A day later, the team visited the spot again to assess the condition of the repaired portion. They found out that the patched-up portion had sunk due to continuous movement of vehicles. And therefore, they used 25 kilograms of cold concrete mixer to level a much larger space around the manhole. Corporation officials have pointed out that the damaged manhole is a utility manhole that had been created mainly for provision of Internet cables and other services by other services providers a few years ago. As per norms, such utility manholes should be constructed around one feet from the existing footpath to allow space for other public works like water lines. As the utility manhole is located close to the inlets of the existing stormwater drain, bitumen around the manhole got eroded. The erosion of bitumen went unnoticed due to low volume of traffic during the intense lockdown. “Regular monitoring of the condition of key bitumen stretches are being carried out in the neighbourhood,” says a Corporation official. Many motorists use the Chintamani junction, which connects New Avadi Road and the First Avenue Road in Anna Nagar with Kilpauk Garden Road. Chintamani junction has become a busy section, especially after channel-laying work began on Third Avenue Road three years ago. Motorists from ICF, Ayanavaram, Villivakkam, Padi, Anna Nagar, Shenoy Nagar and Kolathur take the Chintamani junction accessing it via New Avadi Road as the junction part of a short route to PH Road at Kilpauk.  Sometimes, you have to go beyond just helping people||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/auto-driver-calls-corporation-and-workers-arrive-to-fix-deadly-patch/article32764021.ece

One could instead sense that behind the mask, boredom is written large on his face. Flies do sorties around the fish, and Parthiban does not try to wave them away. Occasionally, his eyes flit to a closed fish shop opposite his. This is a scene from the common market in Aminjikarai. That fish shop belongs to S. Arumugam, Parthiban’s friend from childhood. After school hours, they would hang out together at the market, as both hail from families that have been doing the fish trade, which got passed on to them. Each would help out at his respective family’s outlet. During weekends, they would head to the wholesale fish market in Kasimedu to source fish for the retail outlets in Aminjikarai market. Since then, little has changed. They are residents of the same street. They buy fish together from the wholesale market in North Chennai and divide the purchase before placing it in cold storage. Now, till further notice comes from the Greater Chennai Corporation, both would be conducting their business on different days. A week ago, civic officials of Ward 102 of Zone-8 (Anna Nagar) of the Greater Chennai Corporation introduced a set of guidelines, which included allowing the shops to open only on alternate days as part of preventive steps against COVID-19. All the shops located diagonally opposite each other can open on the same day. By this arrangement, it has been ensured that a distance of 20 feet separate two open shops. Civic officials marked all shops including those on the streets outside the common market in Aminjikarai with odd and even numbers. Sanitation measures The fish market in Aminjikarai has more than 100 outlets, a majority of them run families with three generations of fish traders. An equal number of vegetable traders have their shops on the streets around the market. Every day, the market has to be disinfected by traders before resuming work and also after shutting shop for the day. Visitors and traders are allowed to enter the market after thermal screening. They have to be wearing face masks. A hand sanitiser is kept at the entrance. All traders are tested by the health officials of the civic body once in a fortnight. “We also told the local traders that it is their responsibility to ensure all visitors wear face masks. If some visitors have forgotten it, the traders should provide free face masks to them and then allow them,” says S. Kalaiarasan, Assistant Engineer (A.E), Ward 102, Zone - 8.  We also told the local traders that it is their responsibility to ensure all visitors are wearing face masks||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/new-rules-for-aminjikarai-market/article32764017.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A peek into the workings of a group formed to help seniors||Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association has constituted a team of dedicated volunteers who would attend to the everyday concerns of senior citizens, during the pandemic. And Association would fight the seniors’ battle. There has been sufficient evidence of both. Through Google Groups, the volunteers stay connected to beneficiary-seniors. The seniors can easily contact the 15 volunteers, which include Archana Hari, Krishna Mohan, Krithika Vishwanathan, Vaishnavi Acharya, Akshar Jaikumar, and Ankit Mohota, as the latter’s addresses, phone numbers and email IDs are shared on Google Groups. The seniors can contact the volunteers any time of the day, says Association general secretary Shanthi Krishnan who heads the group. These volunteers have been helping senior-citizens and super-senior citizens get essential provisions, medicines and vegetables. They spend out of their pocket to buy what the seniors need, and the seniors would repay them when the bills are presented. Whenever a senior needs certain work to be carried out with a government agency, this group does the coordination work. “I coordinate with Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). We have been receiving excellent support from the GCC. Deenadayalan, assistant engineer, Ward 181, and sanitary inspector Naveen, are particularly in regular touch with us, rendering all the required help. Many a time, with the help and support of GCC, we have guided senior-citizens, maids and security guards to nearby COVID-19 testing centres,” says Shanthi Krishnan. When the functions of a bank located on the premises of Kalakshetra Colony were going to be merged with those of two other branch banks — the savings account going to a branch located at Besant Nagar, and locker facility to a branch located East Coast Road — the Association took up the issue. This bank at Kalakshetra Colony was a boon to senior citizens. As many seniors were operating their accounts there, they would have to travel to the branches to draw cash, bring jewels from the locker and for other bank-related works. “Upon hearing the proposed move, we took up the issue with the authorities concerned at the higher-level, and stalled it. At present, we are helping the bank staff identify a new premises for the branch, inside the colony,” points out Krishnan. “Ever since it was formed, KCWA has kept helping seniors citizens and super senior-citizens as one of its main objectives.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-peek-into-the-workings-of-a-group-formed-to-help-seniors/article32764034.ece

Ramachandran did not quite relish the thought that he would have to continue staying all alone in a room except when medical personnel and support staff would attend to him. What COVID-19 could do to him did not grip him as intensely as the fear of loneliness. “Having been placed in a separate room with no one to see and talk to, I was frustrated. The hospital took utmost care of me, making my stay extremely comfortable, but the thought of having to spend the days without anyone's company was disturbing,” says Ramachandran, who is 86 years old. Knowing how much he loved to be around people, friends and relatives knew exactly how hard it was for him. At his apartment complex in Vadapalani, Ramachandran is known as ‘photo maama’ for his passion for photography, and also his efficiency in it. Thanks to this skill and his amiable nature, he would invariably get invited to a birthday party any neighbour at the complex would be organising for their child. Ramachandran was famous for striking up a conversation with strangers. After every evening walk in the neighbourhood, his circle of acquaintances would get wider. “ Tatha loves to socialise and he would engage even with random persons,” says his grandson Rohith Kannan, a house surgeon. From the word go, it was obvious Ramachandran would not be able to adjust to a private-room arrangement. “In my frustration, I told a nurse ‘I think I will die’ and what I had said had been discussed. As the oldest among the COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, there was already enough attention coming my way. Now, there was more attention. The next day the doctor who came to check on me opened the topic. The doctor chuckled and asked me my birth star and declared that I would live for 100 years,” Ramachandran laughs recalling how the doctor tried to cheer him up. Within the next couple of hours, Ramachandran was shifted to a three-sharing room. “My oxygen level that was fluctuating had stabilised by then,” says Ramachandran. The fact that one of the two was his grandson's classmate, Reshma, brought a cheer in him. Two days after Reshma was discharged, Ramachandran also left the hospital, having recovered from COVID-19. “But I was asked to be in home quarantine, and so I locked myself up in my room. This time, I did it voluntarily to avoid the risk of my wife and grandson getting infected,” he says. Of course, he still found company, this time in books and classical music. The octogenarian says he has returned to following his usual routine, but with greater cautiousness. Ramachandran says, “My apartment complex has no lift, so I have always been used to climbing the 72 stairs multiple times. I think all this keeps me fit and healthy, along with my will power, has helped me fight the virus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/an-octogenarians-diary/article32764027.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Taking a spiritual route to solve a civic problem||Here is Madhavan Raju’s morning ritual. He carries a small plastic chair and parks himself in it, right outside the grill gate of his house at 7th Street in Murugan Nagar, Kolathur. Whenever he watches someone approaching a small strip of a footpath, garbage bag in hand, he would politely talk them out of dumping the trash on the footpath. Usually, people would arrive in a two-wheeler to dump the garbage on this spot, next to compound wall of a vacant piece of land. The intense lockdown gave Raju a break from this routine. Intense lockdown gave the much-needed break for Raju’s morning routine which he was doing for the past few years. Movement of vehciles having increased since August, due to relaxation of lockdown restrictions, Raju has had to restart the routine. “This routine is cumbersome, and so, my neighbours, my family friend and I came up with the idea of decorating the wall with pictures of deities,” says Raju, a small-time businessman. They decided on this strategy following a brainstorming session where the idea of raising a steel fence around the the the small strip of a footpath, and having garbage bins on the footpath were rejected. It may be noted that street-corner garbage bins were removed more than a year ago to encourage source segregation of bio-degradeable and non-biodegradable waste by residents. Before implementing this idea, these residents sought Corporation officials’ permission to do so. Warning signboards against garbage dumping were also put up. “Being a residents’ initiative, we fully supported the idea of keeping their public place clean. Such an effort by residents also creates awareness against misuse of public space,” says Senthil, Assistant Engineer (A.E), Ward 64 (Zone-6, Madhavaram) of the Greater Chennai Corporation. Surrounded residential localities like V.V. Nagar, Kumaran Nagar and Poompuhar Nagar, Mugugan Nagar seven streets with more than 500 families. Door-to-door garbage collection is being carried out every day by conservancy workers, covering all households. With lockdown restrictions being eased, the neighbourhood witnesses greater movement of people and vehicles. Office goers find it convenient to dump the garbage on the roadside than wait for the conservancy staff to collect it from their households. Residents of Seventh Street point out that an empty private land makes it a convenient excuse for motorcyclists to dump garbage in front of the plot on the footpath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/taking-a-spiritual-route-to-solve-a-civic-problem/article32764011.ece

She often turns to painting and tailoring to beat the lockdown blues. There is now a social element to her pursuit of tailoring as a hobby. She has stitched and distributed three-layered cloth masks to relatives, friends and conservancy workers for free. Earlier, she would use her tailoring skills primarily for stitching herself blouses. At Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, where she lives, she is known as “Kovil Pati”, as she frequents this temple, not a day passing without a visit in the morning and another in the evening. She helps out in the temple. Due to the pandemic, this routine has taken a beating. Being a senior-citizen, she had been confining herself to the safety of her home. Only since September 1, when lockdown restrictions were significantly relaxed, has she been visiting the temple. Considering her safety, her family ensures these visits are not frequent. Nor is she allowed to spend as much time at the temple as before. Passion for painting Her son S. Kumararaja, a civic activist, says, “Now she spends much of her time drawing, painting and stitching. Even at this age she does Tanjore painting and glass painting. She learnt the art of drawing from her father who was a drawing master in a school and a freedom fighter.

This IPL season, a Chennai-based group is giving this slogan a twist — kolam podu it is. Fresh from the oven, this catchphrase seeks to achieve two purposes — extend support to CSK and while doing so, draw attention to the traditional art form of Kolam drawing. With fast-paced urban life leaving people strapped for time, the enthusiasm for kolam drawing is waning in metros. (For the uniformed and initiated, kolam drawing is carried out with rice power or chalk). Initiated by Kolam Podu — a YouTube channel established to revive, demystify and educate people about the art of drawing kolams — its latest campaign is smart and peppy, and drawing people to take a fresh look at the designs in front of houses. The strategy is obvious — use the IPL fever and the love for CSK to get people to think and talk about kolams . The significant part is that it encourages CSK fans to go beyond thinking about kolams and actually draw one to demonstrate their support for the team. The ultimate goal is that it would want people doing whatever they could to revive kolam drawing in the ways they deem fit  Chennai Super Kingskku periya kolam podu/ Tamil Naatu stylela sikku kolam podu/ Namma ooru baaniyila valaichu valaichu podu/ Namma singham dhonikku sokka kolam podu… so goes the first four lines. “We have picked words from kolam and cricket to create a video; it has music by Swaminathan Selvaganesh, son of Vikku Vinayakram,” says Bhargavii Mani, who leads Kolam Podu. For example, sikku is a style of kolam that the YouTube channel presents in much detail. Taking us through the campaign, Bhargavii says that after the song was ready, it was about figuring out how to engage audiences. “Through my circle of friends, I reached out to a few dance schools and asked them to come up with their own dance version of the song. The brief was simple: download our song and choreograph it the way you want to and send us your version,” says Bhargavii. Kolam Podu plans to upload a new video every week based on the responses they get. “If cricket brings people together then let’s also try it through kolams ,” she says. They are also creating GIFs to promote the traditional art form. There is a strong motivation for Bhargavii to promote kolams . Following a medical emergency two years ago, she started drawing kolams as therapy, physical and psychological. She had a stoke which led to loss of mobility for a few days. “I lost a significant part of my memory too,” she says. Turning to kolams slowly helped her bounce back. “Kolam Podu was more like a happy project that I had started to get out of it and I want others to enjoy the benefits it has to offer,” she says.

While widening the service lanes was indeed commendable, the exercise would have been complete if there had been in-built checks against rash driving and traffic violations. GCC now plans to put safety measures in place. It may be noted that a fatal accident occurred near the flyover a fortnight ago: A motorcyclist got killed when he drove on the wrong side of the widened lane. Residents point out that accidents happen with disturbing frequency on these service lanes since the COVID -19 lockdown restrictions were eased in September. “In addition to the lanes being widened, concrete slabs have been placed for a distance of 20 feet along the ramp of the flyover to prevent motorists coming from the interior streets, from entering the flyover. However, this feature has not brought about the desired change. Motorists find ways to drive on the wrong side of the road. Hence, a median on the ramp of the flyover will be constructed to check wrong-way driving,” says a Corporation official. Earlier, to check such violations, the traffic police installed CCTV cameras on the ramp of the flyover. Besides, steel barricades were placed from the ramp of the flyover towards the main road to prevent wrong-way driving. However, motorists drive a little further beyond the barricades and take a left turn to access the streets on both sides of the flyover. Residents suggest that an adequate number of traffic police personnel have to be deployed near the flyover. At present, they are posted near Meenakshi College for Women, around 100 metres from the flyover. Motorists therefore find it easy to violate road safety rules. The Kodambakkam flyover is busy for the following reasons: a railway station and a college are located nearby; it is part of a busy route for MTC buses; and it connects Nungambakkam and Anna Salai. One-way traffic is maintained on the flyover’s service lanes. In Kodambakkam, the traffic arrangement being followed for many years is that motorists on Arcot Road heading towards Kodambakkam can use the service lane to reach Poonamallee High Main Road at Kilpauk via streets below the flyover and the Nelson Manickam Road junction. On the other hand, motorists from residential localities below the flyover can use the other service lane towards Vadapalani via Arcot Road. This traffic arrangement is aimed at easing traffic flow on the main road and preventing accidents on the service lanes. However, many motorists from interior lanes below the flyover drive in the wrong direction to reach the carriageway of the flyover. Further, motorists on the flyover heading towards Vadapalani also jump lanes on the flyover to reach the service lane. All of these result in traffic chaos and accidents.  Residents suggest that an adequate number of traffic police personnel have to be deployed near the flyover. At present, they are posted near Meenakshi College for Women, around 100 metres from the flyover. Motorists therefore find it convenient to violate road safety rules||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/check-rash-driving-on-widened-service-lanes-of-kodambakkam-flyover/article32764045.ece

The non-profit is in need of monetary and material help to support the scale of work it is undertaking in various states. Urgently-required material include clothes, woollen blankets, dry ration, school material, toys, utensils and usable electronic device like mobiles, laptops and desktops. Goonj encourages communities to take the lead in organising a collection drive. The volunteer is required to create awareness through posters, spread the word, allot a day when a truck can be parked in front of the society gate for a few hours.         Thepandemic has driven home the necessity of keeping our homes and surrounding areas absolutely clean. Bhumi shows how this can be achieved, through what it calls ‘Cleanup Drive with a Twist’. It wants the volunteer to choose a spot near their street or home, mobilise a small group of volunteers and and spruce up the place. Remember to wear masks, follow social distancing and for tips on how raise a small team for the clean-up, seek Bhumi’s help. Plastic2brick is another campaign, and it comes with the option of individual or group effort. Collect the plastic items from the home to build something useful. Or, help the team ‘Empower a local street vendor’ by pining their location in Google, getting them a Paytm account, creating a catchy placard, share in local social media networks or give them simple marketing tips. **     Started by a group of citizens in Mumbai, Pad Squad is an initiative that aims to distribute sanitary pads across the respective cities where the drive has been initiated. It wants residents to take charge of the initiative from the stage of campaigning to distribution. “We have 56 squads across the country since we started this initiative in June this year, Bengaluru being one of the active cities. We do not accept cash but only want donation to be in the form of sanitary pads,” says Chhitra Subramaniam, co-founder. She says an apartment complex or community could volunteer by setting up a ‘Pad Peti’, collect donations of sanitary pads and distribute them to economically weaker sections of society during the Daan Utsav. **       Pledge your support to United Way Chennai that is organising a virtual marathon fundraiser. Participants can walk, run or cycle over a specific distance during the Daan Utsav week to help street vendors that are affected by the pandemic. All that is required of the volunteer is to pledge a distance and cover it. You can track your progress using any fitness app and submit the details via email (info@unitedwaychennai.org). As part of the #UnitedForStreetVendors campaign, United Way Chennai has been providing financial assistance to these families.         The festival of giving is open to all, and everyone can celebrate it the way they deem fit. If your apartment complex or neighbourhood has organised a drive then we would like to hear from you.

The new TNFRS station building, expected to be ready by January 2021, is of considerbaly larger dimesnions. But its significance derives from more than just its imposing size and facilities. The new building will serve as the headquarters of the Chennai South Division of the Department. Of the four divisions — North, South, Central and Suburban — Chennai South has the most number of fire stations. There are nine of them, including stations in Mylapore, Raj Bhavan, Thiruvanmiyur, T. Nagar, Saidapet and Tambaram. The Public Works Department (PWD) began the construction of this facility in May 2018 when the State government gave its nod for the project. “It is almost ready except for a few works including flooring, plastering and painting. The station will coordinate with other fire stations especially those south of the city on rescue work,” says a TNFRS official. As per the plan, the new building will have a host of facilities including separate cabins for station officers, firemen, a resting room for firemen and a conference hall. The one-room structure that is being replaced is dilapidated, and has always offered only a bare minimum of amenities. More importantly, the new facility will also have separate offices for the District Fire Officer (DFO - South), the Assistant Director (AD) and other senior officers of the Department. Officials in the department said that among other features a specialised section known as Wings Department will be accommodated in the new building. The role of the Wings Department largely has to do with creating awareness campaigns about fire safety and rescue operations. These campaigns are carried out in schools, colleges and public places by this department on a regular basis. Further, the Ashok Nagar Fire station office will get a skylift that can extend up to a height of 54 metres. At present, such skylifts are available only in select fire stations including the ones in Teynampet, Guindy, Tambaram, Raj Bhavan,Thiruvanmiyur and Egmore within the city limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/fire-station-in-ashok-nagar-gains-in-size-and-significance/article32764050.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Rajamannar Salai in Virugambakkam waits for bitumen topping||In mid-2019, Chennai Metrowater Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) completed its pipe-laying work on the 60-ft Rajamannar Salai, off Arcot Road in Virugambakkam, near the police booth. The pipes were meant to supply water to tail-end areas in the neighbourhood. Despite the work getting completed in a few months, Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) did not have the road relaid with bitumen. GCC, the nodal agency that issues no-objection certificates for such developmental works after collecting the necessary road-cutting charges from the project implementation agencies, had relaid only a portion of the road. Next, the Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) dug up the road to lay its electricity cables to address the issue of power fluctuations in the locality. Tangedco also completed its work without much delay by the end of 2019. But, the GCC is yet to have the road relaid fully. Only a portion of the road has been relaid. Assuming the work got delayed due to the pandemic, residents now want GCC to relay the road at the earliest as the north-east monsoon is approaching. Ever since COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were significantly relaxed in September, the stretch has once again started witnessing considerable traffic movement. It is therefore all the more important that the road be relaid fully, without much delay, residents reason it out. The road is battered and the footpath is out of bounds for pedestrians, they add. “Many prefer to take this stretch as it is less congested than Arcot Road,” says B. Selvam, a resident of Ramapuram. The road is also significant because the Virugambakkam market is located here. Besides, the Container Freight Station is in the vicinity. Further, it connects areas like K.K. Nagar, Chinmaya Nagar, Saligramam, Dasarathapuram, Vadapalani, Alwarthirunagar, Ramapuram, Ashok Nagar and Nesapakkam. In fact, the stretch provides the shortest route to reach CMBT in Koyambedu and Poonamallee High Road. Poor surveillance Residents also point out that Rajamannar Salai does not have an effective surveillance system including police patrol vehicles considering the fact that the stretch has many wholesale units dealing in various cereals. Most of the consignments to the wholesale units on the stretch come by mini-lorries and vans from neighbouring districts like Thiruvanamalai, Villupuram and Vellore. Drivers of these vehicles halt for a few days before making their return journey. At night, the footpath along the stretch where the vehicles are parked are misused for anti-social activities. Most of the LED street lights on the stretch are blocked by overarching branches of trees. In this respect, a GCC official says, “Steps will be taken to have the road relaid soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/rajamannar-salai-in-virugambakkam-waits-for-bitumen-topping/article32764072.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The fine art of community grandparenting||The pandemic may have upended priorities, but grandma’s tales — and grandpa’s too — have dodged the virus. In fact, grandparents are thriving as storytellers, getting more “air time” than ever before. Now, as parents grapple with the challenges of working or working from home in a pandemic situation, stay-at-home children are often left to their own “devices” — actually, their parents’ devices. The fact that classes are now parked online does not help matters — there is too much screen time and it is doing little Johnny no good. And a roll of storytelling honour at a gated community in Sholinganallur gives a reason to believe that grandparents are stepping up to the plate. “Though grey hair is no criterion for choosing our storytellers, it so happens that in recent weeks, when we had revived our storytelling programme, nearly ninety percent of the storytellers have been seniors,” says Supriya Santhanam, a resident of The Central Park South (TCPS) and volunteer-in-charge of a library at the community. The programme in question is “Stories Beneath The Clouds”, an in-person open-air storytelling component of TCPS’ library outreach, that has now been partially revived, stringent safety protocols in place, to tackle children’s gadget addiction during the pandemic. Besides, grandparents at the community have raised their hands seeking to be included in a listening circle on parenting. This programme takes place once in two weeks on the terrace, following safety protocols. Bindu Unnikrishan, who handles this programme as facilitator, in association with the library team, explains, “Initially, we started off with parents, and then we had grandparents also expressing their interest to participate in the circle. We felt that this was important, and that it would help every parenting discussion if grandparents brought their own generational light to it. We have grandparents who have shared their experiences, particularly about how parenting has changed — for a grandparent, how their children grew up and how their grandchildren are growing up are different. So, when they listen to parents (other than their own children), these grandparents become aware of new perspectives. Similarly, parents participating in the listening circle, get the perspectives of grandparents (other than what they have heard from their parents).” Supriya points out that the listening circle has so far had five meet-ups, and its scope has now considerably widened. Says Bindu, “The listening circle offers a safe space for parents and grandparents to discuss various topics related to parenting and learn from each other. It is a non-judgemental space where participants go back home with takeaways that they can customise for their family. What is discussed in the circle stays within the circle.” Meet these storytellers Now, let us get back to the open-air storytelling space — sometimes the poolside, andsometimes the terrace. There, a few senior storytellers from the community would tell you why it is necessary to continue telling those stories to children, in the middle of a pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-fine-art-of-community-grandparenting/article32764057.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Life looks up after encounter with COVID-19||Eight one-year-old V. Parvathy is having a busy Monday, but she complains of unfinished work. “I usually complete writing a page of the narayaneeyanam by late evening, but today I have managed only half of what I would have achieved by this hour,” says the retired librarian. If she was upset that the telephonic interview was eating further into her routine, she would not show it. “Today I had so many calls enquiring about my health and also my fellow residents,” says Parvathy aachi as she is known by those close to her. Parvathy aachi is one of 29 residents of Anandam, a free home for senior citizens, who were in the news recently for how they beat COVID-19, having recovered from it after treatment at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. What is remarkable is that 25 of them are aged above 70 and have multiple comorbidities. At present, these 29 residents are isolating themselves, staying at a student hostel a short jog from Anandam in Ambattur. Anandam has 105 residents. Parvathy aachi recites a list of activities she has been a part of, and they include kanji preparation for the group and helping wash clothes. Those asked if the COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent hospitalisation caused them anxiety answer in the negative. “There is nothing to worry about; be positive. We have seen many things in life and this phase will also pass. Keep yourself occupied doing things you like,” says N.Saraswathi, who is 76 years. She is in-charge of planning and coordinating the kitchen activities, including choosing the menu. Away from the home now, she is missing this role. At the student hostel they are staying at, they can’t do any major cooking. At Anandam, residents are encouraged to take care of the home, assisting in a variety of chores, including cooking, managing the kitchen garden and cleaning. “We have four to five people above 90 years with us and those of us who are healthier than others, take care of these residents. We avoid discussing the latest news, and instead choose to talk about the good old times,” says Parvathy. Ram P. Mony, manager (admin), says, “Earlier, not all of them would take the instructions seriously, now they do. They would not tell me if they are having body pain, now they have understood the importance of timely intervention. The fussy eaters have also changed, post-hospitalisation, as they know they have to eat healthy.” Between managing the activities at the Home, Ram would sometimes forgets to take his kashayam . “Now they are behind me, ensuring I take it,” he says. Every one-and-a-half hours, residents prepare some health drink — buttermilk, lemon juice and kabasuru kudineer . “We persuade those who don’t particularly like to take these health drinks to do so,” says Parvathy. She says evening coffee has been replaced with sukku malli coffee. There is also greater interest in acupressure. Bhageerathy Ramamoorthy, managing trustee of Andanam, says the seniors have been able to come out of the crisis because of the healthy habits they have been following, and healthy food habits among them. “Now, we have employed a nurse to check on them regularly. Thrice a day I call them, plus they have the doctor calling them. It’s a big joint family and this continues at the new place we have rented for a month,” she says. These seniors point out that they have always taken the necessary precautions, but now they wouldn’t mind erring on the side of caution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/life-looks-up-after-encounter-with-covid-19/article32764058.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Plagued by poor illumination||For the past two years, during night time, streets in Blooming Garden, Mugaliwakkam are poorly-lit. The colony, which consists of Aster Street, Jasmine Street, and Marigold Street, used to be well-lit with 18 LED streetlights. Residents point out that there are only a few streetlights, say six, now. Residents have taken up this issue with the Greater Chennai Corporation many a time, but in vain. “In 2018, these street lights were removed while work on construction of stormwater drains was under way. The work got completed in six months, but getting the dug-up roads to be relaid was a big task. Only a year after the completion of SWD work was the relaying of these streets undertaken. While GCC got the streets ready, it failed to have the streetlights reinstalled. We have made several representations about it,” says D. Thirunganam, president, Blooming Garden Residents Welfare Association. Residents say keep the lights on at the thresholds of their houses, into the late hours at night, for the benefit of passersby. “As a temporary measure, GCC has fixed a bulb in one of the lamp posts and we residents turn it on and off. Now, following the rains, the screws give off a shock; we found it using a tester,” says M. Sivaprakash, a member of the Association. Residents also point out that the poor illumination has paved way for incidents of theft. “A year ago, two motorcycles and a bore-well motor got stolen from our residents’ houses. Therefore, with the financial assistance of its residents, the Association installed CCTV cameras. However, as the streets are poorly-lit, footage from the CCTV cameras is not clear,” says T. Kumaran, the Association’s treasurer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/plagued-by-poor-illumination/article32764074.ece

What is interesting is that parents, students and the dance teacher collaborated optimally, though the time at their disposal was short, to submit the video to Kollam Podu, which is running a campaign to promote the art of kolam . “An average Bharatanatyam recital is four minutes long and here we had to shorten it to around 1 minute 14 seconds which was a huge challenge for us in the three days given to us,” says Vanishree Ravishankar, who runs Natya Samarpanam, located in Besant Nagar. She choreographed the dance with her daughter Madhuvanthi Muliya. Since the lockdown, the school has not been conducting classes on its premises and they had to quickly assemble a team for the shoot. Seven students were ready for the rehearsal. On Sunday morning, they short the video on the terrace of a student’s house in Kasturibai Nagar. Two of the parents shot the video and Vanishree’s daughter did the editing. Vanishree says, “On Sunday night it was uploaded and we are happy with the results of this collaborative work.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-collaborative-effort/article32764037.ece

AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association say that power cables severing due to the overarching branches of avenue trees, as a contributing factor. “Although power cables get severed and fall, thankfully no untoward incidents have occurred. We want the authorities concerned to ensure tree branches are trimmed at the earliest,” says Kumaresan, an office-bearer of the association. As the north-east monsoon is approaching, the Association has taken up this issue with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) and Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). “We have had to make a representation to both the departments, because Tangedco says it is the GCC’s job; and GCC fixes the responsibility with Tangedco. However, we find that both the departments carry out the work. Only a few trees have been subjected to a trimming exercise. There are many more that ought to be trimmed. Our Association also carries out this work with Corporation’s consent,” says Kumaresan. A similar exercise has to be carried out in the neighboring areas of AGS Colony Phase Three, which include Guruswamy Nagar, Annai Velankani Nagar Phase Two, and Selva Lakshmi Garden. The Association complains trimming exercise is often not carried out right — there is not just trimming, but ruthless cutting of the branches. “We have take pains to create a green cover in our locality by planting tree saplings and tending to them, and it is disappointing to find branches being chaopped off more what is necessary,” says Kumaresan. Besides, the Association has requested Tangedco to provide an underground power cable facility at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/power-cables-keep-falling-often-say-mugaliwakkam-residents/article32764053.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A peek into the workings of a group formed to help seniors||Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association has constituted a team of dedicated volunteers who would attend to the everyday concerns of senior citizens, during the pandemic. And Association would fight the seniors’ battle. There has been sufficient evidence of both. Through Google Groups, the volunteers stay connected to beneficiary-seniors. The seniors can easily contact the 15 volunteers, which include Archana Hari, Krishna Mohan, Krithika Vishwanathan, Vaishnavi Acharya, Akshar Jaikumar, and Ankit Mohota, as the latter’s addresses, phone numbers and email IDs are shared on Google Groups. The seniors can contact the volunteers any time of the day, says Association general secretary Shanthi Krishnan who heads the group. These volunteers have been helping senior-citizens and super-senior citizens get essential provisions, medicines and vegetables. They spend out of their pocket to buy what the seniors need, and the seniors would repay them when the bills are presented. Whenever a senior needs certain work to be carried out with a government agency, this group does the coordination work. “I coordinate with Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). We have been receiving excellent support from the GCC. Deenadayalan, assistant engineer, Ward 181, and sanitary inspector Naveen, are particularly in regular touch with us, rendering all the required help. Many a time, with the help and support of GCC, we have guided senior-citizens, maids and security guards to nearby COVID-19 testing centres,” says Shanthi Krishnan. When the functions of a bank located on the premises of Kalakshetra Colony were going to be merged with those of two other branch banks — the savings account going to a branch located at Besant Nagar, and locker facility to a branch located East Coast Road — the Association took up the issue. This bank at Kalakshetra Colony was a boon to senior citizens. As many seniors were operating their accounts there, they would have to travel to the branches to draw cash, bring jewels from the locker and for other bank-related works. “Upon hearing the proposed move, we took up the issue with the authorities concerned at the higher-level, and stalled it. At present, we are helping the bank staff identify a new premises for the branch, inside the colony,” points out Krishnan. “Ever since it was formed, KCWA has kept helping seniors citizens and super senior-citizens as one of its main objectives.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-peek-into-the-workings-of-a-group-formed-to-help-seniors/article32764066.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||An octogenarian’s diary||S.P. Ramachandran did not quite relish the thought that he would have to continue staying all alone in a room except when medical personnel and support staff would attend to him. What COVID-19 could do to him did not grip him as intensely as the fear of loneliness. “Having been placed in a separate room with no one to see and talk to, I was frustrated. The hospital took utmost care of me, making my stay extremely comfortable, but the thought of having to spend the days without anyone's company was disturbing,” says Ramachandran, who is 86 years old. Knowing how much he loved to be around people, friends and relatives knew exactly how hard it was for him. At his apartment complex in Vadapalani, Ramachandran is known as ‘photo maama’ for his passion for photography, and also his efficiency in it. Thanks to this skill and his amiable nature, he would invariably get invited to a birthday party any neighbour at the complex would be organising for their child. Ramachandran was famous for striking up a conversation with strangers. After every evening walk in the neighbourhood, his circle of acquaintances would get wider. “ Tatha loves to socialise and he would engage even with random persons,” says his grandson Rohith Kannan, a house surgeon. From the word go, it was obvious Ramachandran would not be able to adjust to a private-room arrangement. “In my frustration, I told a nurse ‘I think I will die’ and what I had said had been discussed. As the oldest among the COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, there was already enough attention coming my way. Now, there was more attention. The next day the doctor who came to check on me opened the topic. The doctor chuckled and asked me my birth star and declared that I would live for 100 years,” Ramachandran laughs recalling how the doctor tried to cheer him up. Within the next couple of hours, Ramachandran was shifted to a three-sharing room. “My oxygen level that was fluctuating had stabilised by then,” says Ramachandran. The fact that one of the two was his grandson's classmate, Reshma, brought a cheer in him. Two days after Reshma was discharged, Ramachandran also left the hospital, having recovered from COVID-19. “But I was asked to be in home quarantine, and so I locked myself up in my room. This time, I did it voluntarily to avoid the risk of my wife and grandson getting infected,” he says. Of course, he still found company, this time in books and classical music. The octogenarian says he has returned to following his usual routine, but with greater cautiousness. Ramachandran says, “My apartment complex has no lift, so I have always been used to climbing the 72 stairs multiple times. I think all this keeps me fit and healthy, along with my will power, has helped me fight the virus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/an-octogenarians-diary/article32764059.ece

They point out that their safety is compromised as they wait on the busy main road. Built at a cost of around Rs. 3 lakh each, the three ration shops together cater to over 6,000 cardholders in a large cluster of neighbourhoods, which include Subramaniyapuram, Parangusapuram, Viswanathapuram, Ramakrishnapuram and Dharmapuram in West Mambalam since February 2019. Residents seek the relocation of these facilities because Rangarajapuram Main Road is narrow and witnesses continual traffic movement. The other factor contributing to this demand is that the ‘Y’ shaped Rangarajapuram flyover — where one ramp connects Bazullah Road with Kodambakkam railway station through Rangarajapuram Main Road and the other ramp connects Bazullah Road with Subramania Nagar in Kodambakkam — also witnesses heavy traffic. Motorists on the way to the Kodambakkam railway station from Bazullah Road have to proceed towards Subramaniya Nagar and then take a ‘U’ turn to reach the railway station. Further, for residents from a good number of localities, Rangarajapuram Main Road provides the option of reaching T. Nagar and Pondy Bazaar without having to take the congested Arcot Road and North Usman Road. In fact, the road connects two railway stations (of course, now closed due to lockdown restrictions) Nungambakkam and Kodambakkam with T. Nagar via Duraiswamy subway. Ever since the PDS outlets came up under the flyover last year, cardholders could be found waiting on the narrow road hindering movement of vehicular traffic. With relaxation of lockdown restrictions, the road is once again witnessing continual traffic movement, at least during rush hour. “While queueing up in front of these PDS outlets, we are at high risk for accidents due to speeding vehicles, especially two-wheelers,” says S. Ramachandran, a resident of West Mambalam. Senior citizens prefer to wait in the interior streets opposite the ration shops and when their turn comes, a staff member at the outlet calls them and hands over the groceries. Things get a lot more complicated when it rains. Residents believe a permanent building in West Mambalam would put an end to this problem. An official at the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Society says, “Taking the safety issue into account, appropriate steps will be taken.”  The 962-metre-long Rangarajapuram flyover was constructed by the Chennai Corporation and the Southern Railway at a cost of Rs 23.76 crore in October 2012. The Southern Railway built the two bowstring bridges that connect the two ramps, which were built by the Chennai Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/mambalam-residents-seek-relocation-of-pds-outlets/article32764048.ece

She often turns to painting and tailoring to beat the lockdown blues. There is now a social element to her pursuit of tailoring as a hobby. She has stitched and distributed three-layered cloth masks to relatives, friends and conservancy workers for free. Earlier, she would use her tailoring skills primarily for stitching herself blouses. At Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, where she lives, she is known as “Kovil Pati”, as she frequents this temple, not a day passing without a visit in the morning and another in the evening. She helps out in the temple. Due to the pandemic, this routine has taken a beating. Being a senior-citizen, she had been confining herself to the safety of her home. Only since September 1, when lockdown restrictions were significantly relaxed, has she been visiting the temple. Considering her safety, her family ensures these visits are not frequent. Nor is she allowed to spend as much time at the temple as before. Passion for painting Her son S. Kumararaja, a civic activist, says, “Now she spends much of her time drawing, painting and stitching. Even at this age she does Tanjore painting and glass painting. She learnt the art of drawing from her father who was a drawing master in a school and a freedom fighter. While doing embroidery, she can thread the needle without wearing spectacles.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-stitch-in-time-saves-nine/article32764063.ece

Nagar desilted to avoid rainwater stagnation. In T. Nagar, most of the residential buildings that came up decades ago, are far below the road level and therefore prone to flooding. Our houses are now are at a lower level because every time roads were relaid above the existing surface. This has been happening over a period of time. As a result, the rainwater on the road flows the into the buildings along the road causing inundation. It may be mentioned that in apartments, the electrical appliances such as main switches and meters are fixed on the ground floor. When the water level rises, residents are forced to switch off the power supply to avoid electrocution. It is therefore imperative that the GCC take up desilting of the drains without further delay. Besides, we request the GCC to sink pits to harvest rainwater. V.S. Jayaraman is a member of T. Nagar Residents Welfare Association, T.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The singer who listened||Every now and then, my playlist reminds me of ‘Humne Toh Dil Ko Aapke Qadmon Pe Rakh Diya’, among my favourite Mohammed Rafi-Asha Bhosle duets. I don’t know enough Hindi to fully understand the lyrics, and I need Google to tell me it’s from a 1965 film called Mere Sanam , and that it was composed by O.P. Nayyar, whose name I first heard on TVS Saregama hosted by the mild-mannered Sonu Nigam in the 90s. Incidentally, of all the video clips that have inundated social media after singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam passed away last fortnight, it is one from a Nigam show that I have been going back to. On the show, speaking of why “Rafi saab ” was the singer who had the “maximum influence” on him, SPB goes on to recall his student days when he would cycle to engineering college at 7.30 a.m. every day, and listen to one particular Rafi song and invariably tear up. He then breaks into ‘ Deewana hua baadal, saawan ki ghataa chaayee, ye dekh ke dil jhooma ’ (from Kashmir Ki Kali , 1964). “That ‘ ma ’ [in jhooma ]… can you imagine anybody else singing it with that sort of beautiful expression?” he says. “The man is coming into your ears, caressing, singing with a smile. How can you not fall in love?!” On another show, on a Telugu TV channel, SPB sings Rafi’s ‘Jaanewalo Zara Mudke Dekho Mujhe’, a song he loved improvising with, and says, “He [Rafi] is the only person who can sing like that.” Later, when I met him for an interview in 2012, he told me the largest music folder on his phone was dedicated to Rafi. Over the past few days, listening to SPB on loop, I was excited to catch what I thought were some Rafi-esque touches, especially in ‘Ore Naal Unai Naan Nilavil Parthadu’, his duet with Vani Jayaram for Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu that released in 1978 when SPB was in his early 30s. The flavour, pace and three-count rhythmic scape of the beautiful Ilaiyaraaja composition took me back to ‘Humne Toh Dil Ko Aapke Qadmon Pe...,’ but it is really the gentleness and care with which SPB’s voice treats the words and notes that remind me most of Rafi. The caressing that SPB so admired in Rafi. A glimpse of Rafi I learnt later that this wasn’t merely my imagination when I found a video clip where SPB says that many of his songs have “a glimpse of Rafi”. He would make a notation saying ‘Rafi’ in certain places on his song scripts, in order to execute a particular glide or vocal effect in those lines. It is not hard to come up with thousands of such examples of SPB’s masterful play with tone and timbre to evoke a certain mood. But what is more fascinating is what SPB does with these various influences, including that of Rafi, because what you hear in an SPB song is not simply a version of another singer but much more. SPB unfailingly acknowledged his many sources of inspiration, but went on to create a whole catalogue of unique vocal expressions that no playback singer after him can afford to overlook. He brought together the musical traits he relished in Rafi, Kishore Kumar, T.M. Soundararajan (TMS) and P.B. Sreenivas (PBS) — but made them his own. In fact, SPB often spoke about how much he learnt from S. Janaki’s voice dynamics — her modulation, the effortless glide from one note to another, and the tiny embellishments that fall gently like the curled ends of satin ribbons atop a gift-wrapped package. This is perhaps why, where the male playback industry often came up with two giants at a time — such as Rafi-Kishore or TMS-PBS, to give listeners two distinct styles and listening experiences — with his genius, it was just SPB-SPB for quite a while. This is not to belittle the remarkable contributions made over the years by the other much-loved male singers such as Mukesh, A.M. Raja, K.J. Yesudas, Jayachandran or Malaysia Vasudevan. It is simply to say that with SPB, music directors often found everything they wanted and needed — flourish, lilt and finesse — in one voice. A master’s mind All the same, the fact that his voice worked equally well for actors with very different physical and performance attributes does not imply he had a different voice for everyone. However different they may sound or feel, each song has an unmistakable SPB ring to it. That ‘SPB core’ remains intact in all his songs, and co-exists with a sincere, willing and daring musical mind. Sincere to the music director and lyricist’s idea; willing to learn and apply; and daring enough to constantly redraw and expand his comfort zone. The many tributes to SPB recall with awe how on many days the singer would record over 20 songs. A.R. Rahman talks about how quickly SPB could learn a composition and record it, while others emphasise his unmatched versatility. What these fundamentally point to is his aptitude to grasp new ideas, his incredible musical acumen that processed and internalised them, and his ability to translate these into vocal perfection. Except, SPB had no formal training in any of these aspects. He was a master of his own making. Above all, when we hear SPB speak about a song — whether his own or another — he comes across first and foremost as a passionate rasika (someone who engages with and deeply enjoys a work of art). You see not a star singer, but a discerning listener, who can make himself vulnerable and drown in the magic of the notes. While acutely aware of his exceptional talent, SPB was grounded in the realisation that all art, including his own, is bigger than the artist. Alternating between playlists, I chance upon the slow-paced ‘Thoda Thoda Malarndhadhenna’, a brilliant melody by A.R. Rahman. In the line ‘ Mazhai vara boomi maruppadhenna ’, when I hear SPB gliding through the word ‘ boomi ’, I get goosebumps. I don’t know if SPB had marked ‘Rafi’ on the margins of the script of this song, but it certainly bears the stamp of India’s best playback singer all over it — it’s called the SPB imprint. Thankfully, there is enough SPB to last us a lifetime. And enough SPB for millions of his fans to share and yet feel he is singing exclusively to each one of us.  What is more fascinating is what SPB does with the various influences, including that of Rafi, because what you hear in an SPB song is not simply a version of another singer but much more||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-singer-who-listened/article32764076.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Magic masala||I never believed a day would come when I could write the following sentence without irony: I feel happier, more empowered, and more on top of the world than ever before. My self-esteem, which has traditionally hovered a few feet below the Mariana Trench, is at a historic high — floating several metres above the Statue of Unity. My shuffling gait is gone. In its place now is a majestic swagger that fills onlookers with awe and anti-nationals with dread. But the biggest change is in my self-confidence. From being someone who always tended to doubt his decisions, I am today an audacious embodiment of aggressive arrogance enacted with assured aplomb. So what is the secret of my transformation? In one word: saffron. In April I got a call from an old friend who used to run a successful Ponzi scheme, better known these days as ‘financial services company’. But during the lockdown, he decided to shut it and start a saffron accessories business. Change your life “What kind of accessories?” I remember asking him. “Since masks are in big demand right now, we’re starting with saffron-coloured masks,” he said. “How does the colour of a mask matter?” I said. He shook his head. “You won’t understand. Wait till you actually try the product. It will change your life.” “Hahaha,” I said. “A mask will change my life?” “Not only will it change your life, it will also change your life chances,” he said. “While you’re at it,” I said, “you might as well promise me that it will restore my achhe din and drop Rs. 15 lakh in my bank account.” “That too, provided you buy all the accessories to the saffron mask.” “What accessories?” I said. “We will also be manufacturing saffron scarves, saffron caps, saffron neckties, saffron bedsheets, saffron headbands, saffron arm bands, and saffron socks,” he said. “Don’t worry, I’ll send you a free sample of each.” His promised samples arrived last week. I tried them out. And believe it or not, they have transformed my life. The first time I saw their full transformative power was at the PSU bank where I have an account for the sake of address proof. The staff there is of three kinds: the rude, the indifferent, and the somnolent. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve taken a token and stood in queue for 45 minutes, only to be told, when I finally reach the counter, that “system is down, come tomorrow.” Highly potent But this time, when I walked into the bank wearing my saffron mask, saffron headband, and saffron scarf around my neck, a hush fell over the usual crowd of pointless cash withdrawers, obsessive-compulsive account openers, and serial passbook updaters. The counter clerks stood up one by one and welcomed me with folded hands (the traditional Indian greeting). Everyone — even the security guard — smiled at me. The branch manager rushed out of his cabin to touch my feet (also a traditional Indian greeting). Then he ordered filter coffee and rasgulla for me, and yelled at his minions to fill up my forms and get the job done “asap as possible”. For the first time in my life, I felt like a ‘preferred customer’. As I was driving back home from the bank, I was so distracted by the novel experience at the bank that I hit a pedestrian, and he fell. I wasn’t driving fast. So, while he wasn’t dead, he was furious. But as I got out of the car to check on him, I saw his expression change. The anger slowly drained from his face, like intelligence from the brain of a TV news panelist. Then there was a jump cut, and he was giving me a big, goofy grin. As I came up to him, he folded his hands (a traditional Indian form of apology) and said, “Entirely my fault, sir. Wonder what I was doing on the zebra crossing. Please forgive me. I will bear the full expenses for the treatment of my injuries and compensate you for the non-existent damage caused to your car.” I was stunned. For the first time ever I was the undisputed victor of a conflict situation on a Delhi road. That evening, I decided to try out every one of my friend’s product offerings, and I have to say, all of them are highly potent. My migraine disappears every time I wear the saffron headband. Kattabomman’s nursery teacher pays him more attention during the Zoom classes on the days I wrap his head in a saffron gamcha. Morning walkers proactively, and respectfully, move aside when they see me marching towards them in saffron socks. And since I started using a saffron bed sheet and saffron pillow covers, my nightmares about India’s democracy, judiciary and economy have stopped completely. So if you are feeling a bit low, broke, unemployed, hungry, or COVID-positive, don’t worry. Just remember: there’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a little bit of saffron.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Across the Dandi bridge||The Salt March to Dandi commenced from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, which is about three hundred and eighty kilometres away. The point of departure was the ashram’s gate near a tamarind tree that Gandhi named Sarva-Sakshi Amli, or, the All-Witnessing Tamarind. Standing in an otherwise barren terrain, the now fallen tamarind tree witnessed everything before and after the march. Beyond it, half a kilometre from the ashram, lies Dandi Bridge. In 1930, the first satyagrahis to Dandi crossed this bridge, traversing a gorge between the ashram and Gujarat Vidyapith, an institute of higher learning founded by Gandhi to boycott the British system of education. Unlike the tamarind tree that lives only in memory, Dandi Bridge has been rescued after decades of decay and neglect. I remember its formerly dilapidated state. I remember its rusty and tattered yellow sign in hand-painted Gujarati script. I remember news reports decrying its ruined sections. Now that the historic structure is restored, access is restricted. But as luck would have it, on the day I went prepared to climb the locked gates to shoot pictures inside, the bridge was open temporarily. For the satyagrahis, crossing Dandi Bridge was less fraught an action than crossing Ellis Bridge, the first bridge of Ahmedabad. Since Ellis Bridge was constructed and named by the British, there were concerns that its use in the Salt March might defeat the purpose of boycott and the message of Swadeshi. Incidentally and ironically, Ellis Bridge became the venue for long deliberations on whether the protesters should walk on it. Imagine the confusion experienced by the large crowds gathered to observe the rejection of all things British. Eventually, the satyagrahis decided to sidestep Ellis Bridge. In yet another contrast between the old and the new, the old bridge has been discontinued from active use. It is flanked on both sides by new bridges for commuters. Padlocked gates prevent access to the historic bridge. Leap of faith Determined to scale the gate of old Ellis Bridge without drawing attention, I reached the site before daybreak. It was too dark to shoot. I switched on the car radio to kill time, but the wait only increased my anxiety. Parking away from the bridge, I ambled closer to the gate, intending to climb up and jump to the other side. Luckily, there were not many people at that hour, but a vehicle did pass by occasionally, reminding me of the risks of being seen entering a restricted area. As I mustered courage and reached halfway up, it dawned on me that the gate was a bit higher than I had anticipated in my enthusiasm. Or rather, I was older. The last time I jumped from a gate was twenty-five years ago, in college. Memory plays tricks on you to make youthful actions appear deceptively easy much later. I took a literal leap of faith from the top of the gate and luckily broke neither bone nor camera in landing on the tarmac. Now that I was inside, the bridge’s bowstring arches provided cover and allowed me to shoot with ease. Fresh grass sprouted on the edges of the broken motorway, infusing the industrial structure with warmth and life. In spite of the light traffic on either side, the bridge seemed surprisingly isolated and pastoral in character. At Chandola Lake, Gandhi delivered the first of his many powerful speeches of the march. On the dusty road from the ashram to Chandola, dirt began to envelope the marchers. So thorough was the layer of grime on the satyagrahis’ faces that the crowds following the procession did not recognise Gandhi and walked right past their beloved leader. The eighty satyagrahis washed in the mostly dry and muddy lake and then rested on its bank. The area around Chandola Lake was a small village on the outskirts of Ahmedabad ninety years ago. Small-scale industry and unsanctioned construction flourish there today. Early in the morning, a pungent odour emanated from what I imagine were chemicals discarded by industrial units. The lake is filled to the brim with severely polluted water that cannot support life. How it began My project to retrace and document the sites of the Dandi March began two years ago at Rangjyot, the printing facility at Navjivan Press where I print my photographs. One day, I was in the middle of prepress operations, when in walked Vivek Desai — friend, photographer, and managing director of Navjivan Trust. He sat next to me and shared his plan to invite photographers for an assignment about Gujarat. I was intrigued. Each photographer, he continued, would document within a year’s time a unique aspect that interested them in Gujarat. It sounded like a fantastic concept. If executed well, I said, it could make a great publication. A faint smile lifted the corners of his mouth, and he asked me if I might consider accepting his invitation. Without missing a beat, I agreed. That night, as my mind raced in many directions, a kernel of focus that had lain dormant for over half a decade, emerged with a new sense of urgency: I would shoot the historic sites of the Salt March of 1930, from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad to the coastal village of Dandi, as they exist in the present. As I immersed myself in researching the history of the march, the pre-photographic task became clear: I would have to match the sites described in various accounts published many decades ago to the transformed environment before my eyes. To this end, I prepared a dossier of local facts from my reading and carried it on the shoots. It became a handy map of history that helped my camera see what was significant. My second task was recording the testimonial accounts of any surviving witnesses of the march. Vivekbhai knew of an elderly gentleman, Lakshmansinh Chavda, who had walked with the satyagrahis from the Sabarmati Ashram up to the Income Tax Circle in Ahmedabad. Lakshmansinh was visiting his son Dilip in mid-2018. From here materialized a web of prior connections. Dilip worked at Kalamkush, a handmade paper factory near the ashram, where I had shot a photo series in the past. I re-acquainted myself with Dilip and visited his home located across the ashram complex. Lakshmansinh reclined on a bed far away from the room’s only window. Morning light streamed in from the window, but it did not reach him. Dilip and I helped Lakshmansinh sit next to the open door of the backyard. After taking a few stills, I video-recorded his reminiscences of Gandhi. A former security guard at the Sarabhai residence in Ahmedabad, Lakshmansinh walked with the satyagrahis when the march flagged off. He battled advanced amnesia now, but two memories stood out sharply in our conversation. He remembered handing a towel to Gandhi after the latter bathed in the Sabarmati river. While putting the towel on Gandhi’s shoulders, he noticed that Gandhi’s arms reached his knees. Lakshmansinh bowed and told him that such long arms were signs that he was a great soul. Gandhi simply smiled at the remark. His other encounter with Gandhi took place when he was a domestic employee in the house of Sheth Mangaldas, a preeminent industrialist of Ahmedabad. His employer had been in a car accident, and while he was laid up, the trio of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Gandhi paid him a visit. The younger Nehru climbed the steep staircase spryly. When came Gandhi’s turn, Patel jokingly asked Lakshmansinh to assist the old man up, punning on “up the stairs” in Gujarati to also imply the stairs to heaven. Gandhi replied with a joke of his own: with independence still far away, why was Patel in a hurry to see him up? Delicate ties to the past It seemed to me that Lakshmansinh could only tap into memories that were associated with Gandhi. Recalling the two interactions changed him, perhaps into someone he was in his youth. Over the years, Dilip had noted down anecdotes that his father narrated about Gandhi, and these now seemed a part of the family lore. He now used these notes to prompt his father. But the delicate connection to the past snapped at times, leaving Lakshmansinh staring past us. The blank look in his eyes brought great pathos to his face. Lakshmansinh’s portraits were the first photographs I took in retracing the march. A few months after our encounter, Dilip called me with the news of his father’s demise. One of the last living witnesses of the Salt March was gone. The loss saddened me greatly. During this project, I spent more time not shooting a historic site than shooting it. At Sabarmati Ashram, I would switch off my camera and sit in solitude under the shade of the ashram’s ancient trees, waiting for the right frame to compose itself. I looked forward to these poignant waits. They stimulated my imagination. My mind often re-enacted the historical events that once took place on these very grounds and within Hriday Kunj, Gandhi’s home from 1918 to 1930, when he vowed before the Salt March not to return home till Swaraj was won. A series of bygone activities came alive for me: Gandhi eating frugal meals prepared in the pantry; Gandhi working in the small office bathed in sunshine; Gandhi sleeping by the veranda; Gandhi emerging from the front gate on the morning of the march; the satyagrahis gathering for the last prayers at the ashram. Kakasaheb Kalelkar presented Gandhi with his iconic bamboo staff in the ground beyond Hriday Kunj, towards the back gate. This was the staff the Mahatma carried throughout the march. It is ingrained in our collective visual memory. At the gate, Kasturba applied tilak to Gandhi’s forehead for an auspicious beginning to the march. My mind conjured these stirring images that might have been routinely ceremonial at the time. Perhaps my shoots were excuses for these waits. Fervour recalled From Sabarmati Ashram, I retraced the march to Gujarat Vidyapith. The institute was established in 1920 to offer education to students who boycotted British colleges as a part of the non-cooperation movement incited by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar. It was the first national educational institution of its kind. Its success prompted the opening of such schools in various parts of the country. Gujarat Vidyapith was officially the first stop where the satyagrahis met with a reserve cohort prepared to step up in the event of their arrest. The university, which was then on the urban periphery, is now a green oasis in the heart of Ahmedabad. The marchers were welcomed eagerly in what is now the oldest building there. The historical sites once charged with the fervor of the satyagrahis appear strangely placid today. The marchers spent the first night of their journey at a dharamshala—a rest house for travelers—in the village of Aslali. With unparalleled enthusiasm, the residents of Aslali cheered the arrival of the satyagrahis. Of all the centres on the route to Dandi, Aslali proved to be the one most bedecked with flowers. Now, it is a densely populated town overrun with brick and mortar houses. I knew from my research that the dharamshala was demolished to make way for a panchayat building. It took many cold calls on passersby to locate the building successfully. It was the peak of the monsoon season; rain clouds had begun gathering quickly. Once the staff arrived, I met Manilal Prajapati, a peon in the panchayat. When he was a child, his school was housed in the dharamshala. He showed me around the building and identified the spot where Gandhi slept during the stop. In a Shiv temple behind the panchayat building, Gandhi gave his Aslali speech. A Swaminarayan temple now stands imperiously between the two, cutting off their circumstantial connection. The Shiv temple from the early twentieth century is modest in size, confined to a very small but tranquil yard. Devotees come and go about their rituals quietly. There is not the frenzy of activity usually associated with large temples. The light drizzle that had contributed to my admiration for the ambience switched to a heavy downpour suddenly. I shielded my equipment and hurried away, jumping over puddles that formed at an alarming rate. By the time I reached the car, I was drenched but satisfied with what I had documented so far.  The 420-page photo-book, 23 Grams of Salt: Retracing Gandhi’s March to Dandi ,   is published by Navajivan Trust, Ahmedabad, to commemorate the   90th anniversary of the march this year.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Casting a long shadow||The long hand of caste touches every aspect of Indian life, politics, culture, society, history. Suraj Yengde begins his recent book, Caste Matters , by saying “I am forced to live in the world as though I am secondary, and the Brahmin and his universality are primary.” Two other writers Sujatha Gidla ( Ants among Elephants ) and Yashica Dutt ( Coming out as Dalit ) have recalled the inhumanity endured by the dispossessed, the malady of caste and “the invisible arm that turns the gears in nearly every system in our country.” Now, an American journalist and writer Isabel Wilkerson seeks to understand the “race-based caste pyramid” in her own country by linking it to two other caste systems, that of Nazi Germany and India. Stigma of inferiority In Caste , a painful exploration of what human beings are capable of doing to each other, Wilkerson writes that “each version relied on stigmatizing those deemed inferior to justify the dehumanization necessary to keep the lowest-ranked people at the bottom.” A caste system is an artificial construction, she points out. It is “a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of other groups.” With devastating anecdotal evidence, some from her own life, years of research, reading the works of Gunnar Myrdal, Allison Davis, B.R. Ambedkar et al, and interviews across continents, Wilkerson reaches the conclusion that the hierarchy of caste is about power — which groups have it and which do not. In America, she says, caste is the bones, race the skin. In India too, caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place. Even for those who shatter these manufactured divisions, it is never an easy transition. She quotes Ambedkar, who worked his whole life for the ‘annihilation of caste’, to argue why the divide is so well-entrenched: “Caste is a notion; it is a state of mind.” Ambedkar, who she once called the Martin Luther King of India to make him relatable to a fellow American, had written to sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois that there is a lot of “similarity between the position of untouchables in India and the position of Negroes in America.” Caste and its ‘eight pillars’ which includes religious sanction, be it in the U.S. or India, hold everyone captive, according to Wilkerson. It forces a black woman to pretend she is not the owner of the house she lives in. It makes a Dalit scholar feel inadequate to face upper caste people. It lets people live in fear. She tells disturbing stories — of a black boy drowned in front of his father; about lynchings, and lynching postcards with photographs of the killings which were apparently a common form of communication in the turn of 20th century America; of huge inequities and other instances of everyday humiliation like being made a scapegoat for all societal ills from drugs, stagnant jobs to crime. Some of her accounts could be taken off headlines in India. Towards a resolution But her book is not just a chronicle of insults. The Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and writer of the highly-acclaimed The Warmth of Other Suns casts a light onto the history of caste and its consequences “to express hopes for its resolution.” Humans can break free of the hierarchy’s hold on them, she writes. But while Germany had atoned for its Nazi past — all memorials in that country are for victims not aggressors — and South Africa set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of apartheid, Wilkerson emphasises that America has a lot to do to bridge the gap. She writes of the visit of Martin Luther King Jr and his wife to India in 1959. The civil rights leader wanted to see the land of Mahatma Gandhi whose fight for freedom from British rule had inspired his fight for justice for his people. The oldest democracy and the largest democracy have since abolished legal discrimination and yet Dalits are “brutalized” as are African-Americans. In an American election year, her observations on the Obama and Trump presidencies are chilling reminders of the deep prevailing chasm. When Trump won in 2016, she heard many progressives saying how could so many people (read whites) vote against their own interests? Wilkerson contends that they voted that way because it was in their interest — they wanted to maintain the caste system as it had always been. Some may argue that linking race relations in America to Nazi atrocities and the Indian caste system is tenuous but she strongly argues her case with a powerful document that holds lessons for aggressors and their victims all over the world.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The buck stops at Bhutan||Ranged in single file stand Reliance Trends, Pantaloons and Citi Mart, along with many other branded malls, whose density increases as we reach the vibrantly engraved Bhutan Gate. Guarding the border gate between India and Bhutan is a rusted and locked grille. The locked gate is an unusual sight for the people of the small yet densely populated town of Jaygaon that’s known as Jaigaon in West Bengal. Shutters down Trucks are lined up on the Jaygaon side of the Bhutan Gate — waiting to deliver food consignments from Kolkata and Siliguri to Bhutan. A few kilometres away is a shopping complex that stands dark and empty, its shutters down and its keepers idle. At the entrance of the complex is a small shop with a heart-shaped leaf drawn on its closed blue shutters. Wrapping betel leaves around pieces of areca nut and smearing chuna is Atul*. He recalls the days just before the pandemic lockdown was declared. On March 22, he sold 3,000 paans for Rs. 10 each to his Bhutanese buyers, who take them back to Phuentsholing, a Bhutanese border town. “They love doma paan with Bangla betel leaves. In the last two years alone, around 100 paan shops have popped up in Jaygaon, and 70% of our customers are Bhutanese,” he says. Chewing on a betel leaf, Atul adds, “I hope the Bhutan Gate opens soon, or else I will have to shut shop and sell vegetables instead.” Gateway to Bhutan Jaygaon offers three major categories of employment: there are the labourers who work in Bhutan, there are the local businesses patronised by Bhutanese customers, and the flat owners who rent to Bhutanese tenants. “Jaygaon exists on the map because of Bhutan. And after the lockdown, there are no jobs here any more,” says an employee of a tourism agency in Phuentsholing. It’s been six months since the Bhutan Gate was closed. Jaygaon, grandly called the ‘gateway to Bhutan’, has come to a standstill. With each passing month, the people of the town are losing hope that their businesses will ever revive. “People are now moving to Bengaluru to work as labourers,” says a porter. Says Anil Prasad, director of Vakil’s supermarket in Jaygaon, “If the gate doesn’t open soon, I will face massive losses and be forced to shut down and move to Siliguri for better opportunities.” The restaurants in the area, which primarily catered to the labourers who would pack lunch before they left for Bhutan on work, are all closed. On March 8, Bhutan cancelled the work permits of hundreds of Indian labourers. In early April, as the coronavirus cases rose, Bhutanese tenants in Jaygaon returned to Phuentsholing. “We transported the belongings of over 200 Bhutanese families to Bhutan Gate,” says Phurba Lama, the Panchayat head of Jaygaon 2. Twice in size Meanwhile, India’s loss is Bhutan’s gain. A report in KuenselOnline, a media outlet in Bhutan, says the local economy in Phuentsholing seems to be picking up because buyers are not going to Jaygaon for commodities such as clothes and food. Jaygaon has grown to twice its original size just in the last two years. Recent data gathered for the West Bengal government showed that some 1,100 labourers had come to Jaygaon from Bihar alone for construction work in Bhutan. Says Phurba Lama, “Jaygaon was just a gram panchayat masquerading as a border town. We demanded a municipality status considering its growing size and density.” On June 9, at a meeting with the People Welfare Society, Jaygaon’s people demanded the opening of Bhutan Gate for basic business. Lama replied that Bhutan Gate was the property of Bhutan and the administration understood the problem but needed to wait for further dialogue. “It is understandable that Bhutan is afraid to open the gate,” says Lama. “It is a small country with a population of just eight lakh.” And the pandemic shows no signs of abating in India.  *Name changed on request.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Shining light in women’s education||Women educators have redefined history worldwide. Be it Anne Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, or Maria Montessori and Mary Mcleod Bethune, who established new educational methods. India’s education canvas too bears masterly strokes from path-breaking women who fought for women’s education and cultural uplift. Savitribai Phule (first woman schoolteacher in mid-1800s), Durgabai Deshmukh (established vocational training schools for women) and Begum Zafar Ali (first woman matriculate of Kashmir) are examples. Our personal experience unravels the story of one such unspoken hero, R. Lilavati. A child widow, she refused remarriage and fought for an education, becoming an educationist for 35 years during the British Raj, creating an army of Indian educators and finally serving as the Deputy Director of School Education, Tamil Nadu, in 1974. Leela, as she was known, was born in Madras in 1919. In 1930, this timid 11-year-old was married before knowing what marriage meant. Three months later, before she formally lived with her husband, he died. As her father consoled her, Leela said, “Send me to school”, with unassuming calm. Those four words changed the arc of multiple generations of families. Perhaps, she drew inspiration from R.S. Subbulakshmi, a child widow who founded Sarada Vidyalaya in the 1920s to educate young widows, where Leela would later start her teaching career. Change-maker For Leela, this was just the beginning. After schooling in Madurai, she had her vision to be a change-maker within and beyond the classroom underpinned by her teachers at Queen Mary’s College from 1935 to 1939, and Lady Willingdon Training College in 1940 in Chennai. Leela instilled similar experiences and discipline in her students. Students recall headmistress Leela leading Government Girls’ High Schools in Vellore and Chidambaram from 1944 to 1959, dressed in crisp white saris and hair tied in a firm bun, while she transformed a dilapidated wedding hall into a school fit for young girls. Going door-to-door, she would debate with parents to let their children become a graduate before becoming a wife. One of her students reminisces, “India had just gained Independence. Schools had a tall order to shape a new generation of Indians, and teachers were considered role models. Leela taught us self-empowerment and leadership, much before it was described in management books. Several of us became educators, inspired by her.” Positive thinking and a feisty spirit accompanied Leela as a single working woman from the 1940s to 1970s. She proudly became the only woman in Tamil Nadu selected for the Madras English Literature Teaching (MELT) Campaign in the 1950s. In 1965, the British Council gave her a rare honour in selecting her to visit England and Wales for a Language Laboratory programme. “We discussed regional challenges in English teaching, which I brought home to strengthen pedagogical techniques at the Regional Institute of English, South India [where she was a lecturer],” she recalled. When her father insisted on the marriage of her younger sister, Leela whisked her away, boarded an overnight train, and admitted her to Queen Mary’s College. On her 100th birthday last year, Leela quipped, “Sachin Tendulkar often gets dismissed at 99, but I made a 100!” Leela passed away in Bengaluru in August at 101. Her vision, fearless spirit, and love for literature live as her legacy. What sweet irony then that Leela’s birthday is on March 8, International Women’s Day.  (The authors are nieces   of R.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||What Enthoven knew||The work we will look at today is a classic although it was written a little over a century ago. It is R.E. Enthoven’s The Tribes and Castes of Bombay , published in three volumes and still in print. A recent incident reminded me strongly of this book — I will come to that presently. Reginald Edward Enthoven was born in 1869 (the same year Mahatma Gandhi was born and Ghalib died), studied at Oxford, and came to India as a civil service officer at the age of 20. Stationed in Bombay, he worked on the census, among other things. He made several contributions to the Gazetteer , a periodical through which the British mapped and understood India, its physical features and communities. The black leather-bound volumes on Bombay make for wonderful reading. 500 communities Indian communities clearly interested Enthoven. The first one he describes in Volume II is that of oil-pressers in Gujarat who claimed mercantile descent though they were likely an occupational caste who broke off from the peasantry. Enthoven describes their family lives and rules of marriage. A man was allowed to marry his wife’s sister after the wife’s death; a widow could remarry her dead husband’s brother, but not the eldest one. Polygamy was also allowed if the earlier wife was provided for. Enthoven documents marriage rituals and related gods, inheritance laws and death rituals. Naturally, he also explains how their hereditary profession is carried out. He ends by noting that “they eat the flesh of goats, sheep, fowls and fish, and drink liquor”. The whole thing takes up two pages. In this fashion, Enthoven documented 500 communities in all. At first, this effort likely fit in with what the government was trying to achieve through the census and other such documentation. But government funding for the community by community and caste by caste survey was stopped in 1909, according to a note published by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1924. It was left to Enthoven to use his own resources to complete the work. Enthusiasts working on similar projects pitched in (G.H. Desai compiled a glossary of castes, tribes, and races in Baroda State in 1912). The three volumes of The Tribes and Castes of Bombay were published in 1920 and their contents have since then been widely used, including by the ‘The People of India’ series, which is a very large ethnographic survey of all of India started by the British in 1868 and taken up by the government in 1992. ‘The People of India’ survey uses Enthoven’s format, which is informative and easy to read. Happy ending Now to turn to the personal event referred to earlier. Recently, I had to attend the hearing for a complaint filed by a ruling party legislator who took offence to something I wrote about his leader’s community. What I wrote was anodyne and factual: the offence probably stemmed from ignorance. But since it was registered as a criminal case, I had to defend myself by producing evidence. Here, I used a note published by the National Commission for Backward Classes, which was formed to introduce relevant communities into the list of Other Backward Classes (this is done State by State after ethnographically identifying the socio-economically backward sub-castes). The note referred to the fact that the Muslim members of a particular caste had been given reservations as OBCs but not the Hindu members, though they shared the same caste occupation, even the name. In the mid-90s, the Hindus submitted a petition for inclusion: a senior Central government bureaucrat looked at the evidence and concluded that Hindus and Muslims from this caste were indeed one community. The Hindu caste, he wrote, should be treated as a synonym for the Muslim one. The evidence the bureaucrat cited was from Enthoven’s Tribes and Castes of Bombay . The story ended happily for the Hindus, who were included in the Mandal list as OBCs and got reservations. I do not know if my own story will have a happy ending too, as the case continues, but it promises to be interesting.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The many conversations with truth||If M.K. Gandhi’s writings matter to us today, the writer in him should matter more, especially for humanist scholars. He is one of the most prolific writers of all times, having provided enough material for the nearly hundred-volume Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi , besides numerous rough drafts and unpublished material. How did Gandhi manage to write so much despite his hectic schedule? Since writing is a public act performed privately, what did writing mean to Gandhi — the public personality and the private self? Why did he write at all? In examining Gandhi’s writerly self, I would like to focus on two of his classics, Hind Swaraj and his autobiography,  The Story of My Experiments with Truth. Gandhi’s involvement with print culture — journalism, editing, publishing, translating and authoring books — invites one more biography. His direct and simple prose devoid of artificiality was honed over the years, chiefly through his reading of the Bible and the English authors. His experience of drafting documents constantly for the Congress might have shaped his art of composition too. Besides, he was an obsessive letter-writer, penning thousands of epistles in his lifetime. No rights reserved Gandhi wrote Hind Swaraj in Gujarati in 1909, aboard a steamer, when he was on the way to South Africa from England. In their critical edition of Hind Swaraj , Suresh Sharma and Tridip Suhrud reconstruct the history of its composition. The pull of writing was so overwhelming that Gandhi used his left hand when the right got tired. The journey had been preceded by an intense period of thinking, reading and discussion on the issues he dealt with in Hind Swaraj. The steamer, like prison, provided an enabling space to reflect and write. As Gandhi explains in the foreword, he wrote Hind Swaraj because he could not restrain himself after having read and pondered much. He says that the views expressed in the book are not his because they were formed after reading several books. In the appendix he gives a list of books that influenced him. Gandhi conceived of his writing as bricolage, an assemblage of different modes of thought. He weaved in the ideas of Plato, Tolstoy, Ruskin, Thoreau, Edward Carpenter, Dadabhai Naoroji, and many others, in Hind Swaraj.  Thus Gandhi not only negated the idea of the author at the centre of the production of meaning, he also practised inter-textuality, predating the poststructuralist theory of the death of the author. He had a pre-modern and pre-capitalist understanding of the writing self and text — for him, they were not sites of intellectual property. He renounced the text by declaring in the title page of the first English edition of Hind Swaraj, ‘No Rights Reserved’. If Gandhi conceived of himself as a weaver of different thoughts in Hind Swaraj , he was up to a different adventure in his autobiography. The critical edition of My Experiments with Truth by Suhrud gives us several clues to what writing meant for Gandhi. According to Suhrud, Gandhi experimented with all kinds of things, including food, clothing and body. Likewise, writing for him was a field of experiments with different practices of the self. Writing, especially the autobiography, was also a matrix of self-discipline. When he found himself stalled, he framed a programme, devoting six hours a day to literary studies as part of his writing exercise. Still small voice If he wrote Hind Swaraj in the solitary space of the steamer, he penned most of his autobiography in the social environs of the ashram. Originally written in Gujarati, it came out in 166 instalments in Gandhi’s journal, Navajivan, between 1925 and 1929. When he began, he had no definite plan, no diary or documents on which to base the story. He says, “I write just as the Spirit moves me at the time of writing.” As if as a counterpoint to the polyphony of Hind Swaraj , it is the antarayami (a Gujarati word translated as ‘Spirit’ in English), the inner voice, that speaks in My Experiments . Gandhi was not following fashionable Western practices in writing his autobiography. For him, his life consisted of nothing but his experiments with truth and he wanted to tell that story. He made a clear distinction between atmakatha (the story of a self) and jivan vrutant (the chronicle of life). What he attempted was atmakatha — the autobiography as a space for having a conversation with oneself, a site for self-exploration. Suhrud observes that Gandhi could have written it only in Gujarati, the language in which he communicated with the self and also the language in which he heard the ‘still small voice’ speaking from within. He stopped writing it the moment he thought the latter part of his life was already in the public sphere. Writing for Gandhi was thus both a personal conversation with the self and a social act of communication with the reader outside. And it was through this ethical engagement with the self and the world that he conveyed the principles that he practised all his life.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The world never goes away||That the Partition with its attendant wounds could, more than half a century later, impact the fates of two young lovers in a small coastal town in Wales, seems unlikely, if not far-fetched. But Karuna Ezara Parikh’s accomplished debut novel, The Heart Asks Pleasure First , fashions an all-too-plausible scenario where this, in fact, could happen. Aaftab, a law student from an affluent but orthodox Islamabad background meets Daya, an aspiring dancer from Lalabad (a thinly disguised Delhi), from the ranks of India’s uber liberal intelligentsia, with parents who proudly wear their secular credentials on their sleeve. Daya, who has come to study ballet in this Welsh town, meets Aaftab in a park where he is sitting on a bench reading Anna Karenina . They soon fall in love. But from early on in the relationship, Aaftab has misgivings about its future, having acquired the wisdom of avoiding unwinnable situations through his dealings with his abusive, authoritarian father. Shades and nuances His approach to Islam is heavily influenced by the Sufi poets he loves reading, and his religious observances are confined to attending Friday prayers in the local mosque. This is the extent of his contact with the small, tightly knit Muslim community which is increasingly being influenced by the new imam’s radical sermons, finding in them a defence against the casual racism of the townspeople. From Daya’s perspective, which Parikh evokes with great sympathy, the religious and nationalist differences between herself and Aaftab, particularly the former, have little relevance. She shares her parents’ liberal humanist belief that it is irrational to hate an entire country or community. One can hate an individual, according to this worldview, but not a nation or religion. The action takes place in the early 2000s: therefore 9/11 as well as the attack on India’s Parliament happen in the course of the narrative. While the former event impels Aaftab to examine what his Muslim identity means to him, Daya, in the wake of the Parliament attack and subsequent military mobilisation, is forced to consider her feelings of outrage, but finds they have little bearing on her feelings for Aaftab. Wasim, Aaftab’s roommate, represents the alternative third position. This lower-middle class boy from Rawalpindi is a non-Westernised counterpoint to Daya’s secular liberalism and Aaftab’s Sufi-influenced Islam. Wasim comes across as grounded and loyal, a friend to both Daya and Aaftab, but from his viewpoint their relationship is impossible — even though they conceal the extent of their involvement from him. He is a devout and practising Muslim, but refuses to have any truck with the fundamentalists; he is a devoted son and brother but allows his family to think he’s studying medicine and not the considerably less prestigious physical education. In Parikh’s telling, he has shades and nuances — more multi-dimensional in contrast to Aaftab’s relentless self-examination and Daya’s blithe unquestioning acceptance of her parents’ virtues and values. Haunting language Matters come to a head when Daya has to rush home because of her father’s serious illness while the imam mounts a campaign against Aaftab for his relationship with a non-Muslim. The denouement is swift and brutal but with a small sliver of hope left at the end. Parikh’s story explores a space where these two earnest young lovers come together trying to discover if it is possible to find a personal truth which is unaffected by the impersonal forces swirling outside their bubble — the forces of history, politics and old hatreds. But they find — as did others from Paris and Helen to Anna Karenina to the victims of so-called ‘honour’ killings — that complete insulation is not possible; that the world never goes away and always punishes what it sees as transgressions. The universe Parikh creates, that of a small diaspora in the small quiet town of Cardiff, with its tight sense of inclusion and exclusion, its codes and punishments, has been explored before — Maps for Lost Lovers by Nadeem Aslam comes to mind. Her language is fluid and haunting and the writing is remarkable for its gentleness. But there are some drawbacks: Daya and Aaftab are somewhat one-dimensional figures and their parents — whether Aaftab’s violent and intractable father or Daya’s parents with their undiluted goodness — sometimes feel like caricatures. Besides, the long, dense expositions of political or historical background (Akbar’s Navratnas, Osama bin Laden’s antecedents, and so on) are not knitted into the story but interrupt the narrative annoyingly. But these are minor cavils. Taken as a whole, The Heart Asks Pleasure First is a remarkable debut that bravely tackles some grand, tough questions about how the past bleeds into the present, and about the role of love, loyalty, history and faith.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||How Gandhi adopted music on the way to freedom||By the time Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa and became active in the independence struggle, there was already a wave of music nationalism being championed by the likes of Vishnu Paluskar, V.N. Bhatkhande and Subramania Bharati; traditional musical practices were being relocated from palace courts to the public arena. Soon after his arrival in India, realising its potential to bring people together, Gandhi adopted music as one of the instruments to mobilise the masses for the cause of swaraj. In Singing Gandhi’s India , historian Lakshmi Subramanian examines Gandhi’s relationship with music through his letters, significant events and other documents. Leaning on bhajans Subramanian begins by introducing the reader to the early nationalisation project aimed at collating and creating a new ‘classical’ tradition of Indian music: Hindustani classical in the north and Carnatic in the south. This reform project, however, led to the exclusion of the communities of the traditional practitioners such as the Devadasis in the south and the Ustads and Tawaifs in the north. Interestingly, according to Subramanian, Gandhi did not engage with this reform project; he felt the classical form of music demanded an intimate knowledge of technique. For Gandhi, music — whether it was a bhajan like Vaishnava Janato or a patriotic song like Vande Mataram — was a means of development of the “moral self” which was essential to become a satyagrahi. Subramanian writes that Gandhi saw the morning prayers as a way to inspire personal discipline and community singing as a means of mobilising people. The book traces Gandhi’s relationship with music from the early days of the Sabarmati Ashram till the time of Independence. But Subramanian does not follow a chronological approach which can be confusing for a reader trying to understand the evolution of this complicated relationship. However, the historian engages the reader by revealing the difficulties in interpreting the vast and frequently contradicting writings of Gandhi. In one instance, she writes about resisting the “temptation to speculate on the gendered dimensions” of Gandhi’s forthright instructions to women followers via his correspondence with Saraladebi Chaudhurani. Moral lessons She also examines Gandhi’s reflections — amounting to dismissing the requirement of public performance of religious songs to assert devotion to a religion — on the communal conflicts created by the singing of devotional songs at prayer times in front of mosques in the 1920s and his subsequent endorsement of the public performance of prabhat pheris (morning musical processions)  in the 1930s as a political act. Crossing hurdles It is fascinating to read how Gandhi remained committed to his idea of music as an important device to build a moral society despite several hurdles such as the opposition to the invocation of Lord Rama in the Ramdhun (Gandhi responded by saying Ram is universal and belongs to all religions) and the Hindu undertones of Vande Mataram .  Despite its uneven structure, the timing of the book helps the reader to delve deep into Gandhi’s use of music as a means of spiritual development and his failure in inspiring the masses to adopt a morally upright lifestyle. It also provokes the reader on contemplating how Gandhi who “admitted it was not possible to have politics without religion” would have reacted to the increasingly intertwined discourse of religion and nation in the country.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1On October 4, 1883, the first train with this now famous name departed from Paris to Constantinople (now Istanbul). Although the original service was simply a normal international railway service, because it was a showcase of luxury and comfort at a time when travelling was still rough and dangerous, the name became synonymous with intrigue and luxury travel. Its name pops up in many films and books and there is even a popular crime story set on this train. What is the name of this train, which unfortunately ceased operations in 2009? 2The TEE was an international first-class railway service that was founded in 1957 and ceased in 1995. It has a network of 45 trains, connecting 130 different cities, from Spain in the west to Austria in the east, and from Denmark in the north to southern Italy. The service inspired a 1977 album by German band Kraftwerk, which popularised the network globally. What is the full form of TEE? 3The Maitree Express II is a bi-weekly international express rail service that runs between Kolkata and the city of Khulna in Bangladesh. You need a valid visa and passport to purchase a ticket on this train. In 2017, it was flagged off by the Prime Ministers of both countries. What is the other, official name of this train service, which is fittingly the Bengali word for ‘bonding’? 4This is a private train service in central Europe that provides a hotel-on-wheels service with sleeping cars, complete with restaurant, lounge and staff cars. It starts at Budapest and crosses several other capital cities — Vienna, Bratislava and Belgrade. Its name comes from the fact that its route follows the contours of a natural entity that also runs through these cities. What is the name of this train service? 5From 1954 to 2016, there was an international overnight express train service between Germany and Switzerland. It was named after a natural phenomenon, as both the latter and the train travelled at great speed at regular intervals and could only be seen at night. What is the name of this train service, which is the German spelling for the English term? 6This international passenger train runs daily between New York and Union Station in Toronto. It takes about 12 hours to complete the 875-km trip, including two hours for customs and immigration inspection at Niagara Falls. The train is named after the national symbol of Canada, which is even found on the national flag. What is the name of this train service? 7This international express ran between Switzerland and the Netherlands, through Belgium and France, since 1928. It was named after the common name of the mountain flower Leontopodium alpinum . This flower found all throughout the Alps is also regarded as a symbol of Switzerland. What is the name of this train service, which you might remember from a beautiful song in The Sound of Music ? 8This is a high-speed passenger train operated by Amtrak that provides three daily round trips between Chicago, Illinois and Pontiac, Michigan. The name is carried over from a heritage train service that ran between Chicago and Detroit. The train is named after the common name for the animal Gulo gulo , a small bear-like animal known for its ferocity, strength and ability to eat a lot ( gulo is Latin for Glutton). What is the name of this train, which you probably know because of a famous fictional character with retractable adamantium claws? 9This is an international train linking the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, and the former West German capital city of Bonn. It ran from 1972 to 2002 and was named after the second part of the name of a famous deaf composer who was born in the city of Bonn. What is the name of the train, which might make you think it is a land-based form of transport rather than a train? 10This is a superfast express train running daily between Madurai and Chennai. On its first run, it covered the distance of 497 km in seven hours and five minutes, after which it was slowed down for safety purposes to a running time of seven hours and 40 minutes. The train is named after a vital river on the banks of which the mighty Pandyan dynasty (after whom another train is named) built their empire. What is the name of this train, which was one of the first certified to run at more than 100 km/h? A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/easy-like-sunday-morning/article32764147.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||This is Híristor’s story||Híristor is not a fantastical being out of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, but a real-life giant of flesh and blood. The elephant’s name means ‘knowledgeable leader’ in the Elvish language, which Nishant Srinivasaiah favours for naming his research subjects. He felt people would be quick to judge or project their own biases on elephants if he gave them names like Raja, Ganesa, and Rowdy. “We name them for a reason, but then even we forget after a while,” says the researcher. “It helps us be unbiased.” Ten years ago, when Srinivasaiah first caught sight of Híristor, the young bull along with others of similar age were understudies of an older male elephant. These wild giants, every one of them a bull, didn’t live in jungles only but made forays into the agricultural areas of Tumakuru, northwest of Bengaluru, weaving their way through residential alleys, crossing highways, and climbing over fences. An irrigation project channelled water year-round to grow crops, and the ripening fields attracted elephants. The constant battles with farmers could create hostile living conditions for the animals. However, eating cultivated cereals for dinner and being chased by humans are a normal part of their daily routine, says Srinivasaiah. Híristor was probably born 100 kilometres away in Bannerghatta National Park on the southern edge of Bengaluru. When he came of age and had to leave his mother’s herd, he probably followed a visiting bull into these lands, a daunting place for new entrants. How to avoid falling into concrete canals and breaking his legs? How to deal with an irate farmer? He could have learned by trial and error, a perilous choice. But he chose the less risky option of sticking close to an older, experienced bull. Cool and casual When Híristor grew independent of his mentor, he was the largest tusker in the area and collected his own entourage of younger bulls. They followed him into fields at night and feasted on ears of grain without alerting half-asleep farmers. The flunkies watched Híristor unlatch gates, look to the right when crossing roads, and being unafraid of camera traps that Srinivasaiah had affixed on their path. Although bulls like Híristor bulk up on crops and reach their prime faster than forest-living elephants, their lives are rife with danger. They could be electrocuted by illegally electrified fences or run over by trucks or trains. When Híristor came into musth, he padded his solitary way south to find mates in the forest where he was born. While he was away, his understudies lived by the skills they had learnt from him, reuniting with him on his return. “They greeted each other with elaborate rituals until now documented among female elephants and their kin only,” says Srinivasaiah. The role of experienced males such as Híristor in bull elephant society has been underestimated, says the researcher. “These are millennial elephants, explorers pushing the boundaries as far as they can.” Under their wise and calm tutelage, younger animals learn to keep their cool even if they are fearful. Without the older bulls’ stabilising influence, the brash inexperienced ones lash out aggressively at humans protecting their crops. None like him! But Híristor’s calm demeanour was also his downfall. Since he had a finely tuned ability to read human body language, he watched people in daylight instead of running away. To farmers who had faced one too many nightly elephantine visits, he symbolised the fearless marauder of their livelihoods. When complaints about elephant damage to crops compelled forest officials to act, they trapped him. None of the younger bulls in his group took his mantle, and they went their separate ways. Neither did his capture solve farmers’ problems. With high-strung giants dispersed across the countryside, the nightmare of protecting crops from them afflicted many more households. Several months later, the tusker died a captive. The larger-than-life elephant lived up to his name so well, the researcher cannot forget him or why he named the wise giant, Híristor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/this-is-hristors-story/article32764156.ece

Such strange yet sweet pairings have been subject of children’s books, movies, documentaries and YouTube videos. Jennifer S. Holland popularised this subject in her books beginning with Unlikely Friendships . In many images of interspecies bonding, we can observe a melancholy with the yearning for intimacy. Many of these images are interpreted with a hope of bridging differences and creating bonds. George Romanes, Darwin’s follower and author of Animal Intelligence (1882), argued that the psychological character of dogs in particular was “moulded by human agency and dogs take on human characteristics”. Romanes claimed that the result of cross-species contact was emotions crossed from human to non-human species. The impulse of humans is to capture the inner being of other species and ascribe humanly values to it. In many animal portraits, the gaze of these animals is not flattering but one that disturbs the human sense of exceptionalism as proposed by John Berger. Robotic reproductions of animals don’t pretend to be realistic. Mental commitment robots (MCRs) made in the form of a seal with enormous eyes and blinking eyelashes were extensively used after the tsunami in Japan among retirement communities and used to provide comfort for people with dementia and Alzheimer’s. And studies showed that non-human and robotic companions do improve the quality of people’s lives. And it makes us question whether interspecies bonding needs reciprocity. vibhude@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/breaking-species-barrier/article32764095.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Size matters||The term nanotechnology conjures up the image of a lab with electronics and wires, power (electricity) and cutting-edge applications, perhaps even a vision of the minute, but almost never its impact on society, the big science or even traditional medicine. Pankaj Sekhsaria’s book Nanoscale is a great place to begin to unravel the connectedness of disciplines, the impact of this science and how Indian society has given its own twist to the way of approaching the nanoscale. The term nanoscale as used in this book can be somewhat approximately defined as the range of size from one nanometre to 100 nanometres. While a carbon atom would be a tenth of a nanometre, a virus can be about 100 nanometres in size. Within these two orders of magnitude lies a world of science that is brought alive in the book. Integrating society The author has taken up work being carried out in four labs to illustrate the extent to which this science has integrated with the needs and dictates of Indian society. The first one is the development of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope at the physics lab of the University of Pune – a process that exemplifies sustained hard work as it does quirky jugaad tactics. Not stopping with a description of the development of this important scientific tool, the book also explores subsidiary concerns such as the absence of a culture of commercialising such systems and processes. Who would have thought that gold, in the nanoscale, appears red or blue but not its familiar glowing shade of yellow? The book offers interesting tidbits such as this, even while tackling involved arguments. In Chapter 3, “Ancient Ayurveda, New Nanotechnology,” the story moves on to the Centre for Nanobiosciences, at the Agharkar Research Institute, also in Pune. From the nuts and bolts approach of the physics department, the reader is transported to a study of molecules, gold bhasma and Ayurveda. Here we have people trained in modern scientific method studying and characterising medicinal products traditionally used in Ayurveda. What could follow when Charaka meets modern medicine, but a discussion of hierarchies, method, philosophy and world views. A short but interesting flavour of this is provided in the book. Technology at the nanoscale can also impact society, it is not merely a subject confined to the labs or is fuelled into business, yes the reader does suspect that, and the book proceeds to elucidate this in an engaging manner. Low-cost projects The scene of action shifts to Hyderabad where, at the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials, a low-cost, drinking water purifier system is being developed. At this centre, mainly focussed on high-tech industrial and defence, mostly high-cost, innovations, the nanosilver incorporated ceramic candles for disinfecting drinking water, is a promising low-cost project. However, the process of trying to commercialise it has been a failure. The final tale is also set in Hyderabad, where at the LV Prasad Eye Institute, nanotechnology is used to treat retinoblastoma, the most common malignant eye tumour in infants in India. This is a narrative of Indian science that brings out how it interacts with society. Often the results are new, unexpected even, but never dull.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A sure thing||This is a famous deal from long ago. South was the legendary Italian expert Giorgio Belladonna. This is a surprisingly complicated hand. A spade finesse? A heart finesse? A regular club finesse or a ruffing finesse in clubs? There are many options for declarer, but they all seem dangerous. A foul lie of the cards can lead to defeat, although all of these plays have reasonable chances. In a pair competition, you’d have to choose a line of play that gave you a chance for an overtrick or two. Merely making your contract might not be good enough. This deal was played in a team competition, however, where overtricks are not very important. Making your contract is the key. Belladonna found a line of play that was guaranteed to make his contract on any lie of the cards. Can you spot it? Belladonna won the opening diamond lead with his ace, crossed to dummy with the ace of clubs, and led a low heart away from dummy’s king! Should East play an honor, Belladonna would have 10 tricks. The worst result would be for South’s jack to lose to West’s queen. West would have to shift to a trump to prevent a heart ruff in dummy. That would give declarer 10 tricks whenever trumps split 2-1. Even if West started with three spades to the king, South would just win in dummy and lead the king of hearts. East would have no trump to lead if he won the ace and West couldn’t lead another trump without giving away his trump trick. A perfect line of play!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-sure-thing/article32764150.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Name, place, letter-writer||Respected Madam/Sir,  Two-three days back suddenly one question is coming to the brain like anything. It is coming into brain as if Chinese army and refusing to go. I tried all techniques to make idea go. I read one novel. I saw one DVD. I even put one evening of rummy with Mrs. Mathrubootham. Whether idea is going out of the head? Never. Finally, I told Mrs. Mathrubootham, Kamalam one idea is coming in the head and it is not going only. What to do? She said, old man go to the kitchen and take two-three plate and hit them like anything. If Corona can go means idea can also go. I said, Kamalam, this is a serious matter. She said first of all, is it some adults-only idea? Because then you please discuss privately and don’t put in newspaper letter and all. Last week only my cousin Katherine from Jamshedpur called and asked whether our Mathrubootham is world-famous Hindu Letter Writer Mathrubootham. Immediately I denied like anything. Whole world is reading your letter. Please don’t cut my nose with matter-type letters. I said, no no no Kamalam, thousand times no. What nonsense you are talking. Whether I am sitting whole day and thinking matter items only? She looked at me. Then she looked at my phone. Then she looked at me. I looked out of the window. Suddenly one beautiful scenery is there, and it is there until Mrs. Mathrubootham is leaving the room. Madam/ Sir, shall I tell you the idea? How many years I have been Mr. J. Mathrubootham? Whole life I am Mathrubootham only. School Mathrubootham. College Mathrubootham. Office Mathrubootham. Whole life I am Mathrubootham. Whether it is boring like anything or no? Well, for two-three months in college one comedy took place. My uncle from Palakkad, who is no more, is doing all my forms and all for college admission. And bloody fool what he has put on one form? Bathroomootham. Madam/ Sir, you just imagine life of young man in college. Everyday during attendance professor is saying where is Bathroomootham? For two-three months torture like anything. Then I put 25,000 forms and begging and crying and falling at feet and finally college is changing name to correct spelling. But my cricket team football is still saying Bathroomootham for one year. Too much humiliation. But same name for whole time is little boring? You agree no? Ok then tell me should I change name or no? What is there? No tension. Some two-three forms and newspaper ad and maybe I can have some good action name. J. Macpherson? Ok, maybe sounds like British villain in freedom struggle movie. How about J.R. Rahman? People will think I am brother and give VIP treatment? Maybe entire Indian police will harass nonstop. Maybe some underworld don type name? Kattabomman? Madam/ Sir, just imagine when people are asking sir, what is your name and I say Kattabomman. Yappa! I took one list of names to Mrs. Mathrubootham and said Kamalam, I am thinking of changing my name to something new and exciting. Any thoughts? She looked at me and said many thoughts are coming but cannot be said. Old man, name is like gas cylinder or what? You are changing every few weeks? What nonsense are you talking? Please don’t waste my time. Best name is Kattabomman. It is giving thrilling hero feel. I like it. Madam/ Sir, today itself I am going to Google to see procedure for name change. Any suggestions from your end? If you say Kasturi and all, then it is useless.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Century-old data help measure the Sun’s magnetic field||The magnetic field of the Sun is unique in that, unlike many other celestial bodies, it reverses its polarity roughly every 11 years. Regular observations of the Sun’s magnetic field begin in 1967, and, so far, we have data for the period from 1967 almost to the present, spanning the solar cycles 20-24. Now, an Indo-Russian collaboration has added to this with a plot of the solar magnetic field from 1915 to 1965 (solar cycles 15-19). Using a novel approach, they have calibrated and calculated the field using data from the archives of the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. “For about the last 50 years, that is, from around 1970s, regular measurements of magnetic field are available from different observatories. One important one is Wilcox Solar Observatory from the US. Before that Mount Wilson Solar Observatory provided some data, although they are not of high quality and uniform,” says Dipankar Banerjee, Director of Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Nainital, and an author of the paper which has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.  Data from Kodaikanal The present study makes the important contribution of building on this using the Kodaikanal Solar observatory data, and extending the magnetic field calculations for another fifty years approximately. “Understanding the magnetic field evolution in the past improves our understanding of the physics itself. In the work we have also talked about the timing of the polarity reversal, which is also very important,” adds Prof. Banerjee. Solar variations, both of long scale and short, depend on the magnetic field, and these can affect both the climate and space weather. Therefore, understanding the magnetic field variations can contribute to our understanding of climate and space weather. The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory was established in 1899 and observations of the Sun from this observatory run over a hundred years, providing what is among the longest series of solar data. An important feature of these data is the multi-wavelength observations. The data consist of full disc spectral images of the Sun using the Ca II K and H-alpha lines. Both these lines image the atmospheric layer of the Sun known as the chromosphere. Extracting information From the full-disc images of Ca II K features, bright patches above magnetic field regions, known as plages are identified. “Underneath these one can find sunspots, so plages provide information about magnetic field locations and strength,” says Bidya Binay Karak, a Ramanujan Fellow at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, and an author of the paper. On the other hand, the H-alpha images show filaments, which are formed along magnetic neutral lines. “Their presence also represents the magnetic field distribution beneath. They also allow us to study the evolution of magnetic field with time,” he explains. Reconstruction The team first calibrated the Ca IIK images of the Kodaikanal data using magnetic field measurements that were available during that period. Using this, they interpreted the data for the periods when magnetic field measurements were not available, namely, years 1915-1965. “The H-alpha images display the location of filaments, which are believed to be formed along the magnetic neutral lines, so these images provide information on the magnetic polarity,” says Dr Karak. “Combining the two sets, the full magnetic field data was reconstructed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/century-old-data-help-measure-the-suns-magnetic-field/article32763599.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Warm COVID-19 vaccine’ that needs no cold chain||Unlike drugs, virtually all vaccines need to be transported at cold temperatures (usually between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius) prior to use. If they are exposed to higher temperatures, many vaccines lose potency. Re-cooling does not help. Thus we need what is called the cold chain of handling before use. It would therefore be extremely useful if we can make and transport a vaccine at room temperature, with no cold chain needed. Warm vaccine It is towards such a “warm vaccine” that an Indian group, led by Raghavan Varadarajan of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru (IISc) and other collaborators at IISER Trivandrum, THSTI Faridabad, and the IISc-incubated startup Mynvax have worked. Their preprint, entitled, “Design of a thermo-tolerant, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 Spike fragment,” is publicly available in Biorxiv at https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.252437. Active domain The COVID virus has, on its surface, a protein called the spike which is about 1,300-amino-acids long. Within this, a sequence that is about 250 amino acids long, called the receptor binding domain (RBD), attaches itself to the “host” cell surface and starts the process of infection. The group decided to synthesise in the laboratory, not the full length spike protein, but a 200-amino-acid fragment of the RBD, and study its structure, (three-dimensional architecture, or the shape which allows it to fit snugly to the host cell surface — a “lock and key” fit), thermal stability (can it work at temperatures higher than the normal lab conditions), and so forth. Happily, the authors found that this fragment, when freeze dried (or “lyophilized”), is highly stable, can withstand transient exposure to temperatures as high as 100 degrees Celsius and can be stored for over a month at 37 degrees Celsius, suggesting a cold-chain should not be required for this molecule. Clues from structure On an aside, for the past 70 years, India has been a pioneer in the field of how the structure or architecture of a protein offers clues to its function. It still is. For example how the triple helical structure of collagen, experimentally discovered by the late G. N. Ramachandran in 1954, explains why it is found in the skin and tendons, offering them rope-like strength. Prof. Ramachandran also suggested, given a protein sequence, how we may predict the ways it may fold into a 3-dimensional architecture. This, in turn, has led biochemists to synthesise proteins with changes in their amino acid sequence that function the way they want it to. The authors have done exactly this by carefully choosing the sequence of the RBD fragment to be expressed, and demonstrating that the resulting protein is thermo-tolerant. This exemplifies the power of protein structural analysis and “genetic engineering”.  The RBD protein was produced in large amounts in mammalian cells as well as in a yeast called Pichia pastoris, which is a highly cost-effective, inexpensive, host. However, when they compared the two proteins, they found that the yeast-expressed protein was more heterogeneous and did not yield the desired antibodies when tested in animals. They also tried expressing the identical RBD fragment in the usual model bacterial system, E.coli, but the protein was non-functional. Adjuvants and trials Now that we have a thermo-tolerant RBD, can it be tried as a vaccine candidate, generating antibodies that will block the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein and prevent infection? Generally, immunologists add what is called an adjuvant which, when co-injected along with the vaccine material (cells or molecules), stimulates the immune system and enhances the ability of the vaccine to work. Aluminium salts are often used. The authors chose to use guinea pigs in their initial immunisations, since these are thought to be better models than mice for respiratory illnesses. As adjuvant, they used a generic version of the MF59 adjuvant which has an excellent safety record in humans, and they injected the RBD formulation in guinea pigs. After two doses, tests showed substantial levels of the desired receptor-blocking antibodies in the animals. So, it works. They point out that numerous other groups have used the entire full length spike protein, or new RNA-based approaches to express antigens, including the RBD. However, unlike all the COVID-19 vaccine formulations currently in clinical trials which require a cold chain, this particular thermo-tolerant RBD fragment, (and possibly other RBD formulations), can be stored at room temperature for extended periods. The researchers are now testing the ability of the formulation to protect animals from challenge with infectious virus and will simultaneously carry out safety and toxicity assessments prior to testing in human clinical trials. We wish the group all success. dbala@lvpei.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/warm-covid-19-vaccine-that-needs-no-cold-chain/article32763586.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Rapid antigen tests ideal for screening for coronavirus||With novel coronavirus cases accelerating or plateauing across the world, the focus should shift from using a test that has high sensitivity to pick even small amounts of the virus, such as the molecular test (RT-PCR), to rapid antigen tests which can detect infections, a Perspective piece published in The New England Journal of Medicine says. This message has been misconstrued on social media without understanding the context in which the researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, have advocated this shift. Right screening tool The researchers have focussed on which test to be used as a screening tool in a community or the entire population in the U.S. to quickly identify infected people, including those who are asymptomatic, and isolate such people so as to quickly cut the transmission chain. Rapid antigen tests are not only quick (can return results in 15-30 minutes compared with 24-48 hours for RT-PCR) but also are cheap and do not rely on laboratory and expensive equipment to carry out testing. But rapid antigen tests have low sensitivity and therefore produce false negative results half the time. It is for this reason that rapid antigen test should be used repeatedly in the same population as part of an overall testing strategy. Frequent testing thus makes up for poor sensitivity. Based on modelling, Daniel Larremore, an applied mathematician at the University of Colorado, Boulder and his colleagues found that testing people every three days and isolating those who test positive could prevent 88% of virus spread. Testing in India No State in India has so far been screening whole communities or populations with either rapid antigen tests or RT-PCR to diagnose those who have been infected. Instead, States follow syndromic surveillance where testing is carried out on people who exhibit fever or any of the other COVID-19 symptoms. Instead of asking States to repeat the tests in those who have a negative result with a rapid antigen test, even in its June 23 advisory, ICMR has asked States to validate all negative results from rapid antigen tests with a RT-PCR. Authors of the NEJM article, too, make a distinction between tests used on people showing symptoms and for screening a population, and bat for RT-PCR for clinical tests. “Clinical tests are designed for use with symptomatic people, do not need to be low-cost, and require high analytic sensitivity to return a definitive clinical diagnosis given a single opportunity to test,” they write. Problems with RT-PCR  Using RT-PCR to screen a community or population has several problems. RT-PCR test is expensive compared with a rapid antigen test, making repeated testing on the same individual every few days even more expensive. It takes at least one–two days to test and a couple of days to inform the individuals of the test result. The slow turnaround time would mean that infected individuals will come in contact with others and spread the virus even while waiting for the test result. Also, it may pick people who have been infected but are no longer infectious. This might be a problem when such people have to be isolated even when they no longer spread the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/rapid-antigen-tests-ideal-for-screening-for-coronavirus/article32763587.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A tale of mangrove migration||In 2008, Punarbasu Chaudhuri, mangrove ecologist from the University of Calcutta spotted an interesting mangrove plant at the bank of river Hooghly inside Kolkata city. It was quite unusual, as mangroves require a cyclic supply of saline water, and this growth at an upstream zone was remarkable. He then started an investigation on their distribution in the Hooghly estuary, and his recent paper suggests that the mangroves have started moving upstream, growing in less-saline regions. Redistributing plants After surveying the banks near Kolkata, he was able to spot a few mangroves belonging to Sonneratia. He says that over the years due to gradual environmental changes and anthropogenic activities, mangroves have started to redistribute. The paper, published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, notes that they have reclaimed even the upper course of the river, which was completely devoid of mangroves before 1995. His team spent years mapping the distribution of mangroves and associated species using ground surveys and satellite data. They also studied the sediments and water samples along the river banks. “Sewage disposal has increased the pollution load in the river waters. Globally, there is also rapid mean sea-level rise. All these might have played a role in this upstream migration,” explains Dr. Chaudhuri who is with the University of Calcutta’s Department of Environmental Science. Associates found Between Barrackpore and Birlapur, in a non-saline region, about 239 mature trees and numerous saplings of Sonneratia caseolaris (commonly known as mangrove apple) have grown naturally. They were just four to five years old with fruits and flowers, exhibiting luxuriant growth. The team also found the redistribution of several other mangrove associate trees, shrubs and climbers in that region. “This is not welcome news. They directly indicate changes in the micro-environment. The rate of sedimentation, quality of the sediment and biogeochemistry of the river has all been affected by elevated anthropogenic activities and global climate change events,” says Somdeep Ghosh, first author of the paper. Change in ecology The team emphasised the fact that the construction of Farakka Barrage in 1975 has increased fresh water flow in River Hooghly, thereby causing change in ecology and chemistry of the river. They also found high chemical oxygen demand in the river because of increased release of harmful chemicals from multiple point and non-point sources. Studies from China have shown that Sonneratia caseolaris grow well in the presence of high chemical oxygen demand of water. “This shows the potential of Sonneratia caseolaris to act as a bio-indicator of regional environmental changes. The decline in the mangrove area along with this migration may increase the amplitude of coastal hazards such as storm surges, erosion and flooding. More studies are needed to understand in detail this new horizon of mangrove adaptation and dispersion ecology. We are also planning to study more rivers in this region,” adds Dr. Chaudhuri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/a-tale-of-mangrove-migration/article32763584.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Earthquake swarms||What causes earthquake swarms in California? According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), hundreds of earthquakes ranging from 2.5 to 4.9 magnitude have been rattling California from Wednesday. These are called earthquake swarms - “a sequence of mostly small earthquakes with no identifiable mainshock. Swarms are usually short-lived, but they can continue for days, weeks, or sometimes even months.” They are many times too subtle for people to notice. They are not to be confused with aftershocks, which happen after a large mainshock. A team from Stanford University used computational modelling and studied swarms from past years. While modelling of earthquakes earlier has focussed on the role of friction in unlocking faults, the new work studies the interactions between fluid and pressure in the fault zone. Fault simulator The team developed a new physics-based fault simulator to aid the study and found that pulses of high-pressure fluids moving closer to the surface can trigger these swarms. While, fluid under pressure can push the walls of the fault away from each other making it easier for the fault to slide, a decrease in pressure creates a suction that pulls the walls together and inhibits sliding. The model was able to predict how quickly a pulse migrates along the fault, causing the fault to slip and triggering these clusters of small earthquakes. They found that each of the small earthquakes in a swarm has its own aftershock event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/earthquake-swarms/article32763589.ece
04 October 2020||Chandigarh,||Protests against farm laws continue||Punjab farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws continued on Saturday as they squatted on rail tracks for an indefinite period. The agitating farmers also raised slogans against the government and said that the stir will go on till their demand for revoking the new laws was not accepted. A total of 31 farmers’ bodies have joined hands to step up their agitation. They had announced to block rail tracks from October 1 for an indefinite period. The farmers have blocked rail tracks at many places including Dhablan (Patiala), Sunam (Sangrur), Budhlada (Mansa), Gidderbaha (Muktsar), Barnala, Bathinda, Faridkot, Gurdaspur, Rupnagar, Phillaur, Samrala and Moga. Farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been squatting at rail tracks in Amritsar and Ferozepur since September 24. According to Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal, besides blocking rail tracks at 33 places, farmers have also staged sit-ins outside 24 petrol pumps, nine toll plazas, four shopping malls, a thermal power plant and a foodgrain godown belonging to some corporate houses. Boycott call The farmers have also given a call to boycott some corporate houses and their products in the State. According to them, the Centre wants to “benefit” a few corporate houses with the “black laws”. ‘Dharnas’ were also being staged outside the houses of five BJP leaders, including former Punjab BJP chief Shwait Malik. In Ferozepur, women have also joined farmers who have been agitating at a rail track near Basti Tankan Wali. At Amritsar, protesting farmers burnt the effigies of the government. In Phagwara, police prevented the farmers from moving towards the residence of Union Minister Som Parkash. The protesters wanted to ‘gherao’ the residence. Police personnel, led by Superintendent of Police Manwinder Singh, stopped the farmers about 200 meters away from Mr. Parkash’s residence. Barricades placed Barricades were put at all the entry points to stop the farmers from going towards the Minister’s residence, said the farmers. Later, the farmers staged a sit-in on the road. Addressing the protesters, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal claimed that the agitation against the anti-farm laws has now snowballed into a mass movement. He said farmers were not averse to holding talks with the Centre if the invitation for the same comes from the Prime Minister’s Office. “We will not accept any leader from the Punjab BJP for talks, as we are boycotting them,” he said. The Punjab unit of the BJP had constituted an eight-member committee to reach out to farmers to apprise them of the benefits of the new laws. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates. President Ram Nath Kovind had given assent to the three contentious Bills — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and the Farm Services Bill and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protests-against-farm-laws-continue/article32763874.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Hathras stir: Dalit activists seek judicial probe, fast-track courts||Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch (DSMM) and other organisations gathered at Jantar Mantar on Saturday to protest against the atrocities meted out to Dalit women in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a judicial inquiry into the cases. They have also demanded more fast-track courts as well as security for the Hathras victim’s family. Sunaina K. of DSMM said: “A series of cases have been reported in the past few days. Atrocities against Dalit women is a norm in U.P. now. The manner in which the bodies were brutally assaulted and the horrific death of the victims show how they were denied basic rights. Even the manner in which the police have acted and the protection been provided by the government has remained suspicious.” “We demand a speedy judicial inquiry into all the cases. Suspension of officials is only a means to calm down the agitated masses and suppress the public outcry. We need justice to be provided to the families. Caste factor has to be reported and discussed as well. We also demand safety and security of the Hathras victim’s family,” said Ms. Sunaina. Demanding fast-track courts, Vinnita Shikhar, president of the Mahila Dakshata Samiti said, “Every day there is news about atrocities against women. Why aren’t there fast-track courts in the country and why are the accused not punished swiftly? We want capital punishment for rapists and fast-track courts should ensure that the death penalty is awarded swiftly.” Students protest Scores of students and others also joined the protest in solidarity. Kanay Mathur, a first-year student studying at a university abroad, said: “This is the first time I am participating in a protest. It is high time that we acknowledge that casteism and sexism are both a huge part of this country. We should step out and not remain silent anymore.” Kabir Beotra (17), also a first-time protester, said: “The incident, which took place in Hathras, is really disgusting. Also, the manner in which the Yogi Adityanath-led government handled the case is even more shameful. It is ironic that an actor’s death is given more importance and Dalit voices are drowned.”  The manner in which the bodies were brutally assaulted and the horrific death of the victims show how they were denied basic rights Sunaina.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||What does herd immunity mean for COVID-19?||The story so far: Right from the time it became obvious that the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak was not confined to China, but scaling other shores too, the theory of herd immunity has been floating around. Initially, herd immunity, an important tool in epidemic control, was proposed as a means to overcome the pandemic. Only a certain proportion of the population needs to be infected in order to stop large outbreaks, either through naturally-acquired disease, or through vaccination. Since a vaccine is not available for COVID-19 yet, some people advocated that the infection be allowed to spread in the community until herd immunity is achieved.  Why is this being stoutly opposed?  The SARS-CoV-2 virus is easily transmissible and would require around 60-70% of the population to be infected to acquire herd immunity. In the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ‘Science in 5’ video series, the organisation’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, explains herd immunity with the help of a common childhood infectious disease — measles — for which there is a very effective vaccine. “To achieve herd immunity in the population, for measles, you need about 95% of the people to have immunity or antibodies,” she explains. “Even if you have 5% of children [who are] not vaccinated, these others actually have enough protection in the population to prevent the measles virus from actually going from one person to the next. So, it is really like having a barrier of people who are protected, who break that chain of transmission.” For the SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Swaminathan thinks that at least 60-70% of the population should have immunity to really break the chain of transmission. “If you allow this to happen naturally, it will take a long time, of course, but more importantly, it is going to do a lot of collateral damage,” adds Dr. Swaminathan. “So, even if 1 % of people who get infected are ultimately going to die, then this can add up to a huge number of people, if we look at the global population. And that is why we believe [that] it is not a good idea to achieve herd immunity by just letting the infection run wild in the general population and infect a lot of people. We should talk about herd immunity in the context of a vaccine,” she says. Marc Lipsitch, Professor of Epidemiology and director, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Harvard School of Public Health, responding on Twitter to the news of the White House’s new pandemic adviser recommending ‘herd immunity’, said: “This is simply wrong … Herd immunity is not a strategy or a solution. It is surrender to a preventable virus.”  How and when will herd immunity be achieved in this pandemic?  Arnaud Fontanet and Simon Cauchemez, authors of a recent Nature publication, ponder over this exact point: “Herd immunity is achieved when one infected person in a population generates less than one secondary case on an average, which corresponds to the effective reproduction number R (that is, the average number of persons infected by a case) dropping below 1 in the absence of interventions.” The publication says, “With flu pandemics, herd immunity is usually attained after two to three epidemic waves, each interrupted by the typical seasonality of influenza virus, and more rarely, by interventions, with the help of cross-protection through immunity to previously encountered influenza viruses, and vaccines, when available.” Currently, there is insufficient confirmed information on re-infection to determine how that will influence the pandemic’s course.  What does the sero-prevalence study in India say?  A measure of the infection levels in the population is provided through the sero-surveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The second study was done between August 17 and September 22, 2020, and found the prevalence at 15.6% of the population in urban slums and at 8.2% in non-slum areas. The hotspots were not included this time. In Delhi, the second round estimated a sero-prevalence of 29.1%. The study revealed that for every reported COVID-19 case, there were 26-32 infections, down from 81-130 infections per reported case in May. It also said the susceptibility of a considerable section of people, who are still unexposed to SARS-CoV-2, exists, and the risk in urban slums is twice that in non-slum areas, and four times higher than the risk in rural settings. In Mumbai (study not by ICMR), the second-round estimated around 45% prevalence in slums and 18% sero-prevalence in non-slums.  Are vaccines the solution?  The Nature paper argues that vaccines are particularly suited for creating herd immunity because “their allocation can be specifically targeted to highly exposed populations, such as healthcare workers or individuals with frequent contact with customers.” They may have a significantly greater impact on reducing viral circulation than naturally-acquired immunity, especially if it turns out that naturally-acquired protective immunity requires boosts through re-infections. Dr. Swaminathan says, “With a vaccine you can achieve immunity and herd immunity safely. Through natural infection also we can achieve it at some point, but it would be at great human cost.” Meanwhile, until a vaccine is readied, it would be best to take actions that would slow down the progress of the virus — following COVID-19 etiquettes of wearing a mask, physical distancing and following hand hygiene — she adds.

04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||DAP 2020: Offset clause and Rafale-like deals||The story so far: On Monday, the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) 2020 was released. Among other things, the Defence Ministry has removed the offset clause requirement in inter-governmental agreements (IGA) and has introduced a new category for leasing of military equipment.  What purpose does an offset clause serve?  A defence offset policy was promulgated under the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP-2005), with the objective that it would bring high-end technology to the country and help build the domestic defence industry. Under the offset clause, a foreign company that wins a defence deal is supposed to invest a part of the contract value in the country, thus developing skills and bringing in technology, while also generating employment. Under the DPP 2006, the offset value was fixed at 30% of defence deals above Rs. 300 crore, which was revised to Rs. 2,000 crore in DPP 2016 for full-import deals. The first offset contract was signed in 2007. Auditing the offset deals till March 2018, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said 46 offset contracts were signed for Rs. 66,427 crore, and till December 2018, Rs. 19,223 crore worth of offsets should have been discharged. “However, the vendors have claimed discharge of only Rs. 11,396 crore, [i.e.,] 59%, of the offsets,” stated a report tabled in Parliament on September 23. Furthermore, the Ministry has accepted only Rs. 5,457 crore or 48% of these offset claims, while the rest were pending or rejected due to various deficiencies. The remaining offset commitments of about Rs. 55,000 crore would be due for completion by 2024, but the rate of the offset discharge has been about Rs. 1,300 crore per year. “Given this situation, fulfilling the commitment of Rs. 55,000 crore by the vendors in the next six years remains a major challenge,” the report said.  What did the CAG say on the Rafale deal offsets?  The IGA of the Rs. 60,000-crore deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets stated that the French side would facilitate implementation of ‘Make in India’ through offsets for 50% value of supply protocols, minus the value of performance-based logistics and simulator and training aids annual maintenance. The CAG said the French aircraft manufacturer, Dassault Aviation, and missile maker MBDA have till date “not confirmed” the transfer of technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under the offset clause. According to the report, in September 2015, French companies Dassault Aviation and MBDA initially proposed to discharge 30% of their offset obligation in the Rafale deal by offering high technology to the DRDO, and as per the contract, acquisition of technology by the DRDO is envisaged subject to discussions between the vendor and the DRDO. In April 2016, the DRDO identified six new technologies to be obtained from the firms under the offset obligations, but the vendors “did not agree on transfer of five technologies as most of them were not within the vendor’s core competence”. The sixth proposal of the DRDO was to obtain technical assistance for indigenous development of an engine, Kaveri , for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). Stating that in October 2019, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had informed them that the vendor had not yet been able to confirm their capability for doing the requisite upgradation, the CAG said, “thus, it is not clear if this technology transfer will take place, and there is need for MoD/DRDO to identify and acquire the right technologies in order to comply with the directions of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) given in September 2016.” The MoD informed the CAG that the offset obligations under the Rafale deal were to start from September 23, 2019, and the first annual commitment would have to be completed by September 23, 2020. The CAG noted that the maximum discharge of offsets — 57% by MBDA and 58% by Dassault Aviation — had been slated during the last year, which is year seven from the date of contract. Giving the Rafale deal as a reference, the report said, “In many cases, it was found that the foreign vendors made various offset commitments to qualify for the main supply contract, but later were not earnest about fulfilling these commitments.”  What is the status now?  In the new DAP 2020, which came into effect on October 1, the government has removed the requirement for offset clause in IGAs or in Rafale-like deals. “We removed some of the offset requirements as they are not working. From now on, there will be no offset clause in government-to-government, single vendor and IGAs,” said Director General (Acquisition), Apurva Chandra.  The CAG report states that in many cases, foreign vendors made offset commitments to qualify for the main supply contract, but later were not earnest about fulfilling them||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dap-2020-offset-clause-and-rafale-like-deals/article32763513.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||The revised guidelines on ‘ideal’ weight and diet||The story so far : The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), the Hyderabad-based premier research body of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has released a new set of guidelines, updating norms on recommended dietary allowances (RDA), which is the average daily intake needed for a nutritious diet. Besides several other recommendations, a salient point in the report released this week is the upward revision of the ‘ideal’ weight of Indian men and women. How are these reports prepared? In 1989, an expert committee constituted by the NIN to decide on what should be a nutritious diet, used data generated by studying body weights and heights of well-to-do Indian children and adolescents. This was not reflective of the breadth and diversity of India. The reference weights for a man and woman were fixed at 60 kg and 50 kg respectively. Another committee in 2010 considered extensive data on anthropometry collected by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, using nutrition profiles from ten States of India for computing reference body weights. They computed reference weights for different age groups. Most of the data collected were from rural India, but the reference points for a single ‘ideal’ weight remained unchanged. For the latest report, NIN looked at nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4, 2015-16), the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (2015-16), the World Health Organization (2006-07) and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP, 2016) to “derive acceptable reference body weight values through the lifespan.” The definition for a reference Indian adult man and woman were modified with regard to age (19-39 years) instead of (20-39 years) and a body weight of 65 kg and 55 kg respectively were fixed for a normal Body Mass Index (BMI). Though termed ‘ideal’, it is more appropriately a measure of the average weight of Indians.  How do Indians compare internationally?  The reference weights are a proxy for the nutritional status of the people of a country. International comparisons find that the average Indian is lighter than his or her counterparts globally. The average Dutch male is 87.4 kg and a woman 72.3 kg, and the average weight in the United Kingdom is 86.8 kg for men and 72.9 kg for women, according to data aggregator ‘WorldData.info’. Indians are closer to typical weights prevalent in Asia. The average Sri Lankan male is 61.3 kg and woman 56.2 kg, and the average Japanese man is 69 kg and woman 54.7 kg. The data, however, is based on 2010 estimates, and the latest NIN revision will push India up a few notches.  What are the dietary recommendations?  The guidelines specify the amount of carbohydrates, minerals, dietary fibre, fats and oils, protein, and even water, that a person must ideally consume. The water intake for an adult man ranges from 32-58 ml per kg body mass, and for a woman, it ranges from 27-52 ml per kg body mass. For children, the requirement is over 60 ml per kg body mass, and for adolescent boys it ranges from 47-60 ml per kg body mass, while for girls, it is 39-49 ml per kg body mass. For a pregnant woman, based on the working intensity, the water required from beverages ranges from 2.1 litres to 3.2 litres per day. A minimum 400 gram/day of fruits and vegetables are necessary to obtain sufficient antioxidant nutrients, such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and certain non-nutrients like polyphenols and flavonoids that reportedly protect against chronic diseases. This should be complemented with a sufficient amount of vegetable oil to obtain Vitamin E. The fat intakes for sedentary, moderate and heavy activities have been set at 25 gram/day, 30 g/d and 40 g/d respectively for an adult man, and 20 g/d, 25 g/d and 30 g/d for adult women.  The National Institute of Nutrition looked at nationally representative data from several sources to specify the amount of carbohydrates, minerals, dietary fibre, fats, and water a person must ideally consume||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-revised-guidelines-on-ideal-weight-and-diet/article32763517.ece
04 October 2020||New Delhi,||Positivity rate now less than 5.5%, claims Health Minister||As many as 2,258 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the Capital in the past 24 hours taking the total number of cases to 2,87,930, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Saturday. Also, 34 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 5,472. Of the total cases, 2,57,224 people have recovered and there are 25,234 active cases. Beds available Of the total 15,840 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 62.1% were vacant, as per government data on Saturday. But 58.21% of the ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied and 67.06% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full. The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) was 5.7%, which is lower than September. The overall positivity rate till now is 8.9%. The number of containment zones in the city on Saturday jumped to 2,658. The number of people admitted to hospitals, active cases and persons under home quarantine have decreased for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Only 39,306 tests were done in the past 24 hours. “There was a time when Delhi was second number [in the country in terms of the number of cases] but now it is in the sixth number,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said. “We had increased the testing on a large scale and had said the cases will decrease in two to three weeks and now it has started to come down. At a time, the positivity rate was around 9-10% now it is less than 5.5%,” the Minister said, adding that more beds are available now. On the Hathras case, Mr. Jain said it feels that people are not afraid of the system and strict punishment should be given.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/positivity-rate-now-less-than-55-claims-health-minister/article32763860.ece
04 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘No home quarantine for most passengers arriving in Delhi’||Several persons — who have travelled to Delhi from other States — and officials from at least three of the Capital’s 11 districts have told The Hindu that domestic travellers are not being put under 7-day home quarantine as directed in June 3 order. Travellers, who arrived in the city by road or by air, said they did not get any follow-up phone calls from the government. There are other States where home quarantine for domestic travellers are still being implemented strictly. “I came back to Delhi in August and no one took down my details at the airport. After that, the government did not contact me for quarantine,” said Sanakan Venugopal, who travelled from Kerala. Another 25-year-old man said he too did not get any calls from government after travelling by air to the city. “After the landing, they did not even check my status on the Aarogya Setu app. Last week, one of my colleagues of travelled to his hometown by air from Delhi on Friday. After three, he came back to the city to join work. There was no quarantine,” he added. An order by Chief Secretary of Delhi, Vijay Dev, on June 3 read: “All asymptomatic passengers who enter/de-board in NCT of Delhi shall home quarantine themselves for 07 days. The District Magistrates shall ensure that the passengers residing in their jurisdiction remain in home quarantine for 07 days [sic].” ‘Order not implemented’ A District Magistrate said: “Though the June 3 order is the last order we received on quarantine for domestic travellers, it’s not being implemented at this point. We do not get any list of travellers from the airport or the railway station.” Officials from two other districts also gave similar responses. According to the order, lists of travellers were supposed to be sent to each of the 11 districts by different departments so that the travellers could be quarantined and checked later. The situation is not the same in other States. For instance, if a person has to travel to Kerala from any another State, she has to register in a government website before going and undergo mandatory home quarantine period and is contacted via phone by officials. For a short visit, which has to be less than a week, also the person has to register on the website but there will be no quarantine in this case. But there is no such system in Delhi. A 27-year-old woman, Anukriti, said: “I came to Delhi from Uttarakhand on August 10 by car with a friend. Our names were not noted down and I did not undergo home quarantine.” Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department of Safdarjung Hospital, said home quarantine and monitoring help prevent the virus from entering a State or city in the early stage of the infection. “Right now, it will help to an extent, but it is not feasible to implement it in a city like Delhi where lakhs of people travel to the city every day,” Dr. Kishore said. The government spokesperson refused to offer a comment on why the order is not being implemented and whether they plan to revoke the order. Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.

04 October 2020||KASAULI,||Kasauli awaits tourists with fingers crossed||It’s half past noon on October 2, and a family of four has just walked into a small cafe on Mall Road in the heart of the tiny hill town of Kasauli. Navneet Sahu, who runs the little eatery, is elated to see customers again, even as he is concerned that his joy would be short-lived and limited to the ‘extended weekend’ that has brought a sizeable rush of tourists to the Queen of the Hills. “Tourists have started to visit after travel restrictions were eased recently. But it’s nothing compared to the numbers before the COVID-19 outbreak. Since March end, the business has come to a standstill,” said Mr. Sahu, who busy preparing the food order for his customers, with just one helper. The hospitality industry in Himachal Pradesh has been severely affected due to the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. The State government allowed unrestricted entry into the State from mid-September, which has come as a big relief.  Focus on breaking even The hoteliers, however, said that right now they are focusing on merely breaking even. Other sections of the industry, including taxi drivers, tourist guides, dhabas and small restaurants are pinning their hopes on a revival of the hotels. “It will take sometime to get things back to normal. So far there have only been ‘walk-in’ tourists. At this time of the year we usually had good number of tourists from West Bengal during the Dushera-Durga Puja holidays. But this year, there have been no advance bookings,” said U. Sharma of Ros Common, a Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel. Sharing his concerns, Deepak Sharma, who runs a dhaba on the Kasauli-Dharmpur road, said the though the weekend business had resumed, the overall sales were well below the pre-COVID period. Lack of workers has also impacted the industry, with many having returned to their homes during the extended lockdown. Vice-president of the Kasauli Hotels and Resident Welfare Association Rocky Chimni said the State government has allowed hotels to open from mid-September, and since then most of the hotels have reopened in the town and surrounding area. “Tourists have started visiting over weekends and weekdays as well and more are coming from Delhi and Punjab. The corporate business has taken a hit as conferences etc., are not taking place. We are hoping that we will be close to break-even point as the number of tourists increase. In comparison to the same period last year the hotels in Kasauli are having 40% less occupancy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kasauli-awaits-tourists-with-fingers-crossed/article32763869.ece
04 October 2020||Guwahati,||Assam Gurkhas seek gazette notification for safeguards||The Gurkha community in Assam has sought gazette notification on the issue of including it for constitutional safeguards according to Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord. Clause 6 of the Accord that ended the anti-foreigners Assam Agitation from 1979-1985 envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards for protecting, preserving and promoting the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people. A 14-member panel headed by retired judge Biplab Kumar Sharma had defined “Assamese people” as those who have been citizens of India residing in the territory of Assam on or before January 1, 1951. “The Clause 6 committee report did not mention anything about the constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards of local Gorkhas who fought for Assam against the Burmese invaders in 1826 resulting in the Treaty of Yandaboo,” said the Bharatiya Gorkha Yuva Parisangh (BGYP) in a statement. The Gurkhas were permanently settled in the scheduled areas in the last part of the 18th century as grazers and cultivators and were accordingly given permits. They were declared as protected class by the British in the tribal belts and blocks according to the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act, 1886, the organisation said. Minister’s assurance A delegation of the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh, the parent body of the BGYP, a few days ago met State Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who agreed that the Gurkhas in Assam are “one of the ancient communities”. He said the government would treat them “on a par with other indigenous communities and protect their constitutional rights while implementing Clause 6”. BGYP president Nanda Kirati Dewan welcomed Mr. Sarma’s statement and requested the government to issue a gazette notification for the including the community within the ambit of Clause 6. “The gazette notification is a request on behalf of 25 lakh Gurkhas in Assam, who were given a commitment before the 2016 Assembly elections,” he said. In January 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs formed the Clause 6 panel headed by retired bureaucrat M.P. Bezbaruah but six of the nine members named quit. The panel was reconstituted almost six months later, on July 16. On February 25, the committee submitted the report to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for handing it over to Union Home Minister Amit Shah. But some members of the committee on August 11 made their “confidential” report public because of the government’s “disinterest” in processing their recommendations. Among the suggestions made by the panel were sealing of the India-Bangladesh border and reservation of 80-100% of the seats in Parliament from Assam for the Assamese people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-gurkhas-seek-gazette-notification-for-safeguards/article32763871.ece
04 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||28-year-old man arrested for killing partner||A 28-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his partner with whom he was in an extramarital relationship, the police said on Saturday. DCP (Dwarka) S.K. Meena said Satish Kumar from Qutub Vihar killed 26-year-old Dishu Kumari and hid her body in a bed box. The police said they received information on September 2 at 9.51 a.m. regarding a foul smell and liquid coming out of a locked room in Chhawla. A team reached the spot and broke open the door and found the body. The police then checked the CCTV footage and found that the victim and a man had entered the room on September 23. However, after a few hours, the man can be seen coming out of the room. During investigation, the police received a tip-off following which Kumar was held. During interrogation, he said he got married in 2017, had a two-year-old daughter, but left his family. He said he was in a relationship with the victim since 2017. However, he came to know that Dishu had relations with other persons and they often fought on this issue. On September 23, during a similar fight, he smothered her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/28-year-old-man-arrested-for-killing-partner/article32763862.ece
04 October 2020||Jaipur,||Pilot seeks national status for canal project||Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project be declared a national project as it will address the drinking water and irrigation needs of 13 districts in the State. ‘Lifeline of districts’ The former Deputy Chief Minister in a letter to Mr. Modi said the project will become the lifeline of the districts in East Rajasthan where agriculture and animal husbandry is the prime source of livelihood but groundwater in the area is depleting. He said the NITI Aayog has also included Dholpur and Karauli districts in “aspirational district” category because they are half developed. Highlighting the importance of water in the development of a region, the Tonk MLA said Rajasthan’s geographical area is 10% of the country’s area but only 1.16% of surface water and 1.72% of groundwater of the country is available in the State. “Since 245 of total 295 blocks are under the dark or critical zone, the State government had forwarded a proposal of the eastern canal project, which aims to develop irrigation area of nearly 3 lakh hectare, to the Centre for technical approval and financing,” Mr. Pilot wrote. He said the project will accelerate the overall development not only in eastern parts but in the entire State and requested the PM to give technical sanction and financial assistance for the project worth Rs. 37,247 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pilot-seeks-national-status-for-canal-project/article32763854.ece
04 October 2020||JAIPUR,||Experts advise Jaipur authorities to focus on water, sanitation and hygiene||Researchers and public health practitioners have laid emphasis on “socially inclusive” services for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for the urban poor in order to strengthen the connect between local communities and government authorities for removing barriers in accessing resources and facilities. The recommendation was made at an event held here recently for releasing the findings of a baseline survey of 11 settlements, comprising 1,118 households, in four zones of Jaipur. The survey was aimed at finding out the status of WASH services and existing practices that determined community behaviour. While 62% of the households reported that they had piped water, 84.7% had a toilet within their premises. About 11.5% of the households received subsidy under the Swachh Bharat Mission for construction of toilets and only 10.64% reported door-to-door waste collection. Rakhee Badhwar of the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) said the human cost of weak WASH services would be unbearable during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/experts-advise-jaipur-authorities-to-focus-on-water-sanitation-and-hygiene/article32763848.ece
04 October 2020||October 04 2020 00:00 IST,||WhatsApp & leaks||The story so far: In recent weeks, television news channels have shared leaked WhatsApp chats of film actors in their coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s passing away. This has led to questions about whether communication over platforms such as WhatsApp is secure or not. It prompted Facebook-owned WhatsApp to come out with a statement on its use of end-to-end encryption to secure user messages.  Does WhatsApp have access to chats?  No. Since 2016, WhatsApp has installed an end-to-end encryption system, which, as its FAQ section says, “ensures only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp”. Governments across the world see end-to-end encryption as a huge issue when it comes to law enforcement. While WhatsApp says it responds to requests from law enforcement agencies “based on applicable law and policy,” it is not clear what kind of data it would have to share. News reports have mentioned that these could be in the nature of metadata such as mobile number, IP address, location, and so on.  How is WhatsApp designed to ensure such secure communication?  WhatsApp uses the encryption protocol developed by Open Whisper Systems, a project known best for its Signal app, which also uses the same open-source framework to ensure privacy. Whistle-blower Edward Snowden’s quote — “I use Signal every day” — is prominently displayed on the application’s homepage. Many closed messaging applications now use the Signal protocol.   What is the technology behind this?  The technology that forms the basis for this is called the ‘Diffie-Hellman key exchange’. In a 1976 paper titled, ‘New Directions in Cryptography,’ Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman saw the futility of the old ways of sharing a key securely (say, by “sending the key in advance over some secure channel such as private courier or registered mail”) in the emerging digital world. They proposed a way for secure communication via a method of a shared secret key, and that too when the communication is over a not-so-secure channel. This is all about high math, but one way to understand the broad concept, used by many experts, is by way of colours. In the world of imagination, a shared secret colour is the shared secret key between two communicators, who we will call A and B. (There are many versions of this example on the Internet.) A and B need to communicate without anyone eavesdropping. They first agree on a public colour (say, yellow). The two communicators then choose their own private colour, which is not to be shared with anyone. Say A chooses red and B, blue. They then individually mix their private colour with the public colour and send the mixture to each other. Note that the eavesdroppers can figure out the public colour and the mixtures. But there is one more step. B’s mixture (some sort of green) at A’s end is added with A’s private colour (red), and A’s mixture (some sort of orange) at B’s end is added with B’s private colour (blue). They both arrive at the same secret colour after the final step. There is now a shared secret colour key. The message that also needs to be understood is that while it is easy to add colours, it is difficult to figure out the original colours that contributed to a mixture. In the math world, that is called a one-way function. Imagine the difficulty in figuring out a key from complex mathematical computations. The Diffie-Hellman paper said: “A third party eavesdropping on this exchange must find it computationally infeasible to compute the key from the information overheard.”   Can’t those who have access to the server read messages?  End-to-end encryption removes this vulnerability. WhatsApp also says it does not store messages on its servers once they are delivered. An earlier generation of encryption did not secure the entire channel, but secured the communication between a user and the server (of a messaging service). Once the server received a message intended for another user, it would decrypt and again encrypt it before sending it securely to the receiver. But this meant that there was a chance of security being compromised at the level of the server.   Can leaks still happen?  End-to-end encryption cannot prevent leaks from happening if a third party has access to a device which contains these messages. Encryption also does not help in cases wherein the sender or the receiver of a message shares it with others, a member of a group shares it with others, or messages are stored in a different format on a different application or platform open to others.   Are there other vulnerabilities?  Bugs that lead others to control a user’s phone are an example of such vulnerabilities. For instance, last year, WhatsApp revealed that surveillance technology developed by Israel’s NSO Group had been used to spy on about 1,400 people across the world, including civil rights activists and journalists in India.  Encryption also does not help if the sender or the receiver of a message shares it with others or if messages are stored in a different format on a different application or platform open to others||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/whatsapp-leaks/article32763515.ece

According to the latest survey of the Indian Council of Medical Research, 413 blood samples were collected in 10 different clusters of Pulwama. “Out of 413, 113 reported to be positive for IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 infection, which makes it to 27.3% prevalence, with Sona Samilo village cluster showing highest 52.5% positive prevalence,” the survey suggested. The first round of ICMR’s national sero survey for SARS COV-2 infection (COVID-19) in Pulwama district carried out between May and June showed only 2% seroprevalence among the population. “From just 2% to over 27% in two months means the disease has been spreading considerably. We are expecting a similar pattern in other districts too,” said Dr. Salim Khan, nodal officer for COVID-19, and Head of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM), Government Medical College, Srinagar. 4,035 cases According to the official figures, Pulwama has reported 4,035 COVID-19 positive cases, including 39 cases reported on Saturday.

More than 20,000 migratory birds had died due to avian botulism in the lake last year. The Rajasthan High Court, which took suo motu cognisance of the mass death, has also constituted a seven-member expert committee to study the impact of salt forming and identify any illegal salt mining in the lake. The State government informed the High Court earlier this week that it had sanctioned Rs. 1.80 crore for creating temporary nurseries near the lake. A Division Bench said if more funds for creating an infrastructure for safety and security of birds were required, the State could seek the Centre’s support. The Bench, headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mohanty, asked the expert committee to carry out investigation and scientific study and make its recommendations in a sealed cover to the court within four weeks. The State government’s Forest Department will bear all the expenses for the committee and also pay an honorarium to the experts nominated to the panel. The members include Wetlands International South Asia vice-president Ajit Pattnaik, Bombay Natural History Society’s assistant director P.
