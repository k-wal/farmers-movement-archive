03 October 2020||Ghaziabad / New Delhi,||Trinamool MPs stopped outside Hathras village||Political pressure on the Uttar Pradesh government continued on Friday over its handling of the Hathras gangrape and the rushed late night cremation of the victim. In a late evening development, the State government suspended Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir and four other officials for negligence over the incident. The action was taken on the basis of the first report submitted by the Special Investigation Team, said Awanish Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary (Home). With the Hathras administration continuing to bar the entry of outsiders, the situation at the victim’s village of Bulgaddhi remained tense. A delegation of Trinamool Congress MPs, which tried to reach the village to meet the victim’s family, was manhandled and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien pushed to the ground by the police about 1.5 km from the village. Later in the day, more leaders from Congress, Aam Admi Party and Peace Party of India were turned back by the district administration. The Trinamool leaders, including Lok Sabha MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Pratima Mondal and former MP Mamata Thakur, apart from Mr. O’Brien, said they had travelled individually to the village to ensure that Section 144 imposed in the area is not violated. The police refused to let even the women MPs go and meet the victim’s family, despite repeated requests. When Ms. Mondal tried to walk towards the victim’s house, she was blocked by SDM Prem Prakash Meena. This led to a tussle between Mr. Meena and Mr. O’ Brien, in which the MP was pushed down. The delegation later staged a dharna around a kilometre away from the victim's home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/trinamool-mps-stopped-outside-hathras-village/article32756371.ece
03 October 2020||Kolkata,||Cruise down Hooghly river offers a peek into Kolkata’s history||It is along the bends of the Hooghly river that the city of Kolkata grew from three villages to a bustling metropolis. Now, a cruise on the Hooghly will take people past the different ghats of the river, providing a peek into the history of the city. On Thursday, the West Bengal Transport Department (WBTD) commenced a 90-minute Heritage River Cruise that starts from the Millennium Park Jetty. Sailing upstream and downstream, the vessel will pass beneath the majestic Howrah Bridge, and go past ghats such as the Armenian ghat, Nimtala ghat and Mayer ghat. Each ghat on the bank of the river has a bit of history attached to it. For instance, the Armenian ghat was built back in 1734 by Manvel Hazaar Maliyan, a trader of Armenian origin. The ferry ghat stands testimony to Kolkata’s cosmopolitan culture in the colonial times, and the Armenian community’s contribution to the city. Historical landmarks There is also the Mayer ghat (the mother’s ghat), which draws its name from Maa Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa. She would visit the ghat daily, and stayed near it from May 1909 to July 1920. Similarly, the Nimtala ghat is a historical landmark where the cremation of Rabindranath Tagore and other important cultural icons was performed. The famous Bhootnath temple is also located here. The cruise’s itinerary also includes Chandpal ghat, located just on the northern side of Babughat, the very place where Lord Cornwallis, the first Governor General of India, landed on September 12, 1786. Guides on board the cruise will tell people about the ghats, and visitors will also be provided with complimentary cruise heritage navigation brochures. Officials of the Transport Department said that tickets have been kept affordable at Rs. 39 for the entire cruise to attract more people. “The idea is to make the heritage river cruise experience affordable, and popular among the youth,” said Rajanvir Singh Kapur, the managing director of WBTD. As COVID-19 norms such as physical distancing will be followed, as of now, not more than 150 people will be allowed on each trip. Attempts have been made in the past to boost waterfront tourism in the city by State governments and different agencies. About 17 km of the Hooghly river’s waterfront lies within the metropolitan corporation’s boundaries, of which about a 10 km length of riverfront, from Taktaghat in south Kashipur and Pramanik ghat in the north, represent the most active and vibrant portion of Kolkata’s diverse engagements with the river. Slice of history There are dozens of ghats on both banks of the river that not only provide a rich slice of history but are associated with the way of life of the city’s people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cruise-down-hooghly-river-offers-a-peek-into-kolkatas-history/article32756476.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,||NGT asks panel to inspect Grizzled Squirrel Sanctuary||No one is entitled to encroach upon forest land for non-foresting activities without getting necessary permission from the Forest Department, especially in a declared Wild Life Sanctuary, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) said. The Southern Bench of the NGT took suo moto cognisance of a report in The Hindu that a road was being laid within the eco-sensitive zone of the Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary in Srivilliputtur, without permission from the Forest Department. Road construction “Even if the alleged road is being constructed within the eco-sensitive zone or within the regulated zones, such activities will have to be controlled and regulated by the Forest Department for which permission will have to be obtained from them including the National Board of Wild Life,” the bench said. To ascertain the genuineness of the allegations made by the activists in the report, and the impact of the alleged road construction within the sanctuary, the NGT appointed a joint committee comprising a senior officer from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, a senior officer not below the rank of Chief Conservator of Forests, the Wild Life Warden of the Sanctuary, and District Collector, Virudhunagar, to inspect the area and submit a factual as well as action-taken report, if any violation is found. The Committee has been directed to submit its report to the Tribunal on or before November 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ngt-asks-panel-to-inspect-grizzled-squirrel-sanctuary/article32756461.ece

03 October 2020||Mangaluru,||Wait for registration gets longer at taluk sub-registrar’s office||Senior citizen Vaman Nayak was waiting along with five other elderly family members since 8.30 a.m. on Thursday at the Mangaluru taluk sub-registrar’s office to execute a sale deed. His turn did not come even at 12.30 p.m., as the staff were attending to Wednesday’s appointments that were affected by server problems. Mr. Nayak was among many waiting to get documents registered at the SRO, where nearly 2,000 appointments are pending. While the government is encouraging senior citizens to stay indoors during COVID-19 pandemic, it is surprising they were made to wait in a crowded place, quipped Rajesh Kumar, a citizen. “The government’s apathy in addressing the issues affecting registration is deplorable,” said Surekha Rao, an advocate. Despite the department generating huge revenue, little was done to speed up the process. Advocate Manjunath said the delay had affected hundreds of people who were in dire need of finances. While many were going for mortgage loans to fight COVID-19, delayed mortgage registration had led banks to cancel sanctioned loans. Taluk Sub-Registrar Basheer Ahmed told The Hindu that the office was crippled by severe crunch of infrastructure and manpower. “We feel helpless when people return without completing their work.” Starting from shortage of computer operators to old computer systems, from flawed BSNL internet connectivity to repeated server problems, officials at the SRO were fighting many odds, Mr. Ahmed said. While there were only three government staff — the SRO, a second division assistant and a Group D staff — the computer operators work was on outsourcing basis. Though the demand was more, the office could register about 50 documents a day under COVID-19 conditions where online appointments were given. “We have given appointments till October 21 and stopped thereafter.” Whenever registration was affected for one or the other reasons, the backlog piles up affecting fresh appointments, he rued. District Registrar Raveendra L. Pujar said the system of one-time password (OTP) to prevent impersonation had led to some delay in registration. Attempts were being made to clear the backlog, he said, adding there was one month waiting for registration at the Taluk SRO that handles bulk of registrations among nine SROs in Dakshina Kannada.  No social distancing With people eager to get their documents registered huddling together inside a small hall, social distancing as a precaution to prevent COVID-19 has been given a go-by at Mangaluru Taluk Sub Registrar’s office. Located on the first floor of Mini Vidhana Soudha at Hampanakatte, the SRO is visited by people of Mangaluru taluk outside the city limit and excluding Mulki and Moodbidri SRO jurisdiction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/wait-for-registration-gets-longer-at-taluk-sub-registrars-office/article32757065.ece

Somashekar, on Friday said face masks and social distancing would be strictly enforced during the Dasara festivities here. He added that fines would be imposed if people violated safety guidelines. Permission sought Speaking to reporters here, the Minister said the celebrations had been scaled down owing to COVID-19 and the public must follow safety guidelines during participation in Dasara events. The Minister said permission had been sought for accommodating 2,000 people for the inaugural of the festivities atop Chamundi Hills and 1,000 people at the inauguration of Dasara cultural events at the palace. Arrangements would be made after the government takes a call. Details about the cultural events at the palace would be made known in two days. Local artistes had recently requested the Minister to accommodate them at the events, as they were in a state of distress owing to the lockdown and the lack of events after the COVID-19 outbreak. Later, after welcoming the Dasara elephants into the palace, the Minister, accompanied by S.A. Ramdas and L. Nagendra, MLAs, met Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family and sought her support for the festivities. MUDA chairman H.V. Rajeev and Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/safety-steps-will-be-strictly-enforced-during-dasara/article32756626.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Despite COVID-19, startups in T.N. manage to attract funding||Startups in Tamil Nadu raised $439 million in the first nine months of 2020 across 22 deals. During the same period last year, State-based startups attracted Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investments to the tune of $1,331 million across 39 deals, according to data provided by Venture Intelligence, a research service focused on private company financials, transactions and their valuations. Despite uncertainty in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this quarter (Q3) witnessed six deals amounting to $108 million. “While the PE-VC investment figures are down on a year-on-year basis, recent weeks have shown that both foreign PE-VC investors (notably, U.S.-headquartered investors like Falcon Edge Capital – which led the $4.5-million investment in Hippo Video) as well as well-established India-dedicated funds are keen to make new investment bets. This general ‘loosening of purse strings’ is likely to improve funding access for Chennai/Tamil Nadu-based companies as well,” said Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence. For the first nine months of this year, Tamil Nadu managed to get 17 angel investments. In 2019, the State had 11 angel investments for the same period. During this third quarter, the State saw seven angel investments while there were only 3 that came in during the same time last year. Mr. Natarajan explained that right now, owing to the impact of the pandemic, digitally native companies in edtech, fintech, entertainment and e-commerce sectors are attracting a lion’s share of PE-VC investments. “Tamil Nadu-based companies in the financial services and fintech space are likely to attract more attention in the current environment. As investor confidence improves, startups in this region which are especially strong in the enterprise software and deep tech segment are likely to witness more investments flowing their way,” he added. According to Mr. Natarajan, the vibrancy of the capital markets (including the very successful IPOs of Chennai-based CAMS and Bangalore-based IT Services firm Happiest Minds), should also encourage more mature companies from the region to look at the IPO route to raise capital. The analysis done by the Venture Intelligence team shows that at the national level PE-VC firms invested $26.3 billion across 547 deals in the first nine months of 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/despite-covid-19-startups-draw-funding/article32756418.ece

03 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Jagan launches distribution of RoFR title deeds to tribals from Agency areas||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy launched a month-long distribution of Recognition of Forest Rights (RoFR) title deeds and passbooks to inhabitants of the Agency areas, from his camp office on Friday. He gave away RoFR passbooks to some beneficiaries present on the occasion. The Chief Minister also virtually launched the civil works of the government medical college being set up at Paderu and multi-speciality hospitals at Sitampeta (Srikakulam), Parvatipuram (Vizianagaram), Rampachodavaram (East Godavari), Buttayagudem (West Godavari), and Dornala (Prakasam district). According to an official release, RoFR documents, covering 3.12 lakh acres of the forest land, will be given away to 1.53 lakh tribal families in a month. The beneficiaries are traditional forest dwellers who have a legitimate right to use the land for a living. A comprehensive survey preceded the distribution of the RoFR documents. In his address, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government was committed to the welfare of tribal communities, who constitute about 6% of the population. He recalled that his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy did his best for the well-being of the tribal folks whose lives were inextricably linked to the forests. Along with the RoFR title deeds, financial assistance would be given to the tribal people for growing various crops. Advisory council Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government formed a tribal advisory council that would take care of the marginalised communities and took a path-breaking step of reserving 50% of the nominated posts and works awarded on nomination basis to SCs, STs, BCs and minorities. Besides, separate commissions were set up for the SCs and STs. Ministers Botcha Satyanarayana, Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, P. Pushpa Sreevani, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and Audimulapu Suresh and Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-launches-distribution-of-rofr-title-deeds-to-tribals-from-agency-areas/article32756382.ece
03 October 2020||Kolkata,||‘11% doctors who die of COVID-19 from WB’||As many as 51 of the 454 doctors in the country who have died so far of COVID-19 are from West Bengal, a statistic that’s worrying the medical fraternity in the State. Even though the daily count of COVID-19 cases reported in the State remains at over 3,000, it is better off than many other States that periodically continue to witness an explosion in the number of cases, and that it should still account for 11% of doctors’ death is emerging as a matter of concern. “We are one of the most populous States, and doctors have a high fatality rate because they are exposed to a high viral load. But since the rate is substantially high [in West Bengal], we all need to earnestly search for the causes,” Dr. Arjun Dasgupta, a founding member of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, told The Hindu . Another reputed doctor who did not wish to be named said that negligence could be a cause for the high number of deaths even though it was highly unlikely that doctors, of all people, would be negligent. “It is also possible that we are reporting each and every case [of a doctor’s death due to COVID-19], which some other States may not be doing. But whatever the reason, the rate at which doctors are dying is indeed worrisome and needs to be examined,” the doctor said. The figures are not official but can be considered authentic because they are maintained by various doctors’ associations in the country. In West Bengal, the latest casualty is Dr. Arghya Sen, a well-known practitioner at Maslandapur in North 24 Parganas district, who died in Kolkata on Thursday. He was only 53. Two among the dead were even younger: Dr. Nitish Kumar, a senior resident at R.N. Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Science, was 36; and Dr. Surendra Nath Bera, a gynaecologist, was 34. ‘Most vulnerable’ “Doctors are most vulnerable due to the high viral load. They should be vigilant and alert during practice hours. Even after eight months [since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out], masks and distancing are the surest ways of preventing COVID-19,” said Dr. Rahul Jain, an internal medicine specialist at Bellevue Clinic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/11-doctors-who-die-of-covid-19-from-wb/article32756572.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Coronavirus spread slow in State: study||The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) which has carried out the second round of sero-epidemiological survey to monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population in three districts of Telangana has come to the conclusion that the spread of virus is occurring at a ‘slow pace’. This could be because of “appropriate measures taken, however, a large number of people are ‘still susceptible to the COVID-19 infection’, hence, the appropriate protection measures like ‘wearing of mask, personal hygiene and social distancing’ should be continued,” it said. The second round of SARS Cov-2 sero-prevalence study had revealed that there were 83 positive (SARS Cov 2 IgG antibodies), out of 454 people tested in Jangaon (18.2%) as against 0.5% in the first round carried out during May 2020. In Nalgonda, 47 were positive (11.1%) out of 422 people tested, as against only 0.25% in the first round. Similarly in Kamareddy district 30 (6.9%) were positive out of 433 people tested as against 0.25% in the first round indicating the slow pace. The study is part of the nation-wide survey being spearheaded by ICMR and the baseline survey was conducted in the above mentioned districts of Telangana and the second one too was carried out during 26-27 August in the same districts and same villages. As per the ICMR guidelines, 10 villages/wards were selected in each district and from each selected village ward, about 16 households were selected randomly for the study. The study was carried out by NIN in association with the Telangana Department of Health and Family Welfare. The State health authorities were also actively supported to ensure smooth conducting of house-to-house survey in 30 villages across three districts with about 1,309 subjects covered. ICMR-NIN’s scientist and nodal officer Avula Laxmaiah conducted the survey with support of other senior scientists B. Dinesh Kumar, N.Arlappa, J.J. Babu, and other 50 scientific/technical staff, participated in the survey. From the Government side — Health Secretary Syed Ali MurtazRaizvi, Finance Secretary Ronald Rose and TB programme Joint Director Rajesham and others played a key role.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/coronavirus-spread-slow-in-ts/article32756526.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Eight held for helping tainted police officer||Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials on Friday arrested eight civilians accused of aiding and abetting former ACP of Malkajgiri, in Rachakonda Commissionerate, Y. Narasimha Reddy, in fraudulent sale and purchase of 1960 square yards of government land in Madhapur. ACB Deputy Director M. Ramana Kumar said the 1,960 square yards of land had a current market value of Rs. 50 crore. Four of the accused, Gopagoni Sajjan Goud, Poreddy Thirupathi Reddy, Yerra Chandrashekhar and Arjula Jaipal created gift deeds on their names using fictitious house numbers and wrong PTIN numbers. Their respective fathers had no ownership title of the land (four plots each of 490 square yards). Yet they created documents claiming their fathers gifted them the plots and got those gift deeds registered in 2016. Investigation by ACB sleuths revealed that they did not mention survey numbers of the land, which was in prohibitory list under Section 22-A(1) (a) of the Registration Act-1908 as it belonged to government. The four plots were actually allotted by the government to Andhra Pradesh Industrial and Infrastructure Corporation, Hyderabad Urban Development Authority and other government organisations. Two years later, Y. Narasimha Reddy purchased these four plots on the name of his wife Y. Manga for a price of Rs. 80 lakh. Though the government value of those four plots was Rs. 6 crore, it was shown as Rs. 4 crore in the registration documents. The accused The other four accused Madhukar Sri Ram, Bandi Chadra Reddy, Bathini Ramesh Alluguvelly Srinivasa Reddy helped Y. Narasimha Reddy, who is facing disproportionate assets case and lodged in Chanchalguda prison, acquire the 1,960 square yards of land, Mr. Ramana Kumar said. They were presented before the First Additional Special Judge for ACB Cases.  Though the government value of the four plots was Rs. 6 crore, it was shown as Rs. 4 crore in the registration documents.

A limited number of trains will be operated by the Chennai division on all routes, including Chennai Central-Avadi/Thiruvallur/Arakkonam, Chennai Beach-Chengalpattu/Tambaram and Chennai Beach-Velachery. In a release on Friday, Southern Railway said only staff members of essential services, authorised by the government, would be allowed to travel in these trains.

The commuters will be issued daily tickets/season tickets only on production of the letters in original, along with the photo identity cards issued by the government departments. To prevent unauthorised persons from entering these trains, the Southern Railway has put in place two layers of checks. Railway Protection Force/Government Railway Police personnel will check the identity proof at the entry points and ticket checking staff members will check train/season tickets and the identity proof near the platforms. The Southern Railway will take several measures to prevent COVID-19, including sanitising the rakes and thermal-screening the passengers.

A senior official of Southern Railway said that at present, 30 special trains were being operated on the suburban routes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/special-suburban-trains-in-city-from-october-5/article32756958.ece
03 October 2020||GUWAHATI,||Branded witches, two killed and cremated in Assam||The police in central Assam’s Karbi Anglong district have arrested nine persons, including three women, for killing a man and a woman after branding them as witches and cremating them together. Police said a murder case has been registered under the Indian Penal Code and the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act against the nine who confessed to the killing. The incident happened in Rahimapur, an Adivasi village about 80 km from district headquarters Diphu, on September 30. “A 50-year-old woman and an unrelated 28-year-old man were killed and cremated together after a kangaroo court was held in the courtyard of the village headman to hold them responsible for the death of a girl on September 27,” the district’s Superintendent of Police Debojit Deuri toldThe Hindu. The two were accused of practising black magic that made the girl fall ill and die. “All the nine arrested confessed to having killed and cremated the two. Six others accused in the case are absconding,” said Mr. Deuri. A local police officer, recounting the confessional statements, said the two were bludgeoned to death before being cremated. Remains of their bodies recovered from the pyre have been collected for forensic test. Witch-hunting has been an age-old social malaise in Assam, mostly reported from the western part of the State. Data presented in the State Assembly said witch-hunting claimed the lives of 107 people from 2011 to November 2019. The Assam police had in 2001 launched Project Prahari to counsel certain communities against practising witch-hunting. The initiative by former Director-General of Police Kuladhar Saikia followed the killing of five people after being labelled as “witches” in Kokrajhar district’s Thaigarguri village. Lynching cases Karbi Anglong district has not been as notorious for witch-hunting but has recorded several instances of mob-lynching in recent years. The most infamous among them was the killing of two adventure-loving Assamese friends – Goa-based sound engineer Nilotpal Das and Guwahati-based businessman Abhijeet Nath – on June 8, 2018. On February 28, a court in Diphu awarded life imprisonment to 12 people for lynching 16-year-old Jhankar Saikia on July 1, 2013, following a tiff over an auto charging Rs. 10 more than the normal fare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/branded-witches-two-killed-and-cremated-in-assam/article32756722.ece

Ramasubramanian of the Supreme Court has said. Justice Ramasubramanian inaugurated the XVI Nani Palkhivala Tax Moot, organised by SASTRA Law School, and launched the C. Natarajan Chair for Legal Studies, according to a release. Tax law Recalling the contributions of Nani Palkhivala and C. Natarajan, especially in tax law, he mentioned a famous copyright infringement case before Justice A.S.P. Iyer at the Madras High Court, in which Nani Palkhivala argued as second defendant and as a witness and rose to become one of India’s outstanding jurist-statesmen. He also recalled the extraordinary contributions of the late C. Natarajan, who shaped the contours of complicated tax jurisprudence, especially when Tamil Nadu took the lead in sales tax. ‘Live law’ Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, who was the guest of honour, appealed to the students of law and practising professionals to live law, and not merely practise it. He encouraged SASTRA to undertake meaningful work under the C. Natarajan Chair, focussing on producing quality legal professionals. The C. Natarajan Chair for Legal Studies has been instituted by Additional Solicitor-General and senior advocate N. Venkataraman in memory of senior advocate and tax expert C. Natarajan, his professional guru.

03 October 2020||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,||Harsha Kumar decides to return to Congress||Former Amalapuram MP G.V. Harsha Kumar on Friday announced his intention to return to the Congress party. “The fight being staged by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra seeking justice for the Hathras gang-rape victim vouches for their concern towards the Dalits and tribal people. I am moved by the way Mr. Rahul Gandhi led the fight on Thursday,” Mr. Harsha Kumar told the media here on Friday. “I have decided to rejoin the Congress party. I have decided it on my own without consulting any of my supporters. I will wait for the response from the party leadership,” said Mr. Harsha Kumar, who quit the Congress after bifurcation of the State. Mr. Harsha Kumar was elected to the Lok Sabha on Congress party ticket from Amalapuram in 2004 and 2009. Later, he joined the TDP and then the YSRCP. However, he has not been associated with any political party in the recent months, and is actively involved in the movement against atrocities against Dalits. Mr. Harsha Kumar further said that the BJP stood for the corporates and not for the poor. “The Centre has failed to tackle the COVID-19 situation properly and has hushed up the death toll,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/harsha-kumar-decides-to-return-to-congress/article32756373.ece
03 October 2020||New Delhi,||LJP will go it alone in Bihar but back Modi||It is almost certain that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) will contest 143 seats outside the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), with the slogan “ Modi se bair nahi, Nitish teri khair nahi, ” which roughly translates to “No enmity with Modi but won’t spare [Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) president] Nitish Kumar.” LJP president Chirag Paswan met BJP president J.P. Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday. It will be a friendly alliance, with the BJP offering not to contest in the seats that will fall in its kitty. The LJP also assured the BJP that in the post-poll scenario, it will back the BJP’s candidate for Chief Minister. A formal announcement is likely over the weekend. A senior LJP leader said the party was in the NDA at the national level but not at the State-level. Technically, therefore, it is not formally walking out of the NDA. With party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan seriously ill and undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital, his resignation from the Cabinet post is completely ruled out. Practically, the LJP will work as the BJP’s proxy. The LJP leader said, “In the 2015 elections, the BJP contested in157 seats. With the JD(U) wishing to play the big brother in the alliance, they will get fewer than 120 seats. So there will be 37 candidates of the BJP who will have nowhere to go but find space with us”. To counter the JD(U)’s candidates, the LJP, a Dalit outfit, is likely to field the so-called upper caste candidates, according to its strategist. The whole idea is to mop up the anti-Nitish and pro-Modi votes, on the JD(U) seats. The whole campaign of the party will be pro-BJP and anti-Nitish. The LJP has proposed this as a win-win situation for itself and the BJP as well. The BJP gets to accommodate its candidates, albeit under the LJP symbol, while the LJP will be able to increase its profile manifold. The LJP is presenting it as a fait accompli , considering the division of seats would leave them with 20-25 odd seats. “We do not really have an option. This is a far lower tally than what we are ready to settle for. And thankfully, we have been working over a year and have serious candidates for all the 143 seats,” the leader stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ljp-will-go-it-alone-in-bihar-but-back-modi/article32756385.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Tangedco to get over Rs. 30,000 crore in loan||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), suffering from chronic financial problems, has been sanctioned Rs. 30,230.3 crore under the Central government’s COVID-19 liquidity infusion scheme. Officially called ‘special long-term transition loan to DISCOMs’ [distribution companies], the bailout package is meant to help entities such as Tangedco clear their dues to the central generation and transmission companies, independent power producers and renewable energy generators. A few months ago, Tangedco sent to the Centre a revised application for Rs. 32,682.65 crore against its original request for Rs. 18,000 crore. This followed the Centre’s decision to extend the scheme’s reference date from March 31 to June 30. The loan will be provided by two Central agencies — REC Limited (formerly Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). REC Limited will give Rs. 17,830.3 crore, including Rs. 2,715.15 crore that pertains to a portion of the PFC’s component of the overall sanctioned loan amount. The remaining Rs. 12,400 crore will come from PFC. It is also expected to follow suit shortly. A communication to this effect was sent on Thursday by Sanjay Kulshrestha, Chief General Manager (State Operations), REC Limited, to his company’s Chennai office, a copy of which is available with The Hindu . The State government was immediately informed of the decision. Initially, 50% of the sanctioned amount will be released by the two institutions as part of the first tranche. One of the pre-commitment conditions is that a tariff revision petition will have to be filed before the disbursement of the second tranche. Digital payment of power bills, self-assessment by consumers and installation of pre-paid meters at government offices are among the other conditions. According to the Centre, the package marks a “one-time permission” to two of its agencies to lend money for the working capital above the ceiling of 25% of the previous year’s revenue of the utility concerned. After extending the reference date, the Centre increased the size of the liquidity infusion package from Rs. 90,000 crore to Rs. 1.2 lakh crore.

03 October 2020||Madurai,||‘Give Marudhu Pandiyar brothers’ descendants’ pension to 3 women’||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to grant the Marudhu Pandiyar brothers’ descendants’ pension to three women descendants of the freedom fighters and observed that the discrimination against the women descendants was totally unjustifiable. The court was hearing the petitions filed by V. Kanaga, C. Maragatham and K. Rajeswari who sought the pension. They challenged the Ramanathapuram Collector’s decision to turn down their request for pension under the scheme in 2017. They sought to quash the order of the Collector and sanction the pension. Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that the State government came forward in 1980 to recognise the role played by the Marudhu Pandiyar brothers in the freedom struggle and as a token of respect provided the freedom fighters political pension to the descendants of the brothers taking into account that a number of them were struggling financially. A committee was constituted and 202 people were identified as descendants of the brothers in 1982. Accordingly, the pension at the rate of Rs. 150 a month was sanctioned to all the 202 descendants. However, some women descendants were either not considered or included in the list. The court took into account that two such women Kalyani and Kasthuri Kannan had to approach the court for relief similar to the case of the three women in the present case. These two are none other than the first cousins of the present petitioners, all descendants of the Marudhu Pandiyar brothers, the court observed. The judge observed that apart from the 202 descendants, if anyone was left out, it is for the government to identify and recognise those descendants because it was not the monetary criteria that had driven the petitioners to the court, but the status and honour that they would enjoy based on such recognition by the government. When we recollect the freedom struggle, both male and female warriors have made equal contribution to the cause of the motherland, the judge said pointing out to the contribution of freedom fighter Velu Nachiyar to the freedom struggle. The judge said the discrimination against women was unjustifiable and set aside the Collector’s order. The court directed that a government order be passed in recognising the three sisters as the descendants of the Marudhu Pandiyar brothers and the pension be sanctioned to them. The government order shall be passed within eight weeks for continuous disbursement of the pension to the three petitioners throughout their life.  It is not the monetary criteria that has driven the petitioners to the court, but the status and honour that they will enjoy based on such recognition by the government Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court    It is not the monetary criteria that has driven the petitioners to the court, but the status and honour that they will enjoy based on such recognition by the government Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/give-marudhu-pandiyar-brothers-descendants-pension-to-three-women-high-court-bench/article32757053.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy will distribute school kits to students at a school in Kankipadu on October 5 as part of Jagananna Vidya Kanuka programme, according to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh. The Minister was speaking after inspecting the Kankipadu Zilla Parishad High School and Model Primary School on Friday. Mr. Suresh said Mr. Jagan would inspect the works taken up under the Nadu-Nedu programme at Kankipdu school before formally inaugurating the Vidya Kanuka scheme. Referring to the Nadu-Nedu programme, he said the face of the government schools would completely change under this scheme. The focus was on development of infrastructure to make schools a happy place to spend for children. The programme was being implemented in three phases and at the end of it all, the stark difference between the school buildings and the facilities around in the past and now would be seen. The government now was also keen on extending this programme to junior and degree colleges and give them a facelift, he said. The COVID-19 pandemic-induced lock down had caused a delay in completion of the works taken up as part of Nadu Nadu and efforts were on to complete them within the targeted time frame, Mr. Suresh added. He said the effort was to develop educational institutions in the government sector on a par with private and corporate schools and colleges. Pre-primary schools Mr. Suresh said the proposed pre-primary schools would start from next academic year. The 1,000 Anganwadi centres located on the premises of school campuses would be developed as pre-primary schools, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-to-launch-vidya-kanuka-on-monday/article32756378.ece

03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Will get justice for rape victim: Priyanka||Congress general secretary for Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said every woman in the country needs to raise her voice to ensure justice for the “daughter of Hathras”, referring to the victim of the gang rape who died on Wednesday. Ms. Vadra was speaking at a prayer meeting organised by the Valmiki community in memory of the rape victim at the Bhagwan Valmiki Mandir in Delhi that once hosted Mahatma Gandhi for 214 days. She asserted that her party would continue to put pressure on the government until justice is delivered to the victim’s family. “Whatever has happened to the woman, her family faced it alone as they did not get any support from the government. I came here to express solidarity with you and her family so that you don’t feel you are alone. We will fight against it. I urge you all to raise your voice and we will put political pressure on the government,” she said. Criticising the U.P. government and the police for cremating the victim at night without the family’s consent, she said, “Our country does not have a tradition where the father, brother and the family of the victim are not allowed to light the pyre.” Earlier in the day, Ms. Vadra welcomed the Allahabad High Court taking suo motu cognizance of the police action to cremate the body without the family’s consent. In a separate set of tweets, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also attacked the U.P. administration, tweeting a video clip showing a young boy from the victim’s family alleging misbehaviour by senior officials and saying the family was being prevented from interacting with anyone. “The U.P. administration is resorting to cruelty to hide the truth. Neither we nor the media is allowed to meet the victim’s family. They are not allowed to come out but the family members are beaten up and brutalised,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted. Newly appointed Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan meanwhile alleged that her clothes were torn during a scuffle with the U.P. police on Thursday. Ms. Dhawan said the incident occurred when she intervened as the police tried to detain Congress leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-get-justice-for-rape-victim-priyanka/article32756326.ece
03 October 2020||New Delhi,||Elder care is a priority: Harsh Vardhan||Health Ministry data showed that 1,095 COVID-19 deaths were registered in the country in the past 24 hours, with 83.37% of them being reported from 10 States and Union Territories. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, speaking about the pressure that COVID-19 puts on the older population, noted that the pandemic has caused an upheaval across the country and the world. The highest number of deaths was reported from Maharashtra (394), followed by Karnataka (130), Uttar Pradesh (80), Tamil Nadu (66), West Bengal (59), Punjab (45), Andhra Pradesh (41), Delhi (40), and Kerala and Chhattisgarh (29 each), according to a release issued by the Ministry on Friday. The Ministry added that 78.07% of the new cases in the last 24 hours in the country are concentrated in ten States/UTs, with Maharashtra contributing more than 16,000 new cases. Karnataka has contributed around 10,000 cases and Kerala follows with more than 8,000. “As on date, the active cases contribute only 14.74% to the positive case load of the country. Maharashtra is leading the States’ tally with more than 2.5 lakh cases, Karnataka follows with more than 1 lakh cases,” said the Ministry. The Health Minister said, “The government has responded to address the concerns of the elderly by recognising them as a vulnerable population category for COVID efforts, issuing advisories, raising awareness of their special needs, encouraging State governments to develop need-based models for delivery of medications and home-based care to the elderly.” “The number of active cases on Friday is 9,42,217 with 78,877 recoveries registered in the last 24 hours in the country. India’s total recoveries are 53,52,078 today. The last 10 lakh recoveries were added in just 12 days. With this, India continues to maintain its global position of being the country with the maximum number of recovered COVID patients in the world. 10 States/UTs account for 72% of the newly recovered cases,” said the Ministry. IMA demand The Indian Medical Association (IMA), on Friday, has demanded that the government should work at strengthening public hospitals and come up with a strategy to sustain small and medium hospitals during the ongoing pandemic. “Reconceive, redesign and restructure Ayushman Bharat is also one of our demands. The response of the Government is not only inadequate, it is totally inappropriate in respect to COVID-19,” the IMA said in its release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elder-care-is-a-priority-harsh-vardhan/article32756334.ece
03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Choose wisely, Sonia tells the voters of Bihar||Some people are running the government by trading in emotions, confusion and fear and people should choose wisely, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday told a rally in Bihar via videoconferencing, as the party formally launched its Assembly poll campaign in the State by recalling Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran movement on his 151st birth anniversary. “Brothers and sisters, enough is enough now. I just want to say that some people are running the government by trading in emotions, confusion and fear. You should be most careful and make the right decision. For this, we all have to fight unitedly, walking on the path of truth, non-violence and swaraj of Gandhi ji, ” she told the rally in Motihari. Her comments came on a day when the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) moved a step closer to finalising a seat-sharing pact in which the Congress may get 70 seats, Left parties 29 and Mukesh Saini’s Vikassheel Insaan Party 11. The RJD would contest in the remaining 133 seats, said a source.  ‘Laws diluted’ Irrespective of the status of alliance, Ms. Gandhi mounted a scathing attack on the Union government ahead of the three-phase Bihar polls later this month and next month. She accused it of diluting all laws that empowered citizens. “Several laws enacted by the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government, whether they were for employment, health or education or those associated with labour, farmers, food security, women security and empowerment, have been weakened so much by the Modi government that it is an assault on citizen’s rights. Their rights have been snatched away,”she said. Crores of youth have lost their jobs, lakhs of micro and small industries have shut shop, farmers were in pain and biggest government employers were being privatised, she said.

03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Laws protected women, children’||Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani addressed the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday morning on the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action to highlight India’s achievements in gender equality. Ms. Irani was among over 150 Prime Ministers, Presidents and Ministers who addressed the UNGA’s High-Level meeting held under the theme “Accelerating the realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”.  Ms. Irani spoke about a shift in India “from a paradigm of women’s development to women-led development”, which is a theme that first found mention in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto ahead of the 2019 general elections. “Several of our legislations, such as those pertaining to sexual harassment of women at workplace, protection of women from domestic violence, protection of children from sexual offences, and our criminal laws’ amendments, have been strong enablers of women empowerment and protection of children, especially girls, over the past six years,” Ms. Irani said.  She added, “The government of India took a series of measures for ensuring safety, security and well-being of women during the COVID pandemic..” Activists unhappy However, activists said the omissions on caste and religious divide, and domestic violence, were glaring in her speech. “Different governments in the world today are pushing behind women’s agenda. There needs to be a conducive environment for these global agendas to work and ensure transformative changes,” said Ruth Manorama, Dalit women’s rights activist. “The omissions in the speech about religious and caste problems are also telling. The government should ensure that through education and quality curriculum, these retrograde thoughts that divide the society are removed,” she added. “The lack of priority given to women’s needs and safety can be seen from the budget of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, where a mere 4% of the budget has been allocated towards services and empowerment of women, and prevention of crimes,” said founder-director of Swayam, an NGO based in Kolkata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/laws-protected-women-children/article32756330.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Govt. cannot keep deferring labour reforms’||The recently passed Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, which along with the Code on Wages, 2019 subsume 29 labour laws into four codes, were passed after widespread consultations, says Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar.   There has been criticism about the manner in which the three labour codes were passed. How would you address the criticism that the Bills were not sent to the Standing committee again and there was lack of consultation with the stakeholders? I wish to clarify that the final draft of the Codes has been framed after wide-ranging consultations with all stakeholders. The reforms were initiated on the basis of the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, 2002, which had recommended to subsume the then existing Central labour legislations into four or five Codes. It was from 2014 onwards that our government took active steps towards codification exercise. I would like to inform that the Labour Ministry seeks to always ensure tripartite consultations. In this context, an extensive consultation process was adopted wherein all stakeholders, including trade unions, employer associations, State governments, international organisations and citizens were consulted. Various consultation processes were held along with seeking the comments of general public by placing the draft codes on the website. Subsequent to these broad consultations, various modifications were made. Many suggestions of trade unions including recognition of trade unions at unit, State and Central level and providing mechanism for inter-trade union dispute resolution through industrial tribunals were accepted. Lastly, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on labour, after scrutinising the labour codes and consulting all stakeholders, gave 233 recommendations out of which about 74% of the recommendations were accepted.... We cannot keep on referring the Bills again and again to committees and in the name of consultation process keep deferring the much needed reforms. How will the four labour codes change the lives of workers? And when will they be implemented? These labour Codes will bring qualitative change in the lives of our workers and they seek to achieve the twin objective of securing the basic rights of the workers and facilitating employment generation. These labour Codes seek to universalise the right to minimum wage of workers, presently available to only about 30% of the workforce engaged in the scheduled employments. Apart from this, the right to timely payment of wages without any unauthorised deduction has been universalised for all employees. The OSH Code seeks to establish a dynamic occupational safety regulatory framework in consonance with the changing technology and working conditions. The IR Code strengthens the dispute resolution machinery in the industrial establishments besides enabling effective participation of Trade Unions. The Code on Social Security takes a significant step towards ensuring a universal coverage of all organised and particularly unorganised workers in the social security net. The Rule-making exercise for the Codes has been initiated and we will implement these Codes after framing of subordinate legislations.  (For full interview, log on to bit.ly/LabourMin)    The final draft of the Codes has been framed only after wide-ranging consultations with all stakeholders||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-cannot-keep-deferring-labour-reforms/article32756336.ece

Leaders of alliance partners are likely to officially announce the formula this weekend. However, confusion continued in the NDA, despite several rounds of meetings between party leaders, both in Patna and Delhi. A day after the RJD and Congress — two major alliance partners of the mahagathbandhan — attacked each other over seat sharing, leaders of both the parties, Tejashwi Yadav and Rahul Gandhi respectively, are said to have had a telephonic discussion on Friday to reach an agreement. The Bihar Assembly has 243 members. If RJD sources are to be believed, the party is to contest around 134-136 seats leaving 65-68 for the Congress and 17-19 for the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), five each for two other Left parties — the CPI and the CPI(M) — 10-12 seats for the Vikassheel Insaan Party and two for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. “Yes, we’ve almost done our seat-sharing among alliance partners and top party leaders are likely to announce it on Saturday or Sunday,” a senior RJD leader told The Hindu. He added that the “seat finalisation was done after Tejashwi Yadav spoke to Rahul Gandhi.” Earlier on Thursday, RJD and Congress leaders had blamed each other for trying to “rock the boat”. Lashing out at RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, heir apparent of party chief Lalu Prasad, Bihar Congress in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil called him “inexperienced” while RJD leader and party spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari hit back saying, “he [Mr. Gohil] is trying to rock the boat”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-tejashwi-talk-helps-seal-seat-sharing-in-bihar/article32756318.ece

After being spurned by the NDA and discarded by the RJD-helmed ‘Mahagathbandhan’, Mr. Kushwaha has forged an alliance with Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and a non-descript Janatantrik Party (Socialist) ahead of the polls in Bihar. BSP chief Mayawati has also announced that her party would be supporting Mr. Kushwaha as the “Chief Ministerial” candidate in Bihar, an assertion which is being scoffed at by the ruling NDA as well as the grand alliance comprising RJD, Congress and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lalu-nitish-two-sides-of-same-coin-rlsp/article32756727.ece

03 October 2020||New Delhi,||Good conduct is key to early release: SC||The length of a prison sentence or the gravity of the crime cannot be the sole basis for denying a convict premature release from jail, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment. A three-judge Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said an assessment of the proclivity to commit a crime upon release “must be based on antecedents as well as the conduct of the prisoner while in jail, and not merely on his age or apprehensions of the victims and witnesses”. In a judgment on September 30, Justice Kant wrote: “Society has a right to lead a peaceful and fearless life, without free-roaming criminals creating havoc in the lives of ordinary peace-loving citizens. But equally strong is the foundation of reformative theory, which propounds that a civilised society cannot be achieved only through punitive attitudes and vindictiveness.” The court said reformative justice should not merely focus on public harmony, but should foster brotherhood and mutual acceptability. First-time offenders should especially be given a second chance at life. “First-time offenders ought to be liberally accorded a chance to repent their past and look forward to a bright future,” the court observed. Prisoners’ plea The judgment came in a plea made by two prisoners who gave been incarcerated for a botched kidnapping for ransom case in Uttar Pradesh. They are in their early middle age with a record of good conduct in jail. The court, ordering their release, said that their “action of kidnapping was nothing but a fanciful attempt to procure easy money, for which they have learnt a painful life lesson”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/good-conduct-key-to-early-release-sc/article32756337.ece
03 October 2020||New Delhi,||Trade unions call strike on Nov. 26 against labour laws||Ten Central trade unions will observe a nationwide general strike on November 26 to protest against the recent labour laws cleared by Parliament. This was decided at a virtual national convention of the unions and other independent federations held on Friday to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti. Parliament passed the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020, the Code on Social Security Bill, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code Bill, 2020 in the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament. Indian National Trade Union Congress president G. Sanjeeva Reddy said that for the working class, the Modi government’s rule was worse than the British regime. “The Modi government is trying to snatch the rights we earned after 60 years of struggle. They are taking the worker’s living standards to British era,” Mr. Reddy said. He said that it was important that all trade unions come together at this hour. All India Trade Union Congress general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said the government, instead of formulating policies for last man in the line, was making policies to benefit those at the top of the food chain. The organisations said the new labour codes had taken away the fundamental right of the worker to go on strike. The unions have collectively drafted seven demands, including cash transfer of Rs. 7,500 a month for all families that do not pay income tax and 10 kg free ration per month to the needy. The unions have also demanded withdrawal of the new labour and farm laws. Centre of Indian Trade Unions general secretary Tapan Sen said the government was adamant on selling public sector units and on privatisation. “On November 26, there will be a nationwide general strike. But this is merely the first step, we will constantly oppose Modi government’s every effort to try and sell off public sector companies,” Mr. Sen said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trade-unions-call-strike-on-nov-26-against-labour-laws/article32756340.ece

The number of leopards captured per month increased more than threefold (from 1.5 to 4.6) after the human-leopard policy guidelines were brought out in 2011. Similarly, there was a threefold increase in the number of leopards translocated per month (from 1 to 3.5). Sanjay Gubbi of the Nature Conservation Foundation, who led the study in the State, said the guidelines for human-leopard conflict management were brought out in April 2011 to reduce conflict with leopards, discourage their translocation, and suggest improved ways of handling emergency conflict situations. Mr. Gubbi, the lead author of the paper, said that in Karnataka, 357 leopards were in conflict situations and were captured between 2009 and 2016, and the final outcome was available in the case of 314 leopards. Of these, 268 were translocated in contravention of the spirit of the policy, 34 were captured and kept in captivity, while 12 died during the capture. These findings have been published in a paper titled ‘Policy to on-ground action: Evaluating a conflict policy guideline for leopards in India’ in the Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy . The co-authors of the paper are Aparna Kolekar and Vijaya Kumara. Taking Karnataka as a case study, the researchers analysed pre- and post-guidelines leopard captures, reasons for the captures, and the outcome for the captured leopards. The numbers The study found that out of 357 leopards captured across 23 of the 30 districts in the State during 2009-16, a majority (79%) occurred in Mysuru, Udupi, Hassan, Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Ballari, Koppal, and Mandya districts. Of the 268 leopards translocated, many were moved to protected areas (59.7%) and some to reserved/State/minor forests (29.8%). The highest number of translocations occurred into Bandipur Tiger Reserve (22.5%), followed by Nagarahole Tiger Reserve (20.6%) and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (15%). The study indicated that of the 80 leopards that were translocated to reserved/State/minor forests, most releases were to Kemphole Reserved Forest (16.2%), followed by Devarayanadurga State Forest (7.5%) and Bukkapatna State Forest (5%). Though eight reasons were attributed to capture and translocation of leopards, the main justification was livestock depredation (38.1%), said Mr. Gubbi. The other reasons included leopards rescued from snares and wells (15.7%), anxiety caused owing to leopard sightings in human habitations (13.7%), and leopards entering human dwellings (10.9%). Human injuries (4.5%) and human deaths (2%) formed a small part of the reason for leopard captures and translocation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-fold-increase-in-leopard-capture-translocation-study/article32756301.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,||15 workers suffer burns in fire at KPCL Yelahanka power plant||As many as 15 employees suffered burns in a fire that broke out at the combined cycle power plant at Yelahanka early on Friday. Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. officials confirmed that they were preparing to commission the long-pending plant. Initial investigations revealed that leakage of CNG led to the accident, but experts are investigating to ascertain the exact cause. According to fire department officials, the accidental fire broke out at the plant around 3 a.m., when employees, belonging to KPCL, BHEL, and GE, were working there. They were injured and shifted to hospital before the fire and emergency services were alerted. It took four fire tendersone hour to bring the fire under control. A member of the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust and resident of the area, requesting anonymity, said there were activities in the plant since four or five days.    The fire and emergency services alleged that KPCL officials had not obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) to carry out such an exercise. However, V. Ponnuraj, managing director, KPCL told The Hindu that the plant was being commissioned at the time of the accident. “The cause [of the fire] will be known only when we get a root cause analysis by BHEL GE. The plant was to be commissioned today or tomorrow,” he said. When asked about allegations on NOC, he said, “There is no NOC required from the fire department. To be on the safe side, a month ago, we wanted to follow the guidelines and approached the fire department. We also wanted to know if we needed any approvals. They said we didn't need anything except fire protection systems, which we had.”   Police take up case The Yelahanka police have taken up a case based on the complaint by a KPCL officer in charge on Friday. A police team, which visited the site to take stock of the situation, said that there was no blast. “It was an accidental fire. A team of technical experts was doing a pre-run of the combined cycle power plant. The fire was noticed in the gas turbine following which the inbuilt fire alarm was triggered. However, the fire triggered oil leakage near the machinery,” said an officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-workers-suffer-burns-in-fire-at-kpcl-yelahanka-power-plant/article32756306.ece
03 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||‘Did not accept phone from Swapna’||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Friday denied that he had received an expensive mobile phone as a gift from Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the high-profile case relating to the smuggling of gold in bulk via air cargo consignments addressed to officials at the UAE consulate here. Politicians from the ruling front had attempted to cast Mr. Chennithala under a harsh spotlight after a private builder said in a court filing in Ernakulam recently that he had purchased five cell phones at the behest of Swapna in 2019. She had purportedly told the builder that UAE consulate would make a present of the devices to dignitaries attending an Iftar party hosted by the diplomatic mission in December that year. Mr. Chennithala was one of the invitees. At the time, Swapna was a consulate employee who often officiated as the master of ceremonies at events organised by the diplomatic mission. The ruling front had raised the baseless allegation to divert public attention from its wrongdoings, Mr. Chennithala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/did-not-accept-phone-from-swapna/article32756310.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Transfer control of Srisailam reservoir: KCR to Centre||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday addressed a letter to Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat seeking transfer of operational control of Srisailam reservoir from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana. The 14-page letter requested the Central government to immediately direct the Andhra Pradesh government to stop work on expansion of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator and construction of Rayalaseema lift-irrigation scheme. In order to enforce this, the operational control of Srisailam reservoir, which now rested with AP, should be handed over to Telangana immediately. Mr. Rao wrote the letter to Mr. Shekhawat ahead of the second round of Apex Council meeting on river water disputes with Andhra Pradesh on October 6. He requested the latter to include the allocation of water issues raised by him in the letter as agenda items of the meeting to be attended virtually by both of them and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy. The issues flagged by Mr. Rao on Krishna river included a) instances of injustice meted out to Telangana in sharing river water in the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh; b) right of Telangana to know about its share and efforts made by Telangana government in this regard; c) illegal Pothireddypadu head regulator project and its unauthorised expansion by Andhra Pradesh which will irreversibly compromise the interests and rights of Telangana; d) ineffective supervision by Krishna river management board; and e) issues related to Section 89 of AP Reorganisation Act. On Godavari river, Mr. Rao wanted discussion on a) objections of Andhra Pradesh about ongoing projects of Telangana on the river; and b) utilisation of Godavari waters. In point-by-point elaboration of issues that he highlighted, Mr. Rao said relief to Telangana in getting its rightful share in Krishna river had not been realised due to gross inaction on the part of Central government. The injustices meted out to Telangana in combined State were recorded by Bachawat Award itself. Every State had a Constitutional right to get a fair and equitable allocation of river water. However, Telangana was still waiting to know its legitimate share of water even after seven years of its formation. The Pothireddypadu head regulator expansion and the Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme were illegal as their original project itself had no water allocation nor approval by any statutory authority since the water was meant to be sent outside Krishna basin.  On Section 89 of State Reorganisation Act, he said its provisions mandated Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal - II to make project wise specific allocation and determine an operational protocol for release of water in the event of deficit flows. However, the terms of reference of the tribunal did not permit inter-se reallocation of water to Telangana and A.P. Referring to Godavari river, Mr. Rao said the objections of AP on seven projects taken up by Telangana on the river could not be called new. The objections were a farce as the projects were contemplated, designed and grounded in the combined State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/transfer-control-of-srisailam-reservoir/article32757013.ece

03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Over 1,600 kg of gold seized till September||The over 30% increase in the price of gold in India has led to a spurt in smuggling in the past one year and enforcement agencies seizing more than 1,600 kg of gold from across the country. “The share of middlemen and carriers goes up with the increase in gold price. Most of the smuggled gold of foreign origin is ultimately traced to Dubai or Thailand. Gold is currently worth about Rs. 50 lakh per kg in India,” said a customs official. On Friday, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized about 33 kg of gold worth Rs. 17.51 kg from a truck in West Bengal’s Siliguri district and arrested four persons. The consignment was smuggled in from Myanmar via Manipur and was destined to Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan. 2,112 cases Till August this year, as many as 2,112 cases of gold seizures were reported by various agencies. About 484 kg of gold was seized in February, while in March the figure was 205.81 kg and 280.66 kg in April. However, due to the lockdown measures, no seizures were made in May and only 37.54 kg of gold was impounded in June. Land route “Gold is smuggled through both the air and land routes. International flights were banned as part of the lockdown. Therefore, the land routes have become more active. A spurt in the gold smuggling through the Indo-Myanmar, Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bangladesh borders has been noticed,” the official said. Two seizures of 10.30 kg and 26.56 kg were made on the Imphal-Moreh Road, close to the Myanmar border, and at the New Jalpaiguri railway station. In both the cases, the agency suspects that the gold was smuggled in from Myanmar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-1600-kg-of-gold-seized-till-september/article32756321.ece

Ms. Bharti, in a series of tweets said that while she had been hesitant to speak out earlier on the issue, watching the media coverage had convinced her that she needed to speak out. “Your image is very clean and you have set up a Special Investigation Team to speedily investigate the matter. But, setting up an SIT while ring-fencing the family members of victim from meeting anyone could affect the integrity of the probe,” Ms. Bharti said. ‘Will hurt party image’ “She [the victim] is a daughter of a Dalit family, and after her death her cremation was done hastily and now her family is being ring-fenced by officials. We have recently performed the bhoomi poojan (ground breaking ceremony) of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and are working to establish Ram Rajya. The actions in Hathras will hurt the image of the party and the U.P. government,” Ms. Bharti said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/let-media-party-leaders-in-uma-bharti-urges-yogi/article32756322.ece

03 October 2020||Chennai,||Railways to pay pending wages to contract staff||The Indian Railways will pay contractual/outsourced staff engaged for various activities on trains and Railway establishments during the COVID-19 lockdown period, when train services were suspended till May 31, 2020. This will benefit thousands of workers who were directly affected by the lockdown. In an order to General Managers of all Zonal Railways and Production Houses, the Railway Board referred to the circular of the Ministry of Finance on “payment of wages to outsourced persons of Ministries/Departments and other organisations of Government of India during lockdown period due to COVID-19,” and said payment to contractors should be made after obtaining proof of paying salaries to workers for the previous month. As part of social distancing measures due to the spread of the coronavirus, Central/State governments had announced a lockdown across the country. Due to these measures, the Ministry of Finance said there was a likelihood of a number of contractual, casual and outsourced workers such as housekeeping staff being required to stay at home, which in normal circumstances would result in deduction in their pay/wages. “In order to avoid any undue hardships under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances, it has been decided that wherever any such contractual, casual and outsourced staff of Ministries/Departments and other organisation of Government of India is required to stay at home due to the pandemic shall be treated as ‘on duty’ during such period of absence and necessary pay/wages would be paid accordingly,” the order said. The Indian Railways engages a large number of contractual workers for housekeeping, cleaning, catering, bedroll supply/management, laundry and other services in trains, railway stations and other establishments across its network. These staff are paid by contractors and the bills settled by the Zonal Railways/production houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-pay-pending-wages-to-contract-staff/article32756342.ece
03 October 2020||New Delhi,||Intention to abet suicide cannot be assumed: SC||The intention to abet suicide cannot be assumed and it needs to be backed by solid, visible proof, the Supreme Court held in a judgment. A three-judge Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said every crime should be backed by a “state of mind” or mens rea or intention. The police have to establish that an accused wanted to abet the suicide. ‘Abetment’ is defined in Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Its ingredients consist of instigating a person or to intentionally aid a person to do or not do something. Similarly, the crime of ‘abetment of suicide’ under Section 306 of the IPC involves instigating or actively aiding a person to take his own life. The police cannot assume the intention ( mens rea ) of the abettor of a suicide. It has to be evident, it held. ‘Something on record’ “In order to prove mens rea , there has to be something on record to establish or show that the appellant herein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of the deceased. The ingredient of mens rea cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous”, Justice Roy, who authored the judgment, said. The judgment came on an appeal filed by Gurcharan Singh, who was convicted of abetting the suicide of his wife 22 years ago in Punjab. The trial court found him guilty, saying the woman was pushed into taking her own life when her hopes of a happy relationship was dashed by his “wilful neglect”. There was, however, no direct evidence of any cruelty on his part towards her. The trial court had even acquitted the man of dowry harassment charges. The High Court agreed with the trial court, saying the death was a cause of the “circumstances and the atmosphere” at home. In his appeal before the Supreme Court, Singh argued about the complete lack of evidence to show that he had instigated or intentionally aided his wife to take her own life. here was no proof that he wilfully neglected her, he said. Setting aside his conviction, the court said it cannot make conjectures about why a young woman with two small children chose to take her own life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/intention-to-abet-suicide-cannot-be-assumed-sc/article32756348.ece

Lady MP was manhandled by U.P. SDM,” Mr. O’ Brien tweeted. The scuffle with the administration came a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were arrested on the Yamuna Expressway by the Uttar Pradesh police and prevented from entering Hathras. CM’s assurance Breaking his silence on the gangrape, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said forces who even harbour ill thoughts against the honour and self-respect of mothers and sisters in the State would be completely annihilated. In a tweet in Hindi on Friday, Mr. Adityanath promised a punishment that will become an example for the future. He said the U.P. government was bound by oath to protect “mothers and sisters” in the State. The Chief Minister’s tweets came after he interacted with the father of the victim on Wednesday via video conferencing and promised him Rs. 25 lakh as compensation and a job for a family member. A young boy who described himself as the brother of the victim and claimed he had escaped the police cordon on the pretext of collecting fodder, told presspersons at the barricades, that there was an atmosphere of fear in the village. “Everybody has been asked to remain inside and the police were instilling fear among villagers. The mobile phones of many villagers have been collected by the policemen,” the boy said. The young boy who identified himself as Gajendra alleged that the policemen were colluding with the accused. As the day progressed, members of the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha gathered outside the village and threatened to hold a panchayat supporting the four men accused of the gangrape and brutal assault on the Dalit girl. A day after a video of him threatening the family went viral on Thursday, district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar remained inaccessible to presspersons on Friday. Some presspersons tried to take alternative routes to enter the village but they were stopped and sent back. Sources said the mobiles of the villagers were collected after one of them recorded the DM’s conversation with the family and leaked it to the media. Later in the day, Prakash Kumar, Assistant Superintendent of Police, told reporters that the entry of politicians and media persons was banned because the Special investigation Team’s was in the village. “We have inputs that some people want to spoil the law and order situation in the village. These restrictions will continue till the situation improves and the SIT completes its job,” he said. Officers suspended According to the U.P, government release, apart from SP Vikrant Vir, Circle officer Ram Shabd, inspector Dinesh Kumar Verma, SI Jagveer Singh and head constable Mahesh Pal have also been suspended. Mr. Verma was the SHO of the Chandpa police station at the time of the gruesome incident. The release added that the members of the victim’s family and the police officials will have to undergo polygraph and narco tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-mps-stopped-outside-hathras-village/article32756298.ece

With party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan seriously ill and undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital, his resignation from the Cabinet post is completely ruled out. BJP’s proxy Practically, the LJP will work as the BJP’s proxy. The LJP leader said, “In the 2015 elections, the BJP contested in 157 seats. With the JD(U) wishing to play the big brother in the alliance, they will get fewer than 120 seats. So there will be 37 candidates of the BJP who will have nowhere to go but find space with us”. To counter the JD(U)’s candidates, the LJP, a Dalit outfit, is likely to field the so-called upper caste candidates, according to its strategist. The whole idea is to mop up the anti-Nitish and pro-Modi votes, on the JD(U) seats. The whole campaign of the party will be pro-BJP and anti-Nitish. The LJP has proposed this as a win-win situation for itself and the BJP as well. The BJP gets to accommodate its candidates, albeit under the LJP symbol, while the LJP will be able to increase its profile manifold. In 2015 In the 2015 Assembly elections, fighting for 42 seats, the LJP got only 4.83% of the total vote share and won only two seats. Its best performance was 29 seats in 2005. “When we contest 143 seats, our vote share will naturally go up. We won’t be a 5% party any more,” another LJP leader said. The LJP is also presenting it as a fait accompli , considering the division of seats would leave them with a measly 20-25 odd seats. “We do not really have an option here. This is a far lower tally than what we are ready to settle for. And thankfully, we have been working over a year and have serious candidates for all the 143 seats,” the leader stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ljp-will-go-it-alone-in-bihar-but-back-modi/article32756308.ece
03 October 2020||Hyderabad,||Bharatanatyam stalwart V.S. Ramamoorthy no more||Veteran Bharatanatyam dancer, guru and founder of Hyderabad-based Sri Rama Nataka Niketan, V.S. Ramamoorthy passed away at the age of 100 in Hyderabad on Friday. Born on September 20, 1920, in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, Ramamoorthy moved to Secunderabad in 1969 and made the twin cities his home. After completing his diploma in electro-technical engineering, Ramamoorthy moved to the erstwhile Calcutta and then to Bangalore to join Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, as a sub-divisional officer. In 1942, he joined Military Engineering Services (MES) and was posted in Madras.  It was Bharatanatyam though that he was most inclined to and became the first male student of the then eminent guru Dandayudhapani Pillai. He gave his Arangetram at Rasika Ranjani Sabha in Madras on Independence Day, at the age of 27. Ramamoorthy was drawn to dance initially by the tradition of ‘Kathakalakshepam’ and narratives from the Ramayana and Bhagavatam. His portrayal of Sivakami, Kundavi in Parthiban Kanavu , Anarkali, Sita, Kaikeyi, Kousalya, Thilakavathy and many historical female characters in dramas enhanced his acting prowess. Going beyond Bharatanatyam, Ramamoorthy trained himself in Kurathi dance — a folk tradition of Tamil Nadu. What started as Sri Devi Nritya Niketan to teach dance to children in Mylapore area in Madras, continued as Sri Rama Nataka Niketan in Hyderabad when Ramamoorthy had to move on a job transfer. Under the guidance of his daughter Manjula Ramaswamy, the institute had won accolades and wide acclaim for its pure and traditional art form. Till his last, Ramamoorthy was actively involved in his students’ performances and used to take pride in their achievements at various platforms. A few months ago the classical dance fraternity was abuzz with activity celebrating Ramamoorthy’s centenary year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dance-guru-vs-ramamoorthy-no-more/article32756528.ece

03 October 2020||Srinagar,||‘Regulate extraction of minor minerals’||A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Sanjay Dhar has directed the J&K administration to regulate extraction of minor minerals from waterbodies and set up an expert committee to assess any environmental degradation. “The Chief Secretary of the Union Territory shall appoint a committee of experts on the lines of directions given by the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal Bar Association to assess the components and scales of compensation and recommend measures of reparation for acts and omissions which have resulted in environmental degradation,” Ms. Mittal and Mr. Dhar observed. Plea for regulation The Bench also directed immediate steps to appoint professional and qualified persons or agencies for technically and scientifically evaluating and fixing the reserved prices of minerals in the UT of J&K. “The recommendations of the experts so appointed be implemented in public interest,” it said. The Bench was hearing a plea that expressed concerns on account of auction notices “being issued without a study of the environmental impact of these auctions”. “We find that it is without conducting any study on the possible environmental impact on the riverbeds and elsewhere [that] the auction notices have been issued,” the petition reads. ‘Collective impact’ The plea argued that it is not an answer to say that the extraction is in blocks of less than five hectares and separated by 1 km. “Their collective impact may be significant, hence the necessity of a proper environmental assessment plan,” it added. It pointed out that the States and UTs should see that the mining of minor minerals is permitted only under a strict regulatory regime and is carried out only under an approved framework of a mining plan, which should provide for reclamation as well as rehabilitation of people in the mined areas. “Sand mining may have an adverse effect on biodiversity as loss of habitat caused by sand mining will affect various species, flora and fauna and it may also destabilise the soil structure of river banks and often leaves isolated islands,” the plea stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/regulate-extraction-of-minor-minerals/article32756584.ece
03 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Suspension of doctor, nurses triggers stir||The medical faculty and a section of the nursing staff at the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, went on a flash strike and staged a demonstration on the hospital campus on Friday soon after the Kerala government suspended a doctor and two head nurses, pending disciplinary action, in connection with the alleged negligence in the care of a patient at the Medical College Hospital (MCH). The government issued suspension orders on a report filed by the Director of Medical Education regarding the negligence committed in the care of an elderly patient, Anilkumar, who had been admitted to the COVID ward recently. Mr. Anilkumar, who had been undergoing treatment following a fall, had been referred to the MCH from the Peroorkada district model hospital. However, after he tested positive for COVID-19, he had been admitted to the COVID ward and since all his family members had been asked to go into quarantine, he was in the ward without any care-givers. Mr. Anilkumar’s family had complained to the Health Minister that the patient, when he was discharged and brought home, was in a totally emaciated condition and that he was covered in bed sores from head to toe, with maggot-infested wounds. The visuals of the patient’s plight, as seen on news channels, had evoked much outrage. Following this, the Health Minister ordered an inquiry into the incident . The medical faculty and nurses have however taken exception to the government’s decision to suspend Dr. Aruna, nodal officer in charge of supervision of the COVID ward, and two head nurses, Leena Kunjan and K. V. Rajani, because they point out that the negligence in care had happened due to the acute shortage of support staff in the MCH. They said the government had been informed time and again about the shortage of nursing assistants, staff nurses and other ancillary staff in the MCH, especially after the hospital was made a COVID hospital. The number of COVID patients has been going up steadily at the MCH and though new wards and ICUs were being opened up to accommodate patients, the government was paying scant attention to human resources, they pointed out. The doctors, as a mark of protest against the suspension order issued to their colleague, have decided to organise a 48-hour relay fast to draw the government’s attention to the issue of human resources shortage. The nurses are also observing a “Black Day” on Saturday in protest against the action taken against their colleagues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/suspension-of-doctor-nurses-triggers-stir/article32756312.ece

According to Miyapur inspector Venkatesh Shamala, Ramachandra Reddy Ramireddygari (67), a resident of Cyber Valley, hanged himself from a ceiling fan on Thursday night. The incident came to light next morning, after his wife found him dead. For the last few days, Reddy isolated himself in a room, as he was suffering from fever and cold, and suspected of contracting the deadly virus. “Fearing that he might spread the virus to his wife and other family members and get admitted to a hospital, he resorted to the extreme step,” the inspector said. A note purportedly left behind by the victim also cited that he suspected of contracting COVID-19 and did not want his family to suffer, Mr. Venkatesh said. “Family members said that he was also depressed after the death of singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam due to COVID-19,” he said. Based on a complaint lodged by family members, a case under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C. was registered and the body was shifted to Osmania General Hospital.

03 October 2020||Jaipur,||Local BJP leader, four others arrested for running sex racket in Rajasthan||Five persons, including a local woman BJP leader, have been arrested in Rajasthan’s Sawai Madhopur district on charges of running an alleged sex racket, which came to light following a complaint of sexual assault lodged by a minor girl with the police last month. Two government employees are also among the accused who have been arrested. The girl, aged 17, alleged that BJP leader Sunita Verma had forced her to have physical relations with several persons between October 2019 and May 2020 and also took money, including her father’s savings, from her. The accused filmed the incident when the girl was allegedly raped for the first time in a hotel and later used the video clips to blackmail her, according to the complaint. The BJP has removed Ms. Verma as the party’s district Mahila Morcha president after her arrest. The case against the BJP leader and her accomplices has been registered under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. More arrests likely Sawai Madhopur Women Cell’s Circle Officer Om Prakash Solanki said on Friday that an accomplice of Ms. Verma had befriended the girl when she was returning from school. She later started sending the girl to meet several persons who allegedly raped her. The 17-year-old was allegedly assaulted more than eight times at different locations, Mr. Solanki said. Those arrested include Sandeep Sharma, who is a clerk at Sawai Madhopur District Industries Centre, Shyoraj Meena, who is a peon in District Collectorate, and Raju Lal Raigar, an electrician. The police were probing whether Ms. Verma had also blackmailed some other girls and forced them into the racket. More arrests could take place in the coming days in connection with the case, according to the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/local-bjp-leader-four-others-arrested-for-running-sex-racket-in-rajasthan/article32756349.ece
03 October 2020||Mumbai,||Anurag Kashyap denies sexual harassment allegations||Film-maker Anurag Kashyap has vehemently denied all allegations of sexually harassing an actor in 2013. He provided documentary evidence to the Mumbai Police showing that he was in Sri Lanka throughout August that year. After the actor alleged that he had raped her, the Versova police station issued summons to Mr. Kashyap. On Thursday, he appeared before the police station to record his statement. He was quizzed for eight hours, and he denied all wrongdoing in the matter. The police recorded his statement, in which Mr. Kashyap said that the complaint was an “outright lie”. He also provided documentary proof of the fact that throughout August 2013, he was away in Sri Lanka in connection with the shooting of one of his films. A statement was released by his lawyer Priyanka Khimani on Friday, which said, “These sudden, belated allegations of an alleged incident of August 2013 have been widely publicised by the complainant for the purpose of vilifying Mr. Kashyap, irrespective of the outcome of the judicial process. He has sought severe action against the complainant for misusing the criminal justice system and for hijacking the Me Too Movement for her ulterior motives.” The statement further said, “Mr. Kashyap is confident that the falsity of the complaint has been exposed, not only by the evidence presented by Mr. Kashyap, but also the ever-shifting version of events put forth by the complainant in the media. Mr. Kashyap is apprehensive that now that the falsity of her allegations in the FIR have been established, she will alter her version of events in the investigation process as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anurag-kashyap-denies-sexual-harassment-allegations/article32756352.ece
03 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC grants bail to man accused of raping ex-wife||The Bombay High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of raping and sexually harassing his ex-wife who has dyslexia. They had got married in June 2003, and have two children. The woman alleged that on June 15, 2017, her ex-husband Jignesh Dangarwala took her out for a walk. Then Mr. Dangarwala’s friend Rajiv came in a car and her husband made her sit in the front seat with Mr. Rajiv. She said she was reluctant and she was forced to sit in the car, and then Mr. Rajiv started touching her indecently. She alleged that Mr. Rajiv then took both of them to his house in Malad and had forced intercourse with her. When she came out of the room and told her ex-husband about it, he told her not to tell anyone and assured her that this would not happen again. An FIR was lodged by the woman against her ex-husband at Samata Nagar police station on December 17, 2019, describing sexual harassment incidents with different persons named as Ravi alias Rohit and Tushar at Borivali in October 2018 and at Dahisar in February 2019.

03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM, Deputy CM attend Gandhi Jayanthi event, but don’t speak||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam came face-to-face at the official Gandhi Jayanthi celebrations on Friday, four days after they were involved in a spar at the AIADMK executive committee meeting. However, the two did not converse, despite standing next to each other. The Chief Minister and his deputy were later seated on either sides of Governor Banwarilal Purohit during the event, in adherence to physical distancing norms. Tributes paid As per protocol, Mr. Palaniswami paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue after the Governor. Mr. Panneerselvam followed suit. Earlier, on Tuesday, Mr. Panneerselvam did not attend COVID-19 review meetings that were chaired by the Chief Minister. Amid the strain in relationship between Mr. Panneerselvam, who is also the AIADMK coordinator, and Mr. Palaniswami, the co-coordinator, buzz was created for a few hours, after a tweet on Friday afternoon from the party’s official handle, @AIADMKOfficial, said that all ruling party MLAs had been ordered by the “party headquarters” to come to Chennai on October 6. Creating a stir Against the backdrop of party’s second-line leader K.P. Munusamy’s earlier announcement that the AIADMK’s Chief Ministerial candidate for 2021 Assembly elections would be announced on October 7, the tweet created a stir. A legislator said he did not receive any communication on the issue. However, by evening, the party’s Twitter handle deleted the tweet without any explanation. Meanwhile, at a separate event, Mr. Palaniswami, Mr. Panneerselvam and Ministers paid floral tributes at the memorial of former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj in Guindy.

When journalists asked him about the steps taken by the police to handle anti-social elements, he said the police had always had a category-wise list of history-sheeters, including details of the ones active within and outside the city. “We are always watching them and will take immediate action if they commit any offence,” Mr. Aggarwal said. The Commissioner added that as per the Madras High Court’s suggestion, a draft legislation on curtailing rowdyism was on the cards. [The DGP had informed the court about the same on Thursday.] Mr. Aggarwal, along with Additional Commissioners of Police, flagged off an awareness campaign vehicle on COVID-19 prevention and precautionary measures. Public cooperation He said the State government had been taking all out efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and had been successful in controlling its spread. He added that 100% success could be achieved with the full participation of the public. The Commissioner said over 2,500 police personnel had been infected so far. While most of them had been cured and had rejoined duty, around 250 were still hospitalised or under home quarantine. Senior police officers are in touch with them and are regularly enquiring about the treatment given to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/draft-legislation-against-rowdyism-on-anvil-says-police-commissioner/article32756973.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A meal for Rs. 10 available in Chennai||Mukesh Khubchandani, a Chennai businessman, has replicated the budget canteen that was run by S. Ramu, fondly called Ramu Thatha, in Madurai and is selling meals for Rs. 10. Ramu Thatha, who passed away a few months ago, ran the budget hotel along with his wife R. Pooranathammal near the Anna bus stand in the temple city. “The day I read about the death of Madurai’s Ramu Thatha (meaning grandfather), who served meals for Rs. 10, I was impressed by his life journey. That is when I thought when a poor man can do this for several decades, why not me,” said Mr. Khubchandani, who is president of the All India Electronics Association, Chennai. In the next 30 days, he and his team did the groundwork and set up a small kitchen (345 sq ft) on Ritchie Street. The operations started in August. “The idea behind collecting Rs. 10 is to make the buyer realise that it is not free. This will also ensure that he does not waste food,” Mr. Khubchandani said. The meal parcel contains rice, sambhar, rasam, buttermilk and vegetables (all packed separately). During the initial days, 100 meals a day were sold. As word spread, more people from nearby places started coming in. Currently, over 300 meals are being sold every day, and the number is increasing. Looking at the demand, Mr. Khubchandani has deployed two persons to be in charge of the kitchen and four others to help in the packaging. He is now planning to set up a restaurant and is scouting for a location. “I’m looking for a space where there are more labourers who would walk in. At the restaurant, I will be giving the meals for Rs. 30 (with the best ambience), and takeaways will be priced at Rs. 10,” he said. This restaurant will be operational within the next six months. Asked about the investment, Mr. Khubchandani refused to give details. He said the idea was not to make profits but to ensure that the common man got access to quality food.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-meal-for-rs-10-available-in-chennai/article32757207.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||91 fake NOCs were used to set up fuel outlets, HC told||The Madras High Court was on Thursday startled to hear from the Director General of Police (DGP) that as many as 91 retail outlets of petrol, diesel and auto gas had been established across the State on the strength of fake No Objection Certificates (NOCs), reportedly issued by Collectors and Commissioners of Police. Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan had called for the information after coming across a couple of habeas corpus petitions filed against the preventive detention of two individuals K.L. Sivakumar and C. Jayaprakash accused of having issued fake NOCs with the seal of the Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai. Far and wide Suspecting that the crime could not have been be limited to Chennai, the judges directed the DGP to verify the records in all districts and submit a detailed report. Accordingly, Additional Public Prosecutor R. Prathap Kumar submitted a list before the court and said the inquiry revealed the issuance of 91 fake NOCs. The court was informed that submission of a NOC from the Commissioner of Police, if a retail outlet was to be established within city limits, or from the Collector, if it was to be established in other places, was a prerequisite to obtain licence for the outlet from the Petroleum and Safety Explosive Organisation (PESO). The onus of obtaining such NOCs was on the individual dealers and so Sivakumar, who was a consultant for a petroleum company, had collected huge sums of money from them and issued fake NOCs. Shocked to hear such allegations, the judges directed Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan too to look into the issue. They directed the APP to furnish a copy of the DGP’s report to Abdul Saleem, counsel for Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Nayara Energy Limited (formerly Essar Oil) so that he could find out if any of the 91 outlets had been established by the dealers of these three companies and initiate appropriate action. Report wanted The judges called for a report from PESO too on the issue of fake NOCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/91-fake-nocs-were-used-to-set-up-fuel-outlets-hc-told/article32757209.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Job racketeering on the rise, say police||When Gandhimathi (name changed) in southern Tamil Nadu received a SMS offering jobs in the Airports Authority of India last month, she eagerly responded by making a call to the mobile number mentioned in the message, which was registered under the name of HR, Aero, in the Truecaller app. What unfolded in the next three days exposed a gang of job racketeers who targeted gullible youth offering them ‘employment letters’ in the names of organisations like the AAI. The girl ended up paying Rs. 2,500 via Google Pay as application fee, and got posted as a ‘Ground Staff’ at Madurai Airport within two days. She grew suspicious when the ‘recruiters’ insisted on a payment of Rs. 28,000 as caution deposit for training equipment like walkie-talkies and uniforms. Ms. Gandhimathi realised that she had been duped after a friend informed her that job offers like those were not made without personal interviews. The police said many such unemployed youth were being cheated by job racketeers based in Tamil Nadu, other States and even abroad. Since the suspects sent mails/offer letters that appeared to be genuine, the victims made payments. Such scams were on the rise at a time when thousands of people have lost jobs due to the pandemic. “These gangs target such gullible youth and lure them with lucrative job offers in Central government organisations,” a police officer said. “We have directed the Commissioners/Superintendents of Police to take firm action on complaints of job racketeering. It will be easy to zero-in on the suspects based on digital footprints. In some cases, the gangs operate from fake addresses using SIM cards activated with forged documents. But there is no let-up in our endeavour to track down such gangs,” Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy said on Friday. In Chennai, Commissioner of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said cyber crime units were decentralised to the police station level with special teams tackling complaints on a daily basis. “In the last two months, we have recovered Rs. 30 lakh money lost by complainants in different types of cyber frauds, including job racketeering,” he said. A couple of days ago, Mr. Mahesh received a complaint from Ranjith Kumar, 31, of Kaatankulathur, via video call, regarding a fake employment firm Sailors Maritime Academy (SMA), headed by one Mohandoss. A special team nabbed Mohandoss, his wife Rani, associates Karthick, Mohanraj and Parthiban, who were involved in the job racket. “Investigation revealed that the accused had cheated over 100 persons out of nearly Rs. 30 lakh in deposits. Legal action is being pursued against them,” the Commissioner said. The AAI and many other Central government organisations have issued alerts to the public not to fall for fake job offers.  It had pointed out then that all vacancies and recruitment would be notified on its official website and also in the Employment News/Rojgar Samachar and leading Indian newspapers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/job-rackets-on-the-rise-police/article32756477.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK’s ‘people’s sabha’ passes resolution against farm legislation||A “people’s sabha” organised by the DMK in Tiruvallur on Friday, in which DMK president M.K. Stalin took part, despite the State government cancelling grama sabhas, passed a resolution condemning the three farm Acts, and demanded that they be repealed. The DMK will continue its fight against the Acts, he said. Speaking at the event, Mr. Stalin termed the meeting “people’s sabha”, and questioned why the government had announced the cancellation of grama sabhas. “When the ruling AIADMK can hold its executive committee meeting and the Chief Minister can go on a tour across the State, should grama sabhas not be held?” he asked. He asked whether the AIADMK wanted the DMK not to do anything. “Is that their agenda? Are they extending the lockdown to stop DMK?” he questioned. Mr. Stalin said the Acts would impose online trade and make farmers slaves to contract farming, with no minimum support price. The prices of goods would go up, threatening the public distribution system. We don’t know if ration shops would function, he added. Acts condemned “The grama sabha, held as the ‘people’s sabha’ passes this resolution, condemning the three farm Acts. We are holding this meeting to save agriculture, which is the backbone of villages, and to ensure the welfare of agriculturalists and farmers. This meeting passes a unilateral resolution demanding that the three farm Acts be repealed,” Mr. Stalin said. AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran too condemned the AIADMK government for calling off the grama sabhas, originally scheduled to take place on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanthi. In a series of tweets, he said grama sabhas were an opportunity to discuss welfare issues in rural areas. CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan termed the abrupt cancellation of grama sabhas “undemocratic” and condemned the action of the State government. In a brief interaction with reporters in Tiruchi, he said grama sabhas were crucial to grassroots democracy. The government had, all of a sudden, on Thursday night, announced the cancellation of grama sabhas, after Mr. Stalin made an appeal to the people to pass resolutions against the new farms Acts, he added. Cases registered The Tiruvallur police have registered a case against Mr. Stalin, Poonamalee MLA A. Krishnaswamy, Tiruvallur MLA V. G. Raajendran and close to 150 other DMK cadre for violating lockdown norms and holding meetings. In Vellore, cases have been booked against DMK general secretary S. Duraimurugan, Vellore MP D.M. Kathiranand and 200 others. DMK MLAs and cadre in Ranipet and Tirupathur too were booked for holding meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmks-peoples-sabha-passes-resolution-against-farm-legislation/article32756446.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu witnesses shortfall in realisation of Cauvery water share||After two successive years of excess realisation of its share of Cauvery water during the crucial southwest monsoon (June-September), Tamil Nadu ended this year’s season with a deficit. Against a prescribed quantity of 123.14 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) for the period, the State got 120.24 tmc ft, marking a shortfall of 2.895 tmc ft. What is significant is that at the beginning of September, the cumulative shortfall for the season was around 11.3 tmc ft, which has come down since. Of the total quantity received this year, about 103 tmc ft was realised by the State in August and September. A significant pattern A perusal of data on the inflow of Cauvery water in the last 10 years reveals a striking feature, which has been a pattern for the last 30 years. In six of the last 10 years, the State got less than its share of Cauvery water. Since 1991, there have been 19 such years when Tamil Nadu realised less than its share of water during June-September, as stipulated by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal in its interim (1991) and final (2007) orders and by the Supreme Court in February 2018. According to the tribunal’s interim order, of an overall annual quantity of 205 tmc ft, 137 tmc ft was to be received by Tamil Nadu during June-September.

03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court depolores increasing incidents of rape||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Inspector General of Police (West Zone) to monitor the investigation into allegations of a 22-year-old migrant labourer having been gang-raped at Palladam in Tiruppur district. Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugam issued the direction following an application moved by advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam who also sought provision of food, shelter, medical aid and monetary compensation to the survivor. Referring to the recent Hathras gang-rape incident in Uttar Pradesh and other similar crimes, the senior judge in the Division Bench expressed anguish over many incidents of rape and gang-rape being reported in the “spiritual land.” The judge referred to a study, which claimed that the statistics were so alarming that it accounted to one woman or girl getting raped in the country every 15 minutes, and said: “It is very unfortunate. There’s no security for women.” The sub-application seeking assistance to the Palladam rape survivor was filed in a habeas corpus petition that was already pending in the court. In the HCP, the court had sought details regarding the protection provided to migrant labourers by the Centre and the State government. After Justice Velmurugan insisted that the State government should ensure that migrant labourers do not get exploited by employers, the Bench passed an order directing the government to disclose steps taken in that direction. Mr. Suryaprakasam told the court that, apart from numerous problems such as meagre pay and lack of access to even basic amenities, women migrant labourers also end up being easy targets for “sexual predators” who indulge in brutal acts. Finding force in his submission, the judges directed the police to ensure that the culprits in the Palladam rape case were brought to book.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-depolores-increasing-incidents-of-rape/article32757208.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State’s own revenue shows positive growth||Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure, excluding borrowings) stood at Rs. 2,605.34 crore in July. The State’s own revenue has shown a positive growth for the month. This takes the fiscal deficit to Rs. 21,833.48 crore in fiscal 2020-21 (till July), according to provisional figures of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). The State’s total receipts (including State’s own tax revenue and share of Central Taxes, among others, and excluding borrowings) grew by about 19.4% to Rs. 14,041.25 crore in July from Rs. 11,756.98 crore in the same period last year. The State’s own tax revenue grew by about 8% to Rs. 8,387.23 crore in July from Rs. 7,765.15 crore in the same period last year. Within the State’s own tax revenue (SOTR), State Goods and Service Tax (SGST) grew by 27% to Rs. 2,997.84 crore in July from Rs. 2,360.40 crore in July 2019. Another SOTR component, State Excise Duties (which reflects liquor revenue), grew by about 18.5% to Rs. 696.57 crore in July from Rs. 587.65 crore in July 2019, while sales tax (which includes VAT on petrol, diesel and liquor) increased to Rs. 4,013.21 crore from Rs. 3,820.27 crore. Registration Fees A major component to see a decline in SOTR was stamps and registration fees, which declined by 31.8% to Rs. 667.04 crore in July from Rs. 977.53 crore in July 2019. The State’s share of Union taxes increased by about 8.4% to Rs. 1,757.96 crore in July from Rs. 1,622.04 crore in July 2019. One of the things that has helped the total receipts is the early release of grants-in-aid by the Central government. The grants-in-aid jumped to Rs. 2,989.30 crore in July from Rs. 967.64 crore in July 2019. The State’s total expenditure stood at Rs. 16,646.59 crore with revenue expenditure at Rs. 14,894.48 crore in July. Under compilation However, some of the components of revenue expenditure, like expenses on salaries and wages and subsidies, are still under compilation, the CAG said. Capital expenditure, which goes into infrastructure and other developmental projects, increased by about 24.5% to Rs. 1,622.91 crore in July from Rs. 1,303.83 crore in July 2019. One of the key challenges for States, including Tamil Nadu, has been the increasing expenditure amid the pandemic and a challenging revenue situation. COVID-19 situation The Legislative Assembly recently passed the first supplementary budget estimates, amounting to Rs. 12,845.20 crore for 2020-21, with over 70% or Rs. 9,027.08 crore provided for COVID-19-related expenditure. This is in addition to the total expenditure of Rs. 3,00,390 crore, estimated in the budget for 2020-21. Tamil Nadu has, so far, borrowed Rs. 48,000 crore in the first half of 2020-21 (April-September 2020), making it the second biggest borrower after Maharashtra.  Capital expenditure, which goes into infrastructure and other developmental projects, increased by about 24.5% to Rs. 1,622.91 crore in July, from Rs. 1,303.83 crore in July 2019||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-own-revenue-shows-positive-growth/article32756449.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Six arrested on charges of cheating woman in Chennai||The Nolambur police on Friday arrested six persons, including three women, for allegedly attempting to sell a site to a woman by impersonating the original owner and producing forged documents at a sub-registrar’s office. According to the police, V. Rajeshwari, 31, of West Mogappair, approached real estate broker Purushothaman, 60, of Nolambur and his associate Rajesh, 37, of Manali, for buying a site in the city. The agents showed her a site, measuring 640 sq ft, and also copies of documents belonging to Rajam in Mogappair West. They finalised Rs. 48 lakh as the price for the site and Ms. Rajeshwari paid Rs. 15 lakh to the duo. The agents brought a woman impersonating the original owner to the sub-registrar office in Ambattur on Thursday for registration. Alert staff On verification, the staff at the sub-registrar’s office told the buyer that the documents were forged.

03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||QR code billing will be implemented in Metro station parking lots soon||Commuters will soon be able to use QR code tickets to pay for parking charges in the city’s Metro stations. Currently, the tickets can only be used for travel. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), the recently launched QR code tickets have been gradually picking up and in the last month, 13,044 passengers have used them. From about 300-350 a day, the number of users had marginally increased to 700-750, officials said. Since CMRL offers a discount of 20% for these tickets, its popularity has been growing among commuters. “We are trying to put this facility in place in parking lots as soon as possible. Perhaps, it will be implemented within six months. It will be very convenient for passengers to just scan the code and leave without hassle,” an official said. Smart card problems Sources said passengers who park their vehicles had to separately buy a smart card now to pay. “Sometimes, in a few stations, the staff do not have pre-issued smart cards in the parking lot. So, if a passenger used a QR code ticket for travel, he has to leave the vehicle, walk all the way till the concourse and return to the parking lot to pay. This should be resolved soon,” another official said. While the number of takers for QR code ticketing is picking up, there are still issues that CMRL grapples with as far as the system is concerned, including gate scanners not registering them properly and leaving commuters stuck behind the barricade. Officials said they were working to resolve the issues at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/qr-code-billing-will-be-implemented-in-metro-station-parking-lots-soon/article32756970.ece

The cyber crime cell of Pulianthope nabbed Rajendran, 42, of Kalyan Nagar, West Tambaram, on a complaint received from Indira Prakash of Pulianthope and her six friends, who were all his victims.

They set up a mobile kiosk near the Stanley Medical College and Hospital, and started distributing food packets. Juzer Rangoonwala, a coordinator of ZHS and Project Rise Chapter in Chennai, said they initially started this in a small way during the lockdown and then continued giving away 200-250 food packets a day from April till June. “Our volunteers, who went to the field, told us about how desperate and starved people were then. We decided to go ahead with the drive for those three months. Now, we want to continue doing it and have set up this mobile kiosk,” he said. The food is cooked in two community kitchens at Parry’s Corner and nearly 50 volunteers distribute them. Mobile kiosks will be extended to other areas like Royapuram and Parrys soon. “One clear instruction given to volunteers is to step in only after wearing a mask and gloves. We also ask them to ensure that those who come to collect the packets stand at an adequate distance from each other,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mobile-food-distribution-kiosk-set-up-at-stanley/article32756966.ece
03 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||India should never become police State: HC||“India should never become a police State,” Justice P.N. Prakash of the Madras High Court has said, disagreeing with powers conferred by the State government on police officers to imprison those who breach bonds executed under Section 117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) to keep peace and maintain good behaviour. The judge held that two Government Orders (GOs), issued in 2013 and 2014 authorising Deputy Commissioners of Police across the State to perform the functions of an Executive Magistrate under the Cr.P.C., were illegal since they were directly in violation of Section 6 of the District Police Act enacted during colonial rule in 1859. Pointing out that even the British Raj had made confessions made to the police as irrelevant and inadmissible, save only for proving the discovery of a fact, and that the Colonial rulers were against conferring judicial powers on the police, the judge said: “What the Raj loathed to do, the Indian State now does with the least compunction.” Justice Prakash stated that the police could not say that it would become impossible to maintain law and order in the State without they being given the power to obtain bonds of good behaviour from habitual offenders and send them to prison in case of a breach. “Rule of law cannot be sacrificed at the altar of expediency,” he observed. The judge also suggested that the State government could follow the detailed guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in the famous Prakash Singh case in 2006. He impressed on the need to repeal all colonial police laws in vogue and replace them with new enactments aimed at making the State police force thoroughly professional and independent.  He also referred his decision to a Division Bench for an authoritative pronouncement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/india-should-never-become-police-state-hc/article32756979.ece

03 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Proposal to replace traffic signals awaits State government’s nod||Once the proposal to replace the 51 traffic signals within Coimbatore City Police limits is approved by the State Government, the maintenance of the signals will improve, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu. Mr. Mutharasu told The Hindu the proposal worth Rs. 4.82 crore was sent by Commissioner of Police Sumit Sharan to the State government in November 2019 and is expected to be approved in the next few months. “We will have a five-year maintenance contract with the firm that will erect traffic signals,” he said. The traffic signals will be designed with the latest technology available at the time of the proposal’s sanction, according to Mr. Mutharasu. Coimbatore City Police will also be paying the electricity bills for all the traffic signals once the proposal is sanctioned, he said. After the Madras High Court directed the State government in 2017 that permission should not be granted for installation of advertisement boards at traffic signal posts, various private firms that were maintaining the signals stopped paying electricity bills. The functioning of the traffic signals was ensured after the traffic police approached Tangedco for a temporary arrangement, he said. Mr. Muthurasu noted that the road safety initiative ‘Uyir’ will be maintaining the 51 traffic signals till the sanction of the proposal. The initiative has so far erected and maintained 11 traffic signals apart from the existing 51 signals in the Coimbatore City Police limits, he said. ‘No dept. entrusted’ Regarding complaints of poor maintenance of traffic signals, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause K. Kathirmathiyon noted that the State government has not entrusted any government department with maintenance and bill payments of the signals. “No government order has been issued in this regard yet,” he said. Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that he wrote to the State government on September 24 requesting to provide adequate funds to a particular department for the erection, electricity bill payment and maintenance of traffic signals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/proposal-to-replace-traffic-signals-awaits-state-governments-nod/article32756997.ece

At the end of the four-month season that starts in June, Coimbatore received 296 mm, which, according to the Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, was 41% more than season average of 210mm. The centre takes into account the last 30 years’ rainfall to arrive at the average, said its head S.P. Ramanathan. Of the total 296 mm, the district received 140.5 mm in September alone in 10 rainy days. The centre considers a day with over 2.5mm precipitation as a rainy day. The rainfall in June was 22.5 mm, July 83.5 mm and August 49.5 mm. Last year, the district had received 221.3 mm rain on seven rainy days in August. This year too the district had seven rainy days but the rainfall was nowhere close to that of last year. In western Tamil Nadu, the Nilgiris, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts had all received more than the average rainfall. Tiruppur had a very good SW Monsoon season as it had received 141% more than its average; it had recorded 309.7mm as against the average of 128.4 The Nilgiris too had received good rain during the season – 1,360mm as against 832.7mm.

03 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Add-on Ayurveda drugs help in optimal immune modulations||A recently concluded clinical study on the integration of Ayurveda into the management of COVID-19 has found that add-on medication of certain non-patented classical Ayurveda medicines generated the optimal immune system modulations in high-risk patients with diabetes. The interim analysis of the study found that patients who were under the add-on Ayurveda medication, along with the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment, exhibited optimal modulation of interleukin 6 (IL6) in reaction to SARS-CoV-2 than those who were under the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment alone. IL6 is a cytokine or a category of small proteins that regulates the immune system in the body with its pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Key biomarker “The add-on Ayurveda group exhibited IL6 cytokine modulation within seven days of treatment, which is a key biomarker indicating the progress of severity. The integrative care seems to be showing comparative earlier viral clearance. The study also explored the possibility of toxicity due to drug-to-drug interaction, if any, and found that there was no liver and kidney toxicity due to the administration of add-on Ayurveda therapy along with the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment,” said Somit Kumar, principal investigator of the study. It was done by AVP Research Foundation, Coimbatore, and Stanley Medical College, Chennai, with funding from the Union Ministry of AYUSH and supported by the Tamil Nadu Health Department. According to investigators, 51 COVID-19 patients with a history of diabetes completed the clinical study registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India. While 27 patients went through the add-on Ayurveda treatment along with the ICMR-recommended treatment, 24 patients had standalone ICMR-recommended treatment. The youngest patient was aged 34 and the oldest 75. The last patient was discharged on August 30. Improving host response “The focus of the add-on Ayurveda group was on improving the host response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, where the treatment would modulate the immune response to act optimal to fight the infection, while at the same time not going haywire to induce a ‘cytokine storm’, which is the major reason for death among patients,” Dr. Kumar said. “No patient from the add-on Ayurveda group required ICU admission, when one in the standalone treatment group had to be in intensive care. Both groups did not have any casualties,” said Sujith Eranezhath, another investigator. According to the study team, the protocol was based on a dozen classical Ayurveda non-patented medicines.  The study also explored the possibility of toxicity due to drug-to-drug interaction, if any, and found that there was no liver and kidney toxicity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/add-on-ayurveda-drugs-help-in-optimal-immune-modulations/article32756443.ece

03 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Gram sabha could have been held: Vanathi Srinivasan||Bharatiya Janata Party State vice-president Vanathi Srinivasan said here on Friday that the government could have held the gram sabhas by ensuring personal distancing norms. Speaking to mediapersons after garlanding Mahatma Gandhi’s statue on Vysial Street here, she said the calling off of the gram sabhas was unnecessary as the spread of COVID-19 was low in rural areas. Gram sabhas would have been an opportunity for the public to learn about the three new Acts on agriculture reforms, she claimed. Regarding the DMK’s call to pass a resolution against the Acts at the meetings, Ms. Srinivasan said it would not have had any impact on the public. The leadership tussle in the AIADMK as an “internal problem” and the BJP would not intervene in it, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gram-sabha-could-have-been-held-vanathi-srinivasan/article32756989.ece

03 October 2020||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||Kisan Sabha condemns cancellation of gram sabhas||The All India Kisan Sabha on Friday condemned the cancellation of gram sabhas dubbing it as an assault on the panchayati raj, guaranteed by the Constitution. In a statement, the All India Kisan Sabha has slammed the government for cancelling the conduct of the gram sabhas at the last minute on Thursday night. The meetings that were slated to be held on May 2 and August 15 were not held due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, it said. However, while the lockdown restrictions were relaxed, the government led by Edappadi K Palaniswami has at the eleventh hour cancelled the scheduled gram sabhas. The cancellation was a result of the government’s fear of farmers’ opposition to the farm legislations, the statement said. According to the AIKS, the AIADMK was party to the passage of the contentious farm bills in Parliament, and hence, feared the wrath of the farmers, who were poised to pass resolutions against the legislation in the meetings that were initially scheduled to be held on October 2. The cancellation of the gram sabhas allegedly following the DMK’s declaration that gram sabhas will adopt resolutions against the farm legislation has been condemned across the board. Meanwhile, DMK MLA T. Senguttuvan convened a “gram sabha” in Kangaleri Panchayat explaining the farm legislations and what it meant to the farmers and the reasons for the opposition to the legislations. Similar ‘sabhas’ were held in Hosur, Thally and Vepanapalli under the respective DMK MLAs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kisan-sabha-condemns-cancellation-of-gram-sabhas/article32756495.ece
03 October 2020||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Onion prices skyrocket in Dindigul wholesale market||Despite the ban on exports, onion prices touched a new high at the wholesale market here on Thursday. The district, which is known as the biggest market for onion varieties, attributed the high prices to poor arrivals. Apart from merchants from Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchi who procure onions and shallots from here, the onions are also exported to Singapore, Sri Lanka and Indonesia by some of the merchants here. Due to COVID-19 and the curfew imposed by the governments, trading activity had come to a standstill since March. When the governments relaxed the guidelines and lifted the curfew, onions could not be procured from Karnataka due to heavy rains there, said Marimuthu, deputy secretary of the Dindigul Mandi and Commission Agents Association. He said that rains had destroyed many onion farms in Karnataka. The market here, which usually receives 10 truck loads of shallots and 4,000 kilos of onions (big) on alternate days was now seeing very poor arrivals. “Hardly four trucks have arrived in the last three days. The Bellary variety, which is one of the fast moving commodities, was being quoted at very high price and not many wholesale merchants were not keen on procuring that,” he added. With the prices now revolving at Rs. 65 to Rs. 80 per kg here, it may soon touch the three digit figure in the market, merchants apprehend citing the heavy rains in Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/onion-prices-skyrocket-in-dindigul-wholesale-market/article32756471.ece

Periasami said that the DMK would stand by the farmers. Speaking at the gram sabha meeting organised by the DMK at Veerasikkampatti village in Athur Union here on Friday, he said that the State government had ignored the farmers’ interest and charged that they were interested only in their political future. The Centre, which was more worried about the survival of select corporate houses, had pledged the interests of the farmers. The next step by the Centre was to lift the free power, which was now in vogue to the farmers, when the elections get over in Tamil Nadu, he claimed.

Her application should have been considered swiftly by the authorities concerned, the court said. This kind of long delay could have been avoided, the judge said and directed the Centre to consider her application and pass necessary orders sanctioning the Freedom Fighter’s Dependent Pension under the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme.

After 10 months of the regraft, the patient can work independently. Head of the Department of Ophthalmology U. Vijaya Shanmugam, who had led a team of doctors in performing the transplant, said the patient had undergone a corneal transplant in a private hospital 10 months back and then approached the GRH. “When we diagnosed the patient, it was found that he had congenital aniridia and he only had light perception,” said Dr. Vijaya Shanmugam. The patient was found suitable to undergo another corneal transplant. So, regrafting was done with the cornea retrieved from a young victim who had died in a road accident. The victim had donated his eyes to the GRH under the Hospital Corneal Retrieval Programme (HCRP). The corneal transplant was successfully completed. “Today, the patient has crossed the risky period of graft rejection and he can work independently,” he added. A press release from the GRH Dean J. Sangumani said that this was a challenging case and congratulated the doctors for the surgery. The Eye Department had state-of-the-art health facilities for diagnosis and treatment of all types of eye disorders free of cost, according to the release.

Disposing of a batch of petitions, Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that the government order may indicate or prescribe the educational qualifications of only or the maximum of up to Higher Secondary for engaging candidates. Highly qualified people having professional degrees, graduation and postgraduation degrees shall be avoided, the court said. Though there was no express provision prohibiting engaging a highly qualified person in an NMR job or as an NMR employee, such kind of engagement cannot be encouraged. This kind of irregular entry into a government job, even at the level of an NMR job, is a plan to grab the government job, the court said. The court was hearing the petitions that sought a direction to permit the petitioners to continue as NMR employees in the Public Works Department. During the course of the hearing the PWD informed the court that NMR employees would be engaged by the department only in certain places. These include the official and private residences of High Court Judges in Chennai and Madurai, official residence of the Chief Minister, official and private residences of State government Ministers, official residences of Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chief Whip and other dignitaries in the government bungalow at Raja Annamalaipuram, Chennai. Taking into account the submission, the High Court observed that in future if at all the government wants to engage NMR employees for emergency or in exigencies, no direct engagement shall be made and suitable candidates can be engaged from the employment exchange concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prescribe-qualification-for-engaging-nmr-employees-hc/article32756511.ece

03 October 2020||RANIPET,TAMIL NADU||A movement for an agile, fit police force||Fitness has taken a hit among policemen, especially after the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic. To make the police force more fit and agile, Ranipet Superintendent of Police P.A. Myilvaganan has started a “Fit-Police Movement” in the district. A gym has been set up in the Arcot town police station and one more is coming up at the Wallajah station. Policemen and women are encouraged to work out daily and eat nutritious food and shed weight. Every month, their body mass index (BMI) is checked. Mr. Myilvaganan conducted a health camp for over 750 police personnel in the district last month. “Of them, around 370 had BMI above 25. Ideally, it should be below 18. Some of them were obese, and some had co-morbidities. I was concerned about their health. So I decided to start the fitness movement,” the SP said. The police personnel were provided a diet chart by a qualified nutritionist and a WhatsApp group was started to share daily workout videos. “Their BMI was checked again on Friday. As many as 27 people had lost between 3 kg to 8 kg. We will conduct the check-up every month. The policemen can take to walking, jogging or weight training in the morning. They should be active. Food should be consumed in moderation,” he said. One common excuse of policemen for neglecting their fitness is lack of time. “Even I used to give the same excuse. But if we have to achieve something, we have to steal time for ourselves. Now, all of us have started working out,” said T. Mukesh Kumar, Ranipet traffic inspector. He said after he started working out, he felt more active and experienced less fatigue despite long hours of duty. “The gym in the Arcot police station has different pictures of workouts that motivate policemen. It has modern equipment too,” said Mr. Mukesh. M. Muthurani, a constable in the Arcot Town station with 13 years of service, said she was a district-level kabaddi player in her college days. “I have shed a few kilos. I feel very fit. After the gym was started here, workout has become easier. My husband J.N. Saravanan is a police constable in Timiri police station. We take some time off for workout,” she said. The policemen in the district are vying for a prize for the person who shows good improvement in his health. “It is a big motivation for us,” said Mr. Mukesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-movement-for-an-agile-fit-police-force-in-ranipet/article32756416.ece

03 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Thanjavur medical college lab completes two lakh tests||The microbiology laboratory at Thanjavur Medical College Hospital on Thursday completed the processing of two lakh COVID 19 tests. The district administration, with the help of the doctors at the TMCH, has increased the number of samples lifted to 2,500 a day. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) granted approval to TMCH to conduct COVID-19 testing on April 13. While many other medical colleges already had Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) machines on hand, the TMCH had to set up a lab, equipped with the machines, and rapid RNA extractors. “The cost of setting up a fully-equipped lab was around Rs. 1 crore,” said Dean S. Maruthudurai. Until April 13, the samples were sent to Tiruvarur for processing. Meanwhile, the TMCH has also increased its test processing capacity. “We had been processing 2,000 samples a day, but we have scaled up the capacity to 2,500 to 2,800,” Dr. Maruthudurai said. The district administration is shifting its focus to testing pockets and clusters where patients have already tested positive and thereby keeping a check on transmission of the viral infection, he said. Positivity rate in the district was an average of 5.8 to 6%, while the death rate was 1.3%. A team of 17 technicians, six house surgeons, seven assistant professors and one associate professor man the microbiology lab round-the-clock. “We aim to provide reports for the viral infection within 48 hours,” he said. Of the two lakh samples processed, 80% are patients hailing from Thanjavur district, Dr. Maruthudurai said. “Initially we received samples from Ariyalur, Perambalur and Pudukottai, but the State government has scaled up the number of laboratories at medical college hospitals, and since July, we have been processing only samples lifted in Thanjavur,” he said. The hospital has 1,060 beds, and preparation is under way to set up another 300. Dr. Maruthudurai said the aim was to reduce the positivity rate to 5%, death rate to 1% and absolute numbers to below 100 by October-end.

03 October 2020||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Mechanised boat, insulated truck destroyed in fire||A mechanised boat with fishnets, worth over Rs. 1 crore, was completely destroyed as fire broke out in the vessel after a LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinder inside the boat burst even as the crew were preparing lunch at Tharuvaikulam Fishing Harbour around Friday noon. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident. Tharuvaikulam Fishing Harbour, base for 128 mechanised boats involved in multi-day deep sea fishing and around 350 country boats, was abuzz with activities on Friday, as boats in batches were resuming fishing operations from Wednesday onwards after berthing the vessels for celebrating the coastal hamlet’s 10-day-long St. Michael’s Church annual feast that ended on last Tuesday (September 29). Even as the crew of the moored mechanised fiberglass boat, owned by S. Antony Raj, 50, of 60 Veedu Colony in Tharuvaikulam, were preparing lunch in the kitchen beneath the wheelhouse after loading provisions – 500 ice bars and 2,500 litres of fuel – all required for the 2-week-long deep sea stay fishing, fire apparently broke out due to a damaged tube of the LPG cylinder, usually used for cooking in the boats even in high seas. Though, the crew managed to come out of the boat immediately, fire engulfed the vessel within no time. Aided by a strong sea breeze, fire spread to other parts of the boat. When the LPG cylinder exploded, fire spread to an insulated truck, owned by K. Dominic, 47, of Manickapuram in Thoothukudi, which had brought ice bars to the boats as it had been parked just a few feet away from the boat. “Though the fire spread to the boats berthed next to this ill-fated vessel, people in the fishing harbour doused it immediately with seawater. A couple of boat drivers, who were in the fishing harbour to board their vessels to resume fishing operations, courageously entered the violently burning boat with ropes so as to tow it into the sea with another boat in a bid to save other vessels from the mishap,” said A. Aniton, a witness to the mishap. Meanwhile, two fire tenders from Thoothukudi Fire Station, on getting the call around noon, arrived at the spot to start firefighting operations. “Even as the burning vessel was being towed by a boat to a safer distance, the rope got snapped. Undeterred by this challenge, a few youths dived into the sea with another rope to tie it to the propeller to bring the badly damaged boat closer to shores on the southern side of the fishing harbor as 300-odd country boats were anchored on the northern side. As the boat was towed closer to the shores, the firefighters doused the flame completely after a 3-hour-long battle,” said Manoharan, a fish exporter who was present at the fishing harbour. The police, fire and rescue services and the fisheries departments are probing the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/boat-gutted/article32757194.ece
03 October 2020||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Oppose Farm Acts: Kanimozhi||DMK MP Kanimozhi participated in the special gram sabha meeting organised by the party at Idaichchivilai near Sattankulam in the district on Friday to distribute relief materials to the poor and explain about the “anti-farmers features” of the recently introduced Farm Acts by the Centre. Ms. Kanimozhi said the State Government, citing the pandemic-related restrictions, had cancelled the gram sabha meetings even as the DMK had appealed to the agriculturists to raise questions over the Farm Acts, which was passed in the Parliament without any debate. “Since the amends will help only the corporate firms, the farmers, who will be forced to enter agreements with these companies promising them to sell their produce at the price fixed by the buyer, should oppose it vehemently until they were withdrawn. Even after a Central Minister resigned her post in protest, the Tamil Nadu Government supports it,” said Ms. Kanimozhi who distributed relief materials to 1,000 beneficiaries. Tiruchendur MLA Anita R. Radhakrishnan was present. Dindigul Appealing to the farmers to oppose the Centre on the recent amendments made in the Farm Acts, which was hurriedly sent to the President and enacted as a Law, the DMK deputy general secretary I. Periasami said that the DMK would stand by the farmers. Speaking at the gram sabha meeting organised by the DMK at Veerasikkampatti village in Athur Union here on Friday, he said that the State government had ignored the farmers’ interest and charged that they were interested only in their political future. The Centre, which was more worried about the survival of select corporate houses, had pledged the interests of the farmers. The next step by the Centre was to lift the free power, which was now in vogue to the farmers, when the elections get over in Tamil Nadu, he claimed. Ramanathapuram In Anaiyur village, Kamudi taluk in the district, the DMK, led by Kadher Basha Muthuramalingam, Kamudi panchayat union chairman Tamilselvi, Anayur panchayat president Kavadi Murugan and among others participated at the gram sabha meeting. The speakers wanted the villagers to be aware of the Farm Acts enacted by the Centre and urged to pass resolutions against it. However, when reporters approached the district authorities, they said that the government had cancelled the gram sabha meetings due to COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, such meetings would be declared null and void, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oppose-farm-acts-kanimozhi/article32757206.ece
03 October 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||ASI to focus on lesser known monuments||A new administrative circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), with jurisdiction over 20 central and southern districts of the State, came into existence in Tiruchi on Thursday. The Tiruchi Circle, created on bifurcation of the ASI’s Chennai Circle, will have 162 monuments and sites under its control. It was one of the seven new circles of the ASI created across the country to improve management of monuments by the Union Ministry of Culture. The erstwhile office of the Tiruchi Sub-Circle, situated right behind the Mainguard Gate, a heritage monument, would function as the Circle office temporarily. T.Arun Raj, who took charge as the first Superintending Archaeologist of the circle, said a more spacious building for the circle would be identified soon in consultation with the district administration. Speaking to The Hindu , Dr.Raj said the circle would get more officers, including technical staff, in the near future in proportion to the number of monuments and sites under its control. “While preserving world heritage monuments such as the Brihadeesvara temples at Thanjavur will be the priority, importance will also given to protect lesser known monuments, especially in Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Tirunelveli districts. Loose sculptures would be strengthened, fenced and documented,” he said. Dr. Raj said that he would soon write to the Collectors and police officers in the districts under his jurisdiction on the importance of protecting heritage structures and preventing encroachments. He would strive to revive district-level heritage committees, with heritage enthusiasts and district officials as members, to take up initiatives to safeguard unprotected monuments. He also plans to develop an app wherein local residents can upload pictures of sculptures and idols of lesser known sites and temples so that they serve as a repository of digital records. It could help prevent theft of idols and in easy identification/tracing in case of thefts. Earlier, speaking at a brief ceremony after taking charge, Dr. Raj underlined the need to protect monuments and heritage structures by involving local communities. “We will try to raise awareness on the importance of protecting heritage structures and sites through various programmes,” he said. The scope for roping in local industries in conservation efforts under public-private partnership mode would also be explored,he added. S. Rajavelu, Adjunct Faculty, Department of History, Alagappa University, said the creation of the new circle was a dream come true as the Chola belt has a large number of temples and heritage sites, many of which were not properly maintained. There is also scope for carrying out excavations along the Cauvery banks, he said. Arockiasamy Xavier, Principal, St. Joseph’s College, said the institution would soon sign MoUs to work in close coordination with the ASI. Responding to a suggestion from A. Manikandan, a heritage enthusiast from Pudukottai, Dr.Raj agreed to explore the feasibility of organising heritage tours in the region. V. P. Yathees Kumar and V. Muthukumar, Assistant Archaeologists, S. Sankar, Conservation Assistant, ASI, and P. Vasudevan, former Assistant Superintending Engineer, ASI, also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/asi-to-focus-on-lesser-known-monuments/article32757205.ece

03 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Cancellation of gram sabha meetings invites criticism||Cancellation of gram sabha meetings scheduled to be held on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanthi on Friday came in for widespread criticism from farmers’ organisations and the Opposition. Members of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam conducted an unofficial gram sabha meetings in some of the villages in the central region and claimed to have adopted resolutions against the three Acts on agriculture reforms. In Tiruchi, former Minister and DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru participated in village meetings at Alundur and Mullikarumbur and highlighted the “adverse impact” that the three legislations would have on agriculture and farmers. The Acts would lead to corporatisation of agriculture. The State government had cancelled the meetings only to thwart attempts to adopt resolutions against the farm Acts, he said. A section of DMK cadre and farmers staged protests at a couple of places in Tiruvarur district against the cancellation of the meetings and the three farm Acts. In Thanjavur, DMK office-bearers conducted meetings in some panchayats to explain the “adverse effects” that the farm Acts would have on agriculture. MLAs and elected representatives of local bodies participated in such meetings held in various villages in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and other districts in the central region. Meanwhile, P.R. Pandian, president, Tamil Nadu All Farmers Associations Coordination Committee, strongly condemned the State government’s decision to cancel the gram sabha meetings at the last minute when farmers had planned to move resolutions against the Centre’s three Acts on agriculture reforms. Speaking to reporters at Irulnikki in Tiruvarur district, Mr. Pandian alleged that the State had resorted to the move at the instigation of the Union government, fearing the adoption of resolutions at the gram sabhas as the new legislations had been challenged in the Supreme Court. The move was nothing but an attempt to stifle voices of farmers. The cancellation of meetings on Gandhi Jayanthi would only temporarily delay the adoption of resolutions against the farm Acts in the democratically-empowered gram sabhas, he said.

03 October 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Thoothukudi airport gets additional power back up||Work on installing two 625 KV diesel generators at Thoothukudi airport, which is being expanded to handle bigger aircraft even at night and additional number of passengers, commenced recently. The Thoothukudi airport, which is being presently served with a 70 KV generator, is badly in need of additional power back up facilities with higher capacity as the aerodrome’s runway is being expanded to handle wide-bodied aircrafts even after dusk and consequently, more number of passengers. Since the airport has been equipped with night landing facility, need for having additional power generators with higher capacity was underlined during the recently-held meetings of Airports Authority of India. Consequently, 2 X 625 KV generators are to be installed before March 2021 on an outlay of Rs. 1.16 crore as it will be handy for keeping the airport terminal and the runway operational even at night and even during acute power shortage. While one of these two generators will be in use, the remaining one will be on standby mode.

In a letter to the Minister, Mr. Vaiko said he had received SOS from 106 employees of a Kuwait-based construction company, who were stranded in a dingy room in the Middle East country after the employer refused to give them their salary and renew their work permit and visas. Since they were not paid their salary since June last even as their visas had expired, they could not move out of the place where they had been forcibly confined. “When we forwarded a letter to the Indian Embassy in Kuwait, the officials there asked us not to come to the Embassy in person in the wake of COVID-19 and hence we sent an e-mail explaining our ordeals. However, no action has been taken by the Indian Embassy officials to rescue us,” says a stranded worker in a video posted on social media. Hence, Mr. Vaiko, who has also forwarded this video to the External Affairs Minister, has appealed to Mr. Jaishankar to take immediate steps through the Indian Embassy in Kuwait to rescue the stranded workers, mostly from Tamil Nadu, and make efforts to get their salary arrears.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rescue-workers-vaiko/article32757054.ece

In a video circulated on social media on Friday, the patients were seen standing at the entrance of the centre on the premises of a private school on Kangeyam Road. One of the patients alleged in the video that the food was uncooked and the portion of food served to each patient was inadequate. The duty doctor at the centre said the patients were complaining about the food “for the past two days.” The supplier responsible for delivering the food was notified of this issue and the patients called off the protest within an hour, the doctor said. Tiruppur South Tahsildar P. Sundaram visited the centre on Friday evening to conduct an inquiry. The patients alleged that the vegetables in the meals were inadequate and the rice served was not completely cooked, he said. As the rasam served on Friday was not adequate for all the 77 patients in the centre, they decided to stage the demonstration, Mr. Sundaram said. “All these complaints are rectifiable,” he said, claiming that the issue would be resolved immediately. A report was submitted to Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan regarding the issue, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patients-stage-protest-at-siddha-covid-19-care-centre/article32756483.ece
03 October 2020||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||‘Good that gram sabhas were cancelled’||Given the rising COVID-19 cases, village panchayat presidents in Tiruppur district were largely appreciative of the State government’s decision to call off the gram sabhas that were to be held on Gandhi Jayanthi on Friday. President of Kavandachipudur panchayat president R. Selvi said that around 20 persons had tested positive for COVID-19 in her village panchayat. At least 200 persons would have come for the gram sabha, increasing risk of a further spread of the disease, she told The Hindu . Although these meetings were not held, petitions regarding basic facilities from all nine wards in the panchayat were received and action would be initiated, she said. Iduvai panchayat president K. Ganesan said the State government should have announced the cancellation at least two days ago, and not as late as Thursday evening. Conducting gram sabhas was vital to flagging people’s issues with the government, but the safety of the people was more important, he said, adding that nearly 30 persons had tested positive for COVID-19 in Iduvai village panchayat. Explore alternatives K.G. Inbarasan, general secretary of Institute of Grassroots Governance, which focuses on strengthening grassroots democracy, said the State government must explore alternative methods to conduct gram sabhas amid the pandemic. “Ward sabhas could be conducted instead of gram sabhas to ensure less crowding,” he said, giving the example of Odisha where such meetings were held at every ward of a village panchayat. Another option is to conduct virtual gram sabha meetings in village panchayats, he suggested.  Conducting gram sabha is vital to flag people’s issues with the government, but people’s safety is more important K.

03 October 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Trees preferred by vultures for nesting planted in MTR||A total of 160 trees, known to be preferred by vultures to build their nests, were planted in the Sigur Range in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on Friday. S. Bharathidasan, secretary of Arulagam, a conservation NGO that has been working on protecting the vulture population in the Sigur plateau, said the saplings of Terminalia arjuna , Terminalia bellerica , Spondias pinnata and Syzigium cumini were preferred by the vultures to build nests. “These trees grow tall, and as a result, elephants cannot knock off the nests from the top of the trees. They grow near the banks of rivers and streams and are resistant to forest fires as they are close to water sources,” said Mr. Bharathidasan. The planting was done by Arulagam with the guidance of the Forest Department and help from volunteers from the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam to mark the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the beginning of the Wildlife Week, which is celebrated every year between October 2 and 8. Mr. Bharathidasan said the Clean India Mission, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, has been gathering pace across the country. “But at the same time, cleanliness work inside forests is done effectively by vultures, who are very effective scavengers,” he said. He hoped that by linking the role of vultures in the ecosystem to the Clean India Mission, the negative connotations people have about vultures can be lifted. In a statement, K.K. Kaushal, Field Director of MTR, said the effort of the government and local communities in ensuring the protection of forests in Mudumalai was bearing fruit, as evidenced by the increase in the number of elephants and tigers in the reserve as well as across the country. Wildlife Week As part of the Wildlife Week celebration, the Forest Department will organise painting, quiz and elocution competitions for school and college students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trees-preferred-by-vultures-for-nesting-planted-in-mtr/article32757000.ece

Duraimurugan has said. Mr. Duraimurugan was addressing a “people’s sabha” that was organised by DMK members in Vandranthangal, near Katpadi, on Friday. “Now, private traders will start purchasing produce from farmers at a higher price and gradually no one will sell it to the government-run marketing committees, leading to their closure,” he said. “After this, the private traders will start quoting low prices and the farmers will have no other option but to sell it to them,” said Mr. Duraimurugan, citing how subscribers deserted BSNL while preferring private telecom players and brought the government-run telecom company to the brink of closure. Under threat The DMK leader said that even Uzhavar Sandhais (farmer market) would cease to exist. “There are many such flaws in the Act. When the DMK was in power we procured rice from farmers for Rs. 1,840 per quintal. In Kerala, the rate is Rs. 2,500 per quintal. A small state like Chhattisgarh gives Rs. 2,650 and Delhi, where rice production is less, the rate is Rs. 2,620. But today, in Tamil Nadu, there is nothing for farmers,” he said, adding that many farmers had met him and submitted petitions against the farm Acts. Residents of a few villages in Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai district took part in the “people’s sabha” on Friday and adopted a resolution against the farm Acts. “We just know that the Acts are harmful to farmers. Based on the directions of DMK president M.K. Stalin, we held meetings with personal distancing norms and passed a resolution against the Acts,” said D. Ravikumar, former panchayat president of Periyankuppam, Tirupathur district.

Addressing gram sabha meetings organised by the party at Kalkurichi and P. Pudupatti under Kariyapatti panchayat union here on Friday, he said the recently-enacted farm legislations would make farmers a slave under the corporates. “Vast extent of farm land has already been taken over by corporates to set up solar power plants in the district. Slowly, the extent of cultivation will shrink putting food security in peril,” he added. Similarly, the one nation, one ration scheme was against the State as Tamil Nadu was offering more goods, including free rice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/basic-rights-of-the-people-will-be-denied/article32756474.ece

In Coimbatore also, the party members who headed the Vellanaipatti Panchayat held a similar meeting. Both meetings condemned the three farm legislations brought in by the Central Government. Party sources in Tiruppur said Thurambadi panchayat president C. Shanmugam headed the meeting in which nearly 50 persons, comprising DMK functionaries and residents of Thurambadi, participated. The sources claimed that all COVID-19 precautionary measures -- wearing of masks, using hand sanitisers and physical distancing --were ensured at the meeting. When contacted, an official from the Tiruppur District Administration said on conditions of anonymity that this would not be considered a gram sabha. “Parties may conduct such meetings on their own, but the government has cancelled [grama sabha meetings],” he said, refusing to comment further. The meeting at Vellanaipatti Panchayat in S.S. Kulam Panchayat Union in Coimbatore passed a resolution condemning the Central Government for the legislations and the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the State for supporting these. Panchayat president Kavitha and vice-president V.R. Rajan passed the resolution in the presence of DMK’s Coimbatore urban west unit in-charge Payya Gounder alias R. Krishnan and S.S. Kulam union secretary S.P. Sureshkumar. Though the district administration on Thursday cancelled the gram sabhas citing the COVID-19 pandemic, the DMK asked its members to hold the meeting wherever possible, to pass resolutions against the farm legislations. Coimbatore district administration officials could not be reached for their comments on the panchayat holding a “gram sabha”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-holds-makkal-sabhai-in-tiruppur-district/article32756987.ece

03 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Congress lives by principles of Gandhiji’||“The Congress lives by the ideals and principles of Mahatma Gandhi. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a different hero. Gandhiji’s killer Nathuram Ghodse is their hero and icon,” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said in Ghataprabha on Friday. He was speaking to party cadres and leaders on the occasion of Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti at the N.S. Hardikar Seva Dal training academy set up in Ghataprabha. “Dividing society on communal lines and fostering hatred between Hindus and Muslims is the BJP’s only job. They have no positive agenda, nor any plans for all-round development. They are waiting to divide the society at every opportunity,” he said. He urged the cadre to imbibe the party’s values of inclusive development and ‘sarvodaya’. “There is no point is just wearing the party’s caps and badges, without attuning yourself to the party’s values,” he said. The BJP was appropriating leaders of the Congress and other freedom fighters as none of its leaders had participated in the Independence struggle, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar urged Congress workers to motivate farmers to write letters against the farm Acts passed by the Parliament. “AICC president Sonia Gandhi has said she would carry all the letters to President Ram Nath Kovind. We need to oppose these anti–farmer laws strongly,” he said. He said that he was very happy to be involved in the task of strengthening the Seva Dal, as it would help build the party’s cadre and to “take on the persistent efforts by the BJP to spread fake news against the party and its ideology”. There are three Seva Dal training centres in the State, in Belagavi, Udupi, and Bengaluru, and a fourth one would be set up. He said he would release Rs. 3 crore for the Ghataprabha academy. KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre said that his exposure to Seva Dal activities had forced him to stay back in India and work for the people, after his engineering degree. “After my degree, I had planned to go overseas. But I attended a Seva Dal camp which changed my mind. I decided to enter active politics,” he said. He said he would urge senior leaders to make Seva Dal training compulsory for those who want to enter the Congress. He said that democratic values of the country would be strengthened if the Congress was voted back to power. Satish Jarkiholi said he had sought the responsibility of training the party cadre. Seva Dal leader B.K. Hariprasad alleged that the BJP was trying to change the Constitution and take away all the liberties offered by it, and urged the cadre to fight against the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-lives-by-principles-of-gandhiji/article32756542.ece

He told journalists that he was close to the former minister as he was a senior party colleague. “Mr. Angadi, Jagadish Shettar, and myself made a formidable team of north Karnataka leaders in the party,” he said. “I consider his wife, Mangala, like my sister. We were neighbours and family friends in Gokak. She grew up along with my own sisters,” she said. He accused Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar of playing cheap politics over the death of the senior leader. “He [Mr. Shivakumar] is not a leader of any significance to make such statements. He should stop playing such petty politics,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Shivakumar had claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party had insulted Mr. Angadi’s memory by not bringing his mortal remains to Belagavi. He told journalists at Sambra airport that the BJP leaders should have allowed shifting the body to Belagavi and permitted his family members and followers to pay their last respects. “But this was not done. I think that it amounts to betrayal of a senior leader's family,” Mr. Shivakumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ramesh-jarkiholi-meets-family-members-of-suresh-angadi/article32756540.ece
03 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Kittur residents oppose university’s extended campus in Hire Bagewadi||The establishment of the extended campus of Rani Channamma University (RCU) has run into a hurdle with Kittur residents demanding that it be shifted to their hometown where the queen reigned in the 19th century. The State government had sanctioned government land for the university in Hire Bagewadi village, after the Centre refused to recognise the grant of land to the university in the Bhootaramanahatti forest range. Satish Jarkiholi, MLA, and Vice-Chancellor Rame Gowda have been maintaining that the RCU would retain its administrative headquarters in Bhootaramanahatti, while the academic sections would be shifted to the new location. However, this has not been accepted by some organisations from Kittur who demand that the institution should be established in Kittur. Madiwala Rajayogendra Swami of Kittur Kalmath, former zilla panchayat member Babasaheb Patil, Channamma Utsav committee president Basavaraj Chinagudi held a series of meetings to push for their demand. The seer also led a few protesters to the tahsildar’s office and urged all elected representatives to sign a petition that the university should be located in Kittur. Mr. Patil has alleged that Mahantesh Doddagoudar, MLA, had signed a petition asking the government to set up the university in Hire Bagewadi. RCU emerged from the satellite centre of the Karnatak University, Dharwad, that was set up in 1989. It ran into problems in 2017 when the Union government refused to provide retrospective approval to the grant of forest land by the State government. The Union Ministry of Forest and Ecology directed the State government “to relocate the university away from the 90 hectares of reserved forest land”. The arguments of the State government that it was degraded forest land without significant wildlife and that it was a government education institution without profit motive, and that civil construction would be undertaken with minimal damage to the flora and fauna were not accepted. Dr. Rame Gowda argued that UGC rules allow universities to have multiple campuses. RCU could easily have more than one campus, just as Delhi University has four campuses and Bombay University has three. Till recently, Bangalore University had two campuses. “We are looking forward to functioning from more than one campus,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kittur-residents-oppose-universitys-extended-campus-in-hire-bagewadi/article32756534.ece

Mr. Shivakumar said they would focus on strengthening the party from the grassroot level. He said that the Congress would organise State and divisional-level programmes in the bhavan. Laxmi Hebbalkar, MLA, urged party workers not to lose hope in the party’s strength. “We are the ideological descendants of Gandhiji. Our fight against fascist forces will continue,” she said. Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah urged party workers and leaders to take up people’s issues and participate in pro-people movements. He criticised the Uttar Pradesh police for booking cases against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for violating prohibitory orders. “That is a baseless charge. Mr. Rahul Gandhi was willing to walk alone to the victim’s house. But the police did not allow him,” he said. He said the U.P. government was anti-democratic. “It is a RSS government. It has no respect for democratic ideals,” he said. Later, Mr. Siddarmaiah told journalists that the Congress would not consider JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy’s statement about electoral alliances seriously. “I would like to ask him who had gone to him seeking an alliance? According to me, the JD(S) is not a political party at all,” he said. He said the party was yet to discuss the issue of choosing the party nominee for the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat. “The bypoll is yet to be declared. Issues related to them will be discussed later,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-bhavan-inaugurated-in-belagavi/article32756544.ece

03 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||BJP has lost moral right to rule U.P., says Siddaramaiah||The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has lost the moral right to rule the State, leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah said in Belagavi on Friday. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has failed to stop the rising atrocities on women and Dalits. He should resign immediately,” he said. He was speaking to journalists in Sambra airport when he arrived to open the Congress Bhavan in the city. “The U.P. police are behaving in a dictatorial manner. It seems as if the laws and rules of the country do not apply in U.P. Women, minorities, Dalits and backward classes are not safe there,” he said. “It is a literal jungle raj there,” he added. He took serious objections to the U.P. police allegedly pushing around Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and trying to stop him from meeting the rape victim’s family in Hathras. “He was not going to cause any problems to anyone. But the U.P. police stopped them. That is because they don’t want the people to know the failures of U.P. police,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-has-lost-moral-right-to-rule-up-says-siddaramaiah/article32756553.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vehicle registrations on the upswing||The Transport Department, which saw its revenue drop during the months that Bengaluru and other parts of the State were under lockdown on account of COVID-19, is finally showing signs of recovery. This is reflected in the registration of new vehicles, which increased by 440% across Karnataka from April to August. When lockdown rules were strictly in force, only 17,188 new vehicles were registered in April. This doubled in May to 37,851, but still remained low. However, registrations rose considerably to 92,291in June, and 93,847 in August. “In August, the department managed to achieve 78% of the revenue target fixed by the State government. Every month, we have a target of Rs. 551 crore,” said Transport Commissioner N. Shivkumar. He added that the revenue target achieved was 60% in July and 66% in June.” Data from the department shows that in the first 15 days of September, 40,818 vehicles were registered across Karnataka, including 30,377 two-wheelers and 5,852 cars. Mostly two-wheelers The bulk of the registrations are for two-wheelers. Between April and August, a total of 3.2 lakh new vehicles were registered in the State, out of which 2.47 lakh were two-wheelers and 41,289 were cars. Moreover, registration of new passenger transportation vehicles such as buses and taxis have remained considerably low. During this period, only 220 buses were registered. In May, not even one new bus was registered across Karnataka. “Usually, the number of vehicle registrations increases during festival season such as Dasara and Deepavali. We are hoping that the trend continues this year too,” said a department official. However, while revenue from registration is picking up, taxes collected from transport operators have remained low. Nataraj Sharma, general secretary of the Karnataka State Tourist Operators Association, said, “Every year, we used to pay Rs. 3,200 crore as tax to the exchequer. After the spread of the pandemic and non-cooperation by the State government, many operators decided to surrender the documents and not to operate the vehicles to minimise their losses.” He estimated that more than 35,000 buses have remained off the road. “Repeated pleas to waive the tax for six months were ignored. The government is doing nothing for the revival of our business. I think they are happy with the revenue collection they are getting from the newly registered vehicles,” he added. Recently, the State government took a decision to lower taxes applicable for contract carriage vehicles (having seating capacity of 13 to 20). The tax per seat was reduced from Rs. 900 to Rs. 700.  In August, the Transport Department managed to achieve 78% of the revenue target fixed by the State government. Every month, we have a target of Rs. 551 crore. N.

03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 tests in State cross 50 lakh||Karnataka’s COVID-19 tests crossed the 50 lakh mark on Friday even as the test positivity rate (TPR) continued to remain above 10% in at least 15 districts. From an average 80 tests a day in March, the State is now testing an average of over 80,000 samples a day. On Wednesday, the State tested an unprecedented 94,886 samples, taking the total number of tests to 49,01,083. This number further increased on Friday with 92,059 samples tested following which the total tests touched 50,89,730. The State ramped up its testing from May onwards. From 2,310 tests in March, the State conducted nearly 16 lakh tests in August. This further went up to nearly 20 lakh tests in September. The tests per million went up from 44,099 on September 1 to 72,541 on September 30. However, despite the high number of samples tested, experts say the State’s testing is yet to match the velocity of the virus. The State’s TPR on September 30 marginally increased to 12.3% from 11.8% on September 1. According to epidemiologists, a high TPR indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said increasing TPR indicates that the overall prevalence is on an upward trajectory. “It means the outbreak is expanding further and the State’s testing is not in pace with the spread,” he said. “It is not sufficient to simply increase the numbers. Whom we test and through which test (Rapid Antigen Test, RT-PCR) is as important. The need of the hour is to find people through syndromic approach (those with symptoms, comorbidities and elderly) and test them on priority. This will necessitate that all the RAT negative symptomatic persons will be tested using RT-PCR,” he said. Shalini Rajneesh, IAS official in charge of testing, said the State’s approach is certainly not on increasing numbers but on focussed testing. “We are testing the symptomatic, ILI, SARI emergency cases, and primary contacts through RAT as they have the highest infection possibility. Other secondary contacts, COVID warriors and super spreaders are tested regularly through RT-PCR,” she said. Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership which is analysing COVID-19 trends across the country, said in September that the incremental increase in number of testing is 19.8 lakh, a 65% jump over August. This is in line with mega States where the average increase of testing is around 65%. “However, the marginal increase in the TPR in September, indicates that in spite of best efforts of the State, the virus is spreading faster,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State COVID-19 task force, said there is need to further ramp up testing to not just prevent the spread of infection but ensure early intervention in sick patients. “We need to track patients at a moderately symptomatic stage for early admission and treatment. This is the key to reduce mortality,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-tests-in-state-cross-50-lakh/article32756549.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Murphy Town ground to be renovated||If everything goes as planned, residents and sports enthusiasts living in Murphy Town will get to enjoy a renovated corporation ground by Independence Day next year. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be undertaking work at the ground near Halusuru – popularly called Ambedkar playground – at an estimated cost of Rs. 7 crore. The ground is currently used by people and school children to play cricket, football and hockey, and even walking. School children also use the ground. Its renovation has been a long-pending demand, said residents. As part of the plan, the civic body will install proper drainage facilities, and build a sports complex with washrooms, dressing rooms, meeting rooms as well as a fitness centre. The renovation work was not without its share of controversy. According to sources, the initial plan was to convert the multi-sports ground into a football stadium with a commercial complex. This was vehemently opposed by residents who approached their MLA S. Raghu. After several meetings, locals were assured that the ground will not be converted into a stadium. “We have taken everyone into consideration. We have decided to do away with the commercial complex as insisted by the locals. The first phase of the work is expected to be completed by April 14 next year. All the works will be completed by August 15, 2021,” said Mr. Raghu. Not everyone is happy with this development. Many residents are worried about whether they will have access to the facilities when it is finally revamped, or whether it will be taken over by a private entity. Others pointed out that the fitness centre will eat into the actual playground. P. Muralidharan, general secretary, Murphy Town Football Club, said that they were worried that the playing area would be reduced. “We have requested the BBMP not to reduce the playing area. Secondly, a proper drain facility has to be built as the ground gets filled with water even after a mild shower when it rains,” he said, adding that they have also requested proper floodlights. The playground holds a special place for the community. “Many football and hockey clubs have events here. Over the years, it nurtured various football and hockey players who have represented the State at the national level,” said one resident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/murphy-town-ground-to-be-renovated/article32756937.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Southwest monsoon: 27% more rainfall in State||Marked by flooding and downpour in parts of Karnataka, this year’s monsoon season between June and September saw the State receiving 27% excess rainfall. As against the normal 840.7 mm, the State received 1,063.9 mm rainfall during the period. No district had deficient rainfall this time. Data for the period from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Bengaluru, showed that the southwest monsoon saw huge departures from normal in parts of north interior Karnataka (NIK) and south interior Karnataka (SIK). In fact, most districts had excess rainfall (over 20% to 59%), while four had large excess (over 60%). Only seven districts had what is categorised as normal rainfall: +19% to -19%. Among districts in SIK, which had an overall departure of 20%, Chitradurga got 81% more rainfall than normal, while the generally drought-hit Kolar got 78% more rainfall than normal. Tumakuru received 56% excess rainfall, Bengaluru Rural 53%, and Ballari 47%. Districts that usually receive heavy rainfall had more or less normal rainfall. Kodagu, which receives the highest rainfall among SIK districts with a normal of 2,257.4 mm, had a 4% departure, and it was the same with Chikkamagaluru, which usually receives 1,591.3 mm. Bengaluru Urban had 23% more rainfall than normal. In NIK, Bagalkot saw 74% excess rainfall, receiving 615 mm as against the normal 353.8 mm, Kalaburagi had 64% more rain, and Koppal 59% excess rainfall. Except Bidar and Haveri, all other districts in the subdivision had over 40% more rainfall than normal. Coastal Karnataka saw some of the least departures, with the highest being in Udupi which had 30% excess rainfall. The district witnessed massive flooding and damage towards September-end. Last year, Karnataka received an average 23% more rainfall than normal between June and September. The monsoon season had also extended into October. The northeast monsoon made an entry into peninsular India on October 16. The year before last, the post-monsoon season had posted deficiency in rainfall across the State, with the period from October to December in 2018 recording 48% deficiency. Northeast monsoon Meanwhile, the onset of the northeast monsoon, which is crucial for Tamil Nadu and brings rainfall to south-interior Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, is forecast for around October 20, plus or minus seven days. Last year, its onset was delayed. “After the retreat of the southwest monsoon, the northeast monsoon sets in. The normal onset is around October 20, plus or minus seven days. Almost 48% of Tamil Nadu’s rainfall is from this,” C.S. Patil, director, IMD, Bengaluru, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/southwest-monsoon-27-more-rainfall-in-state/article32756648.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||WASH campaign launched||The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Karnataka regional office, has launched a Sanitation Literacy Campaign to promote literacy on WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) covering rural populations in five districts — Shivamogga, Tumakuru, Uttara Kannada, Hassan, and Kalaburagi. The programme was inaugurated by Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, at a function here on Friday. Deputy Commissioners and zilla panchayat CEOs also launched the programme in their respective districts through videoconference facility. Mr. Akhtar said sanitation campaigns would improve the health of rural populations, save lost man-days on account of ill health, bring savings on health expenditure, and give protection from COVID-19 by way of increased awareness about sanitation and good hygiene.  Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, NABARD has supported the construction of 3.29 crore household toilets by sanctioning Rs. 15,000 crore and disbursing Rs. 12,298 crore, said a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/wash-campaign-launched/article32756562.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Deadline for app-based crop survey extended till Oct. 15||The State government has extended the deadline for app-based crop survey by farmers by another 15 days. The survey, which started on August 24 with respect to kharif season, was supposed to end on Wednesday. A circular states that the deadline has been extended following request by deputy commissioners of various districts. According to a statement from Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil, there has been an encouraging response from farmers. “Though the survey has been taken up on an experimental basis this season, 88% of the target has been achieved,” the Minister noted, and said that such a progress had caught the attention of the Centre. The mobile app-based survey, which was introduced in 2017, has gained momentum now. While pictures and details of 3,000 plots had been uploaded by farmers in 2017, officials themselves had completed the process with respect to the remaining plots. The survey was not taken up in 2018 and 2019. It was reintroduced this year, and details of nearly 1.83 lakh plots have been uploaded as against the target of 2.2 lakh plots. Data collected through the earlier app-based survey had served as a reference point while transferring one-time compensation on account of COVID-19 towards crop losses through direct benefit transfer to 7.29 lakh farmers who had cultivated maize. It had also helped in payment of minimum support price and compensation towards those who had cultivated vegetables and flowers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/deadline-for-app-based-crop-survey-extended-till-oct-15/article32756647.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||With no syllabi cut, universities adopt ‘self-study’ approach||While the syllabi for the 2020-21 academic year has been cut for schools and pre-university colleges, universities and colleges have decided against trimming or tweaking their syllabi for the current academic year. Instead, they are changing their teaching methods and asking students to adopt the “self-study” approach for many chapters. Managements of universities and colleges say they have been forced to do this as there is no clarity on when classes will be allowed to resume. Lecturers say that not only are they unable to complete portions while teaching online, but there has been a shift in the manner and style of teaching, one that both teachers and students are adapting to. Self-study is one such way of learning that is being adopted. Students, too, say that lecturers are giving them more work to do on their own. A postgraduate student from Christ (Deemed-to-be University) said they have two hours of online classes followed by two hours of self-reading or assignments. “The teachers upload the assignment and give us a deadline. If we submit it in time, we get attendance,” she said. T.D. Kemparaju, Vice-Chancellor, Bengaluru North University, said universities cannot cut their syllabus arbitrarily and need to do so on a scientific basis after a lot of deliberation. Any change in syllabus will need approval from the University Grants Commission (UGC). “The portion of one semester is related to that in the next, so we cannot just cut it. Instead, we want to encourage students to study some parts of the portion on their own. We want to provide study material that will help them,” he said. Colleges and universities in the State were initially slated to open on October 1. However, with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, the government decided to delay the resumption of classes. This is in keeping with the UGC, which had said that first-semester classes may commence from November 1. S. Japhet, Vice-Chancellor, Bengaluru Central University, said many lecturers are also asking students to make presentations so that the classes are not limited to the lecturers delivering monologues. Many students, however, are not happy with the online classes and say that lecturers are adopting these methods as they are neither comfortable with taking online classes nor trained in the medium. “We tell our lecturers that they can use certain visual tools to make the classes more lively. However, they are not tech-savvy. To avoid taking classes, they tell us to complete assignments and ask us to study on our own,” said a second-year student of a city-based college affiliated to Bangalore University.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/with-no-syllabi-cut-universities-adopt-self-study-approach/article32756570.ece
03 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hubballi-Dharwad to have FMCG cluster; to generate 5 lakh jobs||Large- and Medium-scale Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar has said that Hubballi–Dharwad will be developed as a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) cluster for south India, generating an annual turnover of over Rs. 25,000 crore. Mr. Shettar, who received a vision document, ‘Transform Hubbali–Dharwad: Vision 2020-2025’, from Ullas Kamath, joint managing director of Jyothy Labs Ltd. and chairman of the FMCG Vision Group, said the cluster was being actively pursued by the government to attract investments and generate large-scale employment in the north Karnataka region. The government had announced the project in the last budget. It would generate five lakh direct and indirect job opportunities, through the associated service industry such as transport, premium hotels, restaurants,” Mr. Shettar said. The Hubli–Dharwad region was identified suiting the development needs, given its connectivity with the consumer markets of Bengaluru, Belagavi, Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai. The cluster seeks to change the social demographics of the Hubballi–Dharwad region by developing industrial and allied economic activities, he said. In tune with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ concept, Hubballi–Dharwad would be the flag-bearer for the next industrial growth in Karnataka. The FMCG cluster development would be proposed in three phases, with each phase comprising investment of Rs. 2,500 crore from 50 FMCG companies (an average investment of Rs. 50 crore each). Each phase would generate 50,000 jobs, with 50% jobs reserved for women. Each phase is expected to occupy an area of around 500 acres, Mr. Kamath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hubballi-dharwad-to-have-fmcg-cluster-to-generate-5-lakh-jobs/article32756651.ece

This is part of an initiative by the BBMP to upgrade all 120 centres at a cost of Rs. 65 crore. The centres are being upgraded on the lines of the unit at Marappanapalya ward, which received a facelift after Hasiru Dala, an NGO working on waste management, collaborated with a Netherlands-based firm. The civic body chose 10 DWCCs in Atturu, Yelahanka Satellite, Jakkur, Kuvempu Nagar, Nagawara, H.B.R. Layout, Rajamahal Guttahalli, Koramangala and Kengeri (159) wards for the first part of the upgradation at a cost of Rs. 4.75 crore. “Work on the DWCCs at H.B.R. Layout and Koramangala wards have been completed,” said officials in the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) cell. Two centres are likely to be ready by the end of September. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project by a couple of months, an official said but added that it is now back on track. The BBMP decided to upgrade the DWCCs last year after an audit of all the centres in the city. The audit was taken up to understand the gaps that exist with respect to operations. The audit had revealed that 23 DWCCs were unfit for operation, 68 needed minor renovation while 52 could be expanded. Around 120 DWCCs are servicing 126 wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/10-dwccs-to-be-upgraded-by-year-end/article32756931.ece

The BBMP, meanwhile, has denied the allegation. Vani M.B., resident of Bommanahalli, along with her relatives Ranjitha and Vidyashree was stopped by a few BBMP personnel near Banashankari Metro Station on September 24, and asked to give swabs for tests. When the women refused, the personnel asked them to give their mobile phone numbers. “When they showed us their identity cards, we gave them our numbers and immediately got an OTP. They forcibly took the OTP from us. In 10 minutes, we got an SRF Id message that our samples had been collected. After two days, we were shocked when we got a call that we have tested positive,” Ms. Vani told The Hindu.  “We have complained to the BBMP health officials and lodged a complaint in Kumaraswamy Layout police station,” she said. Disputing the allegations, Munish Moudgil, zonal coordinator for south zone, said: “We have their swabs. They themselves gave their mobile phone numbers. This cannot be fudged by the staff.” He said the samples were drawn near Banashankari Metro Station where 70 to 80 samples are collected daily. “The health staff on September 24 collected about 65 samples and these three were among that. We will investigate this in detail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-women-allege-they-tested-positive-without-being-swabbed/article32756552.ece

Ravi has said that “one person, one post” is an “unwritten rule” in the BJP, but there have been instances of the party high command relaxing such rules. This statement gains significance in the context of the expectation that he would quit the Ministry in the light of recently being appointed as national general secretary of the BJP. While not directly citing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa (77) by his name, he said, “Norms like ‘one person, one post’ or that people aged above 75 should not hold posts in the government are unwritten rules in the party. However, the party high command has relaxed these norms on some occasions.” Mr. Ravi told presspersons in Chikkamagaluru on Friday that he would speak to party’s senior leaders in New Delhi before taking a decision on resigning as Minister. He said he was ready to resign as Minister and he would do so when the party high command instructs him. He was, however, quick to add, “If I were asked to choose between the party position and Minister’s post, I would go with the former.” The Minister would be participating in BJP office-bearers’ meeting scheduled for October 5 and 6 in New Delhi. “I will discuss the issue with party’s national president J.P. Nadda, Amit Shah, and B.L. Santhosh and take a decision,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ravi-unwritten-rules-can-be-relaxed-by-high-command/article32756655.ece
03 October 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Hunger strike against ‘anti-farmer’ policies||Former Minister Kimmane Rathnakar staged a hunger strike in front of the taluk office of Tirthahalli in Shivamogga district on Friday, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, opposing the recent laws concerning the farming sector. He began the protest after offering flowers to portraits of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Rathnakar said both the Union and State governments had been engaged in implementing anti-farmer policies. Both governments had no concern for the farming community. With the implementation of the new laws, the farmers would lose their land gradually. Similarly, they would also lose right over their produce with a law weakening the APMCs, he said. Further, he alleged that the people in power had no respect for Mahatma Gandhi. Those in power had been in glorifying Nathuram Godse, the person who killed Mahatma Gandhi. “The people of the country will teach the BJP a lesson for its anti-farmer and anti-poor policies,” he added.  Another protest The District Congress Committee also staged a protest against the controversial law in Shivamogga. Workers of the party took out a protest march from the party’s office to the Deputy Commissioner’s office. Along the protest march, they raised slogans against the Centre and State government. They submitted a memorandum addressed to the President to the DC. The party’s district president H.S. Sundaresh, former legislators Belur Gopalakrishna, K.B.Prasanna Kumar, MLC R.

03 October 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Officers urged to follow principles of Gandhi||Deputy Commissioner R. Girish has called upon the officers to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi in their administration. Officers should be helpful to those who come to them seeking relief, he said in his address at a programme organised to mark the Gandhi Jayanti at his office in Hassan on Friday. “We officers should have empathy. Whenever a man comes to us, we should try to imagine ourselves in his shoes so that we can provide him with better relief. If we follow this it would be the appropriate way of following Mahatma Gandhi in our lives,” he said. Recalling the struggles Mahatma Gandhi faced to secure freedom for the country, Mr. Girish said that because of the way he fought using non-violence as his weapon, Gandhi won hearts worldwide. His statues had been installed in many countries, he said. Assistant Commissioner Naveen Bhat opined that Gandhi was centuries ahead in his thinking. “We have heard about stories of Rama and Krishna who fought against evil forces using weapons. However, Gandhi was different. He got India independence through non-violence. Even today many of us have a feeling that we may not succeed in achieving anything good if we go by the non-violent method. But, Gandhi proved that it would happen and that is his greatness,” he said. M.D. Sudarshan, Assistant Director of Kannada and Culture Department, expressed concern over personalities like Gandhi, Buddha, and Basava being reduced to just persons people worship. “Many wish to worship them rather than follow their principles,” he said.

03 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Design digital verification for fishing vessels: NMPT||The New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) has urged the Fisheries Department to strictly coordinate and identify fishing vessels entering the port during distress through mobile app or digital communication. Failure to authenticate identification of vessels amounts to severe breach of security protocols mandated by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as per the International Ship and Port Safety Regulations (ISPR), NMPT Chairman A.V. Ramana said in a statement. His statement came after several fishing vessels entered NMPT premises on Monday following rough weather in the Arabian Sea. The vessels were finally allowed after the port officials authenticated their identity by contacting fishermen leaders, he said. Mr. Ramana said, “The port had informed the Fisheries Department long ago to follow a well-documented digitised procedure to balance between regulations and fishing trawlers in distress to ease fishermen’s burden when they were in distress. However, the department did not work in that direction.” In the absence of a well-defined system, allowing fishing trawlers would lead to breach of security defined by ISPR and MHA. Failure to follow security protocols would lead to stopping of export-import cargo handling operations by the International Maritime Community, the Chairman noted. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that manages port security could allow boats/trawlers only with proper authentication/ identification inside the port premises. Allowing unauthenticated entry would be dangerous, particularly at a time when there was threat of foreign terrorists hijacking a local fishing trawler and entering the port.  Deputy Director of Fisheries, Dakshina Kannada, Parshwanath, said the fisheries directorate was seized of the matter of designing an app-based authentication system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/design-digital-verification-for-fishing-vessels-nmpt/article32757086.ece
03 October 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Mangaluru girl masters ambidexterity||Fifteen-year-old Aadi Swaroopa can write with ease using both the hands in unidirectional way. She has also mastered writing in nine different ways including speed writing with right and left hand, reverse running writing and mirror image writing. Daughter of Gopadkar and Sumadkar, Swaroopa recently secured a certificate from Uttar Pradesh-based Barelia Lata Foundation for writing 45 words in a minute in an unidirectional way. Swaroopa picked up writing with left hand two years ago during a summer camp conducted by her parents, who manage Swaroopa Adhyayana Kendra – a centre that promotes self-learning. It’s during the lockdown, when there were not much children at the Kendra, that Swaroopa started practising different forms of writing using both hands. “Continuous practice helped me improve my speed,” said Swaroopa, who started writing at the age of three. “I keep on adding new forms of writing.” Swaroopa recently demonstrated her skill before reporters by writing the line “See the line where the sky meets the sea ..” unidirectionally. She then wrote the sentence in the opposite direction, followed by speed writing with right and left hand separately, and also writing the mirror image of the sentence. She showed her heterotopic style of writing, and the hetero linguistic style that involved simultaneously writing in Kannada and English. She displayed dancing form, exchange form and, her blindfolded writing skill too. Swaroopa, who has already come out with a short story book in Kannada and a fiction book in English, said writing with both hands has had a positive effect on her creativity. “I am now writing my second novel,” said Swaroopa, who is a voracious reader, an Yakshagana artiste, a Hindustani classical singer, and an artist. She loves mimicry and performs beatbox. Gopadkar and Sumadkar said they have liberated their daughter from the pressure of learning in a classroom. “She has all the skills to become a good writer,” said Sumadkar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangaluru-girl-masters-ambidexterity/article32757092.ece

He was speaking after Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner (MCC) Akshy Sridhar dedicated a Miyawaki urban forest, the second by the mission in the city, on the Ramakrishna Mutt premises. The initiative was sponsored by the CSR initiatives of Syngene-Biocon Foundation. The seer said after the dedication of the first forest in front of the zilla panchayat, the process was halted owing to COVID-19. The one dedicated on Friday has about 600 saplings, of 59 tree varieties native to the Western Ghat, on about five cents. Speaking on the occasion, Range Forest Officer P. Sridhar said the Forest Department would support afforestation initiatives. Such forests need not be raised on government land alone. If citizens are keen, the department will provide the required saplings, he said. Swachh Mangaluru convener Swami Ekagamyananda said volunteers in the city and the district, who participated in the cleanliness drive for five years, were asking, “What next?” The mission has been promoting pot-composting to reduce wet waste being dumped in dumping yards, he said. A start-up, Mangala Resource Management Pvt., Ltd., was handling the wet waste at doorsteps of about 10 apartments. The demand was there from another 60 apartments, he added It would also manage dry waste shortly. Dr. Rajendra said there is no magic solution to improving the environment and it can happen only through afforestation. Keeping the city clean was a major challenge in Mangaluru and the pot-composting initiative was a good move. The administration would support the initiatives of the mission, he said. Mr. Sridhar said raising urban forests in vacant land in corporation limits could prevent dumping of garbage. The civic body was open to suggestions, he said. No amount of fine could discourage waste generation and dumping, he added. Syngene Mangaluru Head Ranga Rao also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mission-aims-to-raise-100-urban-forests-in-city/article32757076.ece

Later, addressing the protesters, KRRS State Secretary Ravikiran Punachha said both the Union and the State governments were working against the interest of farmers and labourers.

We have the capacity to overthrow the two governments,” he said. State vice-president of KPRS K. Yadava Shetty said Karnataka has been at the forefront in land and agricultural reforms. “Leaders like D. Devaraj Urs, B.V.

03 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Activists suspect campaign to scuttle train service||Railway activists suspect a campaign to scuttle the Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur Express service, which was introduced as Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Special Express from September 4, claiming poor occupancy. This is despite the fact that all special trains introduced during various unlock phases were running almost empty. Citing reports in a section of the media that said very few people travelled to Bengaluru or Karwar in the special service, the activists said it could be a design to cancel the train that was sanctioned after much fight with the Railway Board. The Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur (16595/596) train was introduced on March 7, just before the COVID-19 lockdown. Activists Gautam Shetty, Sudarshan Puttur, and Vivek Nayak have urged South Western Railway (SWR) to conduct an enquiry into false reports being spread. SWR’s Chief Public Relations Officer E. Vijaya said the figures being circulated on occupancy were far from actual. On an average, 100 to 250 people travelled on both directions during the period, she said quoting figures from the reservation system. Ms. Vijaya told The Hindu that special trains were running with very poor patronage pan-India during unlock phases. “No decision can be taken on the basis of occupancy during this period,” she said. The advance reservation for Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru services, Ms. Vijaya said, were encouraging, with an average booking for 150-200 berths during weekdays and Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC) during weekends, meaning the berths were full.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activists-suspect-campaign-to-scuttle-train-service/article32756649.ece

03 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Bruhat Mysuru Mahanagara Palike’ plan gets a new push||The long-pending proposal to expand the jurisdiction of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to include several villages on the outskirts and upgrade the civic body into a ‘Bruhat Mysuru Mahanagara Palike’ or ‘Greater Mysuru’ has picked up pace once more. Acknowledging the growing demand for upgrading MCC, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar told reporters here on Friday that a decision in this regard will be taken after a meeting with MLAs and other elected representatives. He said villages falling under the limits of eight gram panchayats on the outskirts of Mysuru will qualify to be included in the expanded civic body. However, he said it was up to the State government to examine whether MCC should be upgraded on the basis of population or any other parameters. Mr. Somashekar’s assertion comes close on the heels of a letter written by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha to Minister for Municipal Administration K.C. Narayan Gowda on September 1, 2020, making a case for an imperative need to upgrade MCC by referring to the growth of several villages in Mysuru taluk such as Alanahalli, Hanchya, Kadakola, Ramanahalli, Hosahundi, Devalapura, Srirampura, Jayapura, Bogadi, Hootagalli, Hinkal, Koorgalli, Ilavala, Belavatha, Siddalingapura, Udburu, Dhanagalli and Lalithadripura. He said these villages on the outskirts of Mysuru had witnessed enough growth owing to the establishment of several residential layouts and industrial areas. This, Mr. Simha, said had led to a growth in the population of the areas as well as the revenue earned by the respective gram panchayats. The villages can be included into the MCC and the civic body can be upgraded as per the provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Administrations Act, 1964, he said. The inclusion of the villages into the jurisdiction of a Greater Mysuru was necessary to provide basic amenities in the area, he said, while asking Mr. Narayan Gowda to issue necessary directions to officials. Presently, the jurisdiction of MCC stretches across a total of 128.4 sq km inside the Outer Ring Road. Several areas had witnessed development in the recent past fall outside the Outer Ring Road, which is not within the geographic purview of MCC. Residents of many such areas, including layouts developed or approved by Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) have been denied of basic amenities including drinking water. The absence of a garbage collection mechanism in the areas falling outside the jurisdiction of MCC has led to indiscriminate dumping of household and other waste on vacant areas along the Outer Ring Road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bruhat-mysuru-mahanagara-palike-plan-gets-a-new-push/article32756642.ece

03 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Chamarajanagar granite industry set to get a fillip||The granite industry in Chamarajanagar is set to get a fillip with the government set to establish a centre to impart training in granite cutting and polishing to meet the industry’s demand for skilled labour force. The district is known for black granites and has about 50 granite quarries and 12 granite cutting and polishing industrial units. But its expansion and growth is hampered by lack of skilled labour to address which a training institute will be established in Chamarajanagar. “At present the labour requirement is met by Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha and other States and in the absence of skill development centre, the local youth are not gainfully employed. The new initiative will not only provide skilled labour for the granite industry but will also address the local unemployment issue besides abetting the growth of the sector’’, said M.R. Ravi, Deputy Commissioner, Chamarajanagar district. He told The Hindu that establishing a skill development centre and training the local youth in granite cutting and polishing can bring about a sea change in the fortunes of the region. “Just as Surat has emerged as a diamond cutting and polishing centre for the world, Chamarajanagar can emerge as a major hub for exporting granite which is abundant locally’’, said Mr. Ravi. There was tremendous demand for black polished granite across the world and the identified reserve in the district was not going to get exhausted anytime soon. Bulk of the tomb stone in polished black used in cemeteries in Europe isxported from Chamarajanagar and the demand outstrips supply, he added. The authorities have already put a plan in place to launch the training and a private granite unit has agreed to lend its infrastructure to impart the programme. To start with, 240 youths selected from the local communities will be trained during 2020-21 and they will also receive a stipend during the training period which will last from 3 months to 5 months depending on the job roles. The cost of training has been pegged at Rs. 81.6 lakh and the district administration has sought CSR funds from the industrial sector for the purpose. Mr. Ravi said resource persons will be drawn from the local granite industry and quarries and the programme will be further developed in association with Federation of Indian Granite Industries Association, Jaipur and, other professional bodies. Job opportunities are plentiful and the take home salary of a trained worker will range from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 per month, said Mr. Ravi. Other sources said quarrying has its share of problems and issues related to environment and it needs regulation in the absence of which illegal mining was rampant. Mr. Ravi said quarrying was regulated and there was not a single quarry unit anywhere close to forests and national parks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chamarajanagar-granite-industry-set-to-get-a-fillip/article32756558.ece
03 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Dasara elephants make grand entry||The five Dasara elephants led by 54-year-old Abhimanyu, who will be carrying the 750 kg golden howdah for the first time this year, were accorded a traditional welcome into the Mysuru palace on Friday. The caparisoned elephants that arrived from their respective forest camps on Thursday and stayed overnight at Aranya Bhavan majestically marched into the palace to begin their Dasara journey amidst the music of ‘Nadaswara’. Unlike the past, they were brought to the palace from Aranya Bhavan in trucks to avoid people gathering around them as a precaution owing to COVID-19. The elephants received a rousing reception after their arrival at the Jayamarthanda gate of the palace. The Police Band accorded a guard of honour to the jumbos that marched onto the premises at 12:45 p.m. as they were showered by flowers by Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, elected representatives and officials, setting the ball rolling the festivities. Pujas were performed to the jumbos before they entered the palace. As a custom, the Minister handed out bouquets of fruits to key officials requesting them to successfully conduct the festivities. The mahouts and kavadis of the elephants – Abhimanyu, Vikrama, Gopi, Cauvery and Vijaya – also received welcome kits containing daily essentials and other needs on the occasion as they will be staying in the palace premises in makeshift tents and training elephants for the Jamboo Savari. MLAs S.A. Ramdas, G.T. Deve Gowda, L. Nagendra, Mayor Tasneem, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, DCF Alexander and other senior officials were present. All dignitaries underwent thermal screening at the palace before the event. After a day’s rest on Saturday, the elephants will begin their training for the Jamboo Savari on the palace premises from Sunday. They won’t be taken out of the palace as a precaution in view of the pandemic. The training used to be done till Bannimantap all these years. Now, with the procession limited to the palace, the training will also be confined to the palace fortress. Deputy Conservator of Forest Alexander told The Hindu that all training for elephants will be confined to the palace and the jumbo camp will have CCTV surveillance with constant monitoring of their health by the forest staff and vets and provision of a special diet. COVID-19 test for mahouts Mr. Alexander said the mahouts, kavadis and the supporting staff of the elephants would undergo COVID-19 tests on Saturday. All together, around 30 of them would take the test on the palace premises conducted by healthcare authorities. After the test results, the schedule of training and other activities would be finalized, he added. This year, the family members of the mahouts and kavadis have not accompanied them to Mysuru over the pandemic, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dasara-elephants-make-grand-entry/article32756640.ece

Household waste is found dumped in heaps in various vacant spots along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) as the residents of several new residential layouts formed by the MUDA or approved by MUDA denied a garbage collection mechanism. ‘Residents pay tax’ MUDA chairman H.V. Rajeev told The Hindu that MUDA was planning to take steps in this regard as residents of layouts developed or approved by MUDA pay property tax to the authority. He said the MUDA was planning to purchase a jetting machine, used for cleaning underground drainage, besides taking steps to prevent indiscriminate dumping of garbage in the areas under its jurisdiction. MUDA will also take steps to ensure that garbage collected from MCC areas is not illegally dumped in MUDA areas instead of being taken to the designated waste management centre at J.P.

03 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Majority of foresters unaware of guidelines’||A survey of all 53 forest division heads in the State indicated that a majority (65.4%) were unaware of the existence of human-leopard conflict guidelines. The survey, which was taken up as part of a paper published by Sanjay Gubbi and team, found that 5.8% of the respondents felt the guidelines were too theoretical. Only 1.9% said they were following the guidelines. Also, 52% of the forest officials suggested that capture and translocation of leopards was not an option as a solution to a conflict. This suggested that they were acting on public pressure, depicting lower tolerance levels towards leopards. These days, even the sighting of a leopard near human habitations is pursued as conflict, according to Mr. Gubbi. “Though the guidelines make a set of thoughtful suggestions to reduce conflict, they are devoid of critical inputs from States such as Uttarakhand, Karnataka and others that see high levels of leopard conflict; they require refinement,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/majority-of-foresters-unaware-of-guidelines/article32756565.ece
03 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Heritage bridge across Kapila to be conserved||Mysuru division of South Western Railway (SWR) will initiate measures to conserve the bridge across the river Kabini or Kapila at Nanjangud, which is reckoned to be more than 280 years old and is one of the oldest bridges in the country. The bridge was in existence even before the advent of the Railways and was used by bullock carts, horse carriages, and pedestrians to cross the river. It was constructed in the 1730s by Dalvoy Devaraj, a local chieftain, and a railway track was laid over it when the metre-gauge link connecting Mysuru to Nanjangud was laid and commissioned in 1899. This engineering marvel was built in Gothic style and is unique in design as it accommodated metre-gauge railway line parallel to road traffic. The bridge measures nearly 225 meters in length and has 56 piers, and the last metre-gauge train that ran over the bridge was on January 17, 2007. After that, it was closed to traffic. Consequent to the conversion of the railway line to broad gauge, a new bridge was commissioned in 2008 and this vintage structure fell into disuse. But now, the Mysuru division has decided to conserve the rail-road bridge for posterity, given its heritage status, and plans to restore it at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh. This entails clearing the bushes and vegetation growth on the structure, plastering damaged piers, paying attention to damaged parapet walls and the road, colour washing the bridge, and illuminating the structure. It will also have signage complete with the history of the structure. Inspection Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru, said Indian Railways had a vast heritage and was always in the forefront to take measures to preserve it as it narrates the Railways’ growth in India. In the same spirit, the Mysuru division of SWR is taking proactive measure to preserve the old rail-cum-road bridge across Kapila river. She conducted an inspection of the heritage structure along with senior divisional engineers on Friday and said a detailed proposal would be prepared to protect the “one of its kind” structure, duly reflecting its old glory. The restoration works will pay attention to the damage inflicted on the structure with age and elements of nature. The aim will be to strengthen the structure without compromising on the heritage facade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heritage-bridge-across-kapila-to-be-conserved/article32756567.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Accident will not affect commissioning of controversial gas power plant||For long a controversial project, the Yelahanka power plant’s highly delayed commissioning was jinxed in its first attempt with the fire accident. Though the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL) is treating this as a one-off incident, residents and environmentalists who have been fighting against the plant are even more riled up. Simmi Kumar, resident of Heritage apartments, which is close to the power plant, said their worst fears had been confirmed. “There was a blast around 3 a.m. Residents saw fire tenders. We didn't know what happened. In the morning we got a message saying there was a blast. This has always been a major fear,” she said. She pointed out that they live across the road from the plant. “Gas leakage and a blast can be fatal as they can cover a good distance. This is not a small scare. There is a bird conservation reserve. The loud noise is going to impact their habitat. We have some rare birds in the reserve,” she said. In 2013, the closure of the power plant was announced as it was a diesel generating unit at the time. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had issued a show-cause notice to the then 20-year-old plant, alleging violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The board’s officials had alleged that the plant was fuelled by cheap, polluting Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS), and not diesel. Around 40 MW power was being generated at the plant. Later, work on a combined cycle power plant – the only power plant in the city – was launched by the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in June 2016. The plant was supposed to be ready by May 2018, but faced delays. Abdul Azeem Kalebudde, the advocate for the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust and Heritage Estate Apartment Owners’ Association, has alleged that KPCL obtained the Environmental Clearance (EC) from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) by “suppressing the fact that the lakes are declared as Bird Conservation Reserve”, and hence, the Environment Clearance granted by the SEIAA is “void and illegal”. “Moreover, no information is provided as to the construction and functioning of the power plant. People in the vicinity have been experiencing vibrations continuously. There is frequent discharge of froth from the plant. Residents are exposed to some unbearable emission of gas, which is let out during the day and unknowingly at night as well. This has already created a fear psychosis among the people staying in the vicinity,” the advocate alleged. He claimed that no steps have been taken despite the matter being brought to the notice of the KSPCB and BBMP. This July, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered serving a notice to KPCL based on an application filed by the Trust seeking nullification and cancellation of the EC granted by the SEIAA. V. Ponnuraj, Managing Director, KPCL said the plant will be commissioned in due course. “Generally, we keep two to three commissioning dates, and this was our first attempt. Before we commission the plant, we will wait to learn the root cause of the accident and set it right,” he said.  There was a blast around 3 a.m. Residents saw fire tenders.

In the backdrop of the pandemic, most of the events were low-key or held online. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa garlanded the 27-feet-tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the premises of Vidhana Soudha. “Gandhi’s life and messages are an inspiration for various programmes and policies of this government,” he said. The Chief Minister also paid his respects to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri who was born on October 2, 1904. A programme was organised at Congress Bhavan to pay tributes to both Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri. A documentary on centenarian freedom fighter and Gandhian H.S. Doreswamy, Mahan Thatha , was released and screened at the Bharat Scouts and Guides office. A book titled Godsevadigalige Gandhivadada Uttara was also released. At an event at Mahatma Gandhi Park on M.G. Road where his teachings were presented through augmented reality, Mr. Doreswamy’s message was read out: “Gandhiji saw technology and machines as complementary to human effort. His dream of an independent India was to make all Indians contribute towards nation-building, keeping aside personal ambitions and greed.” Cycle rally Bengaluru Smart City Limited and the BBMP came together to organise ‘Ride for Peace’ cycle rally against road violence. Participants cycled from the east gate of Vidhana Soudha through Cubbon Park and M.G. Road to the BBMP office for a better and safer Bengaluru. Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, Managing Director, Bengaluru Smart City Limited said that the rally was also a part of India Cycles4Change Challenge initiated by the Smart Cities Mission, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. “The birthday of Mahatma Gandhi is celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence, and violence includes breaking traffic rules, honking and rash driving,” said Ms. Korlapati.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/low-key-but-enthusiastic-celebrations-mark-gandhi-jayanti/article32756938.ece

The Chief Justice said, “Though I am not an expert in the field of economy, in the present day context when we saw serious issue of migrant labourers [during COVID-19 lockdown], I personally feel that time has come for us to revisit the thought process adopted by Mahatmaji when he said we must give utmost importance to set up village industries.” “After reading what Mahatmaji has written, I realised that tolerance is one of the qualities which all, the judicial officers and the judges must possess. May be due to pressure of work though we understand importance of tolerance we may not be able to practice it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/revisit-thought-on-making-villages-self-sufficient-cj/article32756940.ece

He took this decision to protest the university’s move to allot the land housing the Biodiversity Park for CBSE’s southern centre, Central University of Karnataka, Gulbarga and the Inter University Centre for Yogic Sciences He was awarded the honorary doctorate by BU in 2009 keeping in mind his contribution towards developing the Biodiversity Park on BU’s Jnana Bharathi campus and for his efforts to protect the environment. On October 1, he handed over his doctorate to the Environmental Society of India and asked them to return it to the Governor and Chancellor of Universities Vajubhai Vala on his behalf. Mr. Reddy told The Hindu that he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the Vice Chancellor’s decision to lease out the land without consulting him. “I was instrumental in developing the Biodiversity Park more than two decades ago. I got the doctorate for setting up this park. When this park is no more, what is the meaning of holding the doctorate? I am still the consultant of the Biodiversity Park but the Vice-Chancellor did not consult me once before making this decision,” he said. He had initially asked T.J. Renuka Prasad – the former coordinator of the biopark – to return the award to the Chancellor. However, he was not in a position to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Society members have sought an appointment with the Chancellor to return the award. The Biodiversity Park has more than 9,000 trees that have been nurtured over the years. The park is popularly known as the largest ‘oxygen bank’ in the city and has a fruit garden. Vice-Chancellor K.R. Venugopal said that 10 acres were allotted to Central University, Gulbarga, 15 acres to the University Grants Commission. “We are yet to allot one acre for the CBSE’s southern regional centre,” he said.

According to senior police officials, the CCB had not followed due procedure while submitting the evidence for testing. “It is a small technical problem, which has been resolved. We have rectified the problem and sent the samples back,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). He added that other samples, namely blood and urine, are already with the FSL. “This is the first time that the hair sample test is being done to get additional evidence. We have already gathered evidence in the form of technical data, eyewitness accounts, mobile phone analysis and seizures. The tests from the hair samples will be additional evidence. “Our case does not stand only on the hair samples. The investigation is on the right track,” said Mr. Patil. The actors have been accused of using and dealing in drugs like ecstasy and LSD in parties organised for this purpose. CCB officials have obtained permission to conduct a polygraph test and other ‘scientific tests’ on another key accused in the case, party organiser and socialite Viren Khanna. “He is refusing to cooperate with the investigation. Hence, scientific investigation may get the CCB some good leads,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drugs-probe-fsl-sends-back-hair-samples/article32756932.ece

03 October 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmer brothers set to reap it rich with a local pearl millet variety||The first-ever full-fledged crop of ‘ABV04’ variety of pearl millet grown during the kharif season by a farmer duo at Pathacheruvu village in Anantapur district is ready for harvest and they expect a decent income with minimal investment. The ABV04 - Anantapur Bajra Variety 04, a variety developed by Acharya N.G. Ranga University-run Agriculture Research Station at Rekulakunta, was released nationally in 2019 and this was the first kharif season in which a farmer attempted this variety of millets due to lack of sufficient water in the area. The Research Station scientists Sahadev Reddy and R. Narasimha, who made a field visit on Wednesday, expressed joy at the success of the crop in 12 acres. Sammathi Lakshminarayana and Govindappa, who jointly own 12 acres, could not sow groundnut as it required high investment and sufficient water sources were not there except for depending on rains. On advice from the coordinators of A.F. Ecology Centre, Anantapur, they sowed 1 kg of seed per acre at a cost of Rs. 450 per two acres and did not spray any medicines or apply fertilizers. The total expenditure including their own family labour in looking after the three-month crop during the COVID pandemic was Rs. 25,000 and going by the current price in the market, they expect to get Rs. 2,000 per quintal. A rough estimate is that they would get 12 quintals of pearl millet per acre and the income is likely to be around Rs. 2.88 lakh and deducting all expenses they are likely to save at least Rs. 2 lakh. The same farmer brothers, who have another seven acres land that has irrigation facility, went for groundnut crop in that and invested close to Rs. 1.1 lakh and are not sure whether they can recoup their input cost. “The agriculture officials had come last week and after inspecting the fields, declared that the groundnut crop had failed,” said Govindappa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmer-brothers-set-to-reap-it-rich-with-a-local-pearl-millet-variety/article32756394.ece

This will make an additional amount of Rs. 7,106 crore available to the two States, according to a release. A.P. facilitated the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ system by reforming the PDS. The State took the lead in launching District-Level Business Reform Action Plan, which was initiated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. It took a host of steps prescribed by the DPIIT and qualified for the open market borrowings. A computerised central random inspection system, and elimination of requirement of renewal of certificates / approvals / licences to be obtained by businesses from the authorities at the State level were key factors that helped A.P. in pushing other States behind in the race to the No.1 slot in the EoDB rankings.

03 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hari’s arrest a big blow to Maoists in Galikonda||The Visakhapatnam district police has struck a big blow for the CPI (Maoist) in the Galikonda region, with the arrest of Gemmeli Kamesh alias Hari, on Wednesday. The arrested Maoist was not only involved in over 100 serious offences, including five murders and seven exchanges of fire, but was playing a key role in revival of the Maoist movement in Galikonda area of Visakhapatnam agency. Being an area committee member (ACM), he was leading the Galikonda dalam in some pockets, under the supervision of Jagan, who is the divisional committee member (DCM). Apart from being a local, a resident of Kumkumapudi in GK Veedhi mandal, he is the nephew of slain Maoist leader Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri. This strategically was working in his favour, especially after the death of Jambri and Azad and the surrender of Boda Anjayya alias Bhaskar alias Naveen in 2019. Leadership crisis Galikonda area that comprises mandals such as Chintapalli, GK Veedhi and parts of Koyyuru, has always been a Maoist hotbed, but it suffered a void after the death of Jambri and Azad and surrender of Naveen, within a short span. Gopal alias Azad was killed in an alleged exchange of fire with the security forces in May 2016 in Marripakala in Koyyuru mandal. Azad was then the DCM and leading the movement. His successor Jambri was also killed in an alleged encounter in February 2017 near Annavaram village under Mampa police limits in Koyyuru. Following this, Naveen was elevated as DCM but he surrendered within a year in 2019. Close on the heels, about 12 Maoists and militia members surrendered, in a setback for the Maoist movement in Galikonda. “With the arrest of Hari, we have once again created the void and we will now pursue to see that others also surrender,” said DIG (Visakha range) L.K.V. Ranga Rao. At present, Jagan is the only surviving senior leader in the area and it is estimated that there are 12 to 15 Maoist cadres, who are supported by about 200 militia members, including a few armed militias. According to Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam, B. Krishna Rao, Galikonda area has always been a stronghold of the Maoist. “The terrain is difficult and the forest is thick, which provides them a good cover. But the series of deaths and surrenders have created a void and Hari was entrusted the job of reviving it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/haris-arrest-a-big-blow-to-maoists-in-galikonda/article32757139.ece

The seer distributed prosthetic limbs to several persons with disabilities at the Sri Gurudeva Charitable Trust of Mangalampalem of Kothavalasa mandal, Vizianagaram district. He congratulated Trust founder Raparthi Jagadish Babu for helping 40,000 physically challenged persons by giving them prosthetic limbs. The Chinna Jeeyar guided him on adopting new technologies to reduce the weight of the prosthetics further so that they will be easier to use. Mr. Jagadish Babu said that their research wing is looking into the issue under the guidance of experts from within India as well as from other countries. He said that many youngsters had lost their limbs in road accidents.

03 October 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Theatre owners seek ticket price hike to survive COVID crisis||Running the show is not going to be an easy task for cinema hall owners under the new Unlock guidelines that permit screening of movies from October 15. While the ‘50% occupancy only’ restriction is in itself a hindrance, many exhibitors are doubtful if they could draw even those numbers to the theatres as there are no major films set for release till January since shootings stopped for a few months due to lockdown. If additional costs for sanitisation and other COVID safety measures are factored in, they will not be able to recover even maintenance expenditure, they say. In order to tide over the crisis, Vizianagaram Cine Exhibitors’ Association president Narayanam Srinivas urges the government to permit enhancement of ticket prices. “We will still get minimum maintenance charges only if the government allows partial enhancement of ticket rates. We also request the government to reduce electricity charges and municipal taxes since the theatre owners incurred huge losses in the last six months,” says Mr. Srinivas whose family owns NCS theatre and NCS multiplex in Vizianagaram. According to him, the minimum electricity bill is around Rs. 60,000 for mid-range cinemas. The government has promised to waive the charges for the lockdown period but orders have not yet been given, he adds. Srikakulam Kinnera-Kameswari theatres’ owner Perla Sambamurthy seeks the government support to pay at least staff salaries. “We need to operate theatres for the sake of employees since a majority of them could not get salaries as owners themselves are in deep financial crisis.” ‘Reduce tax burden’ Srikakulam Sunmax partner Mandavilli Ravi urges the government to reduce the tax burden since theatres have been providing direct and indirect employment to many people. “There is little chance of getting 50% occupancy in the current scenario. So, the government’s timely support is needed to run the show,” he says. About 80 theatres are left in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts after many have been converted into shopping malls and function halls due to losses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/theatre-owners-seek-ticket-price-hike-to-survive-covid-crisis/article32756387.ece

03 October 2020||Bhongir,TELANGANA||Pattana Pragathi will be true homage to Bapu: KTR||Municipalities of Telangana should be examples for other states. A true homage to the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi will be in the effective execution of Pattana Pragathi, the integrated programme to transform the urban landscape, which also values cleanliness and sanitation, MA&UD Minister K.T. Rama Rao said on Friday. The department, for the same reason, observed the 151st anniversary of Gandhi on Friday as Swachhata Diwas across the 142 municipalities in the State, he said. The meeting Mr. Rao addressed here, after inaugurating a slew of projects for Bhongir, was also symbolically organised on the premises of a cleaned-up dumping yard. Mr. KTR along with Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy, MPs B. Lingaiah Yadav and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, laid the foundation stone for an integrated market, a graveyard, and inaugurated a bio-mining unit and a faecal sludge treatment plant. Marking the day, he also launched the Pattana Pragathi quarterly newsletter and a public toilet monitoring application. According to Mr. Rao, the State government is implementing a well-planned strategy in building urban infrastructure that also takes care of the future needs. “In the next seven years, with a 7% increase from now, about 50% of the population would reside in urban centres, attracted by its better health, education and job prospects. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has a strategy in Pattana Pragathi and citizen-centric municipal legislation,” he said. Reading out numbers, Mr. Rao explained that Telangana since 2014, on the municipal front, has made significant progress. “There are 1,327 nurseries, 197 dry resource centres and 140 compost yards, the one we are seated here included,” he said. Mr. Rao said all the municipalities should aim for an open defecation-free (ODF ++ tag), a Swachh Bharat Mission protocol acknowledging sustainable sanitation, including faecal sludge management. And to encourage healthy competition among municipalities, annual Pattana Pragathi awards on February 24, would be given away in various categories, he said. Bhongir legislator P. Sekhar Reddy handed over a cheque worth Rs. 1 crore to Mr. Rao towards projects. Commissioner and Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana and District Collector Anita Ramachandran and others participated in the programme on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pattana-pragathi-will-be-true-homage-to-bapu-ktr/article32757178.ece

03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TSRTC adds very less to its city bus fleet||While Bengaluru added nearly 2,000 buses to its city fleet since financial year 2015-16, Hyderabad, during the same period, could add only 250. A comparison of city fleets of the two State transport undertakings – the Benguluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s (TSRTC) Greater Hyderabad Zone – shows this yawing gap. Both cities have approximately the same population. But while the BMTC, as shown on its website, has a fleet size of 6,460, the GHZ has 2,982 buses. According to data obtained by means of the Right to Information Act of 2005, transport researcher G S R Chaitanya found out that the GHZ fleet size has decreased over the years. While in FY 2014-15 it was 3,811, this number declined in FY 2019-2020 to 2,982. Of the 250 buses which were added to the GHZ fleet, 52 were Super Luxury buses which primarily ply inter-State routes, but at times are also are used for intra-State travel. Another six were inter-State Garuda Plus buses, and 37 were Rajdhani buses, which also ply inter-State routes. Most of the city buses – five city ordinary buses, 80 Metro Luxury AC buses and 45 Metro Delux buses - were added to the GHZ fleet in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Data also showed that while the average age of buses in GHZ is a little over 9.56 lakh km, it also gives an idea of how close to the bus scrapping age of 15 lakh km the GHZ fleet is. The age profile of the buses, also obtained by Mr Chaitanya, shows that in addition to 149 buses which have crossed this threshold, there are at least 176 buses which have run between 14 lakh km and 15 lakh km, and another 196 which have run between 13 lakh km and 14 lakh km. As many as 220 buses have run between 12 lakh km to 13 lakh km. In terms of age in years, there are over 600 buses which are over 15 years old. “Buses are generally scrapped after running 15 lakh km. The data shows that there are several buses which are close to that 15 lakh mark, or have crossed it. It is only a matter of time that many will reach the scrapping age,” Mr Chaitanya said, adding that there is a pressing need to increase the fleet size in GHZ. He also explained that per Service Level Benchmarks for Urban Transport, there is a need to increase buses for every lakh of the city’s population. As per the data, 634 City Ordinary buses have been scrapped since FY 2014-15. Again, most of them were scrapped in FY 2014-15, FY 2015-16 and 2016-17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tsrtc-adds-very-less-to-its-city-bus-fleet/article32757047.ece
03 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Selfie point’ Durgam Cheruvu bridge turns risky for admirers||A 1.5 km drive on a flyover on Jubilee Hills Road Number 45 in Hyderabad gives the first glimpse of the newly-inaugurated cable stayed bridge over Durgam Cheruvu. But once the bridge comes to view, something strange is happening to passengers and drivers. Some of them slow their vehicles down to a crawl, others are stopping to click photographs, and a few others get busy clicking selfies oblivious to vehicles that might move fast. “On Wednesday night, a person taking a selfie on the road coming from Mind Space Junction was nicked by a vehicle. It could have been serious,” says a police official standing behind a parked patrol vehicle on the bridge on Friday evening. Throngs of people with families, couples and young men spilled over from the sidewalk on to the road. On Thursday night, civic activist Sai Teja shot and posted a chilling video where a couple walk on the bridge and a woman in pink salwar kameez walks to the middle of the three-lane road as vehicles zip around her. Beside the couple two men take photographs and behind them is a parked car with people spilling over and taking photographs. “The main reason for uploading the video was to show the mindless behaviour of people. It can have tragic consequences for them as well as others,” says Mr. Teja. Immediately after the video was posted on the micro-blogging site, the Madhapur police responded with an appeal: “Our sincere appeal to all the visitors of#DurgamCheruvuCable Bridgenot to come on to traffic lane... Please be in walkway... Be responsible and be safe... and also don’t jump over the railing and don’t take extreme steps for pics and selfies.” “Traffic is not allowed on the bridge after 11 p.m. and our officials are on the bridge ensuring that traffic keeps moving and people’s safety is taken care of,” said an official at the Madhapur Traffic Police Station. Traffic is also being restricted by police on weekends on the bridge, according to police officials. In effect, the bridge will be closed for traffic for 89 hours and will be in use by vehicles for 85 hours in a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/selfie-point-durgam-cheruvu-bridge-turns-risky-for-admirers/article32757176.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Property valuation for Dharani on||The State government has launched valuation of each and every property in the State, both agricultural and non-agricultural, for incorporating them into Dharani portal, an online platform for accessing all land-related records, which will take off on the Vijayadasami day. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar issued orders, seeking basic value details of agricultural and non-agricultural properties that the gram panchayats and urban local bodies (ULBs) other than Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the GHMC itself were supposed to furnish to sub-registrar offices (SROs) for updating on Dharani. Officials said the basic values of properties had not been revised after formation of Telangana state. Hence, the values fixed by committees headed by Revenue Divisional Officers in rural areas and Joint Collectors in urban local bodies in 2013 would hold good. The committees used to revise the values twice an year in combined Andhra Pradesh prior to 2013. In the wake of Mr. Somesh Kumar's orders, Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana directed all municipal commissioners in the State to ensure that the revenue ward/block wise information of buildings and lands was furnished to SROs. The orders of Chief Secretary explained that the government had decided to incorporate the basic values of agricultural and non-agricultural properties on Dharani portal to enable property owners to know them directly without anyone's intervention. Value slabs The current basic value of agricultural properties was by and large based on classification of survey numbers into three categories. Of these, those having potential for conversion to house sites and those abutting important roads were given higher basic value. The remaining survey numbers had a lower basic value. In the case of non-agricultural properties, the current basic value was based on door and ward/block numbers. There were generally two market value slabs — general value and higher value. Door numbers that had higher value were identified and listed separately by the Registration department. The remaining properties were given general value. The Telangana State Technology Services and Dharani team will develop a web application to be used by SROs. It will enable SROs to login, select gram panchayats or ULBs and enter basic value against each property on Dharani. For both agricultural and non-agricultural properties in gram panchayats, the SROs will first record the basic values of those fetching higher values due to their proximity to highways or other considerations. Then, bulk recording of general values for remaining properties will be done. The same procedure of recording basic value of high-valued and general value non-agricultural properties in ULBs other than GHMC will be taken up. In GHMC areas, house numbers of ward/block which have higher values will be fixed with basic values. The SROs will use bulk recording feature to enter the general value of ward/block in the remaining house numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/property-valuation-for-dharani-on/article32757037.ece
03 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||OCTOPUS unit smokes father killer out of house||A mentally unstable man, who allegedly hacked his father to death at their house in Sriram Nagar Colony in Shankarpally of Ranga Reddy district, was arrested in the late hours of Thursday, in quite a dramatic way. OCTOPUS commandos had to be deployed to nab the accused. Medari Yadaiah (40), who has been suffering from mental illness for the past several years, used to frequently quarrel with his father Anjaneyulu (60) over petty issues, police said. Since the death of his mother six months ago, Yadaiah was living with his father. His wife and three children had left him a year ago. On Thursday evening too, he picked up an argument with Anjaneyulu, following which he grabbed a kitchen knife and hit him on the head, which resulted in his father’s instant death, Shamshabad Deputy Commissioner of Police N. Prakash Reddy said. He said that the offence took place around 6.30 p.m. and neighbours and passers-by alerted Shankarpally police, who rushed to the spot and tried to nab the accused. It took more than five hours for the police to catch Yadaiah as he locked himself inside the house and was moving around wielding the weapon. In fact, commandos of the Organisation for Counter Terrorist Operations (OCTOPUS) were pressed into service to smoke him out of the house. “As he could harm himself or others with the weapon, the job to get him out was assigned to the OCTOPUS, who cordoned off the area and hurled smoke grenades inside the house to nab the target,” Mr. Reddy said. As the entire house was filled with smoke, Yadaiah went to the terrace with the weapon in his hand. Subsequently, the commandos used a water cannon to disarm him, the DCP said. “When the knife fell on the ground, the OCTOPUS commandos who had already surrounded the area, jumped on the terrace and nabbed him,” he said, adding that the operation went on till 1.30 a.m. on Friday. Later, the accused was arrested and shifted to the Institute of Mental Health at Erragadda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/commandos-smoke-father-killer-out-of-house/article32757050.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Stem cell therapy for blood cancer patients at NIMS||In a big blessing for blood cancer patients requiring stem cell therapy, the State government has established a Centre for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine in the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). The facility will particularly help those from the lower strata of the society who cannot afford corporate medical care. The centre was inaugurated on Friday by Health Minister Eatala Rajender in the presence of NIMS Director K. Manohar and Superintendent N. Satyanarayana. “The centre will provide a ray of hope to blood cancer patients from poor families, those covered under Aarogyashri scheme, requiring stem cell therapy as they would be treated at the centre free of cost,” the Minister said. Mr Rajender stated samples of blood cancer patients which were sent to Delhi for diagnosis earlier can now be done here itself. The success rate of NIMS in stem cell therapy among kidney and heart transplantation patients was very high, he said, but some services were stopped due to rise in COVID-19 cases. However, all services would be resumed within a week with the COVID spread now under control. Stating that living with COVID-19 would be a new norm as the society was doing with dengue, viral fever, swine flu and malaria, the Minister said and asserted that as per ICMR statistics, about 40 lakh people in Telangana had developed antibodies to COVID. Mr Rajender admitted that COVID treatment in NIMS had impacted the treatment of other patients and made it clear that outpatient services would be scaled up soon with OP and Critical Care blocks being set up with an investment of Rs. 250 crore. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would lay the foundation stone for the new blocks soon to scale up the outpatient services from 2,500 a day in the past to 5,000 a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/stem-cell-therapy-for-blood-cancer-patients-at-nims/article32757021.ece
03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC favours comprehensive plan for criminal justice setup||Observing that public prosecutors are the backbone of the criminal justice delivery system, the Telangana High Court had directed the State government to prepare a comprehensive plan to strengthen the Department of Public Prosecution. Taking up a letter written by the HC Registrar General on pendency of criminal cases and inadequate number of public prosecutors as a PIL petition, the High Court directed the government to fill all vacancies of Public Prosecutors in the State. The State should clearly specify the time period required to recruit public prosecutors, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said. The government should spell out the amount it would allocate to the Department of Prosecution, the ways and means of training public prosecutors (those already appointed and to be recruited). The bench instructed Advocate General B.S. Prasad to present a complete report on the points raised by the bench by October 14. It requested the Advocate-General to interact with all public prosecutors and guide them regularly. The government should seriously think of constructing separate buildings for PPs within court complexes or campuses. It must explain facilities like laptops, software, research engines, ways and means of strengthening communication between investigating officers and public prosecutors, the bench said. Public prosecutors don’t have sufficient infrastructure required for strengthening their professional skills. In many courts, it was found that there was no adequate space for public prosecutors to store files or to accommodate their office, the bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-favours-comprehensive-plan-for-criminal-justice-setup/article32757035.ece

Mahender Reddy to personally appear with the relevant documents. The case in question was that of two officers of the Karimnagar police allegedly intimidating an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protester.  ‘Counselling’ session As was earlier reported in these columns in December last year, M A Mujeeb, a 37-year-old para-legal activist, was involved in an anti-CAA protest in Karimnagar. Soon after, he was summoned to the one-town police station for a ‘counselling’ session. One of the officers, Mr. Mujeeb claimed, described Islam as having the most ‘fanaticism’, and also told him to speak like a ‘true Indian’. Delhi-based lawyer Bilal Anwar Khan represented him at the human rights panel. The NHRC on October 1 stated that it had taken cognisance of the matter on January 22, 2020, and called for an action-taken report. But, no report was filed. On May 12, 2020, the NHRC gave a ‘last opportunity’ to submit the report. Despite this, no report was filed, it stated.  “The Commission has considered all the material placed on the record. Despite giving last opportunity no report has been submitted till date. The Commission takes a serious note of this non-responsive attitude. Let conditional summons u/s 13 of PHR Act, 1993 be issued against the DGP Telangana. He is directed to personally appear before the Commission on 01.02.2021 at 11 am along with the requisite report,” the NHRC stated.

03 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Removed NREGS staff stage protest||Field assistants working on outsourcing method for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), who were removed from duties in March following their strike, launched fasting in front of the office of Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Commissioner here on Friday, demanding that they be taken back into duties. President of the National Backward Classes Welfare Association R. Krishnaiah said the State government had removed over 7,700 field assistants working for MGNREGS in March this year, following their strike in support of long-pending demands. Although most of them had been working for implementation of the project for about 15 years, they were not taken back into duties in spite of repeated requests and in the meantime 14 field assistants had committed suicide due to financial problems arising out of job loss. He sought to know from the government whether it was wrong to go on strike in support of their demands and how far the attitude of the government was justified even after their unconditional call-off of the strike. Stating that going on strike was a democratic and constitutional right of employees, Mr. Krishnaiah said it was natural justice to take them back into duties.

03 October 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||I am here on Mission 2023: Manickam||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) State affairs incharge Manickam Tagore said that farmers were opposing the new Acts passed by Parliament. Addressing a gathering, while participating in Kisan Majdoor Bachav Diwas here on Friday, along with Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, he claimed that only the Congress could take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "From this place in 1979, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had addressed a meeting. I am here on Mission 2023. AICC president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi sent me here to bring Congress back to power. Congress should win 79 seats in the next Assembly elections, a symbol of revival of the party. Sonia Gandhi dreamed of making everyone in Telangana benefit with formation of the State but it was limited to the family members of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Those who felt meted out injustice after Telangana formation should join hands with Congress. Mr. Rao has become the richest in Telangana and he will compete with Mukhesh Ambani in the next five years. It was only with commissions in projects while Ambani is in business," he said. Mr. Tagore said Mr. Modi had handed over the fate of farmers to Adani and Ambani as they were going to decide the prices of farm produce. The TPCC incharge said united fight would defeat the TRS and BJP as in the case of the British. A protest programme against the three agriculture Acts passed by Parliament, signatures would be collected from the public on October 31 and would be handed over to President on November 14. The TPCC president said the three Acts were against the interests of farmers. He questioned the promises by the Chief Minister of double bedroom houses, 12% reservation for minorities and three acres of land for dalits. Candidate for Dubbak byelection would be declared in a day or two, he called upon party workers to go to Dubbak and work for victory. Former deputy chief minister C. Damodar Rajanarasimha felt that election might be held 2022 as Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao would not prefer to complete five-year term. AICC secretary N.S. Bose Raju, TPCC leaders J. Kusuma Kumar, Ponnam Prabhakar, and former minister J.

Two days ago, it was started with Pallepahad in Toguta mandal when more than 100 persons joined the party in the presence of Finance Minister T. Harish Rao. Pallepahad is one of the villages to be affected by Mallannasagar. The next day, some persons from Vemulaghat joined the party and it was stated that oustees of some villages were in queue to join the party. In the wake of this, T. Bal Reddy made a posting in WhatsAap group. He urged those joining the TRS to bring leaders to the village. “It’s an appeal to those interested in joining the TRS. Instead of joining the party by visiting Siddipeet or Toguta, better you ask Finance Minister T Harish Rao and Lok Sabha member K Prabhakar Reddy to visit our villages on motorcycles so that they can know the fate of our road on which we are travelling day in and day out. Let the bike-rally be from Etigaddakishtapur, Vemulaghat and Erravalli. Mr Harish Rao had promised to adopt our villages while acquiring our lands for Mallannasagar project.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Been there, seen that||Orey Bujjiga was initially scheduled to release in theatres for Ugadi. Had COVID-19 not played spoilsport, it would have been one of those films that never aimed high, but managed to give its viewers a few laughs during a festive weekend. The film doesn’t take itself too seriously and hopes that the viewers too will give in to the light-hearted fun and overlook its pitfalls. Director Vijay Kumar Konda takes up a story that feels like a mix of several situations, characters and plot points of films in the mid-90s or early 2000s. Sreenu alias Bujji (Raj Tarun) takes the first train out of Nidadavolu when the first talk of wedding crops up at home; his heart is set on someone else. Krishnaveni (Malvika Nair) takes the same train to run away from her impending wedding. Someone spots the two on the train platform and assumes that they are a couple on the run. The families are at loggerheads. Posani Krishna Murali as Bujji’s father is at the receiving end of the wrath of Krishnaveni’s mother (Vani Vishwanath). Bujji has to trace Krishnaveni and prove that he has nothing to do with her running away from home, to save his dad’s fortunes. And Krishnaveni has to find Bujji to prove her side of the story. The initial hour or so is packed with laugh-aloud moments. There’s nothing too striking, but it’s not bad either. Sid Sriram is also called in to add his charming touch to the blossoming romance through the song ‘Ee May Peremito’ (composed by Anup Rubens). However, the later portions become a drag. The hospital scene involving Sapthagiri and Raj Tarun begins on a fun note but goes on and on until you feel like giving up with the rest of the film. Apart from a few comic segments that overstay their welcome, the lack of depth to some of the characters makes the film disappointing. On paper, Vani Vishwanath’s character might have appeared like a complex woman of power, but it doesn’t translate well on screen. Raj Tarun portrays an effervescent youngster as usual and Malvika gets ample scope to show that she can also be good in fun parts. The portions that show her as a pragmatic young woman who knows to guard herself on social media deserve a mention. Hebah Patel is effortless in her brief appearance as an opportunist. At 149 minutes, Orey Bujjiga is way too long for an old predictable tale full of gags.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A thriller that engages only partially||Nishabdham , streaming on Amazon Prime Video, is a film in which the silence could have been used better. It has a protagonist with hearing and speech impairment — painter Sakshi (Anushka Shetty) who converses with sign language and uses her mobile phone text-to-voice converter to good effect. As though to counter this, the investigative police officer Mahalakshmi (Anjali) doubles up as the sutradhar (narrator) and many a time, is made to over-simply things for viewers. Director Hemanth Madhukar has at his disposal a talented ensemble cast — R Madhavan as the millionaire cello player AntonyGonsalves, Michael Madsen as police officer Richard Dawkins (though others refer to him inconsistently as Richard Dickens in the film), Shalini Pandey as Sonali, Subbaraju as Vivek and Srinivas Avasarala as Chandru, Maha’s pillar of support. The story happens in Seattle, USA, and the film might have managed to cut through language barriers in India as well as appeal to the global audience, if only it had a far more intriguing plot, screenplay and better written characters. On a holiday post their engagement, Antony and Sakshi stop by a haunted house to find a painting. A sudden turn of events makes the house a scene of crime, after nearly 47 years. Meanwhile, there have been cases of missing young women, including Sakshi’s friend Sonali. Shaneil Deo’s camera and Girishh Gopalakrishnan’s background score subtly and effectively amplify the mood of the thriller, using a less-is-more approach. The songs composed by Gopi Sundar are good too but one of them feels out of place, cropping up at a crucial point in the thriller. As we warm up to the characters and plot points, a few things feel amiss. Some characters are painted in broad strokes that it becomes easy to guess an ulterior motive. There are segments that work well — the fleeting moments at the beginning when the director wants us to ‘hear’ the world from Sakshi’s perspective, or Antony teaching her to play the cello by paying heed to the reverberation of the notes. But, this aesthetic film with able actors left me cold when the big reveal happens. The manner in which the big reveal happens is a huge letdown. The actors try to work with the given material. Anushka has that arresting screen presence and emotes well, as though words don’t matter much. Madhavan is saddled with a character that could have had more depth, but he still pulls it off. Shalini makes her presence felt in a role that warrants her to be little else than a grumpy, over possessive friend. Subbaraju gets his moments to shine and I wish it had been the case with Srinivas Avasarala too, who is under utilised. But then, that can also be said of Michael Madsen who is cast in a unidimensional role as an obnoxious cop. Anjali is good; if only the story and screenplay had allowed her to get to the bottom of the puzzle, this would have been a different film, and she too would have had more scope.

03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Hathras case: hundreds gather at Jantar Mantar, demand Yogi’s resignation||Hundreds of citizens, student groups, activists and politicians gathered at Jantar Mantar here on Friday evening demanding justice for the Hathras gangrape and murder case victim. The protesters demanded Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation alleging increased violence against women and atrocities against Dalits in the State. Besides the incident, protesters said they were also outraged by what happened after it, including the last rites of the victim not having been performed in her family’s presence. They chanted slogans against the U.P. Police for the manner in which they have handled the case. Addressing the gathering, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the accused should be hanged at the earliest. “Whatever has happened is painful. The whole episode — the treatment meted out to the victim, the non-registration of the FIR, her not getting proper treatment — this is all very painful,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that there is an impression that attempts are being made to save the accused. “Allow the family to meet whoever they want, don’t put them under lock and key. There should also be no politics on this incident; whether it happens in U.P, Rajasthan or Delhi, the point is that such incidents should not happen,” he said. Yechury on BJP ‘silence’ CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury lashed out at the silence of the BJP’s top brass on the incident. He said: “Silence of Centre, BJP top brass on Hathras incident and U.P. government’s response speaks volumes about the party’s authoritarian face”. Lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan alleged that what was happening in U.P. was “goonda raj” and said that the police have surrounded Hathras and are not allowing Opposition leaders and media persons to enter so that the voices of the victim’s family are not heard. Actor Swara Bhasker called for President’s rule in U.P. and hit out at the government and the police for failing to prevent a crime and also not letting her family perform the last rites. MLA and activist Jignesh Mewani alleged that the U.P. Police was putting pressure on the victim’s family to sign statements to cover up their failures and was therefore not allowing the media and Opposition leaders to enter Hathras. Bhim Army Chief Chandrasekhar Aazad called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his silence and for the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. “I will visit Hathras and ensure that the victim gets justice. We will not stop our protest until the U.P. Chief Minister resigns,” Mr. Aazad said. Students’ voice At the protest, there were a large number of students as well. All India Student Association Secretary (Delhi) Prasenjeet Kumar said U.P. has become a State where rapists and culprits get protection from the government. “In Unnao, Kuldeep Sengar was protected. And once again this is happening. Without 100% conviction rate, rape culture cannot be stopped. The district-level officers must be booked under SC/ST Act immediately,” said Mr. Kumar. The protest was supposed to be at India Gate but after the police barricaded the area, the venue was shifted to Jantar Mantar. The entry gates of Janpath, Rajiv Chowk and Patel Chowk metro station were closed to prevent people from gathering at Jantar Mantar after the crowd started growing. Following this, later in the evening, the police registered a case against the protesters. “The gathering was in violation of orders issued by NGT, Supreme Court and Delhi Police,” said Delhi Police Spokesperson. The protesters have violated prohibitory orders and other laws regarding COVID-19 and a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act has been registered at Parliament Street police station against them.  The accused should be hanged at the earliest. There should also be no politics on this incident.

These include, the extension of the Ashram flyover to the DND Flyway and an underpass at a cost of Rs. 125 crore and Rs. 75 crore respectively. Though both are intended to ease congestion at one of the most busiest transit points in the city in the long run, commuters will have to wait for several months to reap the benefits. Alternative routes While the extension of the flyover is expected to be completed only after a year, the underpass is expected to be completed by mid-2021, necessitating the diversion of vehicular traffic to alternate routes leading to a ripple effect on stretches in the vicinity of Ashram. Anjitha Chepyala, DCP (Traffic) of Southern Range, said extra traffic policemen have been deployed on diverted routes to ensure smooth traffic movement. “We have called extra traffic policemen from nearby traffic circles to manage traffic on diverted routes,” said Ms. Chepyala. “Before enforcing diversion, we have made all arrangements to avoid any inconvenience to motorists. Entry timing of heavy vehicles have been strictly monitored,” Ms. Chepyala said. Traffic police said that Ashram Chowk, the intersection of Mathura Road and Ring Road is one of the busiest crossings in South Delhi. On a 24-hour basis, about 2.8 lakh PCU (passenger car units) pass through Ashram Chowk amounting to about 11,600 PCU per hour on an average. Traffic volumes reach saturation point, both, during morning as well as evening peak hours. Reduce travel time The extension of Ashram up to DND Flyway will be through a six-lane flyover intended to decrease the travel time between Noida and Ashram due to no extended signals, allowing commuters travelling from Lajpat Nagar to Noida and Sarai Kale Khan to face no diversions or signals. Ramps of about 1,400 metres will be constructed for Sarai Kale Khan and will also be built for Ashram from ITO in addition to a subway for the convenience of pedestrians. The underpass at Ashram Chowk is likely to be completed by April-May 2021. On completion, the underpass will help in mitigating the current traffic congestion at Ashram Chowk by allowing traffic to pass through without stopping from Jangpura towards SaritaVihar and from Sarita Vihar towards Jangpura, along Mathura Road. According to the PWD, the 410-metre-long underpass will be four lanes, and after its completion, 41% of the traffic will use it.  We have called extra traffic policemen from nearby traffic circles to manage traffic on diverted routes. Before enforcing diversion, we have made all arrangements to avoid any inconvenience to motorists. Entry timing of heavy vehicles have been strictly monitored.

03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||14 arrested for stealing two-wheelers||Delhi Police has arrested 14 people under operation ‘Eagle Eye’ and recovered a total of 116 stolen two-wheelers from them, said officials on Friday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) A. Koan said snatchers have been using stolen vehicles for their crimes as noticed in the past few months. He said there is a nexus between the snatchers, vehicle thieves and their middlemen. The stolen vehicles are given to the snatchers on rent or commission basis, he added. “It has also come to fore that the criminals park the vehicles around parks, drains and other parking spaces, instead of outside their homes,” the officer said. Following this, two teams, named Eagle Squad and Eagle Eye, were formed to nab the criminals. The accused have been identified as Vikram (35), Rashid (41), Jogender (25), Asheem (28), Suraj (22), Manish (20), Deepak (29), Sumit (25), Sumit (25), Nikhil (20), Rohit (25), Amit (25), Yogesh (23) and Sagar (22), the police said. On September 25, the police spotted two vehicles lying unattended in Industrial Area Phase-1 in Mangolpuri. The vehicles were found stolen from Tilak Nagar and South Rohini. “Next, a trap was laid and after sometime, four persons arrived near the motorcycles. The accused were apprehended after they tried to take away the vehicles. At their instance, 10 more people were arrested,” Mr. Koan said. During interrogation, it was revealed that the high-end motorcycles were being provided to the criminals by the syndicate for entertaining their girlfriends, on high rental charges, whereas the low-end bikes were being provided to the snatchers on commission basis from the proceeds of stolen and snatched articles. It was also revealed that Vikram was the mastermind of the whole syndicate. He was involved in 89 such cases. A total of 116 stolen vehicles, including 39 bikes, were recovered from the possession of accused along with stolen mobiles, countrymade pistol and live cartridges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/14-arrested-for-stealing-two-wheelers/article32757008.ece

Justice Najmi Waziri also directed the PWD, along with three members of resident welfare association, to clean storm water drains and conduct video recording of the proceedings. The court said if the residents have been suffering from inundation by water in their basements, solution has to be found primarily by the Corporation. It also directed the civic body to use drone photography and work along with corporation to clean the storm water drainage. It directed SDMC to visit the houses of the petitioners and those who have annexed photographs of inundated basements in the petition, and come out with a system in place within 10 days. On previous hearing, the court had said: “As far as citizens are concerned, they have to approach only one agency for their civic amenities — SDMC”. The court was hearing a petition by Sadhana Mohan, who was aggrieved by water accumulating in the basements of their properties and in the neighbourhood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/find-solution-to-flooding-of-basements-in-gk-ii/article32756660.ece

The accused has been identified as Sunil Kumar Dubey, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Mirzapur area. He used to swap ATM cards of the victims with his and then withdraw money from their account, they said. During interrogation, Dubey said that he would specifically target Army personnel at railway stations to seek help and dupe them by swapping ATM cards without the knowledge of the victims.

03 October 2020||Mumbai,||Man quit make-up artiste job to sell drugs; arrested||The Crime Branch of Mumbai Police has arrested two drug peddlers, including a former Bollywood make-up artiste, and seized mephedrone (MD) worth Rs. 3.15 lakh from their possession, an official said on Friday. Unit-11 of the Crime Branch arrested Parvez alias Laddu Hanif Halai (30) and Niketan alias Nikhil Suresh Jadhav (30) from Rajendra Nagar in Borivali (West) on Thursday, he said. The duo were nabbed by a team led by senior inspector Sunil Mane during patrolling in the area. During search, the police found 105 gm of narcotic drug MD, worth Rs. 3.15 lakh in illicit trade, in their possession, the official said, adding that the two were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Mr. Jadhav and Mr. Halai had serious offences, including attempt to murder, cheating and theft registered against them, he said. Mr. Jadhav told the police that he once worked as a make-up man and hair dressing artiste for prominent film production houses and leading male and female actors and celebrities appearing in international reality shows, the official said. He came in contact with drug peddlers during this period and after realising that huge amounts of money could be made by selling narcotics, he quit working as a make-up artist in Bollywood. He had allegedly been selling drugs for the last four years. The Crime Branch is investigating from where he procured drugs and whom he supplied them to, the police official said. The accused ensured that WhatsApp chats with customers about drugs were deleted after reading, and the police will try to retrieve these deleted messages, he added. The arrest comes on the heels of the Narcotic Control Bureau’s high-profile investigation into alleged drug use in Bollywood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-quit-make-up-artiste-job-to-sell-drugs-arrested/article32756620.ece
03 October 2020||Mumbai,||Farm Bills: Congress launches Statewide signature campaign||Taking an aggressive stand demanding repeal of the recently-passed farm Bills, the Maharashtra unit of the Congress on Friday launched a Statewide campaign aiming to collect two crore signatures from farmers which will be sent to President Ram Nath Kovind. Congress observed the day as Kisan Mazdoor Bachao Din by organising protests across all districts and tehsils in the State. Revenue Minister and State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said, “This is just the beginning of the struggle. We will continue to work for the benefit of the farmers. The market committee and the minimum support price system have come into being after massive efforts. With the oppressive farm Bills, the BJP government plans to undermine these systems which were brought in to support the farmers.” The BJP government’s ploy was to help certain industrialists by making farmers landless by promoting contract farming. Speaking in Nanded at a bullock cart march held his leadership, Public Works Minister Ashok Chavan said that the Union government had passed the Bills in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha with a dictatorial attitude of “we can do what we want to”. “The BJP is looting the country for the last six years by bringing in such laws. Traders are now looting the country in the same way that the East India Company looted the country during the British rule,” he said. In Mumbai, city Congress president Eknath Gaikwad led the protests while Rajiv Satav, MP, and Gujarat in-charge took the lead in Hingoli. In Amravati the protest was headed by Women and Child Development Minister Yashomati Thakur. Others who headed the protests included Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development Minister Sunil Kedar in Nandurbar, Tribal Development Minister K.C. Padvi, and Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Wadettiwar in Chandrapur. The Minister of State for Home Affairs Satej alias Bunty Patil headed the protest in Kolhapur, while Minister of State for Agriculture Dr. Vishwajeet Kadam held an agitation in the Sangli market yard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farm-bills-congress-launches-statewide-signature-campaign/article32756616.ece

03 October 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Siblings suffocate to death in locked car||Two brothers, aged three and five, have died of suffocation after being trapped in a car at the garage of a scrap dealer in Mahad. The Mahad MIDC police on Friday ruled out foul play, but said that they are investigating if there was any negligence on the part of the garage’s owner. The police said the siblings, Sohail and Abbas, went missing shortly after they stepped outside their house in Nangalwadi chawl to play at 4.30 p.m. on Thursday. While their father was away, their mother, who was in the kitchen, alerted locals when the duo did not return home. Around 7.30 p.m., the brothers were found dead inside a Honda City car in the garage. The locals smashed the car’s windows and pulled out the children. They were rushed to hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival. “The car had a manual locking system. The siblings might have entered it while playing and got trapped inside. Their father was also a scrap dealer and the garage belonged to their neighbour. We will record his statement and find out if he should be booked for negligence. A case of accidental death has been registered,” assistant police inspector Pankaj Giri, Mahad MIDC police station, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/siblings-suffocate-to-death-in-locked-car/article32756624.ece

03 October 2020||Pune,||Parth’s tweets express his opinions, not that of NCP’s, says Ajit Pawar||Senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday clarified that the opinions expressed by his son, Parth Pawar, in a series of tweets on the Maratha quota issue were his own and not that of the NCP’s. Parth, who is the grand-nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, had stirred up a political controversy yet again with a string of tweets expressing anguish over the alleged suicide of a Maratha youth, while chastising his own Maha Vikas Aghadi government (of which the NCP is part of) for not doing enough to ensure justice for the Maratha community. Speaking in Pune, Mr. Ajit Pawar said with mock-irritability that he had more important things to do than commenting on his son’s tweets. At the same time, he said that everyone had a right to express their opinions by tweeting whatever they felt. “These days, youngsters tweet avidly and on a myriad number of issues…each time, I am asked to comment on my son’s tweets. I have more important responsibilities…Supriya Sule [Baramati MP and Mr. Ajit Pawar’s cousin] has already said that his [Parth’s] tweets do not necessarily reflect the party’s stance on an issue,” the Deputy Chief Minister said. Mr. Pawar, however, stressed that the MVA government and the NCP were of the firm opinion that both the Maratha and the Dhangar communities must get their due rights and that the State government was fully behind them. On Wednesday night, Parth had taken to Twitter to plunge into the politicised arena of the Maratha quota imbroglio after a student from Beed district allegedly died by suicide. “The future of an entire generation is at stake. I have no choice but to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court and file an intervenor application in the Maratha reservation matter pending before it… I am ready to carry the burning torch of Maratha agitation in my heart and knock the doors of justice…,” he had tweeted, while announcing that he would be filing an intervention application before the Supreme Court over the Maratha quota issue despite the State government already having filed an application last month seeking to vacate the stay on the implementation of the Maratha quota law in the State. Parth’s tweets had drawn the contempt of Maratha outfits like the Sambhaji Brigade, who accused him of brazen opportunism while stating that he had never once spoken out in the past when several Maratha youths had taken their lives nor had ever participated in any of the quota agitations. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, however, had expressed subtle approval of Parth’s remarks, stating that they merely illuminated the failure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government for failing to strongly defend the Maratha quota law in the SC. More importantly, Parth’s positions on recent matters have triggered tremors of suspicion that all is not well within the Pawar family. In August, a vexed Mr. Sharad Pawar, in an uncharacteristic public admonishment of a family member, had slammed his grand-nephew’s contrarian stance in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, dismissing Parth as “immature”. Meanwhile, Mr. Ajit Pawar strongly condemned the horrific Hathras rape incident in Uttar Pradesh, stating that such atrocities were intolerable regardless of whichever party was in power. “There are no words to condemn the crime that occurred at Hathras…such atrocities and grisly violence against women and backward caste community members are a blot on humanity. Unfortunately, after a few discussions and displays of righteous anger, these incidents are forgotten. The Centre must make stronger laws to deter such crimes from happening again,” the Deputy Chief Minister said. Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government for obstructing Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Pawar said that unless political leaders or social activists were permitted to meet with the kin of the victim, the truth would never emerge. “How is one to get to the bottom of these crimes unless elected representatives are allowed to meet the victim’s relatives and present their version in Parliament or in the Assembly?” Mr. Pawar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/parths-tweets-express-his-opinions-not-that-of-ncps-says-ajit-pawar/article32756622.ece
03 October 2020||Wardha,||Steady stream of visitors at Bapu Kutir||Printed copies of a speech given by Mahatma Gandhi 84 years ago were circulated among visitors at the Bapu Kutir in Wardha to mark the birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation on Friday. The Bapu Kutir is a small hut where Mahatma Gandhi used to stay in Sevagram during the freedom struggle. It has now become a tourist attraction, and is a place regularly visited by Gandhians. After being closed since March-end due to COVID-19, the place was opened for visitors on Friday on Mahatma Gandhi’s 151st birth anniversary. Every year, the Sevagram Ashram Pratishtan organises various programmes to mark Gandhi Jayanti, but due to the pandemic it did not invite anyone this time and kept its events low-key. However, the ashram management decided to open the Bapu Kutir for visitors. Secretary of the ashram, Mukund Mhaske, said all COVID-19 guidelines are being followed on the premises. “We are allowing only five persons at a time inside the Bapu Kutir. Visitors have to follow COVID-19 rules formulated by the State government,” he said. This year, the management printed a speech delivered by Mahatma Gandhi on his first visit to Sevagram, then known as Shegaon, on April 30, 1936.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/steady-stream-of-visitors-at-bapu-kutir/article32756618.ece

03 October 2020||Washington,||Trump to carry on with duties: WH doctor||The White House on Friday sent out a memorandum from President Donald Trump’s physician Sean Conley, confirming that the President and the First Lady contracted the novel coronavirus and saying they will remain at home during their convalescence. “Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Dr. Conley said. Hours before Mr. Trump made the announcement on Twitter, Bloomberg News reported that his adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive. Ms. Hicks had travelled with the President this week, including to Ohio for the first debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. In addition to appearing on stage with his Democratic rival Joe Biden, Mr. Trump had a full schedule this week, including a flight to his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a fundraiser. He did not wear a mask at the golf course or on the plane, the Washington Post reported. Mr. Trump announced that he and Ms. Trump had begun their “quarantine process” as news of Ms. Hick’s infection broke and the Trumps awaited their test results. Mr. Biden said he and his wife, Jill, wished the Trumps a “swift recovery”. “Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the President and his family,” Mr. Biden tweeted. Mr. Biden’s last tweet before the news of the President’s health situation broke was about Mr. Trump distracting the country from his “failed COVID-19 response”. Mr. Trump was supposed to hold a roundtable with supporters in Washington on Friday and later fly to Sanford, Florida, for a rally. Instead, his Friday calendar was updated to show just a previously scheduled phone call “on COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors”. First Lady Melania also tweeted about the situation, saying “too many” Americans had tested positive and were quarantining. “As too many Americans have done this year, POTUS & I are quarantining at home after testing positive for COVID-19. We are feeling good & I have postponed all upcoming engagements. Please be sure you are staying safe & we will all get through this together,” Ms. Trump said. V-P, wife test negative Vice-President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence tested negative on Friday morning as per a tweet from Mr. Pence’s office. Some 2,08,000 Americans have died and 7.3 million have been infected since the virus hit the U.S. Had social distancing guidelines been instituted a week earlier in March, the U.S. could have seen 36,000 fewer deaths and 7,00,000 fewer infections by May, as per a Columbia University study. The President has been criticised for not taking the virus seriously. He told veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward that he wanted to play down the virus so as not to create panic. In February, he said the virus would disappear “like a miracle”. His campaign rallies have been characterised by a lack of masks and little social distancing. The President’s estranged niece Mary Trump, who recently wrote a scathingly critical book on Mr. Trump, implied that her sympathies were not with her uncle but with those who were sick or had died or had been misled. “I reserve my sympathy, empathy, and despair for those who are sick and for those who have died because they were misled, lied to, or ignored. Wear a f****** mask,” she wrote on Twitter. Modi wishes Trumps President Ramnath Kovind wished the Trumps a “speedy recovery” on Twitter. “Our prayers and best wishes are with you during this time,” he wrote. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wished the couple. “Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-to-carry-out-his-duties-wh-doctor/article32756295.ece
03 October 2020||Azerbaijan,||Armenia says it is ready for mediation||Armenia accused Azerbaijani forces of striking the main city in the disputed Nagorny Karabakh region on Friday as fighting raged for a sixth day. International calls for the two neighbours to halt fire and begin talks are intensifying as fears grow that the clashes could expand into a multi-front war sucking in regional powers Turkey and Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned NATO member Turkey — which backs Azerbaijan — against the alleged deployment of militants from Syria to the Karabakh conflict. Yerevan on Friday expressed its readiness to work with international mediators to bring a halt to the fighting. Armenia “stands ready to engage” with France, Russia, and the U.S. — which co-chair the OSCE group of mediators — “to re-establish a ceasefire regime,” the foreign ministry in Yerevan said. But it said that talks could not begin unless fighting is halted. Baku and Yerevan have for decades been locked in a simmering conflict over the ethnic Armenian province that broke away from Azerbaijan in a bitterly fought war in the 1990s. New fighting that erupted on Sunday has been the heaviest in decades and has claimed nearly 200 lives, including more than 30 civilians. Armenia said Azerbaijani forces on Friday struck Stepanakert, the main city in Karabakh, wounding “many” people and damaging civilian infrastructure. Ambulance sirens were heard following loud explosions. The separatist government in Stepanakert said Azerbaijani forces had destroyed a bridge linking Armenia to Karabakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/armenia-says-it-is-ready-for-mediation/article32756289.ece
03 October 2020||COLOMBO,||Maldives’s slow progress on rights a concern, say activists||Two years  after Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih  rose to power promising to “restore democracy”, his government’s record on fulfilling the poll-time pledge could be better, say activists. Politically secure, the Solih administration — which decisively won the September 2018 presidential poll and the April 2019 general election — is faced with a grave economic crisis after its tourism-reliant economy broke down in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The UNDP termed the pandemic’s impact on the Indian Ocean archipelago, with a 500,000-population, among the worst-affected in Asia. Even as the government tries to cope with COVID-19 — over 10,000 cases and deaths so far — and its grave economic impact, its promise to probe alleged human rights abuses committed during the former Abdulla Yameen administration has not been forgotten by those awaiting justice. While acknowledging some significant gains since Mr. Solih came to power, especially in child rights through the Juvenile Justice Act and Child Protection Act ratified by the President last year, activists voice concern over the government’s slow-paced efforts on other fronts. “In comparison to the previous government, the civic space has opened up since 2018. However, this does not mean that there have not been issues pertaining to citizens’ democratic and fundamental rights, especially their right to Freedom of Expression,” said Deekshya Illangasinghe, executive director, South Asians for Human Rights. Human rights defenders, who call for freedom of religion and belief, continue to receive death threats, verbal attacks, especially on social media, she noted, adding: “civil society are still not able to express their opinion without fear or repression.” According to Mushfiq Mohamed, secretary general of the Executive Committee of non-governmental organisation Maldivian Democracy Network (MDN), while the Solih administration has brought “commendable changes” to get the Maldives back on track with democracy, legal reforms to previously enacted anti-democratic laws have been slow over the past two years. “Recently, the government restricted protests based on anti-democratic amendments made by the previous government, which it was voted into repeal,” Mr. Mohamed told The Hindu . Freedom of speech Although the Whistleblower Protection Act — passed last year — and the decriminalisation of defamation have sought to improve the environment for freedom of speech, journalists and human rights activists continue to operate in a “dangerous climate”, said Mr. Mohamed. Meanwhile, the government’s slow progress on two crucial cases has come under scrutiny. In their campaigns ahead of both the presidential and parliamentary elections, the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP)’s leader and Speaker Mohamed Nasheed and President Solih made bold pledges to probe the disappearance of journalist Ahmed Rilwan, who was known for his critical views and has been missing since August 2014, and the killing of dissident blogger Yameen Rasheed in 2017. “It is disappointing to note that, even though the current government came into power with a promise to investigate these cases, the progress has been very slow where the perpetrators have still not been brought to justice and the families remain in hope,” Ms. Illangasinghe said. When President Solih convened the Commission on Investigation of Murders and Enforced Disappearances on his first day in office, November 17, 2018, he gave the victims’ families and rights groups reason for hope. In September last year, the panel said the investigation, then “nearing completion”, threw up troubling evidence of radical Islamist groups targeting dissidents like journalist Rilwan, who they believed, was murdered on a vessel at sea. The murder of Rasheed too was linked to the case. There has been no substantial forward movement since. In July this year, the families of Rilwan and Rasheed requested President Solih to invite an international expert to assist the investigations undertaken by the Commission, hoping that would expedite the probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/maldivess-slow-progress-on-rights-a-concern-say-activists/article32756291.ece
03 October 2020||Hong Kong,||On China’s National Day, dozens held in Hong Kong||Dozens of democracy supporters were arrested in Hong Kong on Thursday for defying a protest ban as the city marked China’s National Day and its leader hailed Beijing’s new security law for restoring stability to the restive finance hub. The People’s Republic of China celebrates its founding on October 1 with a holiday and carefully choreographed festivities. But in Hong Kong, it has become a day of grievance for those worried about authoritarian Beijing’s intensifying crackdown against its opponents. Protest has been effectively outlawed for most of this year due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings and Beijing also imposed a strict national security law on the city in June. Police said at least 60 were detained during protests, mostly for “unlawful assembly”. Officers also raised banners warning crowds that they were breaching the national security law with their protest chants. Last year’s National Day, the PRC’s 70th anniversary, brought fierce clashes between protesters and police during seven months of democracy demonstrations that upended Hong Kong. Authorities denied permission for a protest march this year, citing security concerns and an anti-coronavirus ban on more than four people gathering in public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/on-chinas-national-day-dozens-held-in-hong-kong/article32756288.ece

He talks of how the young woman was “traditional”. Though she had little formal education, she would give sane advice on family issues. Her mother says she was good with household chores. The uncle sums her up in one sentence: “She was a superstar.” Following her brutal assault on September 14, the young woman fought for her life at Aligarh’s J.N. Medical College and Hospital and later passed away in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 29. Her death and hurried cremation in the early hours of September 30 by the district administration has sparked an outcry across India and protests in some pockets. The family says the authorities did not seek their permission before cremating their daughter, a claim that the district administration refutes. The ghastly incident, which has led to a political slugfest, highlights the plight of women in the State and the country, continuing caste-based discrimination, and lapses in administration. A story of discrimination The beginning of this grisly story of alleged rape and murder is not in the undulating millet fields of Boolagarhi village of Hathras, situated 200 km from New Delhi; it begins in discrimination, according to various accounts of the family. Like most girls from the Dalit Valmiki caste, the young woman could not study beyond primary school, says her father Ram Lal. “We always lived in fear of our girls getting dragged into the millet fields,” he says. The millet fields are barely a kilometre away from where the family lives. The tall crops that gently sway in the breeze now look menacing to the family, serving as a terrible reminder of what their child went through. The woman’s uncle, too, says she always preferred to stay at home. In her dying declaration, the woman had said that two of the accused men, Sandeep and Ravi, both belonging to the dominant Thakur community, had tried to assault her earlier. But she had kept quiet as she feared for the life of her father and brother. “We have been punished twice,” says the victim’s younger brother Rakesh who works as a lab attendant in Noida. “Once when my sister was killed by the Thakur boys and the second time when the administration burnt her body in the dead of the night. All I wanted was to wait till dawn and dress up my sister in new clothes for her last journey.” Despite the family pleading to be allowed to see the victim’s face one last time, they were not allowed, they say. The village was turned into a police fortress and the police manhandled anyone who tried to come out of their house that night, they allege. They say they don’t even know what material was used for her funeral. Ram Lal has an LPG cylinder, two buffaloes, and two bighas of allotted land, which is more than what many others in the village have. He works part time as a sanitary worker in a neighbouring school. While Rakesh is in Noida, Ram Lal’s older son Rajesh stays in the village. A steady income ensured that the family did not slide into poverty. Ram Lal’s house is one of the four Valmiki houses in a village dominated by Thakurs and Brahmins. “ Yeh ghar thoda achhcha hai unse (this house is slightly better than theirs),” says Khema Singh Chauhan explaining the alleged animosity between the families of the victim and the accused. In 2001, Sandeep’s father spent time in judicial custody for assaulting the young woman’s grandfather with a sickle. Chauhan is a sanitary worker in Delhi and is married into the family. “When my baraat came to this village in the late ’90s, I found the shopkeepers here sprinkling water on our money before accepting it. Not much has changed since then. They still consider us animals,” he says. Assaulted in the fields The victim’s mother, Gayatri, is inconsolable but doesn’t tire of talking to the media. In her retelling of the incident, the horrors of that morning emerge. On September 14, at around 9 a.m., she went to cut grass with her daughter and her elder son Rajesh. A little later, Rajesh returned home to tend to the cattle and stack up some of the collected grass. The mother and daughter stayed in the field. After some time, Gayatri could not see her daughter, who was working further away in the fields. She called out her name several times. When she didn’t hear an answer, she assumed that her daughter had gone home to drink water as it was an exceptionally hot and humid day. But when she was returning home, she saw one slipper belonging to her daughter lying upside down at the edge of the millet field. “She would have cried for help but I am hard of hearing,” she says. A little ahead, she found another slipper and tell-tale marks of a person being dragged into the millet fields that are thick enough and sometimes tall enough to hide an elephant. Overcome by sudden fear, she ran ahead only to find her daughter lying unconscious and naked, her tongue protruding out. Gayatri quickly covered her daughter’s body with her sari and screamed for help. Gayatri says she didn’t mention anything about sexual assault to anyone as she wanted to save her daughter’s dignity. “I sprinkled water on her face. Soon Rajesh came and we took her to Chandpa police station on a motorcycle,” she recalls. At first, the officials thought nothing of the victim’s complaint that she was struggling to articulate. When Gayatri intervened to say that Sandeep had tried to strangulate her daughter, the station in-charge took down the complaint and asked Rajesh to rush his sister to the hospital. “He sent two constables with us in the auto. At Hathras, they said they didn’t have the facility to treat her and referred her to the Jawaharal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh,” says Rajesh. The two constables had orders to accompany the family only till Hathras and refused to proceed further. Rajesh dialled 108 for an ambulance. It took the family two hours to reach Aligarh. One incident, different versions The district administration and the family have presented two different versions of the incident through videos. Some of these videos were ostensibly recorded when the young woman was taken to the Chandpa police station and made to lie on a stone slab. While Gayatri insists that her daughter was gang-raped, the district administration has tried to discredit her version by circulating a video where the young woman is heard saying Sandeep tried to strangulate her because she resisted his attempt to molest her. The administration has also shared a video where the young woman’s mother can be heard saying that only Sandeep was involved in the crime. However, in a video released by the family, the young woman is heard saying she was raped by at least two men while the other two ran away on seeing her mother. A relative of the woman recorded this video when she was in the Aligarh hospital. A source in the hospital says the woman noted down four names in her dying declaration and attributed the crime to enmity between the families. Brahm Singh, Circle Officer, Sadabad, who recorded the statement on September 22, says she mentioned the names of Ravi, Ram Singh, and Luv Kush, and so their names were added to the FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).   The family alleges the police are trying to drop the gang-rape charges so that the accused will not be sent to the gallows. An uncle of the young woman who works in Aligarh Muslim University says, “My niece had told her mother about the sexual assault when she regained consciousness. She had kept silent earlier because of social pressures. But when she told the investigating officer about the gang rape, we accepted it as her decision.” A lack of trust Vikrant Vir, Superintendent of Police (SP), Hathras, refutes the claim that an attempt is being made to save the accused. “Had that been the case, why would we [the Station House Officer] lodge an FIR under attempt to murder and atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within an hour of the incident,” he asks. Why was the SHO shifted out of his post a few days after filing the FIR, then? “I shifted him to police lines because I felt he could not win the trust of the people he is meant to serve,” he says. Vir himself was suspended on October 2. Vir, who is from Bihar, adds that Sandeep was arrested on September 19, a few days after the incident. And when the girl named the other three men, the police nabbed them quickly and added the section of the IPC pertaining to gang rape to the FIR, he says. Vir also insists that the timing of the cremation was not odd. “I have been told it is not unusual to conduct last rites during the night in this belt. Another official said if you delay the cremation, the soul wanders... The point is, there is no one Hindu way. Anyone can be wiser in hindsight. Anyway, a three-member SIT has come to guide us.” Both Vir and the District Magistrate, Praveen Laxkar, say the young woman’s father is being manipulated by people with vested interests. Rajesh says his father is a simple man, which is why he is being pressured by the administration. On October 1, in a video that went viral, Laxkar can be heard telling the family that the media will be gone in a day or two, but they (the administration) will stand by the family. He can also be heard saying that the family should not change its statements so much that the officials get changed. Laxkar has denied the contents of the video since, but the video shows a lack of trust between the family and the administration. Citing the autopsy and forensic reports, Prashant Kumar, ADG (law and order) told reporters that the victim was not raped. “The FSL reports say that no semen was found in the woman’s body,” he said. Haris Khan, medical superintendent of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, says the medical and forensic examination was conducted on September 22, eight days after the incident. On being asked about the alleged delay in the medical examination of the woman, Vir also says it was conducted as soon as the victim told them about the incident. When asked whether the police could have asked the medical team to conduct it within 72 hours considering the condition in which the woman had been brought to the police station, Vir concedes it could have been done. “There are some systemic gaps for which we all need to work together but our intention always was to do the best for the young woman. I ensured that she got the best of treatment free of cost,” he says. Shahid Siddiqui, Principal, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, says the young woman suffered a fracture in the cervical spine and a gash on the tongue, possibly because she had bitten her tongue while being strangulated. “As she and her mother didn’t say anything about sexual assault, we didn’t examine her. She had developed paralysis of the limbs. She was first admitted to the general ward but later, as her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a high dependency unit and then to the ICU where she was put on a ventilator,” he says. Neurosurgeon Fakhrul Hoda says they were waiting for the patient to stabilise. “She should have been shifted to a higher centre in the first place. There was no point in referring her at a later stage,” he says. “We have all the facilities she required,” he adds. ‘They are all low life’ In front of Ram Lal’s house stands Sandeep’s house. Sandeep has been accused of murder and gang rape along with his uncles Ravi and Ram Singh and friend Luv Kush. Sandeep and Luv Kush are 18-19-year-olds, while Sandeep’s uncles, both in their thirties, are married. There is no male member in the house except for Bhanu, Sandeep’s brother who is a teenager. None of the brothers has more than three bighas of land. The women in the house refuse to buy any story about the wrongdoings of the men. “ Koi bhi badchalan nahin hai (There is no bad character),” says Manorama, Sandeep’s aunt. In 2001, Sandeep’s father Narendra Singh Guddu and Ravi spent time in judicial custody for an attack on Ram Lal’s father. “Ravi sells vegetable biryani in the neighbouring village and was busy with its preparation when the incident took place [on September 14]. All the rice went waste that day,” says his mother Rajwanti. Ram Singh’s mother Shanti Devi says her son was in the dairy outside the village at the time of the incident. The families say Ram Lal has become greedy and wants to make money over his daughter’s death. “He wants to avenge what happened in 2001,” says Rajwanti. Bhanu says Sandeep was at home during the incident. It was Luv Kush who took water for the woman when she was gasping for breath, she claims. “He was in his field which is close to the place where she was found. And now, he has been named in the FIR.” The families describe their neighbours as “ neechi kaum (low life)” whom they won’t touch with a barge pole. When asked if Ravi would sell biryani to a Valmiki, Bhanu chuckles. “We sell biryani on a plastic plate and we don’t mix business with caste,” she says. The conversation reveals how entrenched caste is despite the trappings of modernity in the village, such as televisions and refrigerators. Handling a volatile situation Watching over the wailing women in the victim’s house, who all have their heads covered, are gods of the Hindu pantheon. When the body of the victim was brought to the village from Delhi, several people from other villages and members of the Bhim Army poured into Hathras. Many youngsters could be heard saying, “ Yeh log bhatak gaye hain, humein inko line par lana    hai (These people [the family] have lost their way, we need to bring them back on track).” The implication is that by sticking to Hinduism, they have strayed from the path of B.R. Ambedkar. The local  administration feared that these people who infiltrated into the village would cause a law and order problem. Meanwhile, on the basis of the ADG’s assertion that the victim was not raped, the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha held a protest outside the village demanding that the rape charges be dropped. Hathras is a reserved constituency in U.P. It is represented by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajvir Diler. The party holds four of the five Assembly seats in the district. The anger against Diler is palpable in the village. Though Diler is from the Valmiki community, members of the community see him as someone who is beholden to his upper caste patrons in the party. Like his father Kishan Lal Diler, who nurtured the reserved constituency for the BJP since Kalyan Singh was at the helm of the State, stories of Diler carrying his own glass whenever he visits the family of an upper caste voter are common. On September 30, there were cries that he was a blot on the community. “If a Thakur offers him a chair, he sits on the ground. Today, we made him sit on the ground in a Valmiki’s house,” says the sister-in-law of the victim. It took him more than a week to reach out to the family after the incident, she says. While Diler takes credit for helping the victim shift to Delhi, the family members say it was too little, too late. On his part, Diler says the administration let him down. “I was stopped at the Chandpa police station on the night the body was brought to the village. The District Magistrate and the former SP carried out the funeral without the family. Had I been allowed entry, I would have found a middle path,” he says. Diler says he has complained to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath about the high-handedness of the officials. Shyoraj Jeevan, a senior Congress leader from the area, agrees with his rival. “The administration lacks maturity. It should have used people like us to build bridges with the family. They tried to handle a volatile situation by forgetting that the Dalit youth of today are assertive about their rights.” Meanwhile, in the outer courtyard of the house, relatives can be heard discussing their experiences of everyday discrimination. Things haven’t changed since independence, they say. Surendra Singh, who worked in U.P. Roadways for some time, says he was taunted for his fair skin when he joined service. “My superior would often say that I submitted a fake Scheduled Caste certificate to get the job. They could not digest that a Valmiki can be fair. It led to many skirmishes in the office and ultimately I had to leave the job.” The names of the victim’s family members have been changed to protect their identity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/caste-crime-and-a-cremation/article32756287.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Flagging cess non-transfer, its economic impact||The Financial Audit Report of the Government of India by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) for 2018-19 (https://bit.ly/36uwBb5 andhttps://bit.ly/3ilJrL5)placed in Parliament on September 23 has raised significant issues of a lack of transparency and propriety. The Opposition-ruled States have criticised the Centre on the short transfer of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess revenues to the GST Compensation Fund. The C&AG’s report stated that the Government of India did not transfer Rs. 6,466 crore of compensation cess revenue in 2017-18 and Rs. 40,806 crore in 2018-19. Thus, a total of Rs. 47,272 crore was retained in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI). The report also alluded to the non-apportionment of a portion of Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) among the States and retaining it in the CFI. Boosts claim by States At a time when there is a raging controversy over the Union government’s refusal to compensate States for the shortfall in the collection of GST as per the agreement, and, instead, giving States two options to borrow, the C&AG’s report has only added more fuel to the fire of the States’ claim. These States contend that when there were surplus collections, the Union government appropriated them and when there is a shortfall, it simply distances itself, instead asking States to borrow. Levy of cesses The C&AG’s observations on a non-transfer of cesses, however, has a much larger macroeconomic significance. There are as many as 35 cesses levied by the government of India. These are earmarked taxes and the proceeds should be used for the purposes for which they are levied. A number of reserve funds or development boards have been created for these specified purposes and the collections from the cesses are supposed to be transferred to these funds placed in public accounts for defraying expenditures on the specified purposes. They are not a part of the CFI and cannot be used for defraying regular expenses. The transactions in public accounts are supposed to be done by the government as a trustee or a banker, and are not subject to vote by Parliament. The C&AG has pointed out that in 2018-19, the collections from 35 Cesses amounted to nearly Rs. 2.75-lakh crore of which only Rs. 1.64-lakh crore was transferred to various reserve funds and boards designated for the purpose in Public Accounts. Thus, the short transfer to the Public Account during the year amounted to Rs. 1.11-lakh crore payment. Besides, Rs. 47,272 crore short transfers to the GST Compensation Cess Fund, there was a short payment of Rs. 38,000 crore in the transfer of the road cess to the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund. In addition, the government collected Rs. 1,24,399 crore from the cess on crude oil which, as required, was not transferred to the Oil Industry Development Board (the designated Reserve Fund) and retained in the CFI. By short transfer of the realised amount of cess to the respective funds and boards in Public Account, the government understated revenue and fiscal deficits for the year; and it works out to more than 1.2% of GDP. Thus, in addition to off Budget borrowings to cover fertilizer and food subsidy, financing irrigation projects from the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) created by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), and financing of railway projects through borrowings from the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), short transfer of cess revenue to public accounts is a method used to obfuscate the Budget to show lower revenue and fiscal deficits. Process becomes opaque Should the government of India raise revenues through so many cesses? Cesses are earmarked taxes and to ensure a minimum allocation to important and priority programmes, this method of financing could be used. In India, even after a number of cesses and surcharges were abolished when the GST was implemented, there are as many as 35 cesses levied by the Finance and other Ministries of the Government of India. The ostensible reasoning for levying these cesses is the belief that ring fencing of revenue for specified priority purposes may evoke greater tax compliance as people can link the benefits with the taxes paid. However, when there are as many as 35 earmarked cesses, it is difficult to see all of them as priority areas requiring protection of funding. There is also a possibility of limiting the funding of important and priority areas to the amount of cess collected even when they require much larger amounts. Too many cesses also complicate the tax system and add to administrative and compliance costs. In addition, the operation of the cesses involving collections and transfer to designated funds in the Public Accounts makes the entire process opaque as the operation of these funds too needs to be monitored and audited. Governmental arrangements A major reason for the proliferation of cesses in India is to be found in the inter-governmental fiscal arrangements. Article 270 of the Constitution requires the Union government to distribute the proceeds from all Central taxes listed in the Union List based on the recommendation of the Finance Commission. However, Article 271 excludes the distribution of the revenue from any surcharge or cess levied by the Union government for any specified purpose. As the Finance Commissions are appointed once in five years, the Union government can raise additional revenue from taxes mainly through the levy of cesses and surcharges to avoid sharing them with the States. This has been practised for long and despite the adverse comments of many Finance Commissions, the Union government has found the practice convenient. This is one of the ways to partially negate the recommendation of the Finance Commission, particularly when the Centre sees the recommendations as generous to the States. After the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended that the share of the States in the divisible pool be pegged at 42%, almost all discretionary increases in taxes were done by levying cesses and surcharges. The large increases in additional excise duties on petroleum products this year will entirely accrue to the Centre. The States’ share in the gross Central taxes was 35% in 2015-16, the first year of the Fourteenth Finance Commission’s recommendation, but decreased to 32% in 2019-20, and in the current year, it could be less than 30% as a large volume of revenue from petroleum products is sought to be raised through additional excise duties. As shown by Y.V. Reddy and G.R. Reddy (in their book, Indian Fiscal Federalism , p.241), the cesses and surcharges constituted just about 3% of Central gross tax revenue in 2000-01; but in 2015-16, it was 16.5%. It could be as much as 20% in 2020-21. The issues raised by the C&AG relate merely to short transfer of funds, but the implications are much larger. They relate to obfuscations in the Budget and denying the share of the States in the divisible pool of taxes. M. Govinda Rao is Chief Economic Adviser, Brickwork Ratings. He was former Director, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, and Member, Fourteenth Finance Commission.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||After the Ohio debate chaos, the essential politics||Tuesday’s chaotic Presidential debate, and the first, between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, was unusual in that it was not focused on a substantive discussion of policies, but overwhelmingly focused on the speakers and their dynamics. So much so that debate moderator Chris Wallace, who, prior to the debate had declared his desire to be invisible, also became a talking point. Therefore any analysis of the debate (and its aftermath) must, rather than focusing on specific policy positions alone, examine other signs to get a fuller sense of the priorities at this stage of the campaign. Suburban focus It is clear that both candidates are reaching out to suburban voters but their conception of the suburbs are different. Additionally, Mr. Trump catered to his base — evidenced by his reluctance to condemn outright, white supremacism. His calling into question the legitimacy of the election because of mail-in voting also stood out in the debate. On the other side, Mr. Biden’s response to the charge that he was controlled by the “radical left” and his reference to his working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, roots are indicative of the votes he is specifically targeting at this stage in the campaign: those in the middle class (some of whom have likely not decided how to vote) and working class white voters, who have over the years shifted to the Republican party. Since Tuesday, Mr. Trump has found distance between himself and some key Republicans on Capitol Hill for his failure, during the debate, to condemn the ‘Proud Boys’ — an all-male group of “western chauvinists”. Instead, the President instructed the group to “stand back and stand by” before immediately saying that somebody had to do something about “Antifa and the left”. Several Senators including Trump supporter Lindsey Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell distanced themselves from Mr. Trump’s comments. Others, such as Susan Collins of Maine who faces a tight electoral contest also criticised Mr. Trump. With all House seats and over a third of Senate seats being contested in November, Republicans on Capitol Hill fear alienating moderates (i.e., those who are outside of Mr. Trump’s loyal vote base) and losing support among racial minorities. Mr. Trump walked back his ‘Proud Boys’ statement on Wednesday. Trump’s voter fraud narrative The President, who trails behind Mr. Biden in the national polls, signalled, as he has been doing for some time now, that in the event of a tight contest, he would allege voter fraud over mail-in ballots. Americans are expected to vote by mail in unprecedented numbers due to the pandemic and there is no evidence that mail-in voting is associated with a significant level of voter fraud in the U.S. Mr. Trump urged his supporters to watch polls at polling booths on Election Day. Critics have said this is tantamount to voter intimidation. Other talking points The President has also tried to get Mr. Biden to alienate moderates and undecided voters, who are particularly important in battleground States. He did this on Tuesday by repeatedly accusing Mr. Biden of being controlled by the “radical left” in the context of health-care policy and the Green New Deal (progressive Democrats’ framework for climate action and the economy). Presumably, Mr. Trump’s strategy was to discourage moderates from voting for Mr. Biden, who is a centrist. Mr. Biden denied he was “dominated” by the left flank of the party and that the party platform was approved by him and that he had defeated progressive candidate Bernie Sanders “by a whole hell of a lot”. Mr. Trump’s response was that Mr. Biden had “just lost the left”. Several progressive leaders have since closed ranks with Mr. Biden. For instance, on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders told ABC that he was campaigning for Mr. Biden and that his and Mr. Biden’s health-care plans were indeed different, as per a report in The Washington Post . With regard to suburban voters, especially women, Mr. Trump’s narrative is that Democrats’ reluctance for law and order would impact suburbs. His administration has also rolled back some Obama-era fair housing policies. During a debate segment on crime, Mr. Trump said that if Mr. Biden got to run the country, “suburbs would be gone”. Mr. Biden’s response was that he was raised in a suburb and that it was not the 1950s, so dog whistles and racism do not work and that suburbs were “by and large integrated”. (While suburbs are more integrated than in previous decades, most Americans do not live in substantially integrated neighbourhoods, as per PolitiFact). Mr. Biden has highlighted his working class city of Scranton as a campaign theme, contrasting it to his characterisation of Mr. Trump’s background: Scranton vs. Park Avenue. On Tuesday, he said Mr. Trump and his friends looked down upon Irish Catholics like him “who grew up in Scranton” and on people who did not have money (Mr. Trump shook his head in disagreement). Abstracting from whether or not this is a fair characterisation of Mr. Trump, this is the populist theme Mr. Biden has been pushing (it is true that Mr. Biden’s family did fall upon hard times when he was young). On a post-debate campaign tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania by train (Mr. Trump flipped both States from Democrat to Republican in 2016), Mr. Biden reached out to white working class voters. In Alliance, Ohio, he drew parallels between the economic hardships faced by those whose factories risked closure to his own father’s experience of having to leave Scranton when coal mines started shutting down. Judicial nomination Also important was the discussion around Mr. Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court; the Senate confirmation hearings of the judge are scheduled to begin on October 12. Democrats and Republicans will use the hearing to show-case issues to voters. Given how polarised the country is and how stable candidate vote shares are, there is a view that the controversy around the timing of the nomination itself will not impact Mr. Biden’s or Mr. Trump’s chances significantly. Elaine C. Kamarck analyses this in a paper for Brookings. Mr. Biden has maintained his national lead through this year of “unimaginable drama” — the pandemic, racial tensions, shutdowns and conventions. He led by 5.4 points in February and has a 6.6 point lead now. While these numbers are indicative of stable vote shares, they do not mean that Mr. Biden will necessarily win the presidency. First, polls undercounted support for Mr. Trump in 2016. Second, these are national and not State polls. Winning the popular vote is one thing, winning the elections is another. As in 2016, the outcome might come down to a handful of votes in a few key battleground States altering the Electoral College arithmetic enough to make a winner of the candidate who loses the popular vote. The candidates are clearly aware of this. sriram.lakshman@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/after-the-ohio-debate-chaos-the-essential-politics/article32756282.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Pathways to diversity||The UN Summit on Biodiversity convened on September 30 in the midst of a global crisis caused by the novel coronavirus that is thought to have spilled over to humans from an animal reservoir. In New York, member-nations of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) took note of the link between biodiversity loss and the spread of animal pathogens, calling for an end to destructive industrial and commercial practices. There is consensus that conservation targets set a decade ago in Aichi, Japan, to be achieved by 2020, have spectacularly failed. Evidence is presented by the latest UN Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 report: none of the 20 targets has been fully met. Many countries have chosen to ignore the connection between biodiversity and well-being, and depleted ecological capital in pursuit of financial prosperity. Among the Aichi targets that fell by the wayside are those on reform or phasing out of subsidies that erode biodiversity, steps for resource use within safe ecological limits, preventing industrial fisheries from destroying threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems, and an end to pollution, including growing plastic waste. A bright spot is the partial progress made on protecting surface and subsurface water, inland, coastal and marine areas. But the losses appear even more stark from WWF’s Living Planet Index, which points to precipitous declines in vertebrate populations, a key indicator, by 68% over 1970 levels. Faced with fast-eroding ecosystem health, the 196 CBD member-countries must chart a greener course, aligning it with the Paris Agreement, which has a significant impact on the health of flora and fauna. At Wednesday’s summit, India’s message was one of pride in an ancient conservation tradition, as one of the few megadiverse countries, and one that recognised the value of nature as much as the destructive impact of unregulated resources exploitation. National laws of the 1970s and 1980s have indeed shielded islands of biodiversity, particularly in about 5% of the country’s land designated as protected areas, but they are today seen as irritants to speedy extraction of natural resources. In this unseemly hurry, due process is sought to be dispensed with, as envisaged by the new EIA norms proposed by the NDA government. There is little concern for indigenous communities that have fostered biodiversity, and no effort to make them strong partners in improving the health of forests and buffer zones. Now that CBD members are set to draw up fresh conservation targets to be finalised next year, India too has the opportunity to plan a trajectory of green growth after COVID-19, around clean energy, ecological agriculture, a freeze on expansion of mining and dam-building, resource recovery from waste, and regeneration of arid lands. It should join the coalition of the enlightened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pathways-to-diversity/article32756273.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Brawling in Cleveland||When it was time for U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger for the 2020 election, former Vice-President Joe Biden, to go toe-to-toe in their first ever presidential debate, there was no expectation that the much-anticipated event would showcase bipartisan bonhomie or statesman-like conduct. Yet, the low bar of uncivility on display, undergirded by hostility and a lack of mutual respect, made the event at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, a disturbing spectacle. Almost throughout the 90-minute extravaganza of cognitive disconnect, the two candidates interrupted each other, name-called, and generally made obvious their disdain for the other. A low point for Mr. Trump was when he wilfully sidestepped a passionate defence by Mr. Biden of his late son, Beau, to segue into a vector of proven lies about Mr. Biden’s other son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Russia and the Ukraine. Similarly, Mr. Biden hardly covered himself in glory when he said to Mr. Trump, “Will you shut up, man?”, or referred to him as a clown, a liar and a racist. While many might empathise with Mr. Biden’s sentiments in this context, given Mr. Trump’s record on issues of race, his personal finances and taxes, and his penchant for indulging in acerbic bombast, some Democrats might have hoped that Mr. Biden would hold himself to a higher standard. One thing that the verbal brawl made clear is that the two leaders will likely offer radically different policy visions, in a sense making the choice between them a straightforward one on November 3, Election Day. Mr. Trump dug his heels in on choosing a right-leaning candidate for the vacant seat in the U.S. Supreme Court after the passing of liberal stalwart Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He refused to label a known white supremacist gang as racists. He stood his ground on his intention to dismember the Affordable Care Act passed by former President Barack Obama — when Mr. Biden was his deputy — by killing off the individual mandate. On every policy of serious consequence to the American middle class, whether in the realms of health care and the COVID-19 response, immigration, job creation, clean energy or women’s reproductive rights, Mr. Trump defended the very same approach he has followed for the past three and a half years. Yet his bungling, ambiguous pandemic response speaks for itself, as does his disastrous record on saving jobs in its wake, and his uncompromisingly harsh tack on immigration. Mr. Biden’s policy agenda might be an echo of the Obama years, reflecting traditional, mainstream Democratic Party values that some Americans have grown to resent. Yet, if he can convince the American people, not of any grand liberal vision but simply that he will better Mr. Trump’s low performance bar, this election might be Mr. Biden’s to lose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/brawling-in-cleveland/article32756283.ece
03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Paytm CEO rallies app operators against Google over Play Store’s billing mandate||Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma doubled down in his bid to rally Indian app operators against Google over the U.S. company’s requirement that apps use the Play Store’s billing system for in-app purchases of digital goods, by firing a salvo on Twitter. “Be the app that, you want to see in the world. Condition: If only Google let’s you be,” Mr. Sharma tweeted on Friday. Last month, Google had briefly removed Paytm from its Play Store citing a violation of its policy on gambling. Paytm had at the time called upon the Indian start-up ecosystem and developers to “think the bigger question”. “As a start-up, we are running law-abiding businesses and building for India. Google and its employees are making policies which are over and above the laws of our country, and are arbitrarily implementing them,” it had said. Several Indian start-ups have been exercised over Google’s notification on applications needing to mandatorily use Google Play’s billing system as the method of payment for access to features or services, including any digital content or goods. Earlier this week, senior representatives from almost a dozen start-ups joined a call to discuss ways to deal with Google’s alleged ‘dominance’, including setting up an alternative to Google Play Store and seeking government intervention. Industry body IAMAI, which counts Google as a member, had also suggested a meeting of founders, a community that it said was ‘on fire’ at Google’s announcement. Google clarified that all apps distributed on Google Play offering in-app purchases of digital goods had always needed to use Google Play’s billing system. “We only collect a service fee if the developer charges users to download their app or they sell in-app digital items, and we think that is fair,” the U.S. firm added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/paytm-ceo-rallies-app-operators-against-google-over-play-stores-billing-mandate/article32756261.ece
03 October 2020||New Delhi,||Successful bidder cannot withdraw offer, rules NCLAT||The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has said that once a resolution plan for a debt-ridden company is approved by the lenders, the successful bidder cannot be permitted to withdraw its offer. A three-member NCLAT bench said the sanctity of the resolution process has to be maintained and such withdrawal by a successful bidder ‘frustrates’ the entire exercise of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. Moreover, there is also no express provision in the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code to allow any successful resolution applicant to ‘stage a U-turn’, it added. “We are of the considered opinion that the sanctity of resolution process has to be maintained and the resolution applicant whose resolution plan has been approved by Committee of Creditors cannot be permitted to withdraw its Resolution Plan,” the bench headed by Acting Chairman Justice B.L. Bhat said. The NCLAT further said even under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, there is no express provision for allowing any successful resolution applicant to “stage a U-turn” and withdraw its bids, after being selected by the CoC. “Provision for submission of a Performance Bank Guarantee by a resolution applicant while submitting its resolution plan, as required under the amended provisions of IBBI [Insolvency Resolution Process of Corporate Persons] Regulations, 2016 is a step in this direction, but may not be deterrent enough to prevent a Successful Resolution Applicant from taking a U-turn,” the NCLAT said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/successful-bidder-cannot-withdraw-offer-rules-nclat/article32756270.ece
03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Tesla to enter India next year’||Elon Musk, the co-founder and CEO of automaker Telsa Inc, on Friday tweeted that the company would be entering the Indian market “next year for sure”. Mr. Musk was replying to a tweet with pictures of a t-shirt with messages ‘India wants Tesla’ and ‘India loves Tesla’. In response to another tweet in which a Twitter account stated that they were waiting for this piece of news for ages, Mr. Musk added, “Thanks for waiting!” However, this isn’t the first time that the Tesla chief has hinted at an entry into the Indian market. Last year, he had tweeted saying that import duties in India were “extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable,” amid expectation of a 2020 launch. Likewise, in 2017, Mr. Musk had said he was hopeful of an India entry in the summer of that year. However, he had later tweeted, “Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.” Had sought relief He had further said that the company was in discussions with the Indian government, requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory was built. The Commerce and Industry Ministry, however, had then clarified that it wasn’t accurate to say that the Foreign Direct Investment policy mandates any company to conform to any minimum sourcing of local components if it wanted to establish a manufacturing unit in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tesla-to-enter-india-next-year/article32756263.ece

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Sunrisers ride on Garg and Abhishek’s dazzling performance||A week’s break seemed to have made little difference to Chennai Super Kings, as it slumped to its third straight defeat in four matches, losing by seven runs to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday. Chasing a target of 165, the Super Kings batsmen looked all at sea, yet again, with no real intent shown against a disciplined Sunrisers attack. The chase got off to a poor start with Shane Watson (1) and Ambati Rayudu (8) falling cheaply. Rashid Khan and Abdul Samad then applied the squeeze in the middle overs to suffocate M.S. Dhoni's men. Only Faf du Plessis looked like forcing the issue, hitting four boundaries in a 19-ball 22, but he was run out. Middle-order struggle The middle-order of Kedar Jadhav, Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja struggled against the spinners with the score reading 44 for four at the halfway stage. After taking 18 balls to get his first boundary, Jadeja did produce a late blitz (50, 35b, 5x4, 2x6) with skipper Dhoni remaining unbeaten on 47 off 36 balls. But it was too little too late. Earlier, after electing to bat, a late flourish from youngsters Priyam Garg (51 n.o., 26b, 6x4, 1x6) and Abhishek Sharma helped Sunrisers Hyderabad post 164 after it was reduced to 69 for four. Tall order Garg and Abhishek (31, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) had the tall order of rebuilding the innings and the youngsters proved equal to the task, taking time to settle in before erupting towards the end. The duo put on 77 off 42 balls. Sunrisers lost Jonny Bairstow in the first over before Manish Pandey (29, 21b, 5x4) showed promise with some clean hitting in the V. But it didn't amount to much. After Pandey’s dismissal, Warner tried to take charge and hit Piyush Chawla for two boundaries, but the leggie had him caught spectacularly by du Plessis at long-on. Off the very next ball, Kane Williamson was run out. It was then that the Garg-Abhishek double-act unfolded. Abhishek was the initial aggressor, hitting Jadeja for a four and six, before Garg tore into Sam Curran in the 17th over, hitting him for three fours and a six. The Super Kings were tardy on the field, with Jadeja and Shardul Thakur dropping Abhishek off back-to-back deliveries. Sunrisers collected 64 runs from the last five overs, a phase that ultimately proved the difference.   Super Kings 44 for four  Super Kings were 44 for four in 10 overs. Dhoni (4) and Jadeja (2) were at the crease. Watson (1), Rayudu (8), Jadhav (3) and du Plessis (22) were dismissed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/garg-abhishek-power-sunrisers-to-164/article32756368.ece
03 October 2020||PARIS,||Halep proves too good for Anisimova||Top seed Simona Halep extracted brutal revenge on American teenager Amanda Anisimova with a 6-0, 6-1 victory to move into the fourth round of the French Open on Friday. Anisimova caused a huge upset last year when she comfortably beat the Romanian, then the defending champion, in the quarterfinals, but could not reproduce that form as she received a 54-minute claycourt lesson. Miserly mood Halep was in typically miserly mood on Court Philippe Chatrier, giving precious little away and waiting for the 19-year-old Anisimova to make mistakes. She pocketed the opening set in 23 minutes and although 25th seed Anisimova, who had dropped only four games in her first two matches, briefly threatened a revival at the start of the second set Halep raced away to victory. Earlier, Ukrainian third seed Elina Svitolina advanced with a no-nonsense 6-4, 7-5 victory against Russia’s Ekaterina Alexandrova. In the men’s section, third seed Dominic Thiem was not at his best but still had enough firepower to see off the challenge from Norway’s Casper Ruud with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win.  Dev Javia makes it Dev Javia overcame the challenge of Mexico’s Emiliano Aguilera Guerrero 6-2, 3-6, [10-8] in the second and final league match of the Roland Garros junior wild card on Friday.

03 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||Royals face the Royal Challengers test||Searing heat will be an issue when Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) meets a better-prepared Rajasthan Royals (RR) here on Saturday. Having played its first two games at Sharjah, the smallest of the three venues, RR got its strategy wrong in the game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Dubai. Here too the ground is on the bigger side and Royals’ experience of playing in Dubai will help in taking decisions. It will also be RCB’s first appearance at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium. Royals leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal accepted the fear of unknown. “We can’t really estimate anything sitting here, we’ve practised during the day a few times in the ICC Academy, so we’ll go there and take a call,” he said on the eve of the match.  Since the team has a settled overseas players’ combination, one possible change in the eleven could be replacing pacer Ankit Rajpoot with Varun Aaron. Royals has benched young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after Jos Buttler’s arrival but calls have been growing for his inclusion. Both Royals and the RCB go into Saturday’s afternoon match with two wins from three games.   RCB’s move to open the bowling with Washington Sundar paid off as the offie returned figures of 12 for one in four overs in a game where more than 400 runs were scored. AB de Villiers has been in ominous touch and it must be heartening for the team management to see Shivam Dube providing the big hits towards the end against Mumbai Indians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/royals-face-the-royal-challengers-test/article32756361.ece

And then the MI bowling unit came to the party to ensure Rohit’s big moment ended with a comprehensive win for the defending champion. Once Jasprit Bumrah breached Mayank Agarwal’s drive with his fierce pace in the Powerplay, Kings XI’s middle-order was exposed early. When canny leggie Rahul Chahar forced K.L. Rahul into a mistake — he was bowled after an attempted paddle-sweep went wrong — the fizz was all but taken out of the chase. Nicholas Pooran’s cameo did keep Kings XI’s hopes alive but James Pattinson’s variation of pace resulted in Pooran nicking one behind the stumps. Eventually, Kings XI could only trudge along to 143 for eight, handing MI a comfortable 48-run win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mi-crushes-kings-tops-the-table/article32756357.ece

Russell gave a glimpse of what is in store with three sixes at a big Dubai ground against Rajasthan Royals while Pant will be itching to throw caution to the wind and play his natural game — destructive edge of the seat hitting. In fact, Pant needs it more than Russell as three of his peers, K.L. Rahul, Ishan Kishan and Sanju Samson have got runs under their belt, something that the beefy man from Roorkee so desperately needs. This will be the first weekend of double-headers in the IPL and there couldn’t have been a better ground for that than Sharjah, which has short boundaries promising another run-feast. KKR has been slowly getting into the groove with some comprehensive performances while Capitals, after two fine victories, hit a roadblock against Sunrisers Hyderabad in its last outing. For KKR, its young pace attack of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi will have their task cut out on a batting paradise where their temperament will be put to test. Speaking ahead of the game, Capitals coach Ryan Harris believes his team was not at its best in its last match, and is not in a panic situation at all. “Coming off an unlucky loss, we just weren’t at our best for the game against Sunrisers Hyderabad. But, there’s no panicking by any means,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/capitals-vs-knight-riders-in-high-octane-clash/article32756364.ece

After scoring twice in Barca’s opening game of the season, Fati fired early at a blustery Balaidos, only for Lenglet to collect a second yellow card in the 42nd minute for pulling back Denis Suarez. But even when down to 10, Ronald Koeman’s side was undeterred and Messi made the lead more comfortable shortly after half-time, his weaving run and shot diverted in for an own-goal by Lucas Olaza. Celta hit the crossbar but never really threatened a comeback, and when the ball spilled loose after another Messi dash in injury-time, Sergi Roberto rifled it home and made it 3-0.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Worship by yagnas||Yagas and yagnas are forms of worship that the Vedas prescribe for human beings. The Gita refers to yagnas as the wish-fulfilling mythical cow Kamadenu. Prajapati created men along with sacrifice to establish a mutual dependence between the celestial beings in the different worlds in creation and the human beings on earth. When the celestial beings are worshipped in the yagnas, they bestow their grace on human beings. But though there are yagnas for fulfilment of specific purposes and desires, the Gita advises that these should be done in a selfless manner and dedicated to God without an eye on personal gain, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Janamejaya, Parikshit’s son, is totally shaken at the turn of events in his life following the death of his father under the extraordinary circumstance of a curse. On the advice of Sage Uttanka, he undertakes the performance of a Sarpa Yagna to avenge his father’s death. But due to divine intervention, it is halted midway when Sage Astika arrives at the yaga sala and asks Janamejaya to stop the sacrifice. The snakes that were yet to be summoned to fall in the fire are thus protected. In the Devi Bhagavata narrative it is shown that there is mention of this Sarpa Yaga of Janamejaya long before its actual conduct. Kadru, the mother of snakes once cursed those snakes who had disobeyed her saying that they will die in the Sarpa Yaga of Janamejaya. So these snakes led by Vasuki had then approached Brahma who foretells the birth of sage Astika by whose power they will be delivered from the curse. There is mention of another story that explains the Sarpa satra yaga as punishment for snakes. It is held that snakes resided in deep seas and that once they entered land they caused distress to people with their deadly venom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/worship-by-yagnas/article32756353.ece

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||On a glory night||Exactly 30 years ago, on October 3, 1990, after the wall between the East and West had been brought down by the people of the land in November the previous year, Germany became one nation. At Brandenburg Gate, in Berlin, a symbol of both division and then unification, The Scorpions, a rock band from Hanover, sang ‘Wind of Change’ against a backdrop of fireworks and people reunited. The event was telecast live across Germany. Walter J Lindner, then a diplomat at the start of his career, and now the German ambassador to India, watched it from his home in Bonn, wishing he had been in Berlin, but enthralled because, “We thought in Germany this [the Cold War] would never end. Many people gave up hope after 40 years of separation,” he says. To commemorate the event during the pandemic, Lindner turned to music. Thinking back to 1989-90, he felt ‘Wind of Change’ was the song that represented the era.  Reinventing a song  After speaking to Klaus Meine, the composer and lead singer, he got the rights to perform the song, and asked four Indian musicians he had played with before, if they would like to be a part of the project. Rakesh Chaurasia on the bansuri, Pandit Vikash Maharaj on the sarod, Prabhash Maharaj on tabla, and Abhishek Maharaj on the sitar, all consented. The 15th-generation musician, Prabhash says it is special for their Varanasi-based family because his father, Pandit Vikash, was in Germany, a witness to the wall coming down. Lindner, who has a studio at this Delhi home, played the guitar, keyboard, synthesizer, bass, percussion, and strings, and coordinated with Peter Retzlaff, a drummer he had worked with before in New York. Four background voices — Vrnda Dhar, Renie Mathew, Akash Gadamsetty, Shambhavi Mishra — recorded their parts one at a time in a studio, and the musicians recorded theirs at home, all within 10 days between July and August. He sent the musicians the master indicating where their parts came in, and integrated these into the master. Mumbai-based Chaurasia, who first met Lindner in South Africa at a concert, says while chord changes can be challenging for musicians schooled in classical music here, he found it easy to make the transition, because of his own experience playing with musicians who play different instruments. Then there was a singer to choose: “I needed someone who was soft but not too soft, still rocky.” He asked Gurugram-based singer-songwriter Chetan Dominic Awasthi (Chezin).   The message today  The song itself was inspired by the 1989 Moscow Music Peace, where The Scorpions and several other metal acts performed. It was the first time that bands from beyond the Iron Curtain performed in then USSR. Today, in a splintered world Lindner says what we need are charismatic politicians, a common consciousness around the globe that things have to change, and more peace movements. The main message, says Prabhash, is to live “with love, peace, and music”.  Wind of change: Day of German Unity 2020 has been released today on YouTube with an introductory address by Klaus Meine||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-a-glory-night/article32756715.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||A thumbs up to more Bengali food||Every now and then, I raise a silent toast to all my food loving friends. Some like good food, some cook well, some are knowledgeable about everything culinary — but there is one thread that connects them. They keep me informed about food developments in the city and elsewhere. That’s how I got to know about BongTaste, a new food delivery outfit in town. My friend Pritha — who was a journalist when we first met, has turned into a gourmet cook over the years, and is now a walking encyclopedia on Bengali culinary customs. She asked one of the brains behind the service — Adusyanti Chatterjee — to get in touch with me. She did, I read the menu, ordered a few dishes, and the rest, as they say, is food history. BongTastes operates from south Delhi and delivers to most parts of Delhi-NCR, but only on weekends. They change the menu every week, and rerun old favourites. There were various kinds of chicken dishes (chicken korma and doi chicken) on the menu that week, but I had already ordered a chicken roast from Utpala Mukherjee’s food service, and had cooked a Malaysian chicken for a few friends who were coming over. So we asked for a plate of kanchkolar kofta (green banana kofta ), prawns ( chingri bati chorchori ) and mutton do piyaza , all amounting to Rs. 1,160, a reasonable price, you would agree. The helpings are good enough for two hungry people. I thought I’d had enough of Bengali dishes, but clearly I was mistaken, for I relished all three. The kanchkolar kofta was a revelation. Raw banana is not something we often have at home, and the last time we did, we’d followed a southern Indian recipe from YouTube. This recipe was completely different, and I enjoyed the dish thoroughly. For this, the bananas had been boiled, then mashed with spices, boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, and green chillies. The mash was shaped into balls, which went into a mildly sweet and gingery curry, flavoured with grated coconut and then topped with ghee. It was truly subtle, and I found myself going in for seconds. This dish was light, while the bati chorchori was deliciously spicy. Some fairly large prawns had been marinated with mustard oil and spices and then cooked in a bowl — called bati in Bengali — over a low flame. Chorchori , as most know, is a mix. “This is called a bachelor’s dish,” explains Subinoy Das, co-founder of BongTaste. I suppose the name comes from the fact that it translates into hassle-free cooking. The mutton do piyaza was all right, though I fear it had too much oil. Still, the gravy was tasty, and went well with my home-cooked roti. This week they have something called a Sultanate edition: chicken dishes from Lucknow, Murshidabad, Hyderabad, and Bhopal. It has on offer Nizami murgh, Nawabi murgh, Sultani murgh and Darbari murgh (each Rs. 410). My only grouse with the service is that they don’t factor in the delivery charges when they give us the bill (Rs. 150). The amount is not much, but it is easier when the sum is added to the bill so that you have a cashless delivery. I look forward to more Bong dishes in the near future. Kanchkola , my near and dear ones tell me, is also the Bengali word for the Hindi ‘ thhainga ’, a rude upturned thumb gesture that stands for a phrase like ‘too bad’ or ‘ha ha’! I think in this case the dish — along with BongTaste — deserves not a kanchkola, but a cheerful thumbs up. The writer is a seasoned food critic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-thumbs-up-to-more-bengali-food/article32756703.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||What about us?||In July this year, the CBSE announced a 30% reduction in syllabus across subjects for students in classes 9-12, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19. Portions on citizenship, secularism, democracy, diversity, gender, caste and wildlife will not be taught to students in the academic year 2020-21. If such erasure continues in the years to come, where can youngsters turn to find out more about the people, events and social movements that have shaped the narrative of their own country? Fortunately, here are some picture books, historical fiction and non-fiction titles that have recorded these stories with imagination. Understanding the past Women are often written out of history. Dr Devika Rangachari’s recent Queen of Earth is the story of the ninth-century Odisha queen, Prithvimahadevi. Intelligent and feisty, she is married to an enemy king as part of a power-brokering deal. But rather than wilt, she comes very much into her own and takes charge of the rapidly evolving political situation. In Supriya Kelkar’s Ahimsa , 10-year-old Anjali’s life goes through big and small setbacks when her mother heeds Gandhiji’s call to join the freedom movement. From having to give up clothes madefromimported materials to being shunned by the community for teaching Dalit children, Anjali overcomes her own inner prejudices to step forward and do what needs to be done when her mother is imprisoned.  Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability, written by S Anand and Srividya Natarajan and illustrated by Durgabai Vyam and Subhash Vyam, takes readers through the inspiring life of Dr BR Ambedkar. The book documents several stories that young people will rarely get to read in textbooks, like the Mahad Satyagraha. Paro Anand’s Being Gandhi takes us back to 1984. Chandrashekhar is a privileged teenager who is trying to find ways to shirk off a history project about trying to live by Gandhi’s philosophy. When riots break out post the assassination of the Prime Minister, he finds himself embodying the Mahatma’s ideologies, unwittingly at first and then with intent. The book reminds us that the Gandhian way is as relevant today as it was in the past, and always will be. Understanding the present At a time when pourakarmikas are bearing the brunt of the nation’s fight against Covid-19, understanding dignity of labour is crucial. Kancha Ilaiah and Durgabai Vyam’s Turning the Pot, Tilling the Land: Dignity of Labour in Our Times looks at the labour ofadivasis, potters and weavers, and traces the immense contribution that they have made to society through the lens of caste, gender and religion. For the youngest of readers, Rajiv Eipe’s Anand is a gorgeously-illustrated picture book about a sanitation worker who loves to look good and keep neighbourhoods looking good, too. I remember thinking that the Constitution had little to do with my life when I was in school. Young readers today will not arrive at such a foolish conclusion if they have read The Constitution of India for Children by Subhadra Sen Gupta and Tapas Guha. Written in a wonderfully conversational style, it introduces readers to the Constitution and the key figures who helped frame it. With the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 being hotly debated, I Will Save My Land by Rinchin and Sagar Kolwankar beautifully depicts a girl’s anxiety about losing her land to hungry machines and tackles the issue of ‘development’ at a cost. Every Indian girl in this country owes their education to the efforts of Savitribai Phule. In Sangeeta Mulay’s book Savitribai Phule and I , we come to learn more about this education reformist. Two stories run in parallel: Shabri, a young Dalit girl in college in the present day and Savitribai Phule’s life told through fictional diary entries. Both of them face humiliation and hatred for daring to seek an education.  Betiyaan Bhi Chaahain Azaadi by Kamla Bhasin and Shrujana Shridhar is a call to action andazadifor youngsters.Azadifrom violence and harassment.Azadito be who they want to be.Azadito exercise their rights. The illustrations bring to mind the powerful images of the young women at the fore of the anti CAA-NRC protests from earlier in the year. Being prepared for the future With the climate crisis looming large, I want to end with Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan’s 10 Indian Champions Who Are Fighting to Save the Planet . Meticulously researched and lucidly written, this slim book is packed with inspiring stories of the hard work, dedication and real love that it takes to fight the good fight when it comes to saving the planet. It is the same hope, commitment and passion that young people today will need to draw upon to help steer India in the right direction in the years to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/what-about-us/article32756901.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Beware, I’ve changed my DP||In October last year, a bunch of fearless freedom fighters voluntarily sacrificed 12 entire hours of their internet time — but not before changing their DPs — as a mark of solidarity for the internet blackout in Kashmir while I, uncaring **** that I am, spent much of that time Googling Kangana Ranaut’s quotes on patriotism. The activists were bruised and battered, but, by god, they emerged triumphant from this gruelling, life-threatening ordeal that lasted for a nail-biting, spine-chilling, blood-curdling 43,200 seconds. After sipping on tender coconut water and chilled watermelon juice (add gin or vodka to taste) to regain some of their depleted spirit, and being rewarded for their bravery with hundreds of heart emojis from other fearless friends, these warriors went back to the business at hand: responding with heart emojis on the selfies of fellow activists, spreading brotherly love, and basically showing us how it was done. Without ever leaving home. What an eye-opener it was for a low fool like me. Here I was thinking satyagrahas were for Mahatmas, and my friends proved that to perform a new-age one, you could be a perfectly ordinary atma , didn’t have to leave home and, heck, you didn’t even need the principle ingredients: satya or agraha . All you needed was a phone. And a DP. Today, the same lionhearted folks are back. They keep coming back despite the wounds, scars and PTSD because that’s how committed and selfless they are. But for the current cause, take my word, they have pulled out all the stops. Watch out, Patriarchy! Your days are numbered. My fiery friends are here, armed with the lethal ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ T-shirts that they’ll sucker-punch you with in the solar plexus, and as you are wondering what hit you, finish you off with a (drum-roll) ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ DP. The way things are going, rumour has it that Patriarchy could soon ask for Y+ category security because it fears the T-shirts and the DPs could not just demolish its headquarters, but put its very life in danger. What a massive booster-shot in the arm this must be for the women who have been fighting Patriarchy for centuries, no? As they board trains and buses — or are trudging barefoot — to schools, colleges, computer classes, hospitals, factories, shops, beauty parlours and upper-middle class households, to study, to work, to survive, they now go with the reassuring thought that Patriarchy’s achhe din are ending. Because the ever-vigilant wives, girlfriends, sisters and mothers of the principal practitioners of Patriarchy have changed their DPs, dammit. From their previous ones, taken in Paris or Panruti. And dumb, arrogant Patriarchy didn’t see it coming, LOL. The sheer suddenness of the move, the unexpected nature of the move, the unpredictability of the move. I want to take this opportunity to thank these stoic souls who have given up this sacred space, the little virtual circle or square reserved for their own beauteous faces, repeatedly, to put their formidable social media influence behind such a range of causes as I Am Charlie Hebdo, #MeToo, I Oppose CAB, Black Lives Matter, etc. By bunging in appropriate ready-made JPEGs downloaded from the internet on that all-powerful pedestal. How are these valorous folks one bit inferior to the thali clangers, the diya lighters, the pumpkin-breakers, the chilli-and-lemon garlanders and the Go-Corona-Go chanters, tell me? India is safe in their hands, my friends. Let’s you and I relax. Because, if an all-powerful neighbour were to attack us tomorrow, we can rest assured that my friends will annihilate them with their DPs. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Housing sales slowly climb||Despite the spiralling COVID-19 pressures across the country, the Indian housing sector made a decisive comeback in Q3 2020 with sales and new launches rebounding to 65% and 79% of pre-Covid levels (Q1 2020) respectively. The top seven cities witnessed housing sales of approx. 29,520 units in Q3 2020 as against 45,200 units in the pre-Covid quarter of Q1 2020. Sales were significantly higher than the preceding quarter, when the pandemic had brought sales down to just 12,730 units. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, says, “MMR, Bengaluru, NCR and Pune altogether accounted for 84% sales in the July-Sept quarter. MMR saw maximum sales of 9,200 units, followed by Bengaluru with 5,400 units, NCR with 5,200 units and Pune with 4,850 units.” In terms of new launches, the top seven cities witnessed supply of approx. 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as against 41,220 units in Q1 2020 — reaching over 79% of the pre-Covid quarter levels. “Cities like Hyderabad, Kolkata and NCR saw new supply increase during the quarter as against the first quarter of 2020. Most new launches in the quarter happened virtually,” adds Puri. New supply vs. unsold stock Interestingly, the cities of Hyderabad, Kolkata and NCR saw their new supply increase by 45%, 24% and 10% respectively during the period. The affordable and mid segments (priced up to Rs. 80 lakh) comprised over 72% share (approx. 23,290 units) of the total new supply between July-Sept. Unsold inventory in the top cities shrunk by approx. 3% on a yearly basis: from 6.56 lakh units back in Q3 2019 to 6.36 lakh units in Q3 2020. It reduced by 1% between Q1 2020 and Q3 2020. Thus, despite the inexorable rise of Covid cases and periodic local lockdowns, residential sales and new launches saw reasonable momentum in Q3 2020. On a q-o-q basis, the jump has been massive for both new launches and sales; the Apr-Jun quarter was more of an outlier with most activity at a standstill. Currently, reduced stamp duty charges in Maharashtra, coupled with developers’ incentives and rock-bottom home loan interest rates, are a major attraction for home buyers. This indicates that the upcoming festive season quarter (Oct-Dec) may see housing sales recover to almost pre-pandemic levels. New launch overview The top seven cities recorded new launches of approx. 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as opposed to 41,220 units in Q1 2020 — reaching nearly 79% of the pre-Covid quarter. However, there is a massive jump over Q2 2020 that saw merely 1,390 units being launched. Key cities contributing to Q3 2020 new unit launches included MMR, NCR, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, together accounting for a 78% addition to the housing stock. MMR saw approx. 7,890 units launched in Q3 2020 as against 10,490 units in Q1 2020. Over 53% of the new supply in this quarter was added in the sub Rs. 80 lakh budget segment, while 28% new supply was added between Rs. 80 lakh and Rs. 1.5 crore budget segment. NCR added approx. 6,810 units in Q3 2020 against 6,190 units in Q1 2020 — an increase of 10%. Over 76% of the new supply was added in sub Rs. 80 lakh segment. Bengaluru added new supply of approx. 5,840 units in Q3 2020 as compared to 8,600 units in Q1 2020 — thus touching 68% of the pre-pandemic quarter. Hyderabad added approx. 4,900 units in Q3 2020, a significant increase of 45% over Q1 2020. Approx. 88% new supply was added in sub Rs. 80 lakh price bracket. Pune new launches rebound to 54% of the pre-Covid quarter with approx. 4,200 units being launched in Q3 2020. Chennai added approx. 1,560 units in Q3 2020 as against 3,680 units in Q1 2020 — reaching back at 42% of the pre-pandemic quarter. Kolkata added approx. 1,350 units in Q3 2020 as against 1,090 units, an increase of 24% over Q1 2020. Q3 sales digest Approx. 29,520 units were sold in Q3 2020 — rebounding back to 65% of Q1 2020. Interestingly, in comparison to the preceding quarter, sales have increased by over 132% in the top cities. MMR saw nearly 9,200 units sold in Q3 2020 as against 13,910 units in Q1 2020 — sales effectively come back to 66% of the pre-pandemic quarter. Bengaluru recorded approx. 5,400 units sold in Q3 2020 against 8,630 units in Q1 2020 — regaining 63% of business. NCR witnessed sales of 5,200 units in Q3 2020 against 8,150 units in in Q1 2020 — 64% of the Q1 2020 levels. Pune saw 4,850 units sold in Q3 2020 as against 7,200 units in Q1 2020 — back at 67% of pre-pandemic levels. Hyderabad saw 1,650 units sold in Q3 2020 as compared to 2,680 units in Q1 2020 — sales are back at 62% of Q1 2020 levels. Kolkata saw housing sales of 1,620 units in Q3 2020 and 2,440 units in Q1 2020 quarter — recovering to 66% of Q1 2020 levels Chennai saw approx. 1,600 units sold in Chennai in in Q3 2020 against 2,190 units in Q1 2020, rebounding to 73% of Q1 2020 levels Unsold inventory decreased by approx. 1%: from 6.44 lakh units in Q1 2020 to 6.36 lakh units by Q3 2020 and 3% on yearly basis — it was 6.56 lakh units in Q3 2019. If we look at the performance on a yearly basis, Bengaluru saw the maximum reduction of 3% in its unsold stock — from nearly 62,800 units in Q3 2019 to approx. 60,820 units in Q3 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/housing-sales-slowly-climb/article32756915.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Which colour do you choose?||An accent wall adds immediate impact to any room. Make your living room striking by shunning the regular colour choices and opting for one of these fresh ones. May we suggest getting the family together to give the accent wall a makeover? It’s something exciting to do in these times when the pandemic has put us all under house arrest. 1. Ebony  It is generally believed that dark colours make spaces look smaller. But, deep, dark colours can add to the illusion of space and might be perfect for smaller living rooms. Let’s not forget the intimate and cozy touch ebony gives. 2. Mustard  It may bean unexpected take, but the shade promises to be a winner if your space has furniture and décor items of earthy hues. Extremely Mediterranean in nature, we think. 3. Wine  Wine and similar purples go well with formal spaces and that’s why are perfect apt for your living room. If your drawing room has sparkly items such as a crystal chandelier, a dark purple shade will add richness. Conversations in such settings are known to last long into the night. 4. Fire engine red  There is nothing to be alarmed about this. Red is said to invigorate and enliven activity so use this shade to give your room a jolt of energy. The intensity created by a bold red is matched by very few colours. You can tone down the other accessories if the room appears extra loud. 5. Graphite  Grey walls have the ability to highlight pretty architectural detailing that would otherwise go unnoticed with other colours. If you are going for grey, you may want to paint everything the same shade and not leave out the trim or borders. This will help the eye move over the entire space as a whole. 6. Rouge  If your personality is vivacious, a bright pink may be your colour. Add a splash of colour to your living room with poppy pink and you will find your living room becoming the hot spot for everything lively! If the pink looks too glaring, you can tone it down to a peachy pink. 7. Emerald  You can play with green if your furniture is unassuming. A rich emerald green can give the room a magnificent character clubbed with a few thoughtfully placed gold details. Visually stunning, we say.  Deep, dark colours can add to the illusion of space and might be perfect for smaller living rooms||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/which-colour-do-you-choose/article32756922.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Plotted developments get a boost||Amidst rising demand for plots, some of India’s top developers have ventured into plotted developments. With buyer preference heavily skewed towards established real estate brands, it is a dynamic opportunity for these players. In earlier years, plotted developments were largely offered by smaller developers. The top cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Gurugram are seeing high demand for plots in the wake of the new realities presented by the pandemic. Some of the leading developers with plotted developments now include DLF Ltd., Mahindra Lifespaces, Raheja Group, Godrej Properties, Century Real Estate, Puravankara’s Provident Housing, Shriram Properties, Goel Ganga, TVS and Alpha Corp, among others. Sizing it up The minimum size of marketable plots is as low as 550 sq. ft., and goes up to 10,000 sq. ft. In select projects, larger plots are also available. Plot sizes ranging between 1,200 sq.ft. and 2,500 sq. ft. are seeing maximum demand. However, in the southern cities of Bengaluru and Chennai, smaller plots of average sizes 550 - 750 sq. ft. are also generating interest. Several plotted development projects have also been pre-launched in distant locales of MMR over the past few months. Interestingly, these projects have larger-sized plots than in the southern cities. The minimum plot size starts at 1,600 sq. ft. and goes up to 5,000 sq. ft. on an average. Price matters The starting price for plotted developments in the top cities is as low as Rs. 14 lakh. Plots priced up to Rs. 70 lakh currently see the maximum demand, though larger plots are also seeing traction. Prominent micro markets with new plotted developments include:  Bengaluru: Major micro-markets for plotted developments include Devanahalli, Jigani, Varthur, Dodaballapur Road and Yelahanka. Average plot sizes range between 600 sq.ft. and 5,000 sq. ft. with prices ranging from Rs. 25 lakh to beyond Rs. 3 crore.  Pune: Top areas include Wagholi, Undri and Talegaon Dabhade, among others. Average plot sizes range between 600 sq.ft. and 6,600 sq. ft. while prices start as low as Rs. 14 lakh.  Chennai: Prominent locations with plotted developments are Iyappanthangal, Puddupakkam, Vandalur and West Tambaram, among others. Plot sizes start from 560 sq. ft. and are priced from Rs. 14 lakh onwards. There is a high demand for plots priced within Rs. 50 lakh.  MMR: Key markets for plotted developments include Neral, Warai, Shahpur, Palghar, Boisar and Khalapur, with many projects in the pre-launch stage. Plot sizes here are fairly larger than in the southern cities, starting at 1,600 sq. ft. with prices beginning at Rs. 16 lakh.  Gurugram: Popular areas for recently-launched plotted developments include Sohna and Sector 72. Plots are priced at Rs. 30 lakh and above.  Hyderabad: Markets with new developments supply include Rajendra Nagar, Shadnagar and Serilingampally, with average plot sizes ranging between 1,200 sq.ft. and 8,000 sq. ft. A win-win proposition As Mark Twain put it, ‘Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.’ In India, investment in land is a time-honoured tradition and the ongoing crisis has further strengthened demand for land as a long-term investment. Some buyers are even considering plots in gated societies, as standalone homes are the safest bet in a pandemic situation. The rise of the work from home culture is also closely interrelated here. Buyers The relative affordability of plots compared to built-up real estate  Potentially good returns on patient land investment  Proposed infrastructure projects in city peripheries provide a strong rationale for invest in land now and reaping the benefits on their completion Developers  For developers, plotted development is a smart strategy to liquidate land banks for raising working capital  Minimal capital investment, limited project execution risks and faster exit opportunity  Plotted developments by branded developers are in highest demand.

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||An agreement for joint development||I am a property owner and I wish to enter into a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with a developer. I have the following queries: 1- Are the JDA agreement, builders agreement and construction agreement the same document? 2. In a JV, is registration compulsory for both, the landowner and apartment buyers in Tamil Nadu (TN)? 3. Please advise on the registration fees in TN, and where it is done in Chennai? 4. Should amendments to the JDA be registered? 5. Does a Supplementary JDA need to be registered? M. Pavan Kumar Chennai At the outset, you should consult your lawyer and chartered accountant before settling the terms with the developer and go by their advice during the course of the project. However the following can be taken as general guidelines. In a usual joint development scenario, the owner(s) enter into a JDA with the developer setting out the terms of understanding, such as the ratio of sharing of built up area in the proposed building, advance (refundable or non refundable), time for completion of the construction, consequences for delay/default, authority to obtain approvals, undertake construction, mortgage or sale of the developer’s share etc. As on date, there is no provision to register a JDA (including amendments or supplemental deeds) and the same would be valid and enforceable even without registration. Once the building plans are approved by the statutory authorities, there will be a clarity in the details of the apartments, car parking slots and proportionate undivided share in land. At that point of time, an Allocation Agreement (supplementary agreement) can be executed, following the JDA, earmarking the apartments allotted to each of the parties. If the built up area of flats do not exactly match to the ratio agreed under the JDA, the parties can mutually agree to adjust the same on monetary consideration. The said document also does not require registration. The developer may also require a Deed of Power of Attorney pursuant to the terms agreed in the JDA. If the owner(s) retain their share of built up area, construction agreement(s) should be entered into with the developer and the same has to be registered. The stamp duty and registration charges would be 2% of the cost of construction and this document has to be registered in the sub-registrar’s office having jurisdiction over the location of the property. As regards third party purchasers, sale deeds for undivided share of land and corresponding construction agreement would be registered in their favour. Though the agreements with the developer used to be called as Builders Agreement, after the introduction of TN RERA Rules, it is advisable to adopt the term Construction Agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/an-agreement-for-joint-development/article32756918.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||What about us?||In July this year, the CBSE announced a 30% reduction in syllabus across subjects for students in classes 9-12, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19. Portions on citizenship, secularism, democracy, diversity, gender, caste and wildlife will not be taught to students in the academic year 2020-21. If such erasure continues in the years to come, where can youngsters turn to find out more about the people, events and social movements that have shaped the narrative of their own country? Fortunately, here are some picture books, historical fiction and non-fiction titles that have recorded these stories with imagination. Understanding the past Women are often written out of history. Dr Devika Rangachari’s recent Queen of Earth is the story of the ninth-century Odisha queen, Prithvimahadevi. Intelligent and feisty, she is married to an enemy king as part of a power-brokering deal. But rather than wilt, she comes very much into her own and takes charge of the rapidly evolving political situation. In Supriya Kelkar’s Ahimsa , 10-year-old Anjali’s life goes through big and small setbacks when her mother heeds Gandhiji’s call to join the freedom movement. From having to give up clothes madefromimported materials to being shunned by the community for teaching Dalit children, Anjali overcomes her own inner prejudices to step forward and do what needs to be done when her mother is imprisoned.  Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability, written by S Anand and Srividya Natarajan and illustrated by Durgabai Vyam and Subhash Vyam, takes readers through the inspiring life of Dr BR Ambedkar. The book documents several stories that young people will rarely get to read in textbooks, like the Mahad Satyagraha. Paro Anand’s Being Gandhi takes us back to 1984. Chandrashekhar is a privileged teenager who is trying to find ways to shirk off a history project about trying to live by Gandhi’s philosophy. When riots break out post the assassination of the Prime Minister, he finds himself embodying the Mahatma’s ideologies, unwittingly at first and then with intent. The book reminds us that the Gandhian way is as relevant today as it was in the past, and always will be. Understanding the present At a time when pourakarmikas are bearing the brunt of the nation’s fight against Covid-19, understanding dignity of labour is crucial. Kancha Ilaiah and Durgabai Vyam’s Turning the Pot, Tilling the Land: Dignity of Labour in Our Times looks at the labour ofadivasis, potters and weavers, and traces the immense contribution that they have made to society through the lens of caste, gender and religion. For the youngest of readers, Rajiv Eipe’s Anand is a gorgeously-illustrated picture book about a sanitation worker who loves to look good and keep neighbourhoods looking good, too. I remember thinking that the Constitution had little to do with my life when I was in school. Young readers today will not arrive at such a foolish conclusion if they have read The Constitution of India for Children by Subhadra Sen Gupta and Tapas Guha. Written in a wonderfully conversational style, it introduces readers to the Constitution and the key figures who helped frame it. With the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 being hotly debated, I Will Save My Land by Rinchin and Sagar Kolwankar beautifully depicts a girl’s anxiety about losing her land to hungry machines and tackles the issue of ‘development’ at a cost. Every Indian girl in this country owes their education to the efforts of Savitribai Phule. In Sangeeta Mulay’s book Savitribai Phule and I , we come to learn more about this education reformist. Two stories run in parallel: Shabri, a young Dalit girl in college in the present day and Savitribai Phule’s life told through fictional diary entries. Both of them face humiliation and hatred for daring to seek an education.  Betiyaan Bhi Chaahain Azaadi by Kamla Bhasin and Shrujana Shridhar is a call to action andazadifor youngsters.Azadifrom violence and harassment.Azadito be who they want to be.Azadito exercise their rights. The illustrations bring to mind the powerful images of the young women at the fore of the anti CAA-NRC protests from earlier in the year. Being prepared for the future With the climate crisis looming large, I want to end with Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan’s 10 Indian Champions Who Are Fighting to Save the Planet . Meticulously researched and lucidly written, this slim book is packed with inspiring stories of the hard work, dedication and real love that it takes to fight the good fight when it comes to saving the planet. It is the same hope, commitment and passion that young people today will need to draw upon to help steer India in the right direction in the years to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/what-about-us/article32756678.ece
03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Beware, I’ve changed my DP||In October last year, a bunch of fearless freedom fighters voluntarily sacrificed 12 entire hours of their internet time — but not before changing their DPs — as a mark of solidarity for the internet blackout in Kashmir while I, uncaring **** that I am, spent much of that time Googling Kangana Ranaut’s quotes on patriotism. The activists were bruised and battered, but, by god, they emerged triumphant from this gruelling, life-threatening ordeal that lasted for a nail-biting, spine-chilling, blood-curdling 43,200 seconds. After sipping on tender coconut water and chilled watermelon juice (add gin or vodka to taste) to regain some of their depleted spirit, and being rewarded for their bravery with hundreds of heart emojis from other fearless friends, these warriors went back to the business at hand: responding with heart emojis on the selfies of fellow activists, spreading brotherly love, and basically showing us how it was done. Without ever leaving home. What an eye-opener it was for a low fool like me. Here I was thinking satyagrahas were for Mahatmas, and my friends proved that to perform a new-age one, you could be a perfectly ordinary atma , didn’t have to leave home and, heck, you didn’t even need the principle ingredients: satya or agraha . All you needed was a phone. And a DP. Today, the same lionhearted folks are back. They keep coming back despite the wounds, scars and PTSD because that’s how committed and selfless they are. But for the current cause, take my word, they have pulled out all the stops. Watch out, Patriarchy! Your days are numbered. My fiery friends are here, armed with the lethal ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ T-shirts that they’ll sucker-punch you with in the solar plexus, and as you are wondering what hit you, finish you off with a (drum-roll) ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ DP. The way things are going, rumour has it that Patriarchy could soon ask for Y+ category security because it fears the T-shirts and the DPs could not just demolish its headquarters, but put its very life in danger. What a massive booster-shot in the arm this must be for the women who have been fighting Patriarchy for centuries, no? As they board trains and buses — or are trudging barefoot — to schools, colleges, computer classes, hospitals, factories, shops, beauty parlours and upper-middle class households, to study, to work, to survive, they now go with the reassuring thought that Patriarchy’s achhe din are ending. Because the ever-vigilant wives, girlfriends, sisters and mothers of the principal practitioners of Patriarchy have changed their DPs, dammit. From their previous ones, taken in Paris or Panruti. And dumb, arrogant Patriarchy didn’t see it coming, LOL. The sheer suddenness of the move, the unexpected nature of the move, the unpredictability of the move. I want to take this opportunity to thank these stoic souls who have given up this sacred space, the little virtual circle or square reserved for their own beauteous faces, repeatedly, to put their formidable social media influence behind such a range of causes as I Am Charlie Hebdo, #MeToo, I Oppose CAB, Black Lives Matter, etc. By bunging in appropriate ready-made JPEGs downloaded from the internet on that all-powerful pedestal. How are these valorous folks one bit inferior to the thali clangers, the diya lighters, the pumpkin-breakers, the chilli-and-lemon garlanders and the Go-Corona-Go chanters, tell me? India is safe in their hands, my friends. Let’s you and I relax. Because, if an all-powerful neighbour were to attack us tomorrow, we can rest assured that my friends will annihilate them with their DPs. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/beware-ive-changed-my-dp/article32756680.ece
03 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Seven months on, tensions still writ large in Shiv Vihar||As one enters north-east Delhi’s Shiv Vihar, the dug-up streets are a reminder of the large-scale destruction witnessed in the area during the communal violence that erupted in the city in February this year. Seven months on, the locals are still jittery. Adding to their anxiety and fears has been recent incidents of loud chanting of religious slogans for two consecutive Tuesdays. On September 22, the local Muslim community submitted an application at the Karawal Nagar police station stating they hoped that the police would not allow miscreants to cause problems in the area. Based on this, police personnel were deployed at strategic locations. The last two Tuesdays (September 22 and 29) have been peaceful, they said. “We have not forgotten what happened seven months ago... how houses were burnt and vandalised... how we fled our homes... and it looks like they are ready to repeat it,” cried Zarina Begum (63), who has been living in the area for 35 years. A 48-year-old resident of street number 13 near Madeena Masjid, which was damaged during the riots, said that it was after sunset on September 15 when loud chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ were heard. Second time in a row Groups of men were seen holding saffron flags and roaming the streets. “We told our young sons to stay indoors fearing the matter might escalate. Because it had happened for the second time in a row, all the elderly women decided to go and talk to the people who seemed to be doing the chanting… where people had gathered in large numbers,” she said, adding that they went and talked to a resident who lives on a street close to the mosque. Subsequently, police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) officials who have been stationed in the area since February were called in and the matter was settled, the locals said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East) Ved Prakash Surya said, “Shiv Vihar is a mixed population area. One community was observing their religious practices, which was misconstrued by the other community. Respectable members from both the communities were called and their apprehensions were amicably resolved. The situation is absolutely normal and peaceful.” Similar religious chants were heard on September 8. A teenager who claimed to have been part of Hanuman Chalisa recitals in the area for the past 25 weeks said they would continue the practice. When asked if he was aware of groups of men roaming the streets chanting slogans, he denied any knowledge. Vandana Gupta, a resident of the area who organised the Tuesday recitations, submitted a complaint with the police on September 18 alleging that the worshipping of September 15 was interrupted by a group of people who threatened them and she is scared. In Ms. Gupta’s opinion, the riots were started by the Muslims, and the Hindus only reacted. “If they had not started it, this would not have happened with them,” she said, referring to the burnt and vandalised houses of Muslims in the area. Ms. Gupta claimed she saved the only Muslim house on her street and ensured the safety of her neighbours till February 26. But, now the relationship of the Hindus on the street with the sole Muslim family have soured, she added. “Just to get compensation, they [the Muslim family] told police that Rs. 6 lakh and gold were stolen from their house. It brought bad name to the street and we do not believe that they could have had that kind of money or gold,” Ms. Vandana said. Arti, another resident, said: “We are only performing a pooja, we are not selling arms and ammunition. They perform their namaaz anywhere anytime, why should they have a problem with us?” Soured relationships She admitted that relationships between the communities had changed after the riots. “There used to be a lot of exchange of food earlier, our kids used to address them as chacha, mausi, bua... but now there is hardly any interaction,” she said. Zarina, a resident, echoed the opinion. “Hindu neighbours do not see eye to eye. These are the same people who gave us shelter when rioters were torching our houses. Their attitudes changed after we returned to our houses,” she said. The community is finding it difficult to deal with the mental stress of the recent incidents, we have not yet recovered from the February riots and the subsequent lockdown due to COVID-19, said Muniza, another resident.. “Our children have yet not been able to find work. We were also blamed for spreading the novel coronavirus. People have only now started to rebuild their houses,” she added. Imam of Madeena Masjid Mohammed Zahid, who has been supervising the reconstruction of the mosque, said that work started two months ago and it would take another month to finish. “Cylinder blasts inside the building broke parts of the floor and walls. Everything was destroyed,” he said. Pointing to a poster outside the mosque that read ‘Ravaged in Delhi Riots - 2020’, the Imam added that masjids in the area are being reconstructed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the largest and oldest Muslim organisation in the country. “Most of the Hindus living around the mosque are friendly and warm. Even after the Friday prayers [October 2], many of them lined up outside the mosque for a religious practice to cure their ailing children,” he said, referring to an age-old belief that children can be cured of a disease if an Imam blows into their ear. Most Muslims in the area are either running bakery shops or sew for a living; the younger generation mainly does labour work. A majority of the Hindus are rickshaw drivers, sell vegetables or work in factories in Gandhi Nagar. Locals from both communities said people who run their own business have begun to earn slowly, but labourers and those doing small-time private jobs are yet to start to earning “proper” money. “ Kaam halka hi hai (work is slow),” said 23-year-old Abdul, who runs a tailoring shop in the area. Tensed atmosphere Locals said the atmosphere of the area is always charged. Around three weeks ago, an argument over the shutting of an iron gate escalated to the point where members of both communities got involved, and the police was nearly called in. “Even the smallest of matters can lead to something disastrous here,” rued locals. Gulshan (23) is concerned about girls in the area. “If the situation remains like this, none of our elders will allow us to go out to study or work. They still don’t. What will we do with our lives?” she said. Members of the Muslim community claim to have lost faith in the police as well. “Whatever we say falls on deaf ears. This Tuesday, both RAF and police officials said it is only chanting and that no one has abused us,” said Akram Hussain. “Lord Ram never taught violence. He was peace-loving and sacrificing. No religion teaches hate,” said Asmat (53), who is planning to shift from Shiv Vihar to Mustafabad fearing safety of her two young daughters. Two saffron flags were planted outside her house on August 5 — the day Bhoomi Pujan ceremony for the Ram Temple was performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/seven-months-on-tensions-still-writ-large-in-shiv-vihar/article32756603.ece
03 October 2020||Chandigarh,||Is there ‘jungle raj’ prevailing in Haryana, asks Punjab CM||A day after Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter the State, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday hit back, asking if a “jungle raj” is prevailing there. Reacting sharply to the Mr. Vij’s remarks, Captain Amarinder said it is a futile move to stifle the voice of an angry nation. He warned that such dictatorial steps would only strengthen the resolve of the Congress to fight for the rights of farmers. “Is there a jungle raj in Haryana that you can stop anyone, least of all a duly elected leader of a national political party, from entering the State or from raising his voice against the injustice being meted out to farmers,” the Chief Minister asked the Haryana government in a statement. Coming on the heels of the assault and cases registered by the UP Police against Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and seen in the context of the earlier lathicharge by the Haryana Police against agitating farmers, it is clear that BJP governments were bent on suppressing the voice of the Opposition in total violation of the democratic rights enshrined in the Constitution, he said. Capt. Amarinder said the Congress will not be cowed down by such autocratic and undemocratic actions of the BJP-led governments, either at the Centre or in the States . “If they think they can break the will of the Congress leadership or quell all opposition with such high-handedness, they are living in a fool’s paradise,” he said. “History stands testimony to the fact that the voice of the people only gets stronger if it is sought to be crushed by force,” Capt. Amarinder warned. Mr. Vij had on Thursday had said Rahul Gandhi’s proposed tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter Haryana. “They will not be allowed to disturb Haryana’s atmosphere. Earlier, two Congress-sponsored rallies were stopped from entering the State. Likewise, we will stop his rally and won’t allow him enter Haryana,” he had told reporters.  Tractor rallies Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana from October 4-6 to protest against the contentious farm laws. “Rahul will start his Kisan Mazdoor Yatra on October 4 from Punjab’s Moga. On October 6, this yatra will enter Haryana from the Pehowa border,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in Kaithal on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/is-there-jungle-raj-prevailing-in-haryana-asks-punjab-cm/article32756593.ece
03 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Farmers’ outfit to stage protests across Haryana against new Acts||The Haryana chapter of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination Committee (AIKSCC) on Friday announced to hold demonstrations across the State intensifying the stir against the three agriculture Bills passed by the Parliament recently. The farmers would hold a protest demonstration outside the residence of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala in Sirsa on October 6, seeking his resignation and would show black flags to the leaders of the parties in the State supporting the legislations, said Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, also a member of All-India Working Group of AIKSCC, at a press conference in Rohtak. He was announcing the programme for protest demonstrations in a phased manner on behalf of 20 farmers’ organisations in Haryana, which are part of AIKSCC, a coalition of around 200 farmers and labourers’ groups across the country. These farmers’ groups in Haryana will observe October 14 as the ‘Minimum Support Price Right Day’ and gherao Delhi on November 26 and 27. Mr. Yadav said either Mr. Chautala should give up his position for the sake of farmers or the farmers should eventually leave him. He ridiculed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his utter desperation in the wake of “Bharat bandh” on September 25 against the pro-corporate legislations which no one had ever demanded and were being forcibly “bestowed on the peasantry already reeling under unprecedented crisis”. Kisan Sabha state vice-president Inderjit Singh countered the “misleading” claims of Haryana CM Manohar Lal regarding the purchase of crops with MSP as there were caps in place for maximum amount of produce and other stringent conditions. Mr. Yadav also addressed the agitating farmers at Rohtak’s Meham during the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-outfit-to-stage-protests-across-haryana-against-new-acts/article32756600.ece
03 October 2020||Bhopal,||16% of PDS rice stocks in M.P. ‘unfit for human consumption’||As much as 16.6% rice stocks meant for the public distribution system across Madhya Pradesh have been found to be beyond the prevention of food adulteration (PFA) standards or unfit for human consumption, during an inspection. Of the 2.747 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) inspected across 52 districts, 1.806 LMT had been found to be issuable, while 0.494 LMT has been found to be replaceable by millers, Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Managing Director Abhijeet Agrawal told The Hindu. Further, 0.457 LMT has been found to be beyond the PFA limit. “We are issuing notices to more than 15 officials. Since there are quite many people responsible, we can’t remove everyone. So we will initiate departmental inquiry against them,” Mr. Agrawal added. Meanwhile, 18% of the stocks inspected were replaceable, and would be returned to millers. The Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection has given millers three weeks to supply issuable stocks. When asked about action taken against millers responsible, Mr. Agrawal said first the stocks needed to be replaced. “We still have around 7 LMT of paddy, which is to be milled,” he explained. The State-wide inspection was undertaken following inspection by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in Mandla and Balaghat districts which found all samples to be unfit for human consumption, and instead suitable for livestock, cattle and poultry. The Centre had directed the State government to withhold stocks across districts until recategorisation after inspection. Revamp of policy Earlier, the State government said it planned to revamp its milling policy in view of the inspection’s findings with greater emphasis on quality control and a graded approach to incentives and mobile phone-based solutions. It said a separate quality control cadre was essential. At present, Mr. Agrawal said, the State government was looking at policies in other States and noting their best practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/16-of-pds-rice-stocks-in-mp-unfit-for-human-consumption/article32756587.ece
03 October 2020||Phagwara,||Sarpanch attacked in Punjab||Armed assailants attacked a village sarpanch here with sharp-edged weapons on Friday and severely injured him, police said. Harjit Singh (60) was initially hospitalised in Panchhat and then taken to the civil hospital in Phagwara. He was later referred to the DMC hospital in Ludhiana, they said, adding that his condition is critical. Tarlochan Singh, son of the sarpanch, told reporters that his father was going on his motorcycle to fetch milk like he did everyday when he was attacked by six-seven men. He said the assailants were hiding in a roadside field to pounce on the sarpanch. “When my father reached near them, they virtually waylaid him, attacking him with swords and ‘datturs’ while he was still on his bike. After the attack, my father fell down and the assailants pounced upon him, inflicting multiple serious injuries to him,” Tarlochan Singh said. Police did not rule out old enmity as a motive behind the murderous assault.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sarpanch-attacked-in-punjab/article32756594.ece
03 October 2020||GUWAHATI,||Akhil Gogoi’s group forms political party||Jailed peasant rights activist Akhil Gogoi’s group Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and about 70 associate organisations on Friday floated a political party, the fourth to have been birthed ahead of the 2021 Assam polls. The regional entity, largely sired by the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has been named Raijor Dal, meaning People’s Party. ‘To defeat BJP, RSS’ “We have formed the party to defeat the fascist Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the 2021 elections besides keeping the communal combine of the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front at bay,” the new party said in a statement. The minority-based AIUDF is headed by Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, a perfume baron and Lok Sabha member from Assam. “The constituents of Raijor Dal decided to float the party under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances in the country and the State. The fascist government imposed the CAA completely disregarding the public movement against it, thus triggering the need for our own political party,” the party said. ‘Doors open to all’ KMSS president Bhasco de Saikia said the Raijor Dal was an “inclusive” political party that would keep its doors open to people from all communities. It would endeavour to make Assam a leading State. Filmmaker Jahnu Baruah, who was present at the party’s launch in Guwahati, described the day as “historic” for Assam. “There has been a belief among people that Assam will be ruined if all communities cannot unite. Everyone said this is the last battle for protecting the rights of the indigenous people. So, they took a resolve despite differences and came together,” Mr. Baruah said. The Raijor Dal is the second regional party in Assam formed within a month. In September, the influential All Assam Students’ Union and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad floated the Asom Jatiya Parishad. Earlier this year, people from various walks of life formed parties called the Asom Gana Mancha and the Asom Songrami Mancha. The second one merged with the AJP on September 26. All the new parties have trained their guns on the BJP. “In a democracy, anyone can float a political party. We welcome the formation of the political parties. It will only benefit the BJP,” the party’s Assam unit chief Ranjit Kumar Dass told journalists. For the KMSS, the Raijor Dal is the second political venture in five years. It formed the Gana Mukti Sangram, Asom, in March 2015 for “changing the capitalist system of India” but it could not be sustained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/akhil-gogois-group-forms-political-party/article32756597.ece
03 October 2020||JAIPUR,||Cong. claims fulfilment of manifesto promises||The ruling Congress in Rajasthan on Friday claimed that the State government had fulfilled more than half of the promises made in the party’s manifesto for the 2018 Assembly election during the first 21 months of its tenure. The party released a “report card” of its achievements at a virtual event here. Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said the ruling party had fulfilled 252 of the 501 promises made in the manifesto, while the work on 173 promises was in progress. “Thus, 85% of the promises have been completed or are underway in the State,” he said. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot could not attend the event because of sudden indisposition.

The police said that one Parveen Kumar Singh, along with a woman friend, was operating a society called Jai Maa Laxmi Co-operative Thrift and Credit Society Ltd. and running a shop, Arpit Cloth Store at Mandawali, Fajalpur.

They cheated around 200 people in Mandawli to the tune of more than Rs. 2 crore on the pretext of investing in different schemes to earn high profit, the police said. “During investigation, it was revealed that no society in the name of ‘Jai Maa Laxmi Co-operative Thrift and Credit Society Ltd.’ was registered with the RBI,” Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O.P. Mishra said. The woman was traced to Gujarat’s Surat with the help of the social media.

03 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Digital certificates can be submitted at foreign varsities’||The Delhi High Court has said the online digital degree certificates issued by DU in monolingual, English, unlike the previous degree certificates which were bilingual, both in English and Hindi, would be valid for candidates to submit to their respective universities in foreign countries. Justice Prathiba M. Singh said, “It is ordered that both formats of the online degree certificates, whether in monolingual format or bilingual format, would be valid for the candidates to submit to their respective universities/authorities in foreign countries and the present order may be used for the said purpose”. The court’s direction came while hearing a bunch of petitions relating to the issue of DU students not getting their degree certificates on time. It asked DU to submit the mechanism devised for issuance of online transcripts and marksheets for admission to foreign universities or for purposes of employment. DU had said in cases where there is an urgency for example, for admission to foreign universities or for purposes of employment, it is willing to devise a mechanism to address the urgent requests. DU, however, expressed inability to provide a mechanism for issuance of online transcripts and marksheets for regular students. It said that as far as online degree certificates for students who graduated prior to 2017 are concerned, there was difficulty in creating an online mechanism. Prof. D.S. Rawat, Dean (Examinations), said printing of degrees has already been undertaken for students who graduated prior to 2017 and paper degrees have been sent to the respective colleges. DU said students who passed in 2017 and awarded degree in the convocation held in 2018 shall be issued paper degrees in three months through their respective colleges from where they have passed. Students passed in 2018 and 2019 shall be issued paper degrees in the next three months, after the issue of degree of 2017 through their respective colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/digital-certificates-can-be-submitted-at-foreign-varsities/article32756598.ece

03 October 2020||October 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The pioneer of||Everyone has a story about Elisabetha Kerkar, the interior designer who passed away on September 19 at the age of 82, and who gave Taj Hotels its distinct design identity in the latter decades of the 20th century. For Naomi Menezes, a close friend, it is about a small, weather-beaten 300-year-old Portuguese map of Goa that Elisabetha had restored, mounted and framed. “She asked me if she could use it in some way. The next thing I knew, it was blown up into an 18 ft x 6 ft print and mounted at the back of Fort Aguada’s Anchor bar,” says the wife of Lenny Menezes, director of Goa’s first five-star beach resort. For Saraswathi Mahadevan, former executive housekeeper at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur, it is Elisabetha’s fascination with the fading haveli -style wall paintings that she’d discovered while renovating the suites occupied by the erstwhile royal family. “She went to the local market and found Suresh, an artisan with the expertise to restore them,” she says, adding how Elisabetha played up each room’s distinctive features, such as the glass inlay mosaic on the ceiling of the Sajjan Niwas Suite — where the maharana is said to have lain on his bed, enjoying the reflection of the moon outside — or the ‘happy’ colours in the Khush Mahal Suite. “She got the team to restore the squares of multi-hued glass in the jharokhas [arched windows at the 18th century palace] so that when the sunlight came in, brilliant oranges, magentas and yellows stained the floors and walls,” she says. Her vision, her way But the single memory everyone shares: of Liz as a perfectionist. At 8 am, she would be at her desk in her second floor office in the Heritage Wing of The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. By 8.30 am, she would begin work, placing orders with carpenters and tile makers in her accented English, drawing up patterns to send to fabric manufacturers, and overseeing her team of architects and draftsmen as they mapped out floor plans for properties under refurbishment. “You would see her sitting with the painters, telling them the exact percentage of colour to add to get a specific shade. She would go personally to the Johnson & Johnson tile factory in Mumbai, to sit with them until they got the samples right,” recalls MM Parvathy, who retired as Director Operations for Taj Vivanta and worked closely with Elisabetha when she redid the interiors of the Taj Coromandel in Chennai. Her elephantine memory was legendary. “She used so many artefacts across so many hotels, but she could recall where each one was placed,” says Parvathy, while Mahadevan adds, “Every time she walked into a hotel, she would stand for a minute and scan the lobby. If anything was amiss, everyone from the general manager on would get a dressing down.” Indian at heart Swiss by birth — Elisabetha met and married Ajit Kerkar in the mid-50s, when she was an art student in London — she flawlessly merged her European sensibility with the Indian aesthetic. “I’ve always thought of her as one of India’s first design directors. She understood the country and its artistic potential, and gave Taj Hotels its character, creating what we know today as India Modern,” says Chennai-based gallerist Sharan Apparao. Friends and colleagues remember how she would hunt for antiques wherever she went, be it Chor Bazaar and AK Essajee in Mumbai or thegullysof Varanasi and Rani Arts and Crafts in Chennai. “When we first opened Taj Coromandel, she frequented Kora Ramaswamy’s antique shop to source objects such as an old wooden temple chariot that she placed in the lobby,” says Sujaya Menon, whose husband was then Vice President of Taj Group (South). Elisabetha returned to Chennai once more in 1997, to redo the suites in preparation for Queen Elizabeth’s visit. Working with terrible deadlines, the suite was completed by midnight, just ahead of the royal entourage’s arrival. “It was almost like the last polisher went out and in came the Queen,” Menon recalls, adding, “She personally told us how much she enjoyed her room [outfitted in royal blue, with Italian Crema Marfil marble]”. The art collector Away from her drafting table and countless lists, Elisabetha also made a name for herself collecting art. In the ’60s, she and Rodabeh Sawhney, the sister of JRD Tata, scouted galleries in Mumbai and Delhi. “The art scene was not as mature as it is today. But an advantage she had was that there was a gallery [functioning from the 1950s] in the Taj itself. As it was perceived to be one of the more prestigious venues in the city, it attracted a number of quality artists,” says Mortimer Chatterjee, gallerist and art consultant to the Taj. Among the early works she acquired were Jehangir Sabavala, whose father was a manager at The Taj Mahal Palace and MF Husain. Abstract painter Ram Kumar was a favourite, along with names such as Vasudeo Gaitonde and SH Raza. You may not see much of her 4,000-strong collection in their original ‘hangs’ today. Post the 2008 terror attack, a major rehang, overseen by Chatterjee, gave the masters a fresh outlook. “We created new narratives with her collection. At the renovated Harbour Bar, for example, we worked around abstraction, juxtaposing artists of the ’60s and ’70s like Ram Kumar, Ganesh Haloi and Laxman Pai,” he says. Others from the collection hang at the Taj Mahal in Delhi, Taj Bengal in Kolkata or the Taj West End in Bengaluru.
