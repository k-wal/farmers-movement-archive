01 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||Advani, 31 others acquitted in Babri case||A special CBI court here on Wednesday acquitted senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh and 30 others in the Babri Masjid demolition case, almost 28 years after the December 6, 1992 incident, for lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the charges of criminal conspiracy levelled by the CBI against the accused, observing that the chargesheet did not have any evidence to show that they “got together in common intent” with a group of “hooligan kar sevaks” to bring down the mosque. It observed that a group of “arajak” (hooligan) kar sevaks from the main crowd “suddenly got agitated” and indulged in violence even as senior VHP leader Ashok Singhal appealed to them to retreat that fateful day. “All evidence in the chargesheet was examined. The crime alleged against the accused could not be proven,” said the court. 2,300-page order The court said in the 2,300-page verdict that evidence submitted by the CBI in the form of newspaper clippings, video cassettes, tapes, printed material, speeches, and witness testimonies made it “clear that there was no moment when the accused persons gathered in a room to plan the scheme to demolish the structure.” “None of the witnesses have clearly named any of the accused to say they were demolishing the disputed structure,” special judge S.K. Yadav said. While 351 prosecution witnesses, including many journalists, were examined in the case, none of the accused produced a witness in their defence. Mr. Kalyan Singh was the only accused to submit documentary evidence in his defence. The judge observed that it was “not credible” of some witnesses to point to some accused and say that they were exhorting kar sevaks to demolish the mosque as there was a lot of dust inside the complex that was filled with lakhs of kar sevaks. The disputed structure was about 200-300 metres away from the Katha Kunj dais but some witnesses had said it was 800 metres away, he said. The court found contradictions in the statements of the eyewitnesses. Twenty-six of the 32 accused — most of them linked to the Sangh Parivar — were present in court. Those who could not appear in person were Mr. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Mr. Kalyan Singh, Nritya Gopal Das and Satish Pradhan. The judge said the CBI had failed to prove “which accused gave what speech” that day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/advani-31-others-acquitted-in-babri-case/article32737307.ece
01 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Corpn. to impose fine on those not segregating waste at source||After the High Court of Karnataka took Mangaluru City Corporation to task for lagging behind in implementing Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 and other measures for disposal of municipal solid waste as per law, the civic body said on Wednesday that it will begin, on October 11, imposing fine on apartments, houses, commercial and other establishments if segregated garbage is not handed over to it. Addressing a press conference here, Mayor Diwakar and corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that people will have to segregate solid waste (garbage) at source from October 1 itself. The civic body will give a “grace period” of 10 days from October 1 for people to adhere to the system of waste segregation. Later, it will impose fines as per the Solid Waste Management and Sanitation Bylaws 2019 of the corporation. The Mayor said that earlier the civic body had appealed to the people a number of times to segregate waste at source. But people have not taken it seriously. It had held several meetings with bulk waste generators and had also demonstrated to them various methods of processing solid waste at source. Though the civic body had taken steps to impose fine six months ago, it was shelved due to the COVID-19 situation. Now, people will have to segregate waste in all 60 wards. Mr. Sridhar, an IAS officer who took charge as corporation Commissioner a month ago, said that fine amount for houses and street vendors varied from a minimum of Rs. 1,500 to a maximum of Rs. 5,000. He said that bulk waste generators can be fined from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000. If anybody is found throwing solid waste in open public place, fine ranging from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 25,000 can be imposed. If bio-medical waste was found mixed with solid waste, the civic body will impose fine from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000. In the case of dumping building waste in open place, Rs. 25,000 can be imposed as fine. The Commissioner said that wet waste will be collected every day. But dry waste will be collected only on Fridays starting from October 2. Mr. Sridhar said that if waste generators did not pay heed to the appeal made by the civic body, the corporation will be forced to file cases under the relevant laws against those who fail to comply with the rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/corpn-to-impose-fine-on-those-not-segregating-waste-at-source/article32738033.ece

The State did an additional 14,306 tests than it did on Tuesday, testing a record number of 63,682 samples in the last 24 hours. Nearly 75% of these are rapid antigen tests. Despite the incentive of test-on-demand offered by the government, testing remains quite low in the private sector, for various reasons. However, even after doing higher number of tests, the test positivity rate remained at 13%, indicating the intensity of disease transmission in the community, so that more tests would just pick up more cases. 3,536 recoveries The number of recoveries reported on the day is 3,536, the highest recorded in a single day so far. With the cumulative recoveries reported till date being 1,28,224, the number of active cases now is 67,061. Of these, 438 patients are critically ill and being treated in ICUs, while another 92 have been put on ventilator support. The cumulative death toll in the State rose to 742 by adding 23 more deaths which occurred between September 11 and 27 to the official list. Palakkad accounted for eight of these deaths, Thiruvananthapuram six, Alappuzha three, Malappuram two and one each in Kassaragod, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. Over 97% of the new cases reported — 8,608 out of the 8,830 new cases — are locally acquired infections, which include 784 cases wherein the source of infection remains unknown. It also includes infections reported in 123 health-care workers, majority of the cases being in Kannur (33) and Thiruvananthapuram (32).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-daily-tally-crosses-8000-mark/article32737490.ece

01 October 2020||Hubballi,||Civil Hospital gets oxygen tank||The District Civil Hospital in Dharwad, which earlier used to get oxygen cylinders for treating patients, now has its own 6,000-litre capacity tank storing liquid medical oxygen. Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil inaugurated the new facility at the Civil Hospital on Wednesday and said that all necessary arrangements were being made and facilities being set up for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Patil said that till date the Civil Hospital in Dharwad was using 80 jumbo cylinders of liquid medical oxygen daily for treating patients. “It had become cumbersome as the jumbo oxygen cylinders had to be transported for refilling. Now, there will be no such problem as oxygen supply will be through a centralised supply system attached to the oxygen tank. Both time and transportation cost will be saved,” he said. The Deputy Commissioner said that the Civil Hospital was following in the footsteps of KIMS Hospital in Hubballi, which had so far treated over 4,000 patients. “The Civil Hospital is following the treatment protocol adopted by KIMS and so far 540 COVID-19 patients have been treated and discharged from the hospital,” he said. Mr. Patil said that although there was shortage of paramedical staff, specialists and hi-tech medical facilities, the existing staff and doctors at the Civil Hospital were giving their best and playing a major role in extending healthcare facilities to the poor. He said that a new 100-bed hospital would soon be coming up on the Civil Hospital premises with all hi-tech facilities. District Surgeon Shivakumar Mankar and other health officials and doctors were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/civil-hospital-gets-oxygen-tank/article32737453.ece

01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Chief Minister to discuss arguments for Apex Council meeting on water disputes||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has convened a meeting of irrigation officials on Thursday afternoon to discuss the State government’s stand at the virtual conference of the Apex Council on river water disputes with Andhra Pradesh on October 6. He asked the officials to come prepared with information about all aspects of irrigation related to Telangana and matters that have to be conveyed to the Central government, a release said. Instigating trouble Mr. Rao said Andhra Pradesh was deliberately instigating trouble in river water issues. So, the arguments of that State at the Apex Council meeting have to be effectively countered. The reply on the basis of facts had to be so sound that Andhra Pradesh should not venture to challenge Telangana again. At the same time, Telangana should expose the passiveness and negligence of the Centre to address the issues in the last seven years. The attempts made to violate the rights of the people of Telangana should be retaliated, the Chief Minister added. “The entire country should know the truth from the conference”. Mr. Rao recalled that the bifurcation laws of reorganisation of States mandated that water allotment was foremost to new States as soon as they were formed. Therefore, Telangana government had addressed a letter to the Prime Minister seeking water allocation within 12 days of formation of State. ‘Constitute tribunal’ The allocation should be done either by an existing water disputes tribunal or a tribunal constituted under provisions of Inter-State River Water Disputes Act of 1956. The water should be reallocated either between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh or between all riparian States of a river. Mr. Rao regretted that there was no response to the letter even after seven years. The Centre maintained a stoic silence. Centre blamed On the other hand, the Centre resorted to an eyewash that it was addressing the problem through Apex Council meetings. It actually did nothing. Therefore, the attitude of the Centre should also be exposed at the Apex Council meeting. The Centre should be confronted to make its stand clear on water allocation to Telangana. Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao asked the officers to get ready with all arguments on legitimate demands of Telangana.  The reply on the basis of facts has to be so sound that Andhra Pradesh should not venture to challenge Telangana again. K.

District officials denied the charge and said the last rites had been performed after the consent of the father had been obtained, and that some close members of the girl’s family attended the funeral. The 19-year-old rape victim passed away in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday after a prolonged battle at Aligarh’s J.N. Medical College and Hospital earlier.

01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Govt. to reimburse deferred salary||Good news for employees, pensioners, All India Service officers and elected representatives including Ministers, MLAs and MLCs. The State government has decided to make payments of the quantum of salaries that were held up for three months — March, April and May — following the strain on finances due to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in instalments. The government, under the Sections 4 and 5 of the Telangana Disaster Management and Public, Health Emergency (special provisions) Act, 2020 has decided to defer payment of part of salaries/pensions payable to different categories of staff. The government had decided to withhold payment of 75 per cent of salaries pertaining to Ministers, MLAs, MLCs, chairman of corporations and elected representatives nominated to different organisations while bureaucrats including the IAS and IPS officers had to put up with 40 per cent of the salaries. Pensioners and staff in other categories were subject to deferment of 50 per cent of their emoluments while it was 10 per cent in case of the fourth class, contract and outsourcing staff. Though the payment of full salaries was restored a couple of months ago, there was uncertainty over the reimbursement of the salaries that were deferred to the staff. The government, however, released a schedule for reimbursement of the salaries on Wednesday. Accordingly, the deferred pensions to pensioners would be paid in two instalments in October and November. The deferred portion of salaries/pensions /honorarium to employees of public sector undertakings, government-aided institutions/organisations would be paid on a par with the government employees/pensioners. The reimbursement would be in four instalments, according to the order issued by Principal Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ts-govt-to-reimburse-deferred-salary/article32737981.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Panneerselvam firm on steering panel||Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam, who had a sharp exchange of words with Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami at the party’s executive meeting on Monday over a couple of issues, including the formation of a steering committee, appears to be firm on the setting up of the panel. This was the impression gathered by party leaders who interacted with him this week. A confidant of the Deputy Chief Minister told The Hindu that as far as Mr. Panneerselvam was concerned, the issue was only about the formation of the committee, while details regarding its size and composition could be regarded as secondary. Of course, the Panneerselvam camp expects a reasonable number of its representatives to be accommodated in the event of the constitution of the panel. The genesis of the idea, according to the Panneerselvam camp, could be traced to the understanding it had reached with the Palaniswami camp during the merger of the two factions in 2017. At the time, the two camps had agreed to have a steering committee with 11 members. The idea was that such a panel would provide a framework on a number of issues to enable the coordinator and the co-coordinator to arrive at “mutually acceptable” decisions. It could come in handy in the run-up to elections, when the party would have to hold discussions with many outfits on alliance matters. But the Palaniswami camp is not in favour of forming the steering committee. It is of the view that the committee, if formed, had the potential to create more complications than it could handle. Already, there are two panels in the party — the parliamentary board, which chooses candidates for elections, and the petitions committee. If the purpose of the steering committee is to hold negotiations with other parties for an alliance, it can be served by forming an exclusive panel, as was done during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, explained two members of the CM’s camp.  They added that the selection of members for, and the exclusion of members from, the steering committee, would confound the situation. A perusal of the Tamil text of the 12th resolution, which was moved by Radhapuram legislator I.S. Inbadurai and adopted by the AIADMK general council in September 2017, reveals no reference to the steering committee. The motion only defines the role and functions of various office-bearers, committees and wings of the party. But the term ‘steering committee’ figures at the end of the 10thresolution, allowing the creation of the posts of coordinator, co-coordinator and deputy coordinators. Meanwhile, Mr. Panneerselvam on Wednesday continued to hold consultations with his supporters at his residence on Greenways Road in Chennai. Among those who met him during the day were deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy, former Electricity Minister Natham R. Viswanathan and former MP P.H. Manoj Pandian. In the morning, the Deputy Chief Minister, also the Minister for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and ex-officio chairperson of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), presided over the 265thmeeting of the Authority, which lasted nearly 45 minutes. The meeting was attended by senior government officials, including Principal Secretary (HUD) Rajesh Lakhoni and Member Secretary of the Authority D. Karthikeyan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/panneerselvam-firm-on-steering-panel/article32737349.ece
01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||A.B. Venkateswara Rao suffers setback in HC||Senior IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao suffered a setback in the High Court on Wednesday as a single-judge bench, comprising Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy, dismissed his writ petition (WP) seeking a direction to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) not to arrest him in the case of alleged irregularities in procurement of security equipment when he was the Additional Director-General of Police (intelligence). While allowing the ACB to conduct the inquiry, Justice Satyanarayana Murthy ordered that the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar V/s State of Bihar should be followed. The ACB filed a petition on August 21 appealing to the High Court to vacate Venkateswara Rao's writ plea. In a counter affidavit, ACB additional SP A. Suresh Babu stated that an inquiry was conducted into the procurement of an aerostat and an unmanned aerial vehicle worth about Rs. 25.50 crore by the Intelligence Department from RT Inflatable Objects Limited / RT LTA Systems Limited of Israel, upon the submission of a report by the Chief Secretary (CS) of Government of Andhra Pradesh. The inquiry was on the basis of the findings of CID which conducted a preliminary inquiry as per the instructions of the then Director-General of Police. ‘Serious misconduct’ The Director-General of ACB reported to the CS that there was a serious misconduct on the part of Venkateswara Rao, and the inquiry was continuing. The ACB stated that Venkateswara Rao's son Chetan Sai Krishna has been the Indian representative / agent of the company and the former additional DGP pushed the deal knowing well that it was not in public interest. The equipment is meant for use in anti-extremist and security operations. Venkateswara Rao's contention that the Police Department was acting against him at the behest of the political establishment was nothing but preparing a ground to avoid arrest, ACB standing counsel M. Renuka argued before the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ab-venkateswara-rao-suffers-setback-in-hc/article32737231.ece
01 October 2020||Kolkata,||Spike in COVID-19 cases feared post Durga Puja||The medical fraternity in West Bengal is hoping the State, post Durga Puja, does not see a repeat of Kerala, where COVID-19 cases shot up by over 120% after Onam. “We are worried about the situation that would emerge after Durga Puja and Diwali. We need to prepare ourselves thoroughly in case there is a surge,” said Dr. Koushik Chaki, coordinator of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum protocol monitoring team, which is helping the State fight the pandemic. Dr. Chaki emphasised that it was now entirely up to people to check the spread of the pandemic by taking precautions and avoiding crowds. He said, “COVID-19 has been around for nearly seven months, by now people should know the dos and don’ts. They have to be compliant and cannot drop their guard even for a moment.” Crowding a concern Durga Puja, the most-eagerly awaited festival in West Bengal, which involves the participation and movement of large numbers of crowds and lasts several days, is less than a month away. While certain restrictions are in place this year — open and spacious pandals, no cultural programmes, festivities spread across more number of days — crowding will remain a matter of concern.  So far, close to 5,000 people have died of COVID-19 in West Bengal, and over 3,000 cases continue to be reported every day. The government has ordered streamlining of medical services in all districts to meet with the challenges thrown up by the rising number of cases. “Principals of medical colleges and Chief Medical Officers of districts concerned will jointly monitor the HR placement and deployment of [doctors] at COVID-19-designated hospitals in adequate numbers. Manpower will be deployed full time under the joint signature of the principal and CMO for at least one month on rotation basis,” a government memo issued last week said. “A Rapid Response Team will be formed, including one anaesthesiologist and one medicine specialist to treat the identified serious patients and any emergencies thereof,” it said. Preventing delays “Rapid antigen testing to be arranged at SARI [severe acute respiratory illness] wards so that COVID-19 patients can be identified immediately and admitted to hospital without delay. Before any referral, the patient must be stabilised, so that the receiving hospital can get time for starting management,” it stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/spike-in-covid-19-cases-feared-post-durga-puja/article32737523.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC refuses to shift civil services exam from Oct. 4||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to defer the civil services preliminary examination scheduled for October 4, but asked the authorities to consider a possible concession for aspirants unable to take their last shot at the exam due to the pandemic. The examination is scheduled to be held at 72 centres (2,569 sub-centres) across the country. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said security and health protocols should be followed strictly. It agreed with the Union Public Service Commission that any further delay in the conduct of the exam would have a “cascading effect” on future ones. The Bench asked the authorities to ensure that candidates with admit cards are able to find suitable accommodations near the exam centres/sub-centres. The UPSC, through advocate Naresh Kaushik, said that its logistical arrangements were complete. It has requested Chief Secretaries to ensure the running of public transport systems on October 3 and 4. The Commission had also written to the Railway Board to ensure trains are run across sectors to transport 10.58 lakh candidates who have enrolled for the exam. The Commission said it has already spent approximately Rs. 50.39 crore on the preparations. As of September 28, 6,87,648 candidates have downloaded their admit cards. Cascading effect The UPSC said the exam was earlier scheduled for May 31, but then shifted to October 4 due to the pandemic lockdown and restrictions. “Over the years, a cycle has evolved involving recruitment, training and final appointment ensuring that the government gets its requisite manpower on time. Any disruption at any stage has the potential of upsetting the entire cycle not only for once but is likely to have cascading effects in future as well,” the UPSC affidavit said. It said the calendar of examinations for 2021 is already placed on the website in which the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, 2021 is scheduled to be held on July 27, 2021. The Commission said in case of any further postponement, it would not be in a position to declare the final result of the 2020 exam before next year’s preliminary examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-refuses-to-shift-civil-services-exam-from-oct-4/article32737923.ece

Over 8,000 lives saved The respirators, provided by Bharatpur-based Lupin Foundation and installed at six health facilities in the district since 2016, have so far saved the lives of 8,726 infants. The machines were placed at the District Hospital in Bharatpur and the community health centres at Rudawal, Bayana, Kaman, Deeg and Kumher. The devices have also been supplied to Dholpur and Alwar districts. Eight respirators handed over by Minister of State for Medical & Health Subhash Garg in Bharatpur will be installed at primary health centres at Pathena, Nagar, Pahari and Rudawal and the community health centres at Sikri, Jhurela, Nadbai and Rupbas in Bharatpur district. Each of the equipment is expected to save the lives of 1,500 babies in the next five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-bharatpur-a-kiss-of-life-for-newborns/article32737925.ece

01 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||Accused did not have a plan, says court||A special CBI court here which on Wednesday acquitted senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh and 30 others in the Babri Masjid demolition case, cited lack of credible evidence. “The video cassettes that have been presented, their related witnesses have themselves accepted that these are edited and tampered with,” special judge S.K. Yadav said. The judge said evidence suggested that RSS and VHP volunteers were taking care of arrangements, including seating for women, elderly and media, and regularly making announcements. “This indicates that there was no scheme of the named accused to bring down the disputed structure on December 6, 1992,” the court said. The court also said that in the case of Mr. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sadhvi Ritambara, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and Acharya Dharmendra Dev, it was clear that the recordings of slogans raised by a specific accused were not co-related with voice samples of that specific accused and presented in court. The special court said that as part of the evidence submitted by the CBI, the newspaper clippings qualified as hearsay evidence and even rejected the video cassettes as edited and noted that negatives of none of the photographs had been submitted. The judge said the interviews of the accused and statements published in newspapers and submitted by the CBI from November 1990 to May 1993 could not be considered as evidence. ‘All was normal’ The court said that it had also been established that on December 6, 1992 around 12 p.m. everything was normal, but when senior VHP leader Ashok Singhal announced again how the kar seva should proceed, a “section of kar sevaks” became agitated and started pelting the mosque with stones. Some broke the barricades and climbed the structure, following which Singhal asked the group of kar sevaks to return, but they instead started attacking him, noted the court. “ ... they were definitely hooligans, because if they were actual believers of Lord Ram, they would have paid heed to Ashok Singhal’s statement that the disputed structure ‘is also a temple and you have to protect it’,” said the court. CBI lawyers said it was up to the CBI headquarters to decide on filing an appeal. Any of the aggrieved parties — there were 49 FIRs filed in this case — could also go for appeal, said a lawyer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/accused-did-not-have-a-plan-says-court/article32737259.ece

You think you can do anything and the country will just keep watching. You are wrong, as the country will speak up against the injustice committed by you. On behalf of the Congress, I stand with the demand for justice for the victim’s family,” she said. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati tweeted that the BSP condemned the police action, and called on the Supreme Court to take cognisance of the incident. Samajwadi Party leader and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet that the police had conducted the victim’s last rites without her family’s consent at night under pressure from the government. He said the actions of the police were an attempt to erase evidence, and that the BJP government had committed a “sin and crime” by doing so. The CPI(M) Polit Bureau condemned the U.P. government’s actions, terming it a “blatant denial of justice” and demanding action against the police personnel involved. “Her death is the result of the callous approach of the government,” it said. CPI general secretary D. Raja demanded that the Chief Minister resign, and called for nationwide protests on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-must-quit-opposition/article32737276.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||BJP, Sangh members hail verdict||The BJP and other organisations of the Sangh Parivar welcomed the acquittal of the 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case by a special CBI court in Lucknow on Wednesday, with senior leader and one of the main accused in the case, L.K. Advani, stating that it vindicated “my personal and the BJP’s belief and commitment towards the Ram Janmabhoomi movement”. In a video message, he said: “It is a very important decision and a matter of happiness for us. When we heard the news of the court’s order, we welcomed it by chanting Jai Shri Ram ”. Later in a written statement, he said, “The judgement vindicates my personal and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s [BJP] belief and commitment towards the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement. I also feel blessed that this judgement has come in the footsteps of another landmark verdict of the Supreme Court given in November 2019, which paved the way for my long cherished dream of seeing a grand Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, the foundation-laying ceremony of which was held on 5th August, 2020”. Mr. Advani was visited at his residence by Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad after the verdict, but Mr. Prasad left soon after without speaking to the press. Former Union Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, a co-accused with Mr. Advani in the case, expressed satisfaction that the court had ruled that no conspiracy was behind the destruction of the 16th century mosque. “I will say only one thing ‘ Jai Jai Shri Ram, Sab ko sanmatti de bhagwan [May Lord bestow wisdom on all]’,” he said. ‘It took 28 years’ Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) international working president Alok Kumar said it took 28 years for courts to deliver justice. “This judgment now hopefully draws the final curtains on an issue that had been agitating the Hindu psyche for some 472 years,” he added. The VHP spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi movement for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. Perhaps the shortest statement was issued by the ideological mother ship of the Sangh Parivar, the RSS, via its deputy chief Suresh Bhiyyaji Joshi. “The RSS welcomes the honourable acquittal of all the accused in the case related to the destruction of the disputed structure by the CBI court,” said Mr. Joshi’s statement. He now hoped various sections of society would come together in harmony to steer the nation into progress, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-sangh-members-hail-verdict/article32737255.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI/CHENNAI,||Indian and Chinese officials meet again||Indian and Chinese officials stressed the need to “strengthen communications” between ground military commanders and comply with the 5-point Jaishankar-Wang Moscow agreement, during a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on Wednesday. In separate statements issued in New Delhi and Beijing, the two sides appeared to soften their language a day after they exchanged sharp words over the status of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and China’s claim that it does not “recognise” the Union Territory of Ladakh. “[The two sides] emphasised the need to implement the steps outlined after the last meeting of the senior commanders so as to avoid misunderstandings and to maintain stability on the ground. In this context, the need to strengthen communication, especially between the ground commanders, was emphasised by both sides,” said a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), referring to the sixth meeting of commanders on September 21, where they agreed to stop sending more troops to the front-lines. While that agreement has largely held, no movement has taken place on disengagement or withdrawal of the troops amassed at the LAC. In its statement, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said a seventh round of commander-level talks would be held shortly to “properly handle the remaining issues on the ground and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” and that the WMCC had agreed that both sides would take “practical measures to further ease and cool down the border situation”. The MEA statement said the two sides had also agreed to “work towards early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreement and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity”. The WMCC meeting is the 19th held since the mechanism involving the Foreign Ministry, Defence Ministry, military and security officials was set up in 2012, and its fifth meeting since the Galwan clashes in June, indicating that the mechanism is now playing a much larger role in negotiating a resolution to the LAC standoff than on previous such occasions. The virtual meeting on Wednesday was led by MEA Joint Secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava and director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hong Liang.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-and-chinese-officials-meet-again/article32737261.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||‘New farm laws are a clear encroachment on State functions’||After pulling out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Union government, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) now plans to bring regional parties across the country on one platform to fight against, what it terms, ‘anti-farmer’ laws. Sukhbir Singh Badal, party chief and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister, says it is sad the BJP was “insensitive” to the huge relevance of the alliance with his party in Punjab against the backdrop of Hindu-Sikh unity. Excerpts :   The SAD-BJP alliance in Punjab was seen as symbol of Sikh-Hindu unity. How do you assess the situation after the breaking of the alliance? The values of peace and communal harmony are very dear to us. Mr. Parkash Singh Badal is a symbol of peace and the basic thing he taught us is that Punjab can progress only if there is peace. Badal sahab ’s basic fundamental was that he took every community, every religious organisation together. He took everyone into confidence for everything and that is why everyone trusts him, and that philosophy we will carry on. For us every religion will play equal part in developing Punjab. Punjab is a border State and the Government of India should have been very sensitive. Punjabis and Sikhs are very emotional people. With love, you can take anything from them, but if you do something which hurts them, they get agitated quickly. It is sad that the BJP is insensitive to the huge relevance of our alliance in Punjab for Hindu-Sikh unity. The SAD initially supported agriculture sector ordinances but later decided to alter its stance. The Opposition accuses you of changing your stance only after facing backlash from farmers to save your ‘vote bank’. We never altered our stand from the beginning. When ordinances came to the Cabinet, we had put forward our objections surrounding them. The ordinances were never discussed with us before the Cabinet meeting. In the meeting, we objected. But we were assured that farmers’ reservations would be addressed when these ordinances are converted into Bills for Parliament. We shared the farmers’ concerns and expected that the BJP would accept all of them, but when they did not accept them, we were left with no choice [but to leave the alliance]. In the past few months, I have always been telling farmers that for us [the SAD], any alliance or Ministry is not as important as farmers. Our aim was to gather farmers’ suggestions, and when I held meetings with farm organisations and farm experts, they shared the apprehension that MSP (minimum support price) would be wiped out [by the farm Bills], among other concerns. I conveyed all the objections to the Government of India and the government gave in writing that they will not discontinue MSP. We then took this message to farmers, but the people of the State, including legal experts, suggested that the assurance in writing was not sufficient. So, all this time, we were conveying what the government said to the farmers, and shared the farmers’ view with the government, because we were a part of the NDA. We were assured that they [the Central government] would listen to us. But when they did not listen, we told them we would oppose [them] and walked out of the government. We always remained on one stand. Were you betrayed by the BJP over the farm laws? The BJP should have consulted its allies first. SAD represents farmers. We know more about farmers than the BJP. In an alliance, numbers should not always be used as the method of taking decisions. Instead, a partnership should be considered as the base for decision-making. The SAD had always been advocating more powers to the States. Against this background do you think the agriculture legislation encroaches on the States’ functions? Yes, absolutely. These laws are a clear encroachment on State functions. Agriculture is a State subject but they [the Centre] got the ordinances through the via media of trading, which falls in the Concurrent List. So, the government used the Concurrent List, which is a wrong way to do [this legislation]. We stand for a federal India. These laws are clearly violating the federal principle. After the agriculture Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, you said that democratic virtues had been ignored. Can you elaborate? Winning and losing is something different but the system should not be broken. When people in the Rajya Sabha wanted division of votes on the Bills, it should have taken place. Why were the Bills forced? They [the NDA] would still have had the numbers but you cannot just push your way in the manner in which it was done, by bulldozing all norms. The spirit of democracy is consensus, not majoritarian confrontation. People want consensus and peace. No attempt was made in that direction to bring a consensus in Parliament and the Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, flouting all democratic traditions. How do you plan to fight against the new agriculture laws? Will you be approaching other political parties, especially the regional parties, to join hands for the farmers’ cause? We will try to get all farmers’ organisations under one platform, emerge as one force, and raise our concerns with the Centre. We will fight these laws at every level, including in the people’s court. Farmers are facing a crisis of life and death, and the nation must come to their rescue. What is happening is that the government has abandoned farmers in favour of corporates. The fire has spread all across the country. We will approach regional parties in the country and try to get all together on a single platform against the Centre’s agriculture legislations and other farmers’ issues. The Assembly elections in Punjab are due in 2022. Do you think the farm legislation will be the key election issue? First let us fight this battle to save our farmers. The ruling Congress government is the most incompetent government that Punjab has ever had. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is hardly seen in Punjab. He doesn’t meet anybody.  Farmers are facing a crisis of life and death, and the nation must come to their rescue||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-farm-laws-are-a-clear-encroachment-on-state-functions/article32737272.ece
01 October 2020||Hyderabad,||Highway burglars who looted over 2,400 smartphones held||The highway burglaries involving containers carrying smartphones appear to have deep-rooted international network, as the Medak police have apprehended a gang of the nomadic Kanjarbhat community in Madhya Pradesh. They get paid in advance by the ‘network’ operating from various parts of the country to commit the thefts. After getting instructions and details from the kingpins, the gang trails the consignment from the place of origin and would break into moving or stationary vehicles using high-end equipment at a ‘right place’. As a result, the driver or the cleaner would know about the theft only after a few hours from their previous halt, said a senior officer associated with the investigation of the case. In Medak, where 2,442 smartphones worth around Rs. 2 crore were stolen from a container truck, the driver Srinivas noticed the tampering with the lock only after he had cruised for another 250 km when he stopped the vehicle for refuelling at Ichoda in Adilabad district. The offence took place at a roadside dhaba at Masaipet on September 16 when the driver halted for dinner.   The gang committed similar thefts in Chitttor and Guntur districts of Andhra Pradesh on August 26 and September 17, respectively. “After committing the theft, the accused gang members would hand over the booty to the well-oiled network of receivers, who further move the consignment to the borders of Pakistan and Bangladesh,” the officer told The Hindu , adding that the receivers would also use waterway to smuggle the contraband. This particular gang is specialised only in smartphones and other elections devices. “If one looks at the way three offences took place in AP and Telangana, there is a common link of stealing the in-transit goods,” the officer said. So far, the teams of Medak police have apprehended six members and are still working on tracking and busting the larger network of the case. “We caught the accused, the vehicles involved in the offence, and mobile phones to the extent of 80 percent of lost property in Madhya Pradesh, with our teams camping and working hard on tracking the evidence all through,” the officer said. When asked about the involvement of insiders, including people from the mobile phone company or the transport agency, the officer said, “It is still under examination and soon more facts will come out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/highway-burglars-who-looted-over-2400-smartphones-held/article32737226.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre, States must file an appeal: Cong.||Reacting to the court ruling in the Babri Masjid demolition case, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said it ran counter to the Supreme Court’s November 9, 2019 judgment. “The Supreme Court was misled by filing a wrong affidavit on oath. It is only after detailed examination of all these aspects, facts and evidence that the Supreme Court held the demolition of the Masjid to be ‘an egregious violation of the rule of law’,” he said. “Every Indian, who has innate faith in the Constitution as also in the spirit of communal amity and brotherhood, expects and urges the Central and State governments to file an appeal against the decision of the special court founded in error and follow the letter of the law and the Constitution, without any partiality and pre-meditated prejudice,” he added. ‘No justice delivered’ The CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in a statement that it took 28 long years for this verdict but justice was not delivered. Citing the Supreme Court judgment, it said: “Now, the Lucknow court has found the main perpetrators of this crime not guilty. This verdict will blemish the image of India as a secular-democratic country governed by the Constitution. The CBI must immediately appeal against this judgment.” General secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) D. Raja said it was a travesty of justice, as it was a well-known fact that an intense campaign was carried out by RSS and BJP leaders for mobilising people against the Babri Masjid that finally led to its demolition. ‘Anti-social elements’ Mr. Raja asked, “The kar sevaks who took part in the demolition, we are given to understand, are anti-social elements. But who are they?” CPI secretary and Rajya Sabha member Binoy Viswam said in a statement that the verdict was “disappointing” but “not unexpected”. “The whitewashing of the plethora of crimes committed on December 6, 1992, has been the hallmark of this government and its coteries. It is ridiculous to believe that the events of that fateful day were spontaneous and the mobs were not spurred on by its leaders,” Mr. Viswam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-states-must-file-an-appeal-cong/article32737257.ece
01 October 2020||New Delhi,||Crimes against Scheduled Tribes saw 26% rise in 2019: NCRB report||Crime against members of the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) saw an increase of over 7% and 26%, respectively, in 2019 compared with the 2018 figures, according to the annual Crime in India 2019 report published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday. Due to “non-receipt of data” from West Bengal for 2019, the 2018 data has been used to arrive at national and city-wise figures, the NCRB said. A total of 45,935 cases were registered for committing crime against SCs, showing an increase of 7.3% over 2018, when 42,793 such cases were recorded. At 11,829 cases, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of crimes against SCs in 2019, followed by 6,794 cases in Rajasthan and 6,544 cases in Bihar, the report said.  Rape cases In the number of cases of rape of women belonging to SCs, Rajasthan topped the list with 554 cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh at 537 and Madhya Pradesh at 510. A total of 8,257 cases were registered for committing crime against STs, an increase of 26.5% over 2018, when 6,528 such cases were registered. Madhya Pradesh recorded the highest number of cases against STs as it recorded 1,922 cases, followed by Rajasthan, which recorded 1,797 cases and Odisha (576). The highest number of incidents of rape of tribal women (358) was registered in Madhya Pradesh. A total of 51,56,172 cognisable crimes comprising 32,25,701 Indian Penal Code (IPC) ones and 19,30,471 Special and Local Laws (SLL) crimes were registered in 2019. It showed an increase of 1.6% in registration of cases over 2018 (50,74,635 cases), the NCRB said. A total of 4,05,861 cases of crime against women were registered in 2019 compared to 3,78,236 cases in 2018, showing an increase of 7.3%. CHRI statement The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), a police reforms advocacy group, said few cases were being registered for specific discriminatory action against SCs and STs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crimes-against-scheduled-tribes-saw-26-rise-in-2019-ncrb-report/article32737274.ece
01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Hyderabad’s Gandhi Hospital may resume non-COVID ops||Intense discussions are under way to resume non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital. However, critical infrastructure such as diagnostic machines, pending for the past many years, has to be provided if both COVID and non-COVID patients are to be served at the State-run hospital. When cases started to increase in March, Health Minister Eatala Rajender issued directions to turn Gandhi Hospital into an exclusive COVID treatment facility. Since then, it has been attending only patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.  Junior doctors’ plea Junior doctors studying at Gandhi Medical College met the Health Minister on Tuesday stating that since only coronavirus patients are admitted there, post graduate students of some specialisations are not able to pursue their academic work. Responding to the concern, Mr Rajender has directed officials to resume non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital and other health facilities. However, sources said that separate workforce, infrastructure, and other resources have to be provided to make the transition smooth. “Of the two CT Scan machines at the hospital, one is 15 years old. If it breaks down, it cannot be repaired. The machine used for COVID patients cannot be used for other patients. Defunct MRI machine Besides, the lone MRI scanning machine is defunct. So we need at least one more CT Scan machine if COVID and non-COVID services are to be extended simultaneously. If MRI machines are also provided, it would be of great help,” hospital sources said. In effect, it would be akin to running two hospitals parallelly from one location. The CT Scan machine is used for COVID patients to know if virus has attacked lungs, and the extent of the damage. Before March, around 100 people used to be examined daily using the diagnostic machines. Besides, separate workforce which includes doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, patient care providers and others, will be needed for the two categories of patients. It was learnt that the Health Minister has met senior officials from the hospital administration for a discussion on how to move ahead with the plan. Currently, around 600 COVID patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi. The patient load has to come down substantially if the existing workforce is to be distributed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-mulls-resumption-of-non-covid-services-at-gandhi-hospital/article32737962.ece
01 October 2020||KOCHI,||LIFE Mission moves HC against CBI||LIFE Mission Chief Executive Officer (CEO) U.V. Jose on Wednesday approached the Kerala High Court challenging the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a court here on the alleged irregularities in a LIFE Mission housing project at Wadakkanchery in Thrissur. Mr. Jose said the CBI had registered the FIR with mala fide intentions and it was guided by political and extraneous considerations. The FIR alleged violation of Section 3 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. In fact, the LIFE Mission had not accepted any contributions, much less any foreign contributions. The contractual agreement for the construction of the buildings under the LIFE Mission was executed between the Consular General of the United Arab Emirate and Unitac, a construction company. It was the sponsors which had selected Unitac and Sane Ventures. The petition The petition said neither the State government nor the LIFE Mission had any role in the selection of contractors. The companies which had inked agreements with the UAE Consulate General did not come under any categories of persons prohibited from receiving foreign contributions under Section 3 of the Act. The category of persons included candidates for election, correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper, judges, government servants or employee of government-controlled bodies, member of any legislature, political parties or companies engaged in the production or broadcast of audio news or audio visual news or current affairs programmes through any electronic mode, etc. Mr. Jose said even if it was assumed that they had received any contribution or any amount from the Red Crescent, a U.S.-based organisation, no offence could be attributed to them. Besides, any amounts received by way of fee or cost in lieu of goods or services rendered in ordinary course would not come under the foreign contributions as per explanation 3 to Section 2(h) of the Act. The CBI now proposed to conduct a roving inquiry against the government officials concerned to find out whether they had committed any offence. In fact, the investigation could only be conducted into the offence already committed as per the Act, the petitioner said. The petition sought to quash the FIR registered on a complaint filed by Anil Akkara, MLA, alleging that the two construction companies had accepted foreign contributions in violation of the provisions of the Act.

01 October 2020||Chennai,||Researchers study T.N. and A.P. data||A paper published in the journal Science on Wednesday uses data from two Indian States, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, to provide key insights into the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in resource-limited populations. It used surveillance and contact tracing data from these two States to generate observations that might also work in other similar low- and middle-income settings. The authors of the paper, titled ‘Epidemiology and Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states’, include the Health Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, J. Radhakrishnan and K.S. Jawahar Reddy, Ramanan Laxminarayan of Center for Disease Dynamics, Delhi, and researchers from Princeton Environmental Institute and Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley. Much of the information about COVID-19 so far has been from China, Europe and the United States (U.S.). “Although most COVID-19 cases have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting,” the paper stated. Both States recorded their first laboratory-confirmed case on March 5 and are among those with the largest public health expenditures per capita. They initiated rigorous disease surveillance early, the researchers said. “Our analysis suggests substantial variation in individuals’ likelihood of transmitting: no secondary infections were linked to 71% of cases whose contacts were traced and tested,” it added. It identified high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age. School closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions during the study period may have contributed to the reductions in contact among children. The analyses of fatal outcomes revealed an overall case-fatality ratio of 2.1%. They averred that a lower relative incidence of COVID-19 among older adults in the two States has contributed to stark differences in the overall case fatality ratio and age distribution of decedents, in comparison to observations in the U.S. and other countries. It also studied the role of super spreaders in transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/researchers-study-tn-and-ap-data/article32737233.ece
01 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||ED questions Aryadan Shoukath||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday questioned Congress leader Aryadan Shoukath. An official said the agency was probing whether he had any financial links with the Mary Matha Higher Education Guidance Centre in Kozhikode. The education consultancy had collected money from parents promising placement of their wards in high-profile medical colleges and other coveted institutions conducting professional courses. The centre came under a cloud after several parents approached the police accusing the consultancy of not keeping its word. They alleged that the centre had cheated them of their money. The police registered 23 FIRs based on complaints from the public. It pegged the alleged financial fraud at an estimated Rs. 8 crore. The ED came into the picture because the cases predicated illegal gain from criminal activity, a scheduled offence under the agency’s charter. The agency questioned Mr. Shoukath for several hours. They reportedly asked him if he had any transactions with the chief of the centre, Sibychan Vayalil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-questions-aryadan-shoukath/article32737553.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Southwest monsoon ends with 8% surplus||The southwest monsoon this year has ended with an 8.7% surplus, surpassing estimates by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This is also the first time since 2010 that India has got more than 100% of its long period average (LPA) of 88 cm in consecutive years. Last year, India saw record rainfall of 110% of the LPA, the highest in a quarter century. India has never got over 105% of the LPA in consecutive years in at least 30 years, according to records available since 1988 on the IMD website. “These have been an unusually good couple of years for the monsoon,” said D.S. Pai, chief forecaster, National Climate Centre, IMD Pune. “There are larger trends that statistics show of a decadal swing in overall monsoon rainfall. The last two decades, however, have been weak and hopefully, what we see now is the beginning of a new epoch.” The heavy rains this year have been due to several long-lasting low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal that fuelled heavy rain over large swathes of India in August. This wiped out the deficit in July, which is usually the rainiest of the four monsoon months. At 32 cm, August rainfall was nearly 26% more than what’s usual for the month. Tad short of excess A developing La Nina, the converse of an El Nino, which is a heating of the central equatorial Pacific and responsible for diminished monsoon rain over India, too, contributed to munificent rain this year. The IMD, in its forecasts, had anticipated ‘normal’ rain, defined as 96-104% of the LPA. Rains above 110% LPA are termed ‘excess’ and this year has fallen only a tad short. Of the 36 meteorological subdivisions that the IMD has partitioned the country into, 12 recorded ‘excess’ rain and 17 recorded ‘ normal’ rain. Only five divisions posted ‘deficient rain’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/southwest-monsoon-ends-with-8-surplus/article32737266.ece
01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Ideal weight of Indian men, women redefined||ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has redefined the ideal or reference Indian adult man and woman with regard to age to 19-39 years instead of 20-39 years. The body weight has been put at 65 kg for males and 55 kg for females while earlier, it was 60 kg and 50 kg respectively, which are a decade old. This is based on the latest nationally representative data sourced from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4, 2015-16), National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB, 2015-16), the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2006-07) and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP 2015) to “derive acceptable reference body weight values through the lifespan”. In the ‘Recommended Dietary Allowances’ and ‘Nutrient Requirements’ report prepared by NIN, the city-based nodal agency for recommending dietary allowances and nutrient requirements for Indians, includes Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Tolerable Upper Limits of nutrients for the first time. Dietary intake Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) are daily dietary nutrient intake levels which would be sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals while EARs are the average daily nutrient intake levels of the population. The cereal-legume-milk composition of the diet for moderately active man has been improved to 3:1:2.5 as compared to the earlier 11:1:3 within a given low cost window to meet daily protein requirements. Visible fat intake for sedentary, moderate and heavy activity has been set at 25 gm, 30 gm and 40 gm a day for adult man and 20 gm, 25 gm and 30 gm a day for adult women as against the single level recommended earlier. Fiber intake For the first time, fiber based on energy intake was recommended and the level of about 40 gm/2000 kcal has been considered as safe intake. For carbohydrates, the EAR has been set at 100 gm/day for ages 1 and above with a RDA of 130 gm/day. With regard to sodium due to emerging concerns on prevalence of hypertension a safe intake of 2000 mg/day which amounts to 5 gm/day of salt is recommended; while an intake of 3,510 mg/day is recommended for potassium. It has also recommended a minimum of 400 gm/day of fruits and vegetables to obtain sufficient amounts of antioxidant nutrients such as beta-carotene, vitamin C and certain non nutrients like polyphenols and flavonoids which may protect against chronic diseases. This should be complemented with sufficient amounts of vegetable oil so as to obtain Vitamin E. Water required from beverages for adult man ranges from 32-58 ml per kg body mass and for woman, it ranges from 27-52 ml per kg body mass, with sedentary working group at lower end and the heavy working group at higher end of the range. Children’s needs For children, the requirement is greater than 60 ml per kg body mass and for adolescent boys it ranges from 47-60 ml per kg body mass, while, for girls it is 39-49 ml per kg body mass. For pregnant woman, based on the working intensity, the water required from beverages ranges from 2.1 to 3.2 litres per day. For old-age, irrespective of gender, the present consensus for water requirement from beverages is 33 ml per kg body mass for sedentary activity and 38 ml per kg body mass for moderate activity, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ideal-weight-of-indian-men-women-redefined/article32737847.ece

Kumanan, has challenged the constitutionality of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; Farmers Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 (Act 21 of 2020) on various grounds. The DMK leader said the laws were “ prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary” as they would “usher in a new exploitative regime for the poor farmers of the country, who are entirely dependent on earning their livelihood, by selling their produce in the market”. The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act would facilitate black marketing. “The Acts attack the very foundation of the agricultural fabric of the country that was built to safeguard the interests of the farmers and not leave them at the mercy of the new era of privatisation,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dmk-mp-moves-sc-against-farm-acts/article32737849.ece

He said he did not know what material was used for his daughter’s funeral. A strong police cordon was laid around the village on Wednesday as well. Media teams were stopped on the National Highway 509 and asked to walk on foot for 2.5 km to reach the village. Joint Magistrate Prakash Kumar Meena, who made the arrangements for funeral, said the father himself had said that the body be directly taken to the cremation ground as it had been more than 12 hours since the post mortem had been done in Delhi. Mr. Meena said, “When he [the victim’s father] reached the village, he was influenced by a political party to change his decision and became untraceable. As we anticipated a law and order problem, we went ahead with the cremation with the girl’s real uncle and her father’s real uncle. With the kind of attention the case is getting, and people were coming from different districts, had we waited till morning, a local problem would have become a national issue.” The uncle of the girl’s father told The Hindu that he went to the cremation spot after his nephew told him to go there and see what was happening. “I did not ignite the pyre. When I reached there, the fire was already lit,” he said. The girl’s mother said the women of the house pleaded with the police and said they would arrange ice slabs (for preserving the body). “We even tried to make them understand [by saying] whether they would have done the same with their daughter, but they didn’t listen,” she said.

In May, the Tamil Nadu government put in place a cap of 25 arrival flights from other States in an attempt to control the number of COVID-19 cases. Later, it was increased to 50 flights a day and now it has gone up to 100.

During the occasion, he flagged off vehicles that would be used for cleaning the streets, collecting waste from houses, segregating solid waste and depositing the waste in dumpyards. In a press release, the GCC said the private player would undertake solid waste management in Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones. Urbaser SA and Sumeet Facilities bagged the contract for waste management in the seven zones, containing 86 divisions, for eight years at a cost of Rs. 447 crore per year. The private agency would deploy 92 compactors, 21 mechanical sweepers and 1,931 e-rickshaws for door-to-door household waste collection. To facilitate the process, over 8,870 garbage bins would be installed in various streets, and a total of 6,274 workers would be involved in cleaning operations in the seven zones. The Greater Chennai Corporation has gone for privatisation of the solid waste management project by clearing bills through the Performance Based Cost of Delivery Model, against the normal practice of paying bills based on the quantity of waste removed. The civic body has appointed third-party advisers to monitor the work, and would also keep tabs on the various waste segregation works that have been specified in the key performance indicators.

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. decision cancelling arrear exams not right, AICTE tells HC||The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has told the Madras High Court that an order issued by the State government on August 26, cancelling the arrear examinations for all arts and science, engineering and MCA students except those pursuing the final year of their course, was not in accordance with its guidelines. In a counter-affidavit filed in response to a public interest litigation petition preferred by professor and former vice-chancellor of Anna University E. Balagurusamy, the AICTE said, “The Government Order declaring all the students as passed without an assessment by way of examination is against the AICTE Act.” The counter, served on the litigant’s counsel, E. Vijay Anand, went on to state that the AICTE is a statutory body which has to lay down norms and standards for technical courses, curricula and physical as well as instructional facilities. It also prescribes the staff pattern, their qualifications and the assessment pattern for students. “A degree cannot be awarded to a student who has failed in a large number of courses. This is not acceptable to industry too. “In view of the said G.O., all students, even those who have paid fees for arrear examinations, have been declared as passed, which is totally against the guidelines,” read the counter-affidavit signed by M. Sundaresan, Southern Regional Officer of AICTE, on behalf of the council. In his affidavit, Mr. Balagurusamy had stated that he had chosen to file the PIL petition to save the quality of education, the future of students and the reputation of universities. He said the government’s decision had demoralised meritorious students who had cleared all papers without any arrears. “The G.O. will definitely lower the educational standards of students and universities…Several students have approached me and expressed apprehensions about future prospects, and [have] further informed [me] that most of the students have more than 25 arrear papers and less than 25% of marks in most of the subjects,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancellation-of-arrear-exams-not-right-aicte-tells-hc/article32737397.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Acquittal of Babri accused a shame on rule of law’||Leaders of Opposition parties on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the acquittal by a CBI court of all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. DMK president M.K. Stalin described it as “a shame on the rule of law”. In a statement, Mr. Stalin said that even after the Supreme Court ruled that “the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship,” the CBI had failed to prove the conspiracy. He said it was not a question of mosques; encroachment upon and destruction of a place of worship of any religion amounted to an act of illegality and injustice. “Since the demolition of the mosque brought down India’s image in the international arena, the CBI should have acted with fairness and utmost care. It lost track and became the caged-bird of the BJP. It is a shame,” he said. Mr. Stalin said that since the case caused a crisis to the Constitution, the CBI’s careless attitude would have severe consequences for justice.  Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said the verdict had shocked those who believed in the rule of law and governance. He appealed to the Centre to file an appeal. “The Sangh Parivar groups, including the BJP, mobilised thousands of people and destroyed the Babri Masjid in 1992. But Central investigating agencies did not gather enough evidence to prove the charges. This has raised serious doubts whether it [the CBI] has become a puppet in the hands of the BJP,” he said. MDMK founder Vaiko said the demolition of Babri Masjid was in the works for years and ‘kar sevaks’ were prepared over months. “The mosque was demolished in daylight with the police and the Army watching. This was well-planned. Even the Supreme Court had said this was a ‘planned’ incident. The CBI court verdict that this was not a planned incident is akin to demolishing judicial response,” he said. The CPI(M) State committee said the verdict amounted to a travesty of justice. “It took 28 long years for this verdict, but not for justice to be delivered. This verdict will blemish the image of India as a secular-democratic country governed by the Constitution. The CBI must immediately appeal against this judgment,” it said.  ‘Final nail in the coffin’ Manithaneya Makkal Katchi founder M.H. Jawahirullah felt the verdict was the final nail in the coffin of India’s judicial system. “It is the need of the hour to protest for an India that Mahatma Gandhi wished to create,” said Mr. Jawahirullah, inviting public participation in a protest to save India’s judiciary on October 1. VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said, “Everybody knew that L.K. Advani went on a ‘Rath Yatra’ throughout India to mobilise people for a congregation on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya, to demolish Babri Masjid and encouraged people to bring one brick each to build a Ram temple in its place.” “If people lose trust in the courts, they will lose trust in democratic principles too. It will disturb the peace in the country,” he said, calling upon the Centre to file an appeal. MNM founder Kamal Haasan said the faith of every Indian that he would get justice should not be in vain. He wondered whether the failure to provide undeniable evidence and strong arguments was a planned act or a sign of irresponsibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/acquittal-of-babri-accused-a-shame-on-rule-of-law/article32737387.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Student visas are high priority, says U.S. Consul General||Student visas are high priority, and the U.S. Consulate in Chennai had started processing them in the middle of August, Judith Ravin, Consul General of the United States of America in Chennai, said on Wednesday. Ms. Ravin, who took charge as the Consul General recently, said the pandemic had curtailed operations at the consulate. As part of the U.S. Department of State’s ‘Diplomacy Strong’ initiative, a phased approach on which services could be offered while keeping the staff and the public safe was being adopted. “Student visas are really high priority… In the middle of August, we started processing student visas, cognisant of our priority of handling the workload that was possible to keep people safe. That continues, and we would like to see more than two lakh Indian students because international students internationalise our campuses. The diversity Indian students bring is very important,” Ms. Ravin said in an interview to The Hindu.  When asked if there was interest among students to apply to U.S. universities, considering that there had been confusion over student visas of late, she replied in the affirmative. “Yes. That’s why we are organising an education fair. We are having a very large virtual university graduate fair coming Friday and Saturday and a week later, we are having the undergraduate fair,” she added. Renovation process The Consul General said the consulate was set to undergo renovation to modernise facilities and create a more functional environment. When asked how the consulate was planning to hold events like it used to before the pandemic disrupted normal life, Ms. Ravin said it was creating more virtual programmes and using virtual platforms for events on intellectual property rights, arts and sciences, and an upcoming series in November-December for those curating museums.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/student-visas-are-high-priority-says-us-consul-general/article32737882.ece

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation recruits 12 differently abled persons||After having employed transgender persons recently, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has recruited 12 differently abled persons for jobs in solid waste management in Tiruvottiyur zone. The candidates, with hearing and speech impairment, would be employed at Sathangadu waste processing unit. The zone-1 (Tiruvottiyur) of the Corporation recently placed 10 transgender persons for conservancy jobs on a pilot basis.

They will be working in solid waste management processing units. We have employed them to improve the diversity of our staff as well as to give a sustainable livelihood opportunity for the disadvantaged. We have started it in zone-1, division-7 as a pilot project and are planning to extend it to other zones,” said P. Akash, Regional Deputy Commissioner (North), GCC. Mr. Akash said that they had been working along with an NGO, We Are Your Voice, for improving public participation and awareness in solid waste management. “They have been helping us improve the interface with the public and they pitched in the idea of employing persons with disabilities,” he said. Officials said the candidates were recruited and trained with the help of sign language interpreters by the NGO that works for the employmentof the differently-abled. They have their on-the-job training and grievance reporting facilities through a 24x7 helpline with video calling facility facilitated by the Corporation’s zonal control centre. “These persons are employed in the waste processing unit in Sathangadu. There are two kinds of units — micro composting centres (MCC) that handle biodegradable waste and resource recovery centres that deal with dry waste where different kinds of plastic are segregated for sale. At the MCC, they will be involved in segregating the waste, readying compost pits for preparing manure, and later, packing the manure for sale,” Mr. Akash said. Johny Tom Varghese, State Commissioner and director of Commissionerate for the Welfare of the Differently-Abled, took part in the induction programme for these candidates on Monday.

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More number of HC judges opt for physical hearing from Oct. 5||More number of judges of the Madras High Court have decided to go in for physical hearing of cases from October 5 despite a majority of lawyers having opted to conduct their cases only through virtual courts ever since six Division Benches of the court alone began hearing cases since September 5. The Madras High Court has a working strength of 54 judges, including its Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, as against its sanctioned strength of 75. Of them, 15 have been assigned to the Madurai Bench for a period of three months beginning from October 5. The rest of the 39 judges would continue to serve at the principal seat in Chennai. Early this month, six Division Benches of the High Court began hearing cases through both physical and virtual modes by alternating them in the forenoon and afternoon sessions. Advocates were given the option of choosing to argue their cases either before the physical or virtual court and surprisingly a majority of them chose to conduct cases through video conference. Safety concerns The number of cases listed for physical hearing was very thin compared to those listed before virtual courts. Though the judges attempted to persuade the counsel to agree for physical hearing, it was found difficult to convince all the counsel representing different parties since they feared COVID-19 and found it safe to argue cases through the virtual mode. After experimenting with the conduct of physical hearing through Division Benches, the High Court wanted to know how many more judges were interested in conducting physical hearing from October 5 and found that 26 of the 39 judges in the principal seat were agreeable to it and 13 opted to hold proceedings only through video conference. Hence, it was decided that apart from the six Division Benches, 14 single judges would also hear cases through both modes from Monday. The cases would be listed before the physical court only if all lawyers, representing different parties in every case, were agreeable to it. Other cases would be listed for virtual hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-number-of-hc-judges-opt-for-physical-hearing-from-oct-5/article32737887.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IT company booked for cheating SBI of Rs. 77.14 crore||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against a city-based IT company on the charge of cheating the State Bank of India (SBI) to the tune of Rs. 77.14 crore. The CBI’s Economic Offences Wing has booked M/s Gemini Communication Ltd., a company engaged in the business of system integration and providing networking and communication solutions. Its promoters, R. Vijay Kumar and R. Ram Kumar, executed security documents in favour of SBI and availed themselves of a loan of Rs. 69.5 crore. Owing to the non-payment of dues by the borrowers, the account was declared a non-performing asset on December 7, 2012. It came to light in a forensic audit report that the borrowers had availed themselves of/renewed/enhanced credit facilities by submitting false/manipulated financial statements (balance-sheets). They also diverted funds during the period of asset resolution process without the knowledge of the resolution professional and during the liquidation period without informing the liquidator. A case under Section 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against the promoters and other unknown public servants/private persons, the CBI said in the First Information Report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-company-booked-for-cheating-sbi-of-rs-7714-crore/article32737899.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Grama sabhas on October 2||The Tamil Nadu government has permitted authorities to conduct grama sabhas across the State on October 2, during the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown. An official communication from the State government to District Collectors mentioned agendas for the meetings on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Public expenses, awareness and precautionary measures in view of COVID-19 and the implementation of the ban on single-use plastics, are to be discussed during the meetings. Previously, the government had ordered the postponement of meetings on August 15, in view of the pandemic. DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday called upon panchayat presidents in the State to adopt a resolution against the newly-enacted agriculture legislations, in the grama sabhas on October 2. In a statement in Chennai, he said farmers and people across the county were against the three farm legislations. “But the AIADMK not just supported the Bills in both Houses of the Parliament, but it has also launched a campaign in favour of the legislations,” he said. Mr. Stalin also accused the AIADMK government of filing case after case against the DMK and its alliance partners for holding agitations and protests against the legislations. ‘Adopt resolution’ Stressing that it was imperative to express dissent against the legislations in panchayats, the cradle of Parliamentary democracy, Mr. Stalin said resolutions should be adopted in the grama sabhas on October 2. “Panchayat presidents cutting across party lines should enact resolutions to express their protest against the legislations, since the AIADMK government remains silent for selfish reasons,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grama-sabhas-on-october-2/article32737378.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 93% Anna varsity students take end-semester tests online||Over 93% students from affiliated colleges and 98% students from the four University departments took the end-semester exams online. The exams were held after much debate and trepidation about students lacking technical prowess, required gadgets and equipment to take the tests. The University Grants Commission and the All-India Council of Technical Education had stipulated that end-semester examinations must be held for students in the final year. The State government had issued several orders ruling out exams for students. Another chance Among the issues students faced was an inability to connect after logging in and not being able to complete the exam. The exams for final-year students, numbering 1.51 lakh, were held from September 24 to 29. During this time, of the 4,19,214 exams held, 3,91,379 were “successfully completed”, said M. Venkatesan, controller of examinations. Meanwhile, 10,574 students who logged in, failed to connect, and 17,261 were absent, he added. “We have already written to the government, saying that they must be given an opportunity to write the exams again. Once we receive the order, we will provide a timetable and they will be able to write the exams,” he said. S. Sanjeevi, the additional controller of examinations, who is in-charge of the four university campuses, said that “on one day, the attendance was 98.3% and on another 99%”. University exam officials said they were collating information about malpractices the students had committed during the exams. “We are getting details from the colleges and will know by tomorrow,” Mr. Venkatesan said. The university has issued instructions about how the students should conduct themselves during the online test. Any deviation from the rule will be construed as malpractice, he said. “We have accomplished it in the best possible way. It is for the first time in the country that online exams have been held for over 1.5 lakh students. Our exams were unlike JEE, where students have to come to a centre,” pointed out university vice-chancellor M.K. Surappa. According to him, around 5% students could not take the test. “We will give them a chance to write the exams. When technology is available and leadership is there, we have to take a stand. It is better for academicians to decide on the conduct of exams and there should be no interference. When more autonomy and freedom is given to universities, they will perform better,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-93-anna-varsity-students-take-end-semester-tests-online/article32737385.ece

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hindu Munnani founder Rama Gopalan passes away||Hindu Munnani founder Rama Gopalan, who had tested positive for COVID-19, died on Wednesday evening at a private hospital in Chennai. He was 94. Born in 1927 at Sirkazhi, Mr. Gopalan joined the RSS in 1945. He founded the Hindu Munnani in 1980 under the guidance of the RSS. Following the Meenakshipuram conversions in February 1981, in which around 200 Dalit families of the village converted to Islam as caste Hindus practiced untouchability, he tried to rally Hindus and prevent such conversions. Protecting the religion He had said that Hindu Munnani was formed to protect the religion from attacks by Islam, Christianity, Communism and those claiming to be rationalists. He had also said that Hindus practicing untouchability and caste discrimination were causing damage to the religion. In 1984, he escaped a bid on his life at the Madurai railway station. He was among those instrumental in turning immersion processions of Vinayaka idols into a public event in the last 30 years. Earlier, the tradition was to celebrate Vinayaka Chaturthi at houses and temples. In an interview in 2015 with The Hindu Group’s Frontline magazine, Mr. Gopalan hit out at Dravidian parties and the Communists. “Who says Tamil Nadu is a State of secularism? It is anti-Hindu. These acts of double standards and deceit are for vote-bank politics, which has corrupted the system,” Mr. Gopalan had said. Hindu Munnani State president Kadeswara C. Subramaniam said the organisation’s flags would be flown at half-mast across the State, and condolence meetings would be organised. Governor Banwarilal Purohit, in a condolence message, said, “Fondly known as Veera Thuravi , he dedicated his entire life for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.” Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami also condoled Mr. Gopalan’s death. In a statement, Mr. Palaniswami said Mr. Gopalan had taken part in the freedom struggle and was a guide to Hindu Munnani. He also extended his condolences to members of the movement. DMK president M.K. Stalin, in a tweet, said: “Although there were ideological differences, he was a good friend of Kalaignar [former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi]”. Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani recalled that despite ideological differences, Mr. Gopalan and he would exchange pleasantries and enquire about each other’s well-being whenever they met. ‘A big loss’ Terming his death a big loss for the Hindus of Tamil Nadu, BJP State president L. Murugan said Mr. Gopalan fought to bring unity among Hindus, and fought against religious conversions and injustice meted out to Hindus. He had also raised his voice against cow slaughter. Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, PMK founder S. Ramadoss, DMDK founder Vijayakant, AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran and former Health Minister H.V. Hande were among those who expressed condolences.  Although there were ideological differences, he was a good friend of Kalaignar [former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi] M.K.

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen from Ennore stage protest at Kamarajar Port||Fishermen belonging to eight villages along the Ennore Creek staged a protest on Wednesday demanding a permanent solution to the silting of the creek’s estuary. The two ports north of the creek and the thermal power stations were leading to silting of the estuary and erosion of coastline. “Earlier, we had a dredger working round the clock to remove silt. About four or five years ago, it was stopped. Now we have a couple of earth movers parked there doing nothing. We need the old dredging system back,” said Kalaivanan of Nettukuppam. The fishermen said industries and ports had prevented the movement of the current towards the north, which had led to sand getting deposited in the wrong place, causing depletion of the coast. Fishermen from Nettukuppam, Thalangkuppam, Ennorekuppam, Sivanpadaiveedukuppam, Chinnakuppam, Periyakuppam, Mugadwarakuppam and Kattukuppam blockaded the entry/exit point to the Kamarajar Port in an effort to draw the attention of the State government. “We have written so many letters to the district administration and the government but it has been of no use. We blockaded the port to show our protest. We also want steps to be taken to protect the mangroves in our area. They have been damaged beyond repair,” said Desappan, a fisherman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-from-ennore-stage-protest-at-kamarajar-port/article32737873.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anglo-Indian community wants to be designated separate minority||The Anglo-Indian community has urged the Central government to grant them the status of a separate minority and to take steps to restore and extend the special reservation for nomination of the community’s members to Parliament and the State Assemblies. In a memorandum to the Prime Minister, Augustine Roy Rozario, founder-president, Anglo-Indian Suburban Front, sought the status of a separate minority for the community by amending the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, as done for the Jain community in 2014, to protect the ethnic, linguistic, tradition and culture of the Anglo-Indian community. He appealed for urgent steps to restore and extend the special reservation for the nomination of Anglo-Indian members to Parliament and the State Assemblies beyond January 26 for a period of 10 years. This, he said, was shelved in the 126th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2019, based on an “erroneous enumeration” done in the 2011 Census. This was the only Constitutional guarantee left for the community to safeguard its interests, he said in the memorandum. Though the community comprises Christians, they have different ethnic and linguistic characteristics. The memorandum pointed out the abolishing or denying of Constitutional rights to Anglo-Indians, including the abolishment of the 5% job reservation in 1960 and the stopping of educational grants. Leaders of 11 major Anglo-Indian associations met the Union Law Minister on January 28 and submitted a memorandum clarifying that the population of the community was around 4 lakh and not 296 as mentioned in the 2011 Census.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anglo-indian-community-wants-to-be-designated-separate-minority/article32737870.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Quick reporting of online fraud ensures recovery of funds: police||Cyber crime cells are helping victims in a big way in recovering stolen money, especially since most crimes are being reported within 24 hours of their occurrence. Sanyasi Rao, 51, of Ambattur lost Rs. 39,000 to an unknown online fraudster when he was searching for a customer care number. He immediately lodged a complaint with the Ambattur cyber crime cell, who traced the money trail and spoke to the bank and the payment gateway. The funds were retrieved in a day. Selvaraj, a businessman from Washermenpet, received an SMS informing him about fraudulent transactions from his account at an Australian bank. The cyber crime cell of the Washermanpet police traced the transaction to Melbourne and contacted the bank, who used the chargeback option to credit the amount back in Mr. Selvaraj’s account within a day. Francis Anthony Beniger, a businessman, complained to the cyber crime cell of Adyar that an unknown person had cloned his international debit card and purchased some products in Brooklyn, U.S. He received an SMS charging him $600 (Rs. 46,000) for the fraudulent purchases. The cyber cell immediately got in touch with his bank and the transaction was blocked. The following day, Mr. Beniger received a full refund. “On any complaint, we are able to initiate chargeback on OTP or any other financial frauds. We can stop the payment if the victim lodges a complaint within 24 hours. Our success depends on their awareness,” said a senior police officer who supervises cyber crime cells. Cyber crime cells, inaugurated by Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, are functioning in the city’s 12 police districts since August 1. A cell comprises of four to six police personnel, led by a sub-inspector with expertise in cyber crimes. Deputy Commissioners of Police directly supervise the operations. According to the police, the cells have received 1,010 complaints so far. Over 143 complaints were solved and investigations into 460 of them are nearing completion. About Rs. 30 lakh have been retrieved from culprits. The cells handle complaints on cyber stalking, harassment on social media, posts containing obscene and pornographic material and bank frauds. The cells have also been entrusted with the job of tracing stolen or missing mobile phones. A senior police officer said, “All complaints on missing phones and theft of mobile phones have been forwarded to cyber crime cells. Using IMEI numbers, the phones are traced and recovered. Over 1,200 mobile phones have been retrieved and handed over to the original owners.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/quick-reporting-of-online-fraud-ensures-recovery-of-funds-police/article32737901.ece
01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Villupuram-Nagapattinam road widening work to begin soon||Widening of the 180-km-long stretch of East Coast Road (ECR) from Villupuram to Nagapattinam is expected to commence in a couple of months with the land acquisition process at an advanced stage. The road will be made into a four-lane-wide facility. “We have to hand over at least 80% of the required land to the contractors before commencement of the work and that is nearing completion. By January, we can expect the works to begin. The widening of the Sirkali to Nagapattinam road will begin by November,” said an official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is executing the project. Though bids had already been called for the project for stretches between Puducherry and Cuddalore and Cuddalore and Sirkali, the contracts had to be terminated since the land could not be handed over in time. The land acquisition for the Sirkali to Nagapattinam stretch is in an advanced stage, the official added. Some 110 km of the route would be new formations and Cuddalore and Puducherry towns would be completely avoided by the construction of bypasses. The Rs. 6,000 crore project would have underpasses and inter-changing ramps every 2 km to ensure the safety of motorists and other road users. “It would also help in the segregation of local traffic and prevent accidents. Similar facilities have been provided on the Coimbatore-Perundurai route,” an official explained. The works, which include construction of 60 bridges, would take between 24 and 30 months to be completed. The project would make driving a very comfortable experience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villupuram-nagapattinam-road-widening-work-to-begin-soon/article32738135.ece

Justice N. Sathish Kumar rejected the plea for extending the interim order and directed the Registry to list the case for hearing on Monday since the actor and director M. Anand of Chakra had filed counter-affidavits denying all claims made by the proprietor of Trident Arts. Advocate Krishna Ravindran, representing the actor, told the court that Chakra had been produced by Vishal Film Factory (VFF) and no restraint order could be issued against its release on OTT platforms on the basis of alleged violation of an agreement entered for Action . Stating that Chakra was almost ready for release, he accused Trident Arts of attempting to blackmail the actor-producer by filing the case and obtaining interim orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-clears-chakras-release-on-ott-platforms/article32737871.ece

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||PIL against banning of ornaments in NEET centres||A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the National Testing Agency (NTA) to remove ornaments from the list of items barred at the centres where National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical and dental admissions are conducted every year. Advocate S. Arvind Raj filed the PIL petition on the ground that a ban on ornaments and metallic items had led to many women being asked even to remove their sacred ‘thali’ before being allowed to enter the examination centres. He said such an insistence went against religious customs, and subjected the candidates to mental agony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pil-against-banning-of-ornaments-in-neet-centres/article32737885.ece

Balasubrahmanyam, who passed away on September 25. Several actors, directors and singers reminisced about the singer. “Many of us learnt how to treat others from him. Having travelled with him for concerts, we saw how respectful he was towards the musicians who used to perform with him,” singer Chitra recalled. She said she had sung the maximum number of songs with SPB in the course of her career. “He used to help me a lot in how to pronounce and understand Telugu when we recorded songs together,” she said. Singer Unni Menon said he had learnt immensely from the senior singer during their travels and concerts together. Music composer Vidyasagar said the singer’s death was like the loss of a family member for all. SPB was famous not just for his singing prowess but also for the human being that he was, he said. “He was a constant teacher for me, throughout my life,” singer Mano said. Actors Venkatesh, Sivakumar and Nasser and director Bharathiraja were among those who reflected on their association with the singer through video messages. In an emotional message, composer Gangai Amaran, a close friend of the singer for years, said SPB’s death was an irreplaceable loss.

01 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Apollo Hospitals gets latest diagnostic tool||Apollo Hospitals has installed the latest cardiac diagnostic equipment, the Aquilion One Prism 640-slice CT Scanner, in the city. The non-invasive equipment will allow for one-stop assessment of heart functions, including blood supply and muscle activity of the organ. It can also be used for specialties such as oncology, neurology and paediatric problems, the hospital officials said. Health minister C. Vijayabaskar, who commissioned the scanner on Wednesday, said, “It is a matter of pride that Apollo Hospitals continues to bring the latest and best of medical technology to the State and country for the benefit of the patients.” Hospital founder and chairman Prathap C. Reddy said the new equipment was another step towards making the country ‘atma-nirbhar’ by providing world-class treatment in the country at a fraction of the cost.  The new equipment could image the entire heart in less than a third of a second to allow rapid diagnosis, he said. “The speed ensures there is no delay in either discharging the patient if there are no problems or taking decisions for treatment course in case of coronary artery disease. If the problem is mild then follow up can be continued. The other advantage is that it enhances patient safety as they are exposed to lower radiation levels,” he said. The advanced Aquilion One Prism CT is swift enough to take an image with the span of two heart beats. It is extremely easy to use and covers the whole heart in one rotation, which also makes it feasible for cardiac perfusion studies. Both coronary CT and full aortogram can be done in tandem. The images produced by the scanner are crisp and clear and hence make the diagnosis very accurate, he added. Hospital vice-chairperson Preetha Reddy said, “With the latest advances in medical technology, we are now in an era of non-invasive diagnosis and minimally invasive treatments for heart disease. Cardiac CT allows us to rule out heart disease with 99% accuracy and avoid more invasive testing. In early cases of heart disease, patients can be started on preventive therapy and management, while patient with moderate to advanced heart disease can be immediately referred for an angiogram, stenting or surgery .” Suneeta Reddy, managing director, Apollo Hospitals Group, said, “The new scanner is about using technology to optimise patient care through accelerated clinical decision-making for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/apollo-hospitals-installs-latest-cardiac-diagnostic-tool/article32737879.ece

01 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Centre considering special export package for some textile products’||The Central government plans to extend special export package for 40 man-made fibre (MMF) products and 10 technical textile products that have a global market of $ 250 billion, said Ravi Capoor, Secretary of Textiles, Government of India. Speaking at the annual meeting of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI), he said that India has just 0.7 % global share in these product lines. He advised the stakeholders to focus on value added MMF segment, technical textiles, scale of operation and indigenous textile machinery manufacturing facilities to make Indian textiles and clothing industry globally competitive. According to a study conducted by the government, the share of MMF-based textiles and clothing products will scale up to 80% by 2030 and that of cotton segment will shrink to 20%. Since huge market space will be available in the international market due to geo-political issues and also scaling down of textiles and manufacturing activities in China, India should equip itself to meet the global requirement. The textiles secretary also urged the spinning mills to enter into long-term contracts with farmers for Extra Long Staple (ELS) cotton so that the dependency on imports can be reduced. The industry should focus on speciality cotton, he said.  T. Rajkumar, chairman of Sri Mahasakthi Mills, Palakkad, was re-elected as Chairman of the Confederation for 2020-2021. S K Kandelia, President and CEO of Sutlej Textiles and Industries is the Deputy Chairman and R L Nolkha, Chairman of Nithin Spinners, Bhilwara, is the Vice-Chairman of CITI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-considering-special-export-package-for-some-textile-products/article32737448.ece

The NGO’s organiser K. Syed said he received a call from a resident that a champak tree planted 20 years ago was being cut by some unknown persons. As the resident handed over the phone to one of the persons involved in cutting the tree, he denied that it was being axed and they fled the spot, he said. The 50-feet-tall tree was spared with only a few of its branches being cut, he said. “Many choose to cut such trees without any authorisation for minor inconveniences,” Mr. Syed said, which include blockage of view by a tree, accumulation of tree litteror birds flocking a particular tree. The NGO will approach the Revenue Department if such attempts to cut trees illegally were reported in the future, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/20-year-old-champak-tree-saved-from-being-axed/article32737908.ece

01 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||MSMEs seek priority in getting new power connections||The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations has urged the State Government and the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to give priority to micro and small-scale industries when they apply for new power connection or additional load. In a memorandum submitted to the government and the Tangedco on the draft Electricity Rules, the Federation said the State Government and Tangedco had already implemented several features of the draft Electricity Rules. Further, the MSMEs face challenges in getting the connection due to corruption in the system. The rules should specify that the new connections or additional load are provided within seven to 30 days. Otherwise, the officials concerned should be penalised. If there are defects or damages to a meter, the consumer is blamed invariably. The Tangedco should identify neutral testing centres where the meters can be tested. Further, as in Gujarat, power consumed at night by industries should be at concessional tariff. Any grievance related to electricity should be redressed in seven to 10 days rather than one to one-and-a half months as proposed in the Rules. The Rules should also define what "quality" power means as industries continue to face voltage fluctuations and drop in frequency, the federation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/msmes-seek-priority-in-getting-new-power-connections/article32737421.ece

01 October 2020||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Feedback system introduced in 52 Cuddalore police stations||The Cuddalore district police have introduced a system to get feedback from the public on police personnel who they approache to get their grievances redressed. This feedback system has been introduced in all 52 police stations, including six All-Women Police Stations in the district. Cuddalore Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav introduced the system by having a dedicated team of personnel under his supervision to discreetly collect information from the public on whether they faced any harassment or indifferent attitude. “The system started with passport verification to prevent cops from asking tips. Public interface with police is only through passport verification and police verification certificate for jobs. The team contacts the passport applicants on their mobile phones at random to get information on whether they faced any harassment or whether there was demand from the cops for money to process their applications,” Mr. Sree Abhinav told The Hindu . Police stations are service delivery centres and the idea is to gauge assessment of the services rendered, he said. The system has now been extended to other services including registration of FIR/CSR. Once an FIR is registered, the mobile phone number of the complainant is automatically generated and collected from the server. The team collects the feedback from the public on a form on all issues, including land disputes. The applicants and complainants are randomly selected from various police sub-divisions and jurisdictions on a daily basis to enquire about the quality of service. Identity confidential The team alone has access to the feedback received from the applicants and complainants in all stations. The identity is kept confidential and the public too do not know the police personnel who collect the feedback. “Though we have also received negative feedback, including complaints of harassment and delay in registering FIRs, the overall feedback has been satisfactory,” said an inspector attached to the team. The negative feedback is directly forwarded to the SP and the officers are pulled up and warned. In some instances, they are transferred to the Armed Reserve, the inspector added. This system would go on as its purpose is to augment the interface between the public and the police on sound and healthy grounds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/feedback-system-introduced-in-52-cuddalore-police-stations/article32738133.ece

01 October 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||‘Fertilizer stock inadequate’||Farmers from Oddanchathiram belt in Dindigul district complained about non-availability of fertilizers at the online grievance day meet on Wednesday. Collector M Vijayalakshmi presided over the meeting. Farmers from the respective blocks were provided online facility at the nearest agriculture or Block Development Office. Farmers from Thamaraipadi and Sanarpatti blocks also raised the issue of fertilizer shortage. The Collector directed the officials to check and ensure that there were sufficient stocks of fertilizers. Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam president Perumal said many farmers were yet to get compensation for their crop loss of 2016. “Though we paid the premiums, the insurance company has not given the compensation to many of us,” he said. A horticulture official said compensation was credited to the accounts of farmers who had agreed to the quantum. When the farmers complained that Rs. 6,000 as assistance was not yet credited into their bank accounts under the PM-KISAN scheme, the Collector said that since irregularities were found in many districts, the government had ordered a probe by the CB-CID. As the investigation was in progress, the farmers must wait for some more time to get the assistance. However, the farmers claimed that some of the banks had frozen the accounts of even genuine farmers and demanded that they be allowed to operate them. Seeking better price for milk, some of the farmers said that when drinking water was sold at Rs. 20 per litre, the government procured milk at Rs. 18 due to which farmers could not even break even. The procurement price must be raised at least by 30%, they said. Sanarpatti farmers said that though north-east monsoon was near, many tanks have not been desilted. The Collector directed the PWD and other allied departments to desilt the tanks so as to improve the storage. The farmers also sought permission to lift the alluvial soil from the tanks.A section of farmers from Nilakottai said that there was a shortage of farm labourers. Hence, MGNREGA workers should be allowed to work in agriculture fields of individuals for the time being, they said. Another section of farmers said that instead of diverting water from Kudaganaru to Siddayankottai, which benefited 3,000 acres, it should be allowed to flow on its own course so that it would benefit 13,000 acres. Moreover, around 2 lakh acres in the region would also benefit by way of recharge of groundwater.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fertilizer-stock-inadequate/article32737414.ece
01 October 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Business to resume in Gandhi Market||Woes of vegetable vendors at Gandhi Vegetable Market here never seem to end. The market, which has been functioning for quite a long time, was shut down as a precautionary measure by the civic authorities when COVID-19 surfaced. Normal life came to a standstill for over 250 vendors who procure produce from far and near and sell them to local residents. Though the government relaxed lockdown norms, there was no clarity about the reopening of the market. When the civic authorities announced alternative places as a makeshift arrangement, the vegetable market started functioning from the bus stand as well as on the grounds of MVM Government College for Women during June and July. The district administration moved the vendors to a space in ITI on Natham Road after sometime. Meanwhile, the civic authorities demolished outlets at the Gandhi Market and constructed new buildings as most of the shops were in a bad condition and required to be razed down. When the vendors were waiting for civil works to be completed, some officials gave pressure on the vendors to vacate the premises, vendors alleged. While some vendors were selling their produce on Natham Road, others preferred to move to the Gandhi Market where the work was still in progress. The vendors, in a memorandum submitted to the Corporation Commissioner, said that they had no other alternative but to move into their outlets earmarked in the Gandhi Market and pleaded with the authorities to get the remaining work completed so that they can start afresh from October 2. A civic official said that 80 % of the work at the market was completed and they were permitting vendors to move in. He admitted that there was a delay in getting the work completed in time due to the pandemic and the vendors can commence their activities as usual from October 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/business-to-resume-in-gandhi-market/article32737400.ece
01 October 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK backs Palaniswami as CM candidate: Minister||Forests Minister Dindigul C. Srinivasan, a senior AIADMK leader, on Wednesday said the party backed Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its face for the 2021 Assembly election. Asked about the “confusion” over the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate, Mr. Srinivasan said the party backed Mr. Palaniswami. “Mediapersons should wait to hear on October 7, when both the leaders [Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam] will jointly announce the candidate,” he added. He described the “tussle” between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam at the party’s recent executive council meeting as an “internal affair”. The AIADMK, he felt, would win hands down, in the next elections. Deputy CM’s absence On Mr. Panneerselvam’s absence from an official meeting chaired by the Chief Minister, he said the latter was fully aware of the Deputy Chief Minister’s engagements that day. “There is no issue within the party and internal matters will be settled amicably,” he said. Meanwhile, two Ministers on Wednesday came up with different versions on why Mr. Panneerselvam did not attend the meeting. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said the pre-occupation of Mr. Panneerselvam, who is also the AIADMK coordinator, with party work, was the reason for his absence at the meeting on Tuesday. Just as Mr. Panneerselvam was busy with party work, Mr. Palaniswami was looking after the affairs of the government, Mr. Jayakumar told reporters at his residence in Chennai. As for the omission of the Deputy Chief Minister’s name on the invitation of an event concerning the Greater Chennai Corporation, the Minister said “no motive” should be attributed to it. Separately, Revenue Minister R.B.

01 October 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||As 4-month excavation concludes, granary found at Kodumanal||The four-month excavation at Kodumanal village by the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology concluded here on Wednesday, with a team unearthing a well-like granary in one of the quadrants in an area believed to be a habitation-cum-industrial site. The team, led by J. Ranjith, Archaeology Officer, Chennai, and Project Director for Kodumanal Excavation, began the work on May 27. It comprised S. Nandakumar, Coordinator for the excavation from the Department of Archaeology, Coimbatore; T. Subramaniam, Assistant Director (Retired), Department of Archaeology; an expert coordinating the excavation with researchers; and 70 workers. In the 45 quadrants that were dug, utensils, terracotta, copper and iron beads, semi-precious stones such as carnelian, quartz, and crystals were found. “Samples were sent for pollen analysis that will reveal evidence of past ecological and climate changes,” Mr. Ranjith told The Hindu . He said 500 kg of animal skeletons were found in the habitation mounds and 75 kg of skeletons would be sent for an analysis to identify the species. He said a rubble masonry wall measuring 25 metres was found and further analysis would reveal whether it had served as a waterway. Also, a four-course brick structure dating to the Sangam Era was found. A well-like granary with sockets was found at a humus level of 4.25 metres in a quadrant. It could have been used to store grain. “Since its depth is over three metres, grain could have been stored for many persons,” said Mr. Subramaniam. Graffiti and copper and silver punch mark coins were also found at the site. Of the 300 burial pits, 27 were opened. They revealed three types of burials: cairn circle, urn burial and urn burial with and without cists. Two burial pits had 42 ceremonial pots each, along with arrowheads, terracotta beads, iron swords and graffiti. Officials said documentation would be taken up in the coming days and a report would be submitted to the Department of Archaeology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ancient-granary-found-at-kodumanal/article32737420.ece
01 October 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||No takers for Malliamman Durgham guavas||Residents of Malliamman Durgham, a remote tribal settlement in Kadambur Hills, are a worried lot as their main source of annual income through sale of guava is hit due to COVID-19 pandemic. The hamlet with a population of 450 is located nine km from a motorable road in Kadambur. Inscriptions on a hero stone in the settlement confirm that the region was under Vijayanagara Empire during the 14th century. The tribal residents cultivate finger millet (ragi), broad beans, tapioca and other millets on their small land holdings throughout the year, for their own needs. Their only source of income comes from the harvest of guava trees, raised on 120-acre patta and poramboke lands in the hamlet, from August to October. The hills also have jack fruit trees and the fruits are sold to traders in Kadambur . The current guava season had turned disastrous for the people as they were unable to find traders who could buy the fruits. “The fruits are not harvested and left to fall on the ground,” said M.K. Subramani (40). Last year, a box of guava weighing 25 kg was sold between Rs. 600 and Rs. 720, whereas now a box of guava is available for Rs. 250, but there are no takers. “Due to rains, the production is good in the current season. But pandemic prevented the traders from buying the fruits,” he added. Recently, they started selling guava to traders at markets in Annur and Coimbatore. However, most of their earnings went towards transportation and other expenses. “Only with this income, we buy household essentials, meet health care expenditure and celebrate festivals. Now, we will be forced to borrow money to meet our needs,” said Sasi, a resident of the hamlet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-takers-for-malliamman-durgham-guavas/article32737425.ece

01 October 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Nearly 750 cases recorded after lockdown relaxation||Madurai district has recorded 700 to 750 active cases in September after the State government’s decision to relax the lockdown norms. However, to reduce the number of active cases, doctors say stringent protocol regarding wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing should be in place to ensure that the daily rise in the number of cases remains under control. Head of the COVID-19 speciality hospital at Government Rajaji Hospital K. Senthil says that in the last month, there has been a mild spike in the total number of cases recorded. However, the effect of the spike has been cancelled by the number of recoveries. “The spike has been manageable despite the resumption of public transport. This, however, should not make us complacent. The more the lockdown norms are relaxed, the more careful we should be and be vigilant all the time,” he says. Deputy Director of Health Services K.V. Arjun Kumar says outside of the general awareness raised by the district administration regarding wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing, officials have been levying fines on those flouting rules under the Disaster Management Act. “The district administration is monitoring crowded areas to ensure that social distancing is maintained. We must understand that in order to reduce the total number of active cases, the daily case rise must also be curbed. This can be achieved only if the public also complies,” he says. Dr. Senthil adds that hand washing protocol must also be kept in mind. “Health workers have been working hard through the last seven months in Madurai so that people can stay safe. The public too must take the first step towards taking precautions,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nearly-750-cases-recorded-after-lockdown-relaxation/article32738018.ece
01 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Runway re-carpeting work taken up at Madurai airport||Airports Authority of India has taken up the work of re-carpeting runway at Madurai airport. The work to be executed at a cost of Rs. 20.67 crore that began on Monday would be completed by November 2021. “We will take up the civil works at night after the operations at the airport gets over,” said Airport Director S. Senthil Valavan. The surface of the runway would undergo wear and tear over the years due to landing and taking off of flights, Mr. Senthil Valavan. Besides, the runway would also have rubber deposits. “We take up the re-carpeting work after around 10 years. This work involves providing three different layers over the existing runway,” he added. The runway is handed over to the contractor for the civil work after midnight. The work is completed in a staggered manner by 6 a.m. This includes the cooling time for the work completed to enable safe landing and take off of flights. Madurai airport has a 2,286-metre-long runway with a width of 45 metres. “Every day the work is taken up for around 50 metres depending upon the weather conditions. Along with the runway, the re-carpeting work is taken up for the taxiway and also the turnpad. Apron work Meanwhile, expansion of the apron at the airport is progressing at a faster phase and over 90% of the work has been completed. The existing apron can accommodate one Boeing-737-400, one Airbus-A310, two AB-320/B or 737-800 and three ATR-72-500 aircraft. However, with the airport having the facilities to handle 700 passengers in peak hour and demand for more domestic and international flights, the need for expansion of apron was felt. “We will be able to provide four additional bays for A-321-200/B737-800 type of aircraft and a helipad for parking two helicopters. The additional bays would help provide night parking facilities and attract additional flights,” Mr. Senthil Valavan said. The work has been taken up at a cost of Rs. 15.43 crore. Despite non-availability of construction materials for nearly two months during the initial phases of lockdown, the work did not stop as the officials were able to retain all north Indian workers. “While the workers, like their counterparts across the State, wanted to go back to their native places, we assured them that they would be provided a safe stay here,” he said.  Safety matters  The re-carpeting work has been taken up after 10 years  It is also done for taxiway and the turnpad The work has been taken up at a cost of Rs. 20.67 crore||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/runway-re-carpeting-work-taken-up-at-madurai-airport/article32738023.ece

01 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Fish died due to low level of dissolved oxygen in tank, reveals TNPCB study||The recent death of a large number of fish at Saravana Poigai, the temple tank of Subramaniaswamy temple at Tirupparankundram, was caused mainly due to low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, reveals the findings submitted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the Fisheries department. Executive Officer of the temple M. Ramasamy said that the dead fish floating in the pond were being removed since Friday morning. An official from the TNPCB said that there must be a minimum dissolved oxygen level of 4mg/ litre in the water for healthy survival of fish. “But, from the samples listed from the pond, it was found that the dissolved oxygen levels were between 1mg/litre and 2 mg/litre. We are continuing with our investigation to find out why the dissolved oxygen levels reduced in the pond,” said the official. Mr. Ramasamy also said that the findings revealed that the fish density at the pond was also higher. An official from the Fisheries department said that the main issue was that the water in the pond was stagnant as there was no outlet point. “The water is also severely contaminated as devotees and residents washed their clothes using detergents with powerful chemicals. Hence, we have suggested the officials to not grow fish in the pond,” he added. He said that they have increased the number of motors to four as these will help improve dissolved oxygen levels in the water. “The pond is also currently closed for public use,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fish-died-due-to-low-level-of-dissolved-oxygen-in-tank-reveals-tnpcb-study/article32738015.ece

01 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Buy plantain bunches based on weight and not height: farmers||Farmers here complain that plantain bunches are procured at lower rates by commission agents due to lack of a fixed rate for their produce. They say the plantain bunches must be procured based on their weight rather than the current practice where the bunches are bought based upon their height. K.M. Gopalan, a farmer from Melavalavu, says the commission agents categorise plantain bunches based on the height and buy through auction. “The traders will see the number of rows of plantains in each bunch and accordingly pay for it,” he says. But the problem arises when there is a huge disparity in the amount paid by traders for two different bunches with almost the same number of rows, says P. Gnanasekaran, a farmer from Mullipallam. “Already the farmers have to pay a hefty sum for the labour and transportation costs. When traders pay the farmers a pittance, they can hardly earn any profit,” he adds. The farmers suffered huge losses during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, says D.Sekaran from Ettimangalam in Melur block. “It was mainly due to the transportation problem and lower demand for bananas,” he says. The traders often work in coalition and pay lower amount for the farmers. An official from the Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business department says they have received petitions from farmers for selling banana bunches at regulated markets through auction. “We will look into the possibility,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/buy-plantain-bunches-based-on-weight-and-not-height-farmers/article32738030.ece

01 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Replica of Oussudu Lake, a feather in Puducherry’s cap||A microcosm of the outlying Oussudu Lake, the roosting spot for a variety of migratory birds, has been recreated through a tableaux of life-like models on the premises of the Department of Forests and Wildlife. The Oussudu Interpretation Centre replicates the characteristics of the lake’s ecosystem, especially its avifauna, through a mix of artistic landscaping, three-dimensional modelling, paintings and stone sculptures. Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy formally opened the centre to the public on Wednesday and undertook a survey of the features. Top wetland Apart from recreating the biodiversity of Oussudu, recognised as one of the important wetlands of Asia by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the interpretation centre also offers a study of other local or endemic floral and faunal attributes, such as Olive Ridley turtles. A stone sculpture at the entrance captures all the four State symbols of Puducherry — the Asian Koel, the Indian Palm Squirrel, the Cannon Ball Flower and the Vilva Tree. Paintings on kadappa stone (black limestone) feature species such as the Brahminy Kite, Painted Stork, Purple Swamphen and the Pheasant Tailed Jacana, while a fibre sculpture of the Greater Flamingos and single stone carvings of the Indian Chameleon, Russel Viper and Fan-Throated Lizard greet visitors at the entrance. Inside the special gel replica of the lake are featured ferro cement and fibre canvas models of 22 avifauna species of Oussudu, an ecosystem which falls under the joint aegis of the Governments of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. The models have been positioned with an astonishing degree of precision exactly as they would be perched in natural habitat. The two-storeyed building housing the interpretation centre could well be the country’s first art-based facility of its kind created by a team of officials led by G. Sathiyamoorthy, Conservator of Forests. Conceived under a Centrally-sponsored scheme, the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco System, at a cost of Rs. 86 lakh, it took nearly two years to realise the carefully curated project. The centre has come up on a final cost of about Rs. 1 crore, including the landscaping and art theme expenditure. “The centre is unique in being art-themed and also in that every detail is hand-crafted, right down to the texts accompanying the exhibits which are handwritten and not digitally produced,” said Vanjulavalli Karthik, Deputy Conservator of Forests. A group of about 25 wildlife artists associated with the Universal Eco Foundation, a city-based biodiversity conservation and awareness disseminating organisation, were commissioned for making the exhibits. No effort has been spared to provide a real-life feel to the models, right down to the taxonomic specifics of each species. Rich experience The Forest Department has planned the centre to serve as a half-day tour with the added experience of visiting the adjacent deer park. “We are planning to have a full-time guide to assist visitors. And in the long term, we could even provide a day-long experience for visitors by connecting a trip to the centre with an urban forest trail,” Ms. Karthik said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/replica-of-oussudu-lake-a-feather-in-puducherrys-cap/article32738138.ece

01 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Narayanasamy blames Bedi for the closure of mills||Blaming Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for the closure of Swadeshi Cotton Mills and Bharathi Textile Mills, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday said Ms. Bedi had “threatened” officials to issue an order closing down the mills without the knowledge of the elected government. Addressing a press conference along with Minister for Industries M.O.H.F. Shahjahan at the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Minister said as was the case with Anglo French Textiles, the government forwarded a file to the Lt. Governor, seeking financial sanction for Rs. 1 crore to provide layoff salary to workers in Swadeshi and Bharathi Mills. Instead of giving sanction, she directly sent the file to the management of the mills, directing their closure. “The government did not receive any communication on the closure of the mills. She sent the file directly to the department concerned and threatened the official to issue the closure order,” the Chief Minister said. The Lt. Governor was duty bound to refer subjects that she had differences with the government to the President. She had no right to take unilateral decisions, the Chief Minister added. Whether it was her intervention to close down AFT Mills or reluctance to accord pay sanction to teachers of aided schools and workers of various societies, the Chief Minister said the Lt. Governor had the sole intention of bringing disrepute to the elected government. “The government is only answerable to the workers and teachers. Her decisions are to tarnish the image of the government and with the intent to deny a good name to the Congress government,” he said, adding, “The time will soon come to put an end to such acts.” Verification of the files related to the mills and payment of salary by anyone, including the Prime Minister or the Home Minister, would reveal the style of functioning of the Lt. Governor, the Chief Minister said. Questioning the BJP’s criticism against his government on the closure of the mills, the Chief Minister said the Lt. Governor was appointed by the BJP-led government at the Centre. “The BJP has double standards. If the party was keen on the revival of the mills, then it should have prevailed upon the Lt. Governor to accept the government’s demand to provide salary instead of closing it down,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/narayanasamy-blames-bedi-for-closure-of-swadeshi-bharathi-mills/article32737895.ece

Nominated legislator and party president V. Saminathan, in a statement, said the mills were getting closed at a time when unemployment rate was high in the Union Territory. The government failed to revive the mills. The party was all in favour of restructuring and reviving the mills to provide jobs to hundreds of people, he said. The government could have sold the land owned by Anglo French Textiles at Pattanoor to clear the liabilities accrued by the mills, he said. If the BJP comes to power in the Union Territory, the mills would be revived, he added.  If the BJP comes to power in the Union Territory, the mills will be revived V.

In a statement on Wednesday, AIADMK leader A. Anbalagan said there was no clarity on the amount received and money utilised from the fund for COVID-19 related works. The government should also make public the funds received from the Centre and the expenses incurred to procure medicine and medical equipment in the fight against the pandemic. Expenses incurred for providing free food to patients admitted in hospitals should also be made public, he said. Urging the Chief Minister and the Lt. Governor to work in unison to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Union Territory, the AIADMK leader said it would not augur well if both continued to work in different directions. The government could constitute a committee, comprising Ministers to interact with the Lt.

Rains in the past one week led to drains at Ramanathapuram getting clogged and overflowing causing inconvenience to residents and road-users. Rani, a resident, said that they are facing problems during the rainy season as the drainage channel was not desilted. Also, the capacity of the channel is not sufficient to hold the rain water, she said. On Wednesday, stagnated sewage water on the road irked road-users who had to wade through the water while pedestrians faced more trouble in crossing the road. “Even before the start of the North-East monsoon, the situation is worse here”, said a two-wheeler rider. He wanted the channel to be desilted so that water does not flow onto the road. Many residents fear that the perennial problem, if not attended now, will lead to an outbreak of water-borne diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sewage-mixed-rain-water-poses-problems-for-residents/article32737437.ece

01 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Residents pitch for canal banks as alternative road links||While the Public Works Department is busy reinforcing a small stretch of Uyyakondan canal bund after an old sluice collapsed near Puthur Weir in the city on Monday, a section of residents has urged the district and civic authorities to strengthen and develop the canal bank as an alternative route to the narrow and congested Vayalur Road. The sluice, an old masonry structure, collapsed during heavy rainfall on Monday, leading to erosion of a substantial portion of the bund. PWD authorities have begun repair work and are engaged in reinforcing the bund using sand bags and casuarina poles. Traffic along the bund has been suspended temporarily by PWD authorities as water is in full flow in the canal. “We are carrying out temporary repairs and reinforcing the bund so as to prevent any further erosion. Permanent repair and rebuilding of the sluice will be taken up under the kudimaramathu scheme after irrigation season,” a PWD official told The Hindu . The work is expected to be completed by Thursday, officials said. Meanwhile, commuters traversing the route to avoid Vayalur Road were caught unawares and had to return on finding the route blocked on Tuesday. Many of them feel that it is time that the authorities develop the bund as a full-fledged road as Vayalur Road is literally bursting at the seams. However, a PWD official says it is for the district administration and Tiruchi Corporation to take a call on the demand. The Uyyakondan canal bank can become an alternative road link between Puthur High Road near Cantonment and Somarasampettai, residents say. “Already, a large number of people have been using the route for their regular commute to avoid the heavy traffic on Vayalur Road. It is also a shorter route and we can reach the city from Somarasampettai in quick time,” points out Gerald, a regular commuter on the route. The bunds of Kudamuritti canal branching off from Puthur Weir can also be used by residents of Srinivasa Nagar and scores of residential colonies on either side of the water body. Although a blacktopped road was laid over the right bank some years ago, it has taken a severe beating and is full of potholes now. “The badly damaged road has to be repaired and linked with Vayalur Road towards the end. If properly developed, the two roads can become good alternative routes and benefit hundreds of thousands of residents off Vayalur Road,” says V. Sundararaju, a retired District Forest Officer and resident of Srinivasa Nagar South. The road over the right bank of Koraiyar, which connects Puthur High Road and Dindigul Highway near Dheeran Nagar, is also in bad shape after being strengthened some years ago as part of a flood prevention project. If the road is re-laid, residents will get a direct and short access route from the Koraiyar river bridge on Dindigul Highway to Puthur High Road. This will mean saving four to five km of travel to the city from Pirattiyur and Dheeran Nagar, the residents add. “The poor condition of the roads has left them largely underutilised. Though the roads laid over the bunds are essentially meant for PWD inspection vehicles, they can be strengthened and turned into alternative roads for light vehicles and two-wheelers to benefit a sizeable segment of the city populace,” observes R. Gopalakrishnan, another commuter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-pitch-for-canal-banks-as-alternative-road-links/article32737374.ece
01 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Uncertainty over resumption of classes||The apparent flip-flop by the Education Department in arriving at a decision on reopening schools has caused disquiet among teachers. Earlier this week, the State government came out with standard operating procedures to be adopted after permitting students studying in classes X to XII to come to schools from October 1 on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from teachers. A recent statement by School Education Minister T.A. Sengottaiyan that announcement on regular functioning of schools will be made by the Chief Minister at the start of October has caused confusion among school heads. “There is no clarity if the Minister referred to the opening of schools for classes I to IX. In any case, there are indications that parents are reluctant to send their wards to the schools,” a school head said. As per the schedule, admissions will get to a close at the end of this month. But teachers still have no information on the portions that will be reduced from the syllabi this year due to loss in the number of working days. “All we know as of now is that 40% of the portions will be reduced. But there is no information on the chapters identified for deletion this year. In case the chapters that have already been handled are taken off, the very purpose of the exercise of content reduction will be defied,” a senior teacher in a city school said. The portions being voluminous, for the core subjects in particular, teachers have no clue on how to do justice to the teaching-learning process. As such, the department has reportedly hinted that the quarterly and half-yearly exams will be replaced by a series of revision tests later in this academic year. “We have lost much time. There is no certainty about factors turning out to be conducive any time soon,” another teacher in Manaparai block said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uncertainty-over-resumption-of-classes/article32737354.ece

01 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||SETC operating only 50% of its fleet||Three weeks after resumption of inter-district bus services, State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) continues to operate only about 50% of its fleet of 100 buses from its Tiruchi depot. Most of the buses are operated from Tiruchi to Chennai, Hosur and southern districts. On an average, online bookings has not exceeded 50% so far. “Nevertheless, we are in a position to cover the costs,” a senior official said. Since operation of air-conditioned buses is not permitted yet, the returns are much lesser. “Passenger movement is slightly higher on Sundays. Additional buses are operated as and when required,” the official said. The SETC, it is learnt, is bracing for competition as omni bus operators are said to be contemplating to get back to business. For now, the private operators are on a ‘wait and watch’ mode, assessing the demand. Private bus operators, sources said, have been permitted to resume their business after clearing pending tax balances that had accrued during the lockdown period. However, the need to conform to physical distancing norm will imply that they cannot go beyond 50% occupancy even if there is demand. “Also operating non-A/C buses will further dent the viability factor,” Balu, proprietor of a private bus service, said. “Educational institutions have not been opened yet, and tourist destinations are still out of bounds for the people. Also, not many are inclined to conduct functions during the lockdown period. This being the case, we would rather wait for a week or more before taking a final call,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/setc-operating-only-50-of-its-fleet/article32737356.ece

01 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Bio-shield coming around garbage yard||The corporation’s garbage dump at Ramaiyanpatti on outskirts of the city is all set to have a dependable bio-shield in the near future to protect residents living in nearby areas from pollution caused by the waste being accumulated there for several years as saplings planted by the urban civic body in ‘Miyawaki method’ are growing healthily. The city that generates around 170 tonnes of waste including 102 tonnes of degradable waste and 68 tonnes of non-degradable waste everyday, converts 35 tonnes of recyclable waste into manure at its micro composting centres and 40 tonnes of waste at its Ramaiyanpatti garbage yard besides using another five tonnes at its bio-methanation plant, at Ramaiyanpatti. The remaining 22 tonnes, being generated by bulk waste generators, have been told to establish their own solid waste management system. The 68 tonnes of solid waste, mostly plastic waste, is being sent to recyclers and to a nearby cement factory where it is being used as supplementary fuel or fuel derived from refuse. Women self-help groups involved in shredding the plastic waste into granules give it at the rate of Rs. 30 per kg for laying roads. Since the Supreme Court, while directing the urban civic bodies to put in place credible solid and liquid waste management systems, has mandated growing bio-shield around garbage dump to minimize the pollution to the maximum possible extent. Consequently, the corporation has compacted the solid waste dumped on 180 acres on just 32.50 acres and closed it scientifically with HDPE sheets to cultivate grass on it to give ‘green mound’ look to the compacted garbage. After conversion of this stagnant non-degradable solid waste into green mound, degradable waste is being converted into manure which is being given to farmers at heavily discounted price. Even though a major chunk of waste being generated in the corporation area is converted into manure and for other purpose, ‘green shield’ is being provided besides ‘green mound’ to protect people from the remaining waste being dumped at Ramaiyanpatti. To add more green cover to this area, the corporation started planting a range of saplings near the garbage dump from June 27 onwards. “We, in association with Nellai Nature Club and ‘Ainthinai,’ planted over 6,000 saplings under ‘Miyawaki’ planting system to provide bio-shield to nearby residential areas. All these 3-month-old saplings have grown really well since we are watering them at regular intervals. Since we’ll get showers during the north-east monsoon within a fortnight, one can experience the impact of the bio-shield by January,” said G. Kannan, Commissioner of Tirunelveli Corporation. Mr. Kannan has designed a plan to plant more saplings before the onset of north-east monsoon. “Under the ‘Miyawaki’ system, we’ve taken up the work in a few spots and have planted 12,000 saplings. This number will go up in the days to come. Saplings have been planted on the land not suitable for cultivation so that it will increase the ‘green density’ within the corporation limits. Our aim is to create jungles in urban areas,” Mr. Kannan explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bio-shield-coming-around-garbage-yard/article32738209.ece
01 October 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Start excavation in entire Aditchanallur: MPs||Besides pressing the Union Government to allow excavation in 114 acres in the Aditchanallur archaeological site under its control, the Centre will be asked to establish a museum of international standard, as announced in the Union Budget, for displaying the artefacts recovered from the site, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has said. Visiting the Aditchanallur archaeological site along with Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi and Tiruchendur MLA Anita R. Radhakrishnan on Tuesday, he said the artefacts retrieved during the excavation, being carried out by the State government’s wing, showcased Tamil civilization and its ancientness. The excavation so far conducted in the peripheral areas had led to recovery of interesting artefacts. However, the Centre was not taking due steps to carry out excavation in the entire 114 acres of land acquired though it was under its control for the past several years. If this area, apparently the core area where the ancient Tamils lived, acquired for the purpose of excavation, was properly used, it would prove the ancient Tamils’ civilized life several thousands of years ago. “Above all, we will exert pressure on the Centre to release the report submitted to the Centre in 2004 on the archaeological activities so far carried out at Aditchanallur. If it is released, it will prove categorically that Tamil’ civilization is the most ancient one,” he said. When the State government’s Department of Archaeology started excavation in Aditchanallur and Sivakalai on May 25, it has recovered burial urns containing a range of products and paddy, terracotta hookah, bangles etc. As the excavation was extended to the areas closer to the hillock, experts found remnants of an ancient village close to the Tamirabharani watercourse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/start-excavation-in-entire-aditchanallur/article32738016.ece
01 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||SDPI stages protests in Tirunelveli||The verdict acquitting all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case including senior BJP leader L.K. Advani triggered instant protests in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts on Wednesday wherein they termed the verdict as “mockery of democracy and judiciary.” The Social Democratic Party of India staged a demonstration at Melapalayam. Addressing the protesters, the State president of Social Democratic Party of India Nellai Mubarak said the verdict given by the designated CBI court in the wake of political developments in the country (formation of BJP-led Government at the Centre) had shattered the trust people on judiciary, which termed the demolition as an act of anti-social elements and not a pre-planned act even after over 1.50 lakh people had gathered there with crowbar to raze down the place. Moreover, the finding of the court that the accused did not take part in the demolition directly was nothing but mockery of Indian judiciary and betrayal of the people who had pinned hope on the judiciary as the last resort of rendering justice to the aggrieved people. Terming the judgment as ‘gruesome murder of democracy,’ State general secretary of Tamil Nadu Thowheedh Jamaath E. Mohammed, in a statement, said the CBI court had exonerated the Babri Masjid demolition case accused from the serious charges of razing down the shrine after the Supreme Court gave permission for constructing Ram Temple on the disputed site in Ayodhya. Dindigul Members of the SDPI and the PFI staged a demonstration at Begampur on Wednesday condemning the verdict delivered on the Babri Masjid demolition case. They shouted slogans against the judgement and criticised the verdict. Minorities cannot pardon the demolition. Acquitting the accused in the case came as a big blow, said SDPI district president Syed Ibrahim. Other members including Abdul Latif, Abudahir and Irfan spoke. About 50 participated, the police said. Madurai Police picketing at important places in the city in view of the special court verdict on Babri Masjid demolition case on Wednesday continued in the city. Besides picketing at places of worships and offices belonging to the Hindu and Muslim outfits, the city police conducted intensified vehicle check all over the city. Houses of some of the functionaries from both sides were provided with security as a precaution. A senior police officer said that no untoward incident was reported in the city. The police had intensified the security since September 29 in view of Al-Umma member, Imam Ali, death anniversary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sdpi-stages-protests-in-tirunelveli/article32738200.ece

Business establishments that fail to regulate their customers also faced the music. When reports of people visiting shops without wearing face masks and violating social distancing norms were shared on social media and carried in newspapers, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish asked Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan to deploy special teams to check.  Corporation teams, led by the Assistant Commissioner, in each zone have started booking violators from Tuesday onwards. “If the violation continues, our team will seal erring business establishments and initiate legal action against the owner for facilitating the spread of the viral infection,” Mr. Kannan said. A team deployed in Palayamkottai Zone visited a few shops on Tuesday morning and a showroom dealing with mobile phone communication service was booked for entertaining customers inside the air-conditioned showroom. After slapping a fine of Rs. 500 for this violation, a few more nearby shops were checked and some of them were booked for serving customers who were not wearing masks. Those who were riding bikes without masks had to pay Rs. 200 as fine. The team also randomly boarded city buses to check if all passengers were wearing masks and the teams’ operation continued till dusk. “On the first day of the operation, more than 75 shops and as many individuals were fined for violations. This operation will continue until the infection dies down completely,” Mr. Kannan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-gets-tough-with-covid-19-protocol-violators/article32738202.ece

After Selvan, 30, of Chokkankudiyiruppu under Thattaarmadam police station limits was abducted and murdered by a gang on September 17, the police arrested Chinnadurai and Muthuramalingam of Arasur even as AIADMK functionary Thirumanavel of nearby Usaraththukudiyiruppu and his associate Muthukrishnan surrendered before a court at Saidapet in Chennai. As mother of deceased Elizabeth accused Thattaarmadam Police Inspector Harikrishnan of having played a crucial role in the abduction and murder of Selvam that was sequel to the land dispute between Selvan and Thirumanavel, the police officer was cited as accused in this case registered by Thisaiyanvilai police. However, he was not arrested even though he was placed under suspension. Since the case was transferred to the CB-CID, the investigating agency filed petition seeking custody of the four persons arrested in connection with this case.

01 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Arrest of trade union leaders condemned||Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation employees staged a demonstration at Palayamkottai on Tuesday condemning the arrest of trade union leaders in Uttar Pradesh even as they were protesting against privatisation of power distribution companies. They raised slogans against the “draconian act” unleashed by the Uttar Pradesh government to crush the agitation against privatisation of power distribution system and urged the rulers to release them unconditionally. Besides killing the power distribution system, the move would eventually lead to privatisation of Department of Electricity in the State. “Since privatisation of any system that is closely associated with day-to-day life of the public would make it unaffordable for the common man, the Uttar Pradesh Government should give up the attempt and release the protesters unconditionally,” said S. Natarajan of DMK-affiliated Thozilaalar Munnetra Sangam, who presided over the protest. The demonstration was organised by the Joint Action Committee of TANGEDCO trade unions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arrest-of-trade-union-leaders-condemned/article32738198.ece

01 October 2020||Tiruvannamalai,TAMIL NADU||Jawadhu Hills produce reach customers’ doorstep||One need not travel all the way to Jawadhu Hills to purchase pure wild honey or Samai (the little millet) and other produce from the tribal hamlets. People can order it from the comfort of their homes through e-commerce sites and it will be delivered at their doorstep under the brand name Jawathu Hills Divine Pure — thanks to the efforts of the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission (TNSRLM) in Tiruvannamalai district. A total of 12,795 families are involved in the production of little millet, honey, tamarind, gooseberry and other agricultural produce. “Annually, 12,400 tonnes of little millet, 22 tonnes of honey, 90 tonnes of tamarind, 20 tonnes of Kadukkai , 20 tonnes of jackfruit and 5 tonnes of gooseberry are produced. These items used to be purchased by middle men and the tribals got only a paltry sum. A few months ago, Tiruvannamalai Collector K.S. Kandasamy started the Jawadhu Hills Tribal Farmer Produce company and people started selling their produce through it,” said Y Johnson, assistant project officer, TNSRLM. Equipment was also purchased to process the produce and package them. “Earlier, they used to sell the goods in plastic packets. Now, we are using the latest packaging methods, including ziploc bags. It is similar to the ones displayed in major super markets and organic stores. We are also tying up with e-commerce sites to deliver these products, including jackfruit, to places like Chennai and Bengaluru,” said M. Kumaresan, block coordinator, TNSRLM. A website www.jawadhuhills.com has also been started and people can order the products by calling the numbers given on the website. “We have also appointed a marketing manager who will coordinate orders, ensuring that it is sent on time to the customer and get the payment for the same,” Mr. Kumaresan added. Marketing skills Usha Rani, one of the farmers involved in producing honey and little millet, said she used to earn around Rs. 5,000 per month earlier by selling honey to middlemen. “After I started selling it to the Jawadhu Hills Tribal Farmer Produce company, I am earning around Rs. 10,000 per month. Besides, we did not have the marketing or branding skills. Through the company, we have learnt it now,” she added. The Collector said that the main aim of the initiative was to market the produce better to give more profit to the producers. “The profit will stay in the company itself and can be used by the farmers during the off-season,” said Mr. Kandasamy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jawadhu-hills-produce-reach-customers-doorstep/article32738214.ece
01 October 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Rare butterfly documented in the Nilgiris after more than a century||A rare butterfly, which had not been spotted in the Nilgiris for over 130 years, was documented along the Kotagiri slopes recently. The Branded Royal ( Tajuria melastigma ), a species of lycaenid, was last recorded in the Nilgiris in 1888 by G.F. Hampson, and there is only one other record in Tamil Nadu, said Vinod Sriramulu, trustee of the Wynter-Blyth Association (WBA), which comprises enthusiasts and conservationists who have been working on documenting and protecting butterfly species in the region. “The Branded Royal is very rarely seen in India, with only four or five records in existence – in the Nilgiris, Dindigul and two in Kerala and Karnataka,” said Mr. Sriramulu. “This is an extremely significant record, as there are very few recorded sightings in the public domain,” he added. The reasons for its rarity could be many. Host plant “Each butterfly has a host plant, so one of the reasons that it’s not spotted often could be that the host plant it relies on could be rare,” said Mr. Sriramulu, who was quick to point out that the butterfly was also particularly hard to identify. “The Branded Royal is also hard to identify as it could be mistaken to be a different species, as many Royals look strikingly similar,” he said. The record of the butterfly along the Kotagiri slopes will help conservationists better understand this species, said Manoj Sethumadhavan, another trustee of the WBA. “Finding this butterfly, in a relatively pristine ecosystem with very few threats, could help us study this species in the future,” said Mr. Sethumadhavan. Threat One potential threat that was noticed by the WBA members who photographed the Branded Royal was the prevalence of invasive plants such as Lantana camara near where the butterfly was spotted. “We will have to keep an eye on this threat, but are hopeful as we don’t foresee a huge anthropogenic pressure in the region,” said Mr. Sriramulu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rare-butterfly-documented-in-the-nilgiris-after-more-than-a-century/article32737429.ece

In Thanjavur district, a shift in the condition of patients testing positive is noticeable, said a senior health official. While in other districts, and even in Thanjavur, a large number of persons testing positive have been asymptomatic, over the last few weeks, however, the number of symptomatic patients has increased up to 70%. Most patients have a history of respiratory illnesses including influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (SARI). The health official attributes the sharp increase in cases to increase in testing capability and focussed testing in the district. “We do not want to test random samples. We are tracing patterns and focusing on specific groups,” he said. The virology laboratory at Thanjavur Medical College Hospital has been processing an average of 2,000 samples per day, but by the end of this week, 2,500 samples can be processed, I. Raveendran, Deputy Director of Health Services, Thanjavur said. “We want to ensure that the test results are given within 48 hours. This will help in containment and prevention of the infection.” A total of 4,253 beds have been prepared at Pattukottai, Vallam, Kumbakonam to treat patients, while 31 ICU beds and 108 oxygen supply-attached beds are on standby. In Pudukottai, where an average of 90 fresh cases are being reported on a daily basis, most cases are patients with Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI) and their immediate contacts, say officials of the health department. Other reported cases include travellers, primary contacts of ILI patients and patients who tested positive for the viral infection earlier. Among the daily reported cases, 60% are asymptomatic, said B. Kalaivani, Deputy Director of Health Services, Pudukottai. “A majority of them are being detected through fever camps conducted across the district. With an average of 2,000 samples processed per day, the number of cases reported is also high,” she pointed out. The district continues to treat COVID-19 patients only in government facilities and the bed capacity available is being scaled up. Ranee's Government Hospital and Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital are the only hospitals treating COVID 19 patients in the district. Ranee's hospital and GMCH have wards for asymptomatic patients, while the Renal Block at GMCH with 350-bed capacity is a dedicated symptomatic patients' treatment facility, Dr. Kalaivani added. Meanwhile, a private laboratory in the district has acquired approval from Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, for testing for COVID-19.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||At Tiruchi Aavin, flow of milk continues unabated||The Tiruchi District Cooperative Milk Producers Union — popularly known as Tiruchi Aavin — has crossed five lakh litres of milk procurement a day yet again this month. While the union achieved the milestone in 2019, it is considered significant this year as a new union headquartered at Karur has been created recently by bifurcating the Tiruchi union. Procurement during the southwest monsoon from June to September largely depends upon rainfall. The season has turned out to be good for farmers as most parts of Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur, where the union procures milk from member societies, received good rain. It has made the climate perfect for milch animal rearers. There has been no report of shortage of fodder in any area under the jurisdiction of the union due to extensive green pastures. The average procurement of the season from Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur hovers between 3.15 lakh and 3.40 lakh litres. It is over five lakh litres a day now. On Wednesday, the union procured 5.30 lakh litres. Of this, 1.65 lakh litres was procured and processed through 42 Bulk Milk Coolers at various places. The remaining 3.65 lakh litres was transported to the chilling plant in Tiruchi. “Milk yield has gone up by 15% to 20% due to availability of green and dry fodder. The green pasture facilitates farmers to feed green fodder to cattle. Availability of water for drinking is also vital for milch animals,” said M. Vadivel Prabu, General Manager, Aavin, Tiruchi. Though purchase has exceeded demand, increase in milk procurement price a few months ago has motivated more farmers to supply milk to Aavin. Out of 5.20 lakh litres of procured milk, about 1.20 lakh litres is sold to customers in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur through 510 agents, three parlours and three high-tech parlours. About 1.65 lakh litres of milk was sent to Chennai daily. Surplus milk is sent to Aavin’s powder-making units, he said. Mr. Prabu adds that Tiruchi Aavin has been spending Rs. 60 lakh a month on account of subsidy to farmers attached to its member societies to buy fodder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/at-tiruchi-aavin-flow-of-milk-continues-unabated/article32737369.ece

A perusal of the Tamil text of the 12th resolution, which was moved by Radhapuram legislator I.S. Inbadurai and adopted by the AIADMK general council in September 2017, reveals no reference to the steering committee. The motion only defines the role and functions of various office-bearers, committees and wings of the party. But the term ‘steering committee’ figures at the end of the 10th resolution, allowing the creation of the posts of coordinator, co-coordinator and deputy coordinators. Meanwhile, Mr. Panneerselvam on Wednesday continued to hold consultations with his supporters at his residence on Greenways Road in Chennai. Among those who met him during the day were deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy, former Electricity Minister Natham R. Viswanathan and former MP P.H. Manoj Pandian. In the morning, the Deputy Chief Minister, also the Minister for Housing and Urban Development and ex-officio chairperson of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, presided over the 265th meeting of the Authority, which lasted nearly 45 minutes.

Anbalagan. During the Anglo-Mysore war between the British forces and Tippu Sultan in 1783, the Karur Fort was destroyed, and the British forces brought Karur under its rule. Thereafter, Karur became part of British India. It was said that the British forces lost 19 personnel and an office in the fight at Rayanur. A memorial was built for the warriors, who lost lives, and it is under the maintenance of the Karur municipality. Mr. Anbalagan said that the rehabilitation work had begun. It had been decided to establish a stone inscription with details of the war. It would enable people to know the history of Karur. The Collector, earlier, inspected the war memorial along with R. Sabarish, president of Rotaract Club, and its members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/war-memorial-at-rayanur-to-be-renovated/article32737357.ece

01 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Plan to form residential layouts in villages around Belagavi opposed||Residents of some villages have taken objection to the State government’s plans to form residential layouts in villages surrounding Belagavi city, saying that they would lose their fertile land. They said that the Belagavi Urban Development Authority was making efforts to acquire land in 28 villages for creating layouts. This issue was raised in the taluk panchayat meeting here on Tuesday. Some members said that gram panchayats in all the 28 villages had received notice about land acquisition for construction of residential layouts for urban residents. Taluk panchayat president Shankargouda Patil said that a resolution would be passed against this and sent to the State government. However, BUDA officials refuted this. “No notice has been sent for formation of layouts. There is a proposal before the State government to expand the jurisdiction of BUDA. That is yet to be approved,” a senior BUDA officer said. “There is no plan or proposal for acquiring land for residential layouts in any of the new areas, as of now,” BUDA Commissioner Preetam Naslapure said. BUDA, one of the biggest city development authorities in the State, has a spread of over 192 square kilometres. It stretches from villages such as Kakati and Kangrali on one side and Savgaon, Mandolli and Peeranwadi on the other. When expanded, it will encompass the Belagavi airport in Sambra, Yallur, Navage and Kadoli on the four sides. The proposal has been forwarded by the district administration to the State government. Once the new areas are included, then the rules set by BUDA on land use and house construction will have to be followed. Regulations on creating new layouts and residential and commercial complexes will also have to be adhered to. A vision document is being prepared, along with a comprehensive development plan. A detailed plan of the city will be prepared using Geographical Information Systems, under the Centrally aided AMRUT Scheme. BUDA’s plans for layout development under the farmers partnership scheme is also being opposed. The urban body plans to take over farm land from those willing to sell, develop it into layouts and offer half of the number of sites developed to farmers so that they can sell them to whoever they want. BUDA will, however, allocate its sites to those who apply for them, under government rates. It has an on-going project on Kanabaragi Road that was challenged in court earlier. It has been cleared now and BUDA will develop the layout in 140 acres, excluding the 160 acres that is under dispute. Similar plans are afoot in Jhadshahapur, Hindalga and Anagol villages. A few days ago, residents of Anagol and Halaga villages submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner’s office urging the government to drop the idea of creating residential layouts in these villages under farmers partnership scheme. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has assured them of looking into their concerns.  There is no plan for acquiring land in the new areas, says BUDA Commissioner||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-to-form-residential-layouts-in-villages-around-belagavi-opposed/article32737465.ece
01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka registers highest number of sedition cases in the country||Karnataka has recorded the highest number of sedition cases and cases related to crimes against the State in the country in 2019, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, which was released on Wednesday. During this period, Karnataka registered 22 sedition cases against 23 persons, while insurgency-prone States like Jammu and Kashmir and many in the North East reported far fewer. It also registered 14 cases in sections related to other crimes against the State, taking the total number of cases booked for crimes against the State to 36. This is the highest for any State in the country for 2019. Lack of discretion Senior advocate S. Balan, who has worked as a defence advocate in several sedition cases, said the State police has lost a sense of discretion when it comes to filing sedition cases. “They are being filed at the drop of a hat. During the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests, sedition cases were booked against a person for holding a placard saying ‘Free Kashmir’. Another case was booked against an individual who said ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. The lower judiciary is also not using its discretion,” he said. Mr. Balan also argued that sedition cases were being misused to target critics of the incumbent regime at the Centre. “People from minority communities were mostly the targets,” he added. Cases under UAPA However, NCRB data also points to another trend. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, seems to be the preferred law to tackle such crimes in other parts of the country, but not in Karnataka. While even Tamil Nadu registered 270 UAPA cases, Manipur, 306, and Jammu and Kashmir 255 cases, Karnataka registered only seven cases under UAPA. “However, Karnataka police are also fast catching up to this trend. How is it that the rioters at D.J. Halli were booked under UAPA? They do not belong to any proscribed organisation. It is an uneven legal response to the crime committed,” he said. The crime rate in Karnataka for 2019 has only marginally increased compared to the previous year. As per the data, the State recorded a crime rate of 248.1 per lakh of population last year - a middling crime rate when compared to larger States in the country. It recorded one of the lowest crime rates in rape at 1.6 per lakh of population. Only Bihar and Tamil Nadu have a lower rate. Karnataka has remained one of the States that continues to report one of the highest cases registered under SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-registers-highest-number-of-sedition-cases-in-the-country/article32737483.ece
01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Many parents now looking to enrol children in govt. schools||Many parents, especially those who had enrolled their children under the RTE quota in private schools, are turning to government schools for admissions. The reasons for this range from difficulty in accessing online classes, the lack of infrastructure, such as smartphones or laptops, and their inability to pay private school fees. Others claim that officials from the Department of Public Instruction are reaching out to persuade them to pull their children out of the RTE reservation quota by reportedly telling them that their children will benefit from the Vidyagama programme, where government teachers will come to their neighbourhoods to teach students. . Parameshwarappa, a farmer in Yadgir district, said that he pulled out his son who was studying in class 3 under the RTE quota in a private school and admitted him in a government school last week. “The private school was conducting online classes but my son was unable to attend them as I do not have a spare phone to give him. So I decided to admit him in a government school as I did not want him to loiter and waste one full year. After we submitted the transfer certificate of a private school, the teachers are now teaching him under the Vidyagama programme,” he said. The shift for many students may be abrupt as they will be moving from English-medium private schools to government schools where Kannada is the medium of instruction. Education experts and RTE activists are worried about the consequences of this and the impact on the child’s education. “Many parents are listening to officials and removing them from private schools. But once they pull out their children who are admitted under the RTE quota out of private schools, they will be unable to go back to the private school in the coming academic year,” said RTE Students and Parents’ Association chief secretary B.N. Yogananda. According to him, families are only thinking of this academic year as they are facing financial hardship. Although the State government reimburses the school managements for tuition fees, parents each year are forced to bear overhead costs of extra-curricular activities, smart classes, and uniforms, among others. Currently, there are around 5.37 lakh students studying under the RTE quota from LKG to class 8. Another cause for concern is the fate of those students who were admitted under the RTE quota to private schools and have completed class 8 this year. They are left in the lurch as the reservation quota has not been extended for class 9. An autorickshaw driver from Bengaluru whose daughter is in such a situation said that he has no choice but to consider a government school. “I will not be able to pay fees in the same private school,” he added. A senior official of the department said that parents should not withdraw admission from the RTE quota. "Once they withdraw admissions from the RTE quota, they cannot continue to avail the reservation benefits," he said.  But once they pull out their children who are admitted under the RTE quota out of private schools, they will be unable to go back to the private school in the coming academic year. B.N.

01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||City once again tops the country in cyber crime||Cyber crime remains a problem for citizens and the police. In keeping with a nearly decade-long trend, Bengaluru once again recorded the maximum number of cyber crime cases – 10,668 in 2019 – among all the metros in India. Crimes in Bengaluru seem to have followed trends observed in previous years, with the city recording the third highest number of crimes in most categories after Delhi and Mumbai. The crime rate in Bengaluru for the year 2019 saw a marginal increase when compared to 2018, as per data released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). While the crime rate was 470.4 per lakh of population in 2018, it went up to 492.5 for 2019. The number of cases registered has also seen a slight increase. Second highest number of murders The city recorded the second-highest number of murders (210), behind Delhi. The country’s capital recorded 505 murders last year. A senior police official said that of the 210 murder victims in Bengaluru, 106 were killed because of personal enmity, six were for gain and one was related to gang wars. Kidnapping for ransom Bengaluru tops the nation in attempt to murder and kidnap cases. Among 1,073 kidnap cases, most were related to minors’ elopement, police said. The city reported 35 kidnappings for ransom, highest for any metro city in the country. The city has the third-highest robbery cases. There was a slight increase in crimes against women from 84.4 per lakh population in 2018 to 85.9 in 2019. There were143 rape cases and 40 dowry deaths in Bengaluru in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-once-again-tops-the-country-in-cyber-crime/article32737860.ece
01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Will you still visit a temple knowing it is built illegally?’||Will you still want to visit a temple after realising it was built illegally on government land? A. Velumurugan, 47, who filed a PIL petition against the illegal construction of Sri Shiva Subramanya temple at Bhadragiri in Tarikere of Chikkamagaluru district, will have to file an affidavit answering this question posed to him by the Karnataka High Court on Wednesday. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi posed the question as the petitioner claimed that he was a devotee of the temple, while complaining about its illegal construction. Observing orally that “no God would say that he should be worshipped in an illegally built temple”, the Bench asked the petitioner why he was not making a plea for demolition of the temple and merely asking that it be taken over by the government. As the petitioner claimed that around Rs. 65 lakh income generated by the temple annually was being allegedly misappropriated by one Chandra G. and his son Karthik after the death of the main priest, the Bench asked whether the petitioner wanted to grind axe against them or was he interested in protecting public interest. As the tahsildar, in his report to the Assistant Commissioner of Tarikere, stated that the temple was built on government and forest land, the Bench directed the government to initiate action, including demolition of illegal constructions, after examining the matter based on the apex court’s directions on illegal religious structures on public lands/places. The Bench also asked the government whether the temple was covered under the apex court’s order of 2009, which gave an option to the government to regularise/remove/relocate illegal religious structures built on public properties prior to September 29, 2009, and to not allow any such structure built illegally on public properties after that date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-you-still-visit-a-temple-knowing-it-is-built-illegally/article32737616.ece
01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Sira bypoll litmus test for JD(S): HDK||Terming the byelections to Sira Assembly constituency on November 3 as “litmus test” for Janata Dal (Secular), former Chief Minister H.D Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said the party will announce the candidates for Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar in the next two days. While JD(S) insiders said the party’s first preference for candidate for Sira was the family of the deceased legislator B. Satyanarayana, there were at least three more strong contenders from the grassroots. On Wednesday, as Mr. Kumaraswamy kickstarted the campaign in Sira, a day after the Election Commission announced schedule for the byelections, the public rally saw at least three local leaders throw their hats in the ring. “We will announce the candidate in the next two days after consulting with the hobli-level leaders. We will not push the candidature unilaterally and the party will take everyone into confidence. It’s important that the party wins in Sira,” he said. Preparations The Congress had announced the candidature of former Law Minister T.B. Jayachandra as its candidate in Sira and the BJP has had several rounds of meetings on this. Mr. Kumaraswamy said JD(S) was not slow in preparation compared to national parties. “We had a meeting at the party’s office in Bengaluru, and we had planned meetings after the Assembly session.” Mr. Kumaraswamy also held meetings with party leaders from R.R. Nagar constituency, which has a sizeable number of Vokkaliga votes. “Traditionally, the party has been polling around 50,000 votes and internally, several people in the BJP are not happy with Muniratna, who left the Congress to join the BJP. The JD(S) wants to put up a good fight,” party sources said.    We will not push the candidature unilaterally and the party will take everyone into confidence.

01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Minto hospital to resume elective surgeries from Oct. 5||The State-run Minto Ophthalmic Hospital is all set to resume elective surgeries from October 5. The hospital was only conducting emergency surgeries so far. It began out-patient services on June 24. Hospital director B.L. Sujatha Rathod told The Hindu that the plan was to start off with 15-20 surgeries per day. “Usually during the pre-COVID-19 days, we were conducting over 100 surgeries. Now, we will limit the daily number of surgeries till our staff get adjusted to operating with PPEs. Also, our staff are being trained on the additional precautions that they need to take now,” she said. The hospital had stopped its regular functioning when Victoria Hospital was converted into a COVID-19 facility during the early days of the pandemic. Nearly 100 beds in Minto were also set aside for COVID-19 patients. ‘Patient flow is minimal’ “Although we have resumed our OPD services, the patient flow is minimal as people are generally scared to visit hospitals. Our daily patient flow of over 600 during pre-COVID-19 days has reduced to less than 100 now. Although we were open for emergency surgeries, we have not done more than six surgeries in the last month,” the director said. Precautionary measures Ms. Rathod said all the operation theatres in the hospital had been fumigated and tests for culture growth had been done. “Some reports have come and they are negative. A few more are expected in a day or two. We want to ensure patients do not catch any infection within the hospital. As it is not uncommon for fungal growth to happen in any centralised air-conditioned building that has remained closed for months, we want to be doubly ensure that the operation theatres are fit for use again,” the doctor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minto-hospital-to-resume-elective-surgeries-from-oct-5/article32737474.ece
01 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two-month-old undergoes complex heart surgery||A two-month-old baby diagnosed with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis (SVPS), a rare type of obstruction in blood flow to both large arteries of the heart, recently underwent a complex heart surgery at a private hospital in the city. SVAS is the narrowing, or stenosis, of large blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the body. It is a rare birth defect that occurs in one in 20,000 newborns. “The two major arteries leaving the heart (one taking blood to the body and other to the lungs) in the baby had severe stenosis, resulting in significant obstruction of blood flow. This is an extremely rare condition, especially having significant obstruction in both the great arteries to the extent that it reduced the function of the heart,” said Devananda N.S., consultant, Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery, Heart and Lung Transplant Surgery, Manipal Hospitals, where the baby was treated. Two weeks The baby, who remained stable after the procedure, was discharged after two weeks of near-normal heart function. The baby had developed breathing difficulties, excessive sweating, and feeding issues after 5-6 weeks after birth. When taken for a routine check-up, the paediatrician noticed a heart murmur and referred him for further investigation. On evaluation, an echocardiogram showed the baby had a rare congenital defect. During the five-hour surgery, both the arteries had to be cut open at the place of obstruction and widened by grafting a piece of the pericardium (outer covering of the heart) to allow optimal blood flow through them, the doctor said.  Repeat echocardiogram After the surgery, a repeat echocardiogram was done to make sure the obstruction had been released completely without causing damage to the heart valve. “We were finally able to get rid of all the medications and discharged the child after two weeks. The right ventricle, which was quite dysfunctional, also recovered by 60% to 70% and is expected to recover completely in another month or two,” the doctor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-month-old-undergoes-complex-heart-surgery/article32737478.ece

A Division Bench passed the order on the petition filed by Giridhar Kulkarni, an environment enthusiast from Bengaluru. The petitioner has contended that the process of setting up of IROs is being projected as a mere administrative and staff reorganisation, when in reality the proposed merger directly defeats the object and scheme of establishment of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the Forest Survey of India, and the Central Zoo Authority. “The object of setting up these organisations is to fulfill the statutory purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife whereas contrary to this legislative object, the object of the merger is to ensure ease of doing business, defeating the very purpose of not just these statutory bodies but the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 itself.” it was claimed in the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-to-centre-on-move-to-reorganise-branches-of-environment-ministry/article32737485.ece

A convention would be held to stress the need for implementing the commission’s recommendations in the interest of weaker sections, which had not got the benefits of the reservation, they said. K.T. Shivaprasad, artist and leader of DSS (Amebdkarvada), said several Scheduled Castes had not got any benefits under the reservation. Only a few castes had been getting the benefits. “The politicians, who came to power promising them internal reservation, had forgotten the issue. There was a need to remind them their promises,” he said. T. Vijay Kumar, convener of Madiga Dandora Horata Samiti, said somecommunities had been enjoying more benefits than the others among the Scheduled Castes. The injustice should end, he said. DSS leaders Narayana Das and H.K. Sandesh participated in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/quota-issue-dalit-groups-plan-meet-in-hassan/article32737606.ece

Eshwarappa has said it would be an inspiration to take up struggles concerning other places of faith such as Mathura. Speaking to presspersons at his residence in Shivamogga, the Minister said the court had acquitted all 32 people, including L.K. Advani in the case. “This is a happy day for all nationalists of the country, who wanted a Ram temple at Ayodhya. This is an inspiration to all fighting in the interest of our places of faith”, he said.  Asked if there will be kar seva at Mathura, the Minister said, “I wish Krishna temple is built at Mathura without a kar seva. However, if it did not happen, a situation would arise where a kar seva would be inevitable.” Senior BJP leader and former chairman of Legislative Council D.H. Shankaramurthy also expressed happiness over the judgement. “This was expected. None of the accused had provoked the kar sevakas to demolish the structure. I too had participated and I had seen the senior leaders appealing the people not to go close to the structure”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/judgment-an-inspiration-eshwarappa/article32737612.ece
01 October 2020||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||Several organisations seek justice for UP rape victim||Condemning the rape and murder of a 19-year-old young woman in Uttar Pradesh and seeking justice for her, members of the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist), the All India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane (AIMSS), the All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) and the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) staged a demonstration in Dharwad on Wednesday. Staging the demonstration in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner, the protestors sought justice for the victim by bringing all the perpetrators of the heinous crime to book. Holding placards, they also raised slogans against the Uttar Pradesh Police for failing to respond to the victim’s plea. Addressing the protestors, district committee member of SUCI-C Gangadhar Badiger strongly condemned the apathetic attitude of the administration and the police. He said that it was shocking that even after committing the crime, the four youths who belong to the upper caste were roaming around freely. “It was only after five days of the crime that the accused were arrested. The fact that the young woman struggled between life and death for 15 days and then passed away clearly shows the negligent attitude of the Uttar Pradesh government towards women and also the failure of the administration. At least, now, the government should get the case heard in a fast track court and ensure that all those involved in the crime are punished,” he said. AIMSS district secretary Vijayalakshmi Devatkal said that because of the anti-women and anti-social attitude of those in power in Uttar Pradesh, crimes against women and children were increasing day by day. “Rape of women and children, mass rape and murders are increasing in Uttar Pradesh with least regard for law and order. While the administration has failed to act, the police too had behaved inhumanly by delaying action against those involved,” she said. District president of AIDYO Bhavanishankar said that along with taking action against the guilty, all governments should also act against pornography websites, films, literature and videos that promoted sex and violence and also impose Prohibition. Other office-bearers of the four organisations were present. Condemned Meanwhile, in a statement, district secretary of AIDYO Hanumesh Huded has condemned the police action against members of AIDSO, AIDYO and AIMSS who were silently protesting against the incident in Uttar Pradesh. The police action seemed to be aimed at threatening those who raised questions against the erring administration, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/several-organisations-seek-justice-for-up-rape-victim/article32737473.ece

01 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Demonstrations in several places in Kalyana Karnataka||Apart from participating in an online campaign with the hashtag #justiceformanisha to condemn the brutal gang-rape of a woman from Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, hundreds of youths in Kalaburagi, Ballari and other cities in Kalyana Karnataka region staged demonstrations on Wednesday. The victim later died in a Delhi hospital. Holding placards and raising slogans against the successive governments for their failures to curb violence against women and children, they demanded exemplary punishment to the culprits of the Hathras rape case. In Kalaburagi, activists associated with the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) staged a demonstration outside the district administrative complex and submitted a memorandum to the office of the Deputy Commissioner. “The Hathras gang rape shows the pathetic condition of women in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. The BJP claims to have high regard for women often equating them to Goddesses. In practice, it, however, not just fails to protect women from atrocities but often stands with the culprits of violence against women. The promotion of nudity, obscenity, drugs and liquor by the successive governments, including the BJP, is among the several causes of violence against women and children,” Sneha Kattimani, a student leader, said, during the agitation. In Ballari, activists associated with the All India Mahila Samskrutik Sanghatane (AIMSS), the All India Democratic Students Organisation and the All India Democratic Youths Organisation staged protests against the crime. “The brutality on the woman in Hathras is simply inexplicable. The victim struggled for more than a fortnight to survive and finally died at a hospital in Delhi. I strongly condemn the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for its inaction in the issue. I demand exemplary punishment to the culprits,” A. Shantha, district president of AIMSS, said, at the agitation site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demonstrations-in-several-places-in-kalyana-karnataka/article32737468.ece

Addressing media representatives here last week, he said that the ICMR recommendation was ideal for industry and trade units, educational institutions and other organisations where large number of people work together. “IgG antibodies are naturally produced antibodies in the human immune system when the body is exposed to COVID-19 and are capable of destroying the novel coronavirus. The presence of good levels of IgG antibodies simply signifies immunity against COVID-19. IgG Sero Titre Test now means COVID-19 Immunity Passport to travel across the globe. “The ICMR has already recommended this type of IgG Sero Surveillance for large clusters such as industrial and trade units, educational institutions, banks and other organisations. With this test, any organisation will be able to identify its members who have developed complete immunity against COVID-19 so that it can reorganise its operations and move towards effectively unlocking the organisation and bringing it to normality,” he said. Dr. Siddareddy added that United Hospital has launched a My Immunity Test (MIT) against COVID-19 campaign to inculcate awareness among people about the importance of IgG Sero Titre Test to create a safer environment and workplace.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/igg-sero-surveillance-better-to-create-safer-workplaces/article32737466.ece

The mela could not perform its rainy season’s shows, started in 2017 to reduce the number of bookings for the “harake aata”, in the Sri Durgaparameshwari temple hall at Mandarthi this year from June due to COVID-19 restrictions. The temple broke the tradition of not performing in the monsoon in 2017 due to pressure from devotees who felt that they had to wait for years for the shows. Temple managing committee president H. Dhananjaya Shetty told The Hindu that the mela, which has five troupes now, resumed the rainy season’s shows on September 25. About 30 artistes drawn from its two troupes now perform two shows daily from 7 p.m. to midnight. They are assisted by about 10 persons. The temple is ensuring that not more than 25 persons from each host’s side turned up for the shows. As two different parties hosted two different shows daily, the audience will not exceed 50 persons. Thus, not more than 100 persons, including the artistes, gathered for the shows daily, he said and added that the shows are being staged as per COVID-19 guidelines with the permission of the district administration. Mr. Shetty said that the rainy season’s shows will go on till the government gives permission to commence its annual “tirugata” (tour) from November to May. In the rainy season, each one of the two troupes performed about 150 shows thus fulfilling the demand of about 300 devotees. It was wounding up its rainy season’s shows usually on November 1 or November 2. After some days of rest, all the five troupes were preparing for the annual tour usually from November 17 or November 18. The five troupes with about 250 artistes staged 940 shows during their annual “tirugata”. There is no clarity whether the government will permit the annual seasonal tours of different Yakshagana melas from this November due to COVID-19, as they attracted huge crowd. Mr. Shetty said that the “harake aatas” have been booked till 2042-43. The mela’s second troupe was formed in 1992 and the fifth troupe came into being in 2004. The troupes were increased to reduce the increasing number of bookings and thus, give a chance to the parties to host their shows as early as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yakshagana-mela-resumes-its-rainy-seasons-shows/article32738046.ece

01 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Banks’ offset clause adding to financial distress of farmers during pandemic||On the day he was treated for a medical procedure in a private hospital last week, Vivek Cariappa, an organic farmer from Sargur near H.D. Kote, discovered that his savings bank account displayed zero balance. This, despite the fact that he had replenished his account with adequate cash to meet the hospital expenses. Puzzled, he made alternative arrangements to pay the hospital and visited his bank fearing that his account had been hacked. To his shock, he learnt from the branch manager that the bank had dipped into his savings bank account to offset an outstanding due for a loan Mr. Cariappa had taken from the bank. This is not a one-off case and many farmers have discovered that when they default on repayment of a loan due to various circumstances, the banks tend to dip into their savings bank account and quietly recover the outstanding due for the month without their permission. This is a particular blow amidst the pandemic and the financial distress it has ushered in. What has come as a bolt from the blue for many farmers is that this is legal and permissible under the existing laws. Hence, they cannot take recourse to legal procedure to prevent banks from tapping their savings bank account. There have been as many as five such cases in the Sargur branch of a nationalised bank in the last 15 days, and farmers are only now realising that they are signatories to the clause which authorises banks to offset the dues from their savings bank accounts or other deposit accounts, in case of a default. Atahalli Devaraj, general secretary, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association, said complaints against loan offset are most common in their meetings with farmers across the State. “Not only personal savings meant for children’s education or medical emergency and parked in the savings bank account are blocked by the bank, even the union government’s income support scheme of Rs. 6,000 under PM Kisan Yojana credited to farmers’ account is drawn and adjusted against the outstanding loan account,” said Mr. Devaraj. The association has received innumerable complaints in T. Narsipur, H.D. Kote, Bannur, and other places and the farmers have taken up the issue with the bank, he added. “The terms and conditions are couched in legal language, which is comprehensible only to a lawyer and as a bank officer even I did not know these legalese for years. Hence, the farmers or other bank customers availing loans cannot be expected to be aware of this clause to which they blindly agree and affix their signature,” said K.N. Shivalingaiah, retired Lead Bank Manager, State Bank of India. He said there was “Right of Set-off” under the Negotiable Instruments Act, which allowed banks to adjust the outstanding due from other accounts of the loanee. Invoking this, the banks tend to recover the amount without the account holder’s permission, said Mr. Shivalingaiah. But Mr. Cariappa said invoking the provision during the pandemic was questionable as farmers are reeling under financial penury. “Industrialists get loans readjusted and EMIs staggered but farmers are being treated shabbily,” he added. A senior official of a leading public sector bank said though small-scale vendors, traders, farmers etc. are in distress due to the prevailing situation arising out of the pandemic, the loan recovery process continues in the absence of clear instructions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banks-offset-clause-adding-to-financial-distress-of-farmers-during-pandemic/article32737615.ece
01 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Phase 3 trials begin for Covishield vaccine at JSSAHER in Mysuru||The crucial phase 3 trials for Covishield vaccine, which is expected to test the immunogenicity of the vaccine, has begun at JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research (JSSAHER) in Mysuru. After the conclusion of the phase 2 trials during which no adverse effects were shown by any of the 25 healthy volunteers, the phase 3 trials envisaging inoculation of a total of 120 volunteers had begun. Covishield is a vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. JSSAHER is one of the 18 centres carrying out the clinical trials on humans for the vaccine candidate produced by Serum Institute of India (SII). Out of the estimated 1,400 volunteers from across the 18 centres participating in the clinical trials, 120 will be from JSSAHER. “About 80 out of the total 120 volunteers have been inoculated. The remaining 40 will be covered by the end of this week”, JSSAHER’s Pro Chancellor B. Suresh told The Hindu . The phase 2 trials in Mysuru began around August 29 and none of the 25 volunteers showed any adverse effect during the 28-day trial period. While the phase 2 trials were aimed at checking the safety of the vaccine, the phase 3 trials will assess its immunogenicity. “We were not authorised to check if the volunteers had developed antibodies during the phase 2 trials”, Dr. Suresh said adding that the volunteers will be monitored during the 28-day-long phase 3 trials by the end of which they will be tested for presence or absence or antibodies against COVID-19. By November-end or early December, the data from all the 18 centres including JSSAHER will be sent to SII, which in turn will forward the same to Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), Dr. Suresh said and referred to the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement that the first vaccine is likely to be available by early 2021 in the country. Further studies However, even if there are positive indications about the presence of antibodies among the volunteers, Dr. Suresh said studies will have to be carried out further to check how long the anti-bodies last in the human bodies. “We will have to see if they (antibodies) will be sustained for a year or for a life-time or for four to five years. This will determine whether we need to keep giving repeated shots of the vaccine or whether it will be one-time vaccine”, he said. The clinical trials were open to the public to participate and the healthy volunteers, who had come forward and registered themselves, were first subjected to exclusion criteria based on morbidities including diabetes and blood pressure, besides not having been exposed to COVID-19. If the volunteers had already been exposed to COVID-19, antibodies will be present in the blood, which will give false results. So, the two tests the volunteers underwent included the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 and a test for presence of antibodies. The purpose of the trials is to see if the vaccination generates the type of antibodies that is required for assessment by the laboratories, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/phase-3-trials-begin-for-covishield-vaccine-at-jssaher-in-mysuru/article32737603.ece
01 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Get ready for ‘Ambari’ ride||Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation’s new tourist attraction that faced hurdles over COVID-19 situation early this year is gearing up for a launch in Mysuru and Hampi, the State’s two major tourist destinations. ‘Ambari’, a specially-built double-decker bus for open-roof bus tours, is being launched in Mysuru during the low-key Dasara celebrations. The initiative's launch planned in March this year was put off in view of the pandemic. With the festivities approaching, the KSTDC is now making preparations for rolling out the open-roof bus tours and ferrying tourists on the designated route to help them experience the beauty of Mysuru’s rich heritage on the go. The KSTDC had requested the Forest Department and the Mysuru City Corporation to prune tree branches on the designated route for the smooth movement of the 16-ft.-tall bus. The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation was also requested to raise its overhead electrical lines to facilitate hassle-free movement of the bus, and these works are expected to be done by Dasara. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru. KSTDC Regional Manager Uday Kumar told The Hindu that the CESC is expected to commence the work soon while the MCC and the Forest Department are already on the job. “All of them have assured us to get the things done soon so that we can start our trial run before we officially roll out the buses,” he added. The COVID-19 situation had put brakes on the KSTDC’s plan of launching ‘Ambari’ in March this year and one such bus that arrived here from Bengaluru for the launch had to be parked in the KSTDC office premises awaiting the run. Once the preparations are done for the launch, three other ‘Ambari’ buses are also expected to be operated depending on the prevailing situation and the response to the new attraction. Besides four ‘Ambari’ buses to Mysuru, two buses will be operated in Hampi. “The route and other logistics are being worked out for the Hampi tour which may also take off this year,” he said. Audio guide Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. Foreign languages will be added subsequently. The body wrapping of ‘Ambari’ had been done based on the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/get-ready-for-ambari-ride/article32737601.ece
01 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Common Man’ greets visitors here||Visitors to the Rail Museum in the city are greeted by a statue of a man with a checked coat and bemused expression. And it does not take long to ascertain that it is the famous cartoon character ‘’Common Man’’ created by the illustrious cartoonist R.K. Laxman. For, the Mysuru division of the South Western Railway has installed a life-size sculpture of the celebrated cartoon character in the precincts of the museum. Laxman was born in Mysuru and graduated from the University of Mysore. The character of ‘common man’ appeared for the first time in the year 1951 which also coincides with the journey of Railways in independent India. ‘’This is a small tribute to the creative genius of the illustrator who hails from the city. It is another highlight of the transformed rail museum’’ said Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru. “Railways in India reflects the hopes and aspirations of the common man. Installing this iconic character is a way of celebrating Railway’s connect with the common man’’, she added. The authorities engaged Arun Yogiraj, a sculpture artist who hails from Mysuru, to execute the statue. This is another novel initiative of the Division which recently inaugurated Museum Malgudi at Arasalu station exhibiting various art works associated with the popular serial ‘Malgudi Days’ based on the works of novelist R.K. Narayan. brother of Laxman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/common-man-greets-visitors-here/article32737611.ece
01 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Palace getting ready to greet Dasara elephants||With less than a month for the start of Dasara festivities here, the iconic Mysuru palace, which will be the cynosure of all eyes, is getting ready for the fete even as its premises was being spruced up for the celebrations which will be a low-key affair this year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The palace garden will be one of the attractions for visitors as a variety of flowering and ornamental plants would be on display. The palace is all set to greet Dasara elephants which would be accorded a traditional welcome into the premises on October 2 (Friday) with the customary puja to the jumbos. The jumbo team led by the lead elephant Abhimanyu would be arriving here from their respective camps on Thursday and stay overnight at the Aranya Bhavan. This is the first year that the 54-year-old Abhimanyu would be carrying the 750-kg golden howdah following the retirement of tall tusker Arjuna, which turned 60 this year. Ahead of the elephants’ welcome, artists were seen painting the images of elephants on the palace forecourt besides sculpting models of elephants using floral foam bricks. These structures would be adorned with flowers for their welcome. The models had been placed on either side of Jayamarthanda Gate of the palace through which the elephants enter the palace and thereafter begin training for the scaled down Jamboo Savari. The Dasara squad – Abhimanyu, Gopi, Vikrama, Cauvery and Vijaya – would be brought in trucks from Aranya Bhavan to the palace instead of bringing them in a procession which was the practice all these years, as a precaution over COVID-19. This measure was taken to avoid people crowding around the elephants. Abhimanyu is best known for its astuteness in the operations for capturing errant elephants and aged and injured wild tigers straying out of forests. When Arjuna was the lead elephant, Abhimanyu was also undergoing weight training as a stand-by for the howdah elephant. It was carrying sandbags and wooden replicas of the howdah of the same weight on its back during daily training. Sources said Abhimanyu was selected for the task because of its skills and its two-decade long experience as a Dasara jumbo. All the jumbos would be under close watch with CCTV surveillance around their makeshift camp. This year, only mahouts and kavadis will accompany the elephants unlike the past when their families too would escort them to Mysuru for the festivities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/palace-getting-ready-to-greet-dasara-elephants/article32737608.ece
01 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Teaching community anxious as many test COVID-19 positive||The teaching community in Mysuru district is in a state of worry as many teachers from the government schools were said to have tested positive to COVID-19 during the free test conducted by the Department of Health and Family Welfare since past few days. The tests had been halted for the time being. The teachers across the district were undergoing rapid antigen tests (RATs) in the designated centre since the last three days. As on Wednesday, over 650 had been tested in Mysuru city with several of them found to have contracted the infection. Details from the taluk centres where testing was also conducted were awaited for collating the results. Uday Kumar, Education Officer, Office of the DDPI, Mysuru confirmed to The Hindu that teachers had been found to have contracted the infection after the testing and all of them had been complying with the mandated guidelines. “The DDPI Mysuru, Panduranga, and four staff members in his office too have tested positive to the infection.” The office of the DDPI had received instructions for carrying out COVID-19 testing to all teachers perhaps in expectation of the reopening of the schools. However, the State government had taken a decision not to reopen the schools and colleges until October 15. District Vector Borne Diseases Controlling Officer S. Chidambar said RATs were conducted for teachers here and nearly 200-plus teachers underwent the tests daily since the last three days. On all three days, there were positive cases and the exact number of cases among the teaching community would be known on Thursday with the data being checked. Those with symptoms and testing negative in RATs had been subjected to RT-PCR and the results of some of the samples were awaited. “Now the tests have been halted. If they (DDPI office) want tests again on teachers, we are ready to do it.” Mysuru district alone has over 7,000 teachers and it is not clear whether the tests would be continued, covering all teachers, in the light of the positive cases. Also, the Vidyagama programme may face hurdles in the wake of infections among the teachers. The initiative came under praise as teachers went to the doorsteps of the children in villages and conducted classes to ensure that none drop out of schools following closure of schools since many months and with the reopening being delayed with no let-up in new infections. Apprehensions are also being expressed over teachers being exposed to the risks of contracting the infection as they had been told to get engaged in the teaching process visiting the community since many children, especially those in rural areas, are not able to afford online education. Thanks to Vidyagama, many government schools that had been shut down since past two years are readying for reopening because of admission of children who are leaving private schools and joining those run by the government in Mysuru, Mandya, Kodagu and Chamarajanagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/teaching-community-anxious-as-many-test-covid-19-positive/article32737600.ece

A senior BBMP official said that installation of bollards was complete on both sides of the lane, and that the work on barricades and signage boards at merging points as well as entry and exit points is nearing completion. The BBMP had initially hoped to complete all installations by October 2, but officials said there were objections from some commuters and residents who live along the 16-km stretch from Silk Board junction to Lowry Memorial College. “There are 37 entry and exit points, which have been marked. Installation of barricades and signage was near completion. However, regular commuters and residents had complaints about the barricades and signage, and we are making some changes based on their requests,” the official said. A BMTC bus driver said that bollards and barricades will prevent other motorists from entering the priority lane. “When cameras are installed and violators are penalised, the lane will reach its potential. The success of the BPL can be gauged once people start going back to their work places,” he said. However, many motorists reiterated that the presence of bollards is a safety hazard. To ensure that no vehicle, other than BMTC buses and ambulances, use the priority lane, the civic body will be installing 150 high-definition cameras. This, in the future, will help the police and marshals identify violators and penalise them. “The tender will be called in a week or two. If everything goes as planned, cameras will be installed by the end of the year,” said a civic official. Cycle lane Work on a pop up cycle lane along the bus priority lane will gain momentum from Monday. “Initial work has already begun, but was halted because of the recent spate of rains.” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-week-more-for-bus-priority-lane-to-be-ready/article32737863.ece

Balasubrahmanyam, fondly called ‘SPB’, who passed away in Chennai recently after a long battle with COVID-19, by organising a music concert in his memory. Although the annual festivities had been scaled down in view of the pandemic, the Mysuru palace is the only venue hosting the cultural events this time with the music and dance programmes in the backdrop of the illuminated palace which is considered highly prestigious and treasured. When Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar was holding a review of the preparations for the festivities here, suggestions came in for paying a musical tribute to SPB, who regaled the music lovers across the country, especially in South India, with his soulful melodies since past five decades. Big turnout SPB had performed in the backdrop of the illuminated Amba Vilasa Palace during the 2018 Dasara celebrations. Hundreds of his devoted fans braved the rains to watch his concert. SPB had also performed here early this year at a fund-raising event that evoked packed audiences. Meanwhile, the District Minister has told the Dasara Festival Committee here to organise the cultural events giving opportunities to the local artistes as well. Recently, the local artistes had sought opportunity for performance at the palace since the events had been scaled down in view of low-key celebrations. The artistes had also submitted a memorandum to the Minister in this connection. Though the Jamboo Savari has been confined to the palace premises, the government has decided to include tableaux in the procession. The number could be less but they are definitely part of the procession, the organisers said. Tableaux would include those on COVID-19 awareness and State government’s programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concert-likely-in-memory-of-spb/article32737605.ece

According to Agriculture Department officials, harvest of the additional crop (second crop) will begin in the district in the first week of October. “The August floods had destroyed paddy in around 3,500 ha in the district. However, crop in around 5,300 ha survived the floods. We have made all arrangements for the harvest of the second crop,” Lata Mary George, Principal Agricultural Officer, said.  Special protocol Ms. George said in view of the pandemic, paddy harvest would be conducted as per a special protocol. A committee involving agriculture officers and health workers would be constituted in all grama panchayats. It would prepare an action plan. Further, padasekhara samitis would sign an agreement with combine harvester machine agents. Farmers have expressed concern over the shortage of combine harvesters and labour. However, officials said 82 combine harvesters would be needed and steps had been taken to bring the combine harvesters necessary from neighbouring States. As per the protocol, operators of combine harvesters should undergo COVID-19 testing before starting their journey to Alappuzha. Once they reach the district, they are barred from interacting with local residents and farmers and travelling to other places. Agents should arrange food and accommodation for the operators in the respective grama panchayat itself. The harvester machines should be disinfected before and after harvest. This is the third year in a row, Kuttanad suffered crop loss in the additional crop season. Last year, torrential downpour and increased flow of water from the eastern districts resulted in bund breaches and flooding, destroying paddy in large tracts. In 2018, back-to-back floods destroyed the additional crop in its entirety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kuttanad-geared-up-for-paddy-harvest/article32737555.ece

Further 19 FHCs are under construction,” Ms. Divakar said. Eight PHCs will be upgraded in the third phase. Longer OP hours Aardram is a Statewide programme aimed at creating people-friendly health delivery systems. Officials said the conversion of PHCs to FHCs would mean that all these institutions would work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., delivering outpatient services. Additional staff, including doctors and nurses, will be provided to FHCs. Lifestyle clinics, SWAAS clinics for asthma and other obstructive airway diseases, and depression clinics are part of the FHCs. Besides, the FHCs have improved facilities. A pre-check-up room for examining blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass have been arranged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/upgradation-of-phcs-making-good-progress-in-alappuzha/article32737564.ece

Baby, probing the alleged theft of a panchaloha idol from an idol manufacturing unit at Karakkad, near Chengannur, found out that the complaint was fake. Earlier, the police launched an investigation based on a complaint alleging that a gang attacked two employees of Panickers Granites at 9.30 p.m. on Sunday and decamped with the Ayyappa idol, which was moulded for a temple in London. The idol was recovered from the compound of the manufacturing unit on Tuesday. Staff attacked by gang Although the police confirmed that the employees were attacked by a gang led by a former employee of the unit, officials on Wednesday said that the idol was not stolen by the gang members. The police said they suspected that the people belonging to the unit itself had hidden the idol and later abandoned it on the premises. Detailed probe on “We can confirm that a part of the complaint was fake. An attack indeed took place but the idol was not stolen by the attackers.

Dineshan has convened a meeting to discuss road-widening works on the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway on Friday. Resumption of works would figure at the meeting. The works had been suspended after a major landslip on June 17. The landslip had caused large-scale damage to agricultural land on lower side of the road. It was alleged that unscientific works had caused a series of landslips, including the one on June 17. The meeting will also discuss the compensation to the affected farmers, the Collector said. The Devikulam Subcollector has submitted a report on the landslip, he said adding that a detailed report would also be given to the government. An official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said permission was received from the Ministry of Road Transport to resume road-widening works on the stretch. The works had been suspended considering the chances of landslips during the monsoon season. He said the construction works of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway were expected to be completed before December and funds for construction of retaining walls in areas prone to landslips had been allotted. A report by Devikulam Subcollector S. Premkrishnan to the Revenue Principal Secretary stated that road-widening works on the stretch should not have resumed in the present condition. The report also recommended an inquiry into the allegations of unscientific road works by the contractor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/meet-to-discuss-gap-road-widening/article32737559.ece

Judicial member of the commission P. Mohandas said the withholding of pension to an employee who retired from service seven years ago was a serious human rights violation. The commission direction was based on a complaint submitted by K. Balakrishnan of Kannur. The complainant retired from the Kannur depot in 2013. The KSRTC Managing Director, in a report submitted, said the complainant had applied for pension three years after his retirement. The complainant argued that he was bedridden three years before he left the service. In its order, the commission cited that as the reason why the complainant had failed to file the application.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-directed-to-give-pension-to-retired-conductor/article32737497.ece
01 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Panchayat turns adversities into opportunity||If the people of Vadakkekara panchayat learnt anything from the floods of 2018 and 2019, it is that there is no time like now to do good work. They have turned adversity into an opportunity in writing a new chapter in green, bring all of the cultivable land in the panchayat under various crops. That Vadakkekara was declared a fallow landless panchayat in early August is just one aspect of the initiatives being taken by Kudumbashree groups, women under the national employment guarantee scheme and the four primary service cooperative banks. An official of the department of agriculture said that while 110 acres were brought under cultivation after lying fallow for several years, the range of experiments being carried out was a good example. The crops being tried out in Vadakkekara include corn and ragi; medicinal rice varieties like Njavara and Raktasali as well as sweet tuber crops under the guidance of the Central Tuber Crop Research Institute in Thiruvananthapuram. The tuber cultivation initiative, “Madhura Gramam”, has seen 8,000 sweet potato cuttings being distributed to 1,600 to 2,000 households in the panchayat. In the second phase, all the 11,000 homes will be given the tuber crop cuttings. Panchayat president K. M. Ambrose said almost the entire lot of 11,000 houses in the panchayat went under flood waters in 2018 and many were affected in 2019. People had learnt a lesson, he said from the troubling experience, which prompted them to answer the call for food sufficiency under the “Subhiksha Keralam” banner in the wake of COVID-19 lockdown. The panchayat now has around 1,000 hectares under various crops. Once known only for small patches of vegetable fields and dominated by homestead coconut groves, Vadakkekara has seen a revolutionary transformation. “Every single plot has turned into a place for growing vegetables, bananas, and even upland paddy”, said an official. More than 800 hectares are under coconut cultivation; 10 hectares under nutmeg, 15 hectares under banana, 10 hectares under tapioca, 10 hectares under vegetable crops and eight hectares under conventional tuber crops. In another initiative, around 6,000 seedlings of the red lady variety of papaya were distributed in the panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panchayat-turns-adversities-into-opportunity/article32737998.ece
01 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Ernakulam’s daily count crosses 1,000||The number of fresh COVID-19 cases in the district crossed the 1,000-mark on Wednesday, with 1,056 people testing positive for the virus. Compared to the other districts, Ernakulam recorded the highest number of new cases in the State. A total of 896 people contracted the infection through local contact, while eight persons had arrived from outside the State, and the source of infection in 140 people remains unknown. Six health workers tested positive on Wednesday. As many as 263 people tested negative on the day, and 23,896 remain in quarantine. The total number of active cases in the district has risen to 7,876. For testing, 1,961 samples were sent from government facilities and 2,572 from private laboratories and hospitals. 21 cops test positive Twenty-one police personnel in the Ernakulam Armed Reserve camp had tested positive for SARS-COV-2 till Wednesday, sending around 50 of their colleagues into quarantine. Among the infected include four drivers belonging to the motor transport wing. The camp accounts for 600-odd cops, of whom around 100 will be available at any given time. “The infection among drivers could pose a bigger problem, as they would have come into contact with a lot of police personnel as part of their duty. If the drivers are indisposed in large numbers, the operation of police vehicles will also be seriously hit,” said a Kerala Police Association office-bearer, who further warned that at this rate the camp was in danger of getting turned into a cluster on its own. Many of the infected personnel were deployed for duties across the city, and hence there is a possibility of them having infected others with whom they may have come into contact during the course of duty. The only minor relief to cops in the city being a recent order issued by the Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order) G. Poonguzhali, directing that 20% of the staff strength in every police station being retained as a buffer to carry out station duties uninterrupted in the event of any widespread infection. They will remain in home quarantine and alternate in seven-day cycles. “Kochi city perhaps remains the only police division in the State to have such an arrangement as of now,” said police association sources. Circular Though the State Police Chief had issued a circular to have such a reserve arrangement with half the strength in every police station at the start of the spike in infections months ago, it was not executed, since performing COVID-19 duties with depleted strength was found impractical. Shortly thereafter, law and order issues also started cropping up, following which the plan was dropped altogether.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulams-daily-count-crosses-1000/article32738009.ece
01 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Migration from unaided to govt. schools continues||Migration of students from unaided sector to government schools in Ernakulam continues even after four months into the new academic year. Official data available with the General Education Department showed that nearly 150 students had left unaided schools to join classes from 1 to 10 in government schools between July 20 and September 25. Even though the department does not ask parents to mention the reason for joining a government or aided school, its officials said that the financial crisis induced by the pandemic remained a key reason for the continuing migration from unaided streams to government schools. Many parents were unable to remit the fees after losing their jobs following the outbreak of COVID-19. A section of the unaided schools had witnessed protests by parents demanding reduction in fees in view of the ongoing crisis, they said. Dip in enrolment The data revealed that there was a dip in the enrolment of students in classes 1 to 10 in the recognised unaided schools in Ernakulam in the new academic year compared to 2019-20. The difference in the head count was about 1,300. The enrolment recorded an increase to the tune of 1,500 in government schools in 2020-21 compared to the previous academic year. The enrolment in aided schools went up by nearly 720 students in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20. Parents shifting their children to government schools pointed out that the decision had eased their financial burden. While the tuition fee in an unaided school for a term may vary from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 7,500 and above without bus fee, government schools collect only Rs. 100 as Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fund from students admitted in classes 1 to 8 while the corresponding figure for students in classes 9 and 10 was 150. Students belonging to the SC/ST streams are exempted from remitting the PTA fund. Infrastructural facilities in government schools have also caught the attention of parents. They are also vocal about the quality of teachers. The joining process was not cumbersome as the Government Order issued on June 5 had said submission of transfer certificates was not mandatory for admitting students in classes 2 to 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/migration-from-unaided-to-govt-schools-continues/article32737994.ece
01 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Govt asks corpn to recover money from Mayor, officials||In a letter to the Kochi Corporation Secretary, the Local Self Government Department (LSGD) has said the security deposit returned to the contractor before the completion of work on the first Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) housing tower at Thuruthy in West Kochi will have to be recovered from the contractor. If the amount is not returned, the deposit will have to be recovered from the Mayor, then Additional Secretary of the corporation, and the Superintending Engineer. The letter comes on the heels of a report from the State performance audit officer on violation of rules in returning the deposit. The Mayor, the then Additional Secretary of the corporation, and the Superintending Engineer were responsible for the violation of rules in returning the security deposit of Rs. 91.22 lakh to the contractor, said the letter signed by the LSGD Deputy Secretary on behalf of the Principal Secretary. Till the amount was returned, the amount would be the liability of the three. If they are unable to get the amount returned, the deposit will have to be retrieved in equal amounts from them, and a report on the action taken must be presented to the government within two weeks, said the letter dated September 18. “I have not seen the letter yet. There has been no violation of rules. This matter is purely political, and hides many facts. Anticipatory sanction is given by the Mayor in several instances. This issue of returning the deposit was later approved by the corporation council through a vote. If the contractor must return the deposit, a decision will have to be taken on that,” said Mayor Soumini Jain. Corporation Secretary in-charge, K.P. Vinayan, who also holds charge as Regional Joint Director, said with the additional duties he discharges, he had not yet seen the letter. Additional Secretary Satheesan U.S. said the letter was received at the office only earlier this week and that a decision on it would be taken by the Secretary. After a section of Opposition councillors had written to the Minister for Local Self Governments about the return of the security deposit, the performance audit officer had in October last year examined the matter and prepared a report. The report noted that the return of the deposit to the contractor before the completion of work and in lieu of pending bills, was a violation of rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-asks-corpn-to-recover-money-from-mayor-officials/article32738005.ece
01 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Anti-MVD vitriol goes viral on social media||Social media is rife with the righteous indignation of motorists fuming over the Motor Vehicle Department’s allegedly unreasonable and stifling fine regime for filling government coffers and lining the pockets of officials who have vouched to legally fight what they regarded a criminal smear campaign. WhatsApp is flush with audio clippings of motorists claiming to have been on the receiving end of the department’s alleged “fining spree”, especially on account of unauthorised alterations. These victims claim that anything from playing loud music, alloy wheels, minor discrepancies on number plates, and display of stickers of professional organisations are being fined hefty. A theory being touted around for the perceived sudden surge in enforcement, and which has since then achieved some traction following repeated sharing, is that an arrangement is in place, whereby enforcement officials are guaranteed 30% of the fine, and only the rest goes to the government exchequer. That regional transport offices have been given stiff targets to fill up government coffers is another popular theory. MVD, however, is planning to take legal action based on the IT Act against the smear campaign. No targets “Neither has the government ordered any target-centric enforcement nor is there any arrangement for sharing of fines between the government and enforcement officials. In fact, any such revenue-sharing arrangement in any government department is illegal, a reason why none of the accusers have produced any Government Order substantiating their allegations,” said Shaji Madhavan, Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement), Ernakulam. After completely abstaining from enforcement for months following COVID-19 duties, enforcement is back on track, while there are a lot more private vehicles on the road owing to depleted public transport, enhancing the number of motorists charged. This may have created the impression of a sudden spike in enforcement, Mr. Madhavan said. “The emergence of e-PoS machines has increased the speed and efficiency of enforcement while infusing transparency, as challans are generated with photographs of the offence. Earlier, vehicle owners were not even aware of challans issued by the department, and there was no deterrent against non-payment of fines. But now, they receive alerts about the fines instantly on their mobile phones with a link for online payment, failing which they will be denied all future department services,” said Mr. Madhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anti-mvd-vitriol-goes-viral/article32737989.ece

The constitution of the committee is part of follow-up steps being initiated by the government after the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi pulled it up for its failure to address unscientific handling of waste at the dumping site. The committee comprises Principal Secretary (Urban) of the Department of Local Self Government as Chairman, Kerala State Pollution Control Board Chairman, the and Kochi Corporation Secretary. An action plan will be formulated to implement the directives of the tribunal. Personal affidavit Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta will personally monitor compliance with the directives on a monthly basis and record the proceedings. He will file his personal affidavit furnishing information on commencement of work on remediation of old waste lying at the site by January 21, 2021. A Government Order issued on September 28 said the tribunal had ordered assessment and recovery of compensation for environmental damage from those responsible for the situation at Brahmapuram. The State Pollution Control Board has assessed a total environmental compensation of Rs. 25.4 crore on the Kochi Corporation and the five municipalities (dumping their waste at Brahmapuram) of Kalamassery, Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara, and Thripunithura for their failure to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The compensation assessed for the Kochi Corporation is Rs. 13.31 crore, while the figures for the five municipalities are Rs. 2.77 crore for Kalamassery, Rs. 1.72 crore for Aluva, Rs. 1.96 crore for Angamaly, Rs. 2.92 crore for Thrikkakara, and Rs. 2.72 crore for Thripunithura as on July 31, 2020. Notices to be served Senior board officials said notices would be issued under relevant sections of the Environment Protection Act and Solid Waste Management Rules against the erring local bodies as part of recovering compensation. Successful models The NGT has also advised the government to consider action on the pattern of successful models of other States, where meaningful steps have been initiated to deal with situations similar to Brahmapuram in consultation with the Central Pollution Control Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-member-panel-to-oversee-waste-handling-at-brahmapuram/article32737992.ece
01 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Patient transport on brink of breakdown||The surge in COVID-19 caseload in the district has left the mostly centralised patient transport and management system struggling to keep up over the past week. Earlier in the district’s pandemic trajectory, patients would be shifted to first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) or hospitals soon after they tested positive, even if it was at night, said Zeenath Rasheed, councillor representing Kalvathy, Division 2, of the Kochi Corporation, which has recorded several positive cases of infection in more than two months. Now, delays can range from a day to three days, she said, even for patients experiencing some discomfort from their symptoms. Recently, she has had to call the control room and officials handling the shifting to get patients moved to COVID facilities, and had received prompt responses, Ms. Rasheed said. Sheeba Lal, who represents Fort Kochi Veli, where the entire division remains a containment zone, said considering the distance to FLTCs far away from West Kochi and the need to disinfect the transport vehicle after every trip, the process had been taking a while recently. An expensive affair After testing negative, travelling back from treatment centres far away from Kalvathy has also been a hassle for patients, Ms. Rasheed said. “Returning to West Kochi from centres in Angamaly or Kothamangalam has been expensive for residents, particularly daily wage earners,” she added. Patient load management, with the goal of making beds available for patients who actually need them, is handled from the Integrated Command Control and Communication Centre (IC4), along with the telemedicine system, said a health official. Once a person tests positive, patient data is entered onto the ‘Care’ platform, a web-based app readied by volunteers, that prepares a patient card and creates a request for a bed, depending on the patient’s condition. Transport is then arranged through the software that also tracks ambulance and other patient transport vehicles, besides keeping tabs on bed availability at the various COVID-19 care facilities. Bed allotment The patient card is sent to the receiving facility, so that it will have the patient’s details upon his/her arrival, and an emergency tab in the system allows beds to be allotted for those who need them urgently. This load balancing system floundered a little when cases hit new peaks recently, the official said. The whole process has been happening in a centralised manner so far with the small teams at the telemedicine unit and the IC4 handling patient data and transport. An attempt is being made now to decentralise it, with peripheral teams in the respective local bodies entering patient data to hasten the process, he said. “We are trying to get panchayats to use the care platform and use their own vehicles to shift patients rather than rely on the central team. Controlling transport centrally, as it has been happening so far, can be hazardous with the caseload increasing. The system is still being fine-tuned,” he added. A pool of around 250 double-chambered vehicles is ready at the local body level, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/patient-transport-on-brink-of-breakdown/article32738010.ece

President of the chamber Biju Ramesh said here on Wednesday that the institutions were not abiding by the moratorium on loan repayment granted to borrowers in view of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The chamber had submitted a memorandum to the State government for a solution as many chamber members who had borrowed money were being pressured by the institutions to pay the dues. However, the director of a leading Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) based in Kerala denied the allegation and said NBFCs were overseen by the Reserve Bank of India and their existence depended on following the RBI guidelines. Mr. Rajesh Nair said that those who faced ‘harassment’ from the lending institutions were mostly small borrowers. Complaints had come in from most districts in the State, he said. Collection agents He alleged that collection agents were being used by some of the lenders. These agents had told the borrowers that the offer of moratorium on loan repayments was at the discretion of the lending institution. The chamber named two private lending institutions in its statement to the press. The chamber leaders appealed to its members who had run into trouble with their lenders to contact the action council for advice and action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chamber-alleges-harassment-by-nbfcs/article32738002.ece

The facility that was inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in December 2017, works under the supervision of the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam. Though the preparations for the distribution of the seedlings has been delayed by the COVID-19 restrictions, the high-tech nursery was shut only between March 23 and 31, said a communication here. More takers  Manager Bimal Roy said that the centre was able to sell Rs. 3 lakh worth of seedlings during the lockdown period as more and more people turned to farming activities in the wake of the lockdown. The farm has also started producing cold season vegetable seedlings such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and capsicum. Twenty-five types of vegetable seedlings suited to the Kerala conditions are available from the facility. Along with these, saplings of cold season vegetables are also available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/15-lakh-seedlings-ready-at-nadukkara/article32737987.ece

The report prima facie found that the quarry was operated in violation of the licence conditions and more than the permissible limit of explosives were stored in the building concerned. K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural), submitted the report to the District Collector and the explosives controller. Instead of storing the explosives in a dedicated storeroom, they were kept in the building in violation of the norms. The migrant workers were also illegally accommodated in the building leading to their death in the explosion. “Police have so far arrested seven accused and further probe is under way. Separate teams of police are inspecting quarries in the district with special focus on licence conditions, storage of explosives and the state of labourers,” said Mr. Karthik. The final report will be submitted once the probe is wrapped up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/quarry-flouted-explosives-storage-norms/article32738003.ece

01 October 2020||Kollam,KERALA||Work on walkway facelift project at Asramam halted||Beautification works in connection with the heritage walkway project at Asramam have landed the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in a soup with the Kollam Corporation issuing a stop memo for carrying out construction in the protected site. Since the area has been declared a biodiversity heritage site with a very rich and unique ecosystem, it is illegal to allow any construction that alters its character. Eight sculptures, commissioned by the DTPC, to be installed on the walkway have been left unfinished following the intervention. “The major problem is the medium of construction. Instead of concrete they could have opted for some eco-friendly material that goes well with the character of the place. We have nothing against the sculptors or their art, but we cannot allow anyone to convert a heritage site into a concrete forest,” says Mayor Honey Benjamin. Residents and environmental activists have always opposed new constructions in the area as they believe it will set a bad precedent. Ms.Benjamin points out unscientific installation of the sculptures as another issue. “They have placed the sculptures without proper spacing spoiling all the aesthetic quality of the works. I think they went for such a design to protect the interest of some people. The DTPC says it had submitted the plan and a final decision will be taken after going through it,” she says. Committee suggestions The Kollam Corporation had earlier formed a committee for devising a management plan for the conservation of the site. The committee had come up with several recommendations including strict measures to prevent encroachment to protect the rare vegetation of the area. Environmentalists had also pointed out cattle grazing as a major threat to the rare herbs and mangrove varieties in the site. According to DTPC officials, sculptures and small kiosks for selling local products like cashew, spices and handicrafts are part of the heritage walkway project. “It's not an unauthorised work and all officials concerned were informed about it before starting the construction. The executive committee had discussed the project and the work was handed over to the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi after the directorate approved it. We had also obtained official permission from the District Collector,” says an official. Fifty seven acres of land in Asramam that includes the ground, Government Guest House complex, the mangrove stretch and the backwaters form Kerala’s first biodiversity heritage site. “But our construction is happening outside the area declared as the biodiversity heritage site. Each sculptor was given 10 days and the project was nearing completion when the work stopped,” added the official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-on-walkway-facelift-project-at-asramam-halted/article32737557.ece

The report, to be submitted to the State government within October 15, will mainly consider the exclusion of villages such as Chembanoda, Chakkittappara and Muthukad from the buffer zone limit. Officials made it clear that only inhabited areas would be excluded from the list. There would not be any change in criteria on the basis of unfounded claims or protests, they added. Divisional Forest Officer M. Rajeevan said Kattippara was one of such villages where no inhabited locations were added to the buffer zone as claimed by protesters. He said the new report would be prepared using accurate geospatial data available with the department and it would be submitted to the State government for further proceedings. Mr. Rajeevan also said the claims of land holders under the Peruvannamoozhi range were found genuine as there were many inhabited areas within the interior village. They also possessed land documents issued by the government to prove legal ownership and to be excluded from the buffer zone limit, he said. It was following a recent district-level meeting chaired by Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan that the Forest Department was entrusted with the preparation of a new report on buffer zone and people’s concerns. The meeting was convened as a number of farmer organisations announced their decision to launch an indefinite stir in Kozhikode seeking the revision of the buffer zone classification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/inhabited-villages-likely-to-be-excluded-from-buffer-zone/article32737504.ece

According to figures available with the Tourism Department, there are 4,313 responsible tourism units in Kozhikode district alone. Now, panchayats such as Olavanna, Kadalundi, Thalakkulathur and Koodaranhi are leading the show with the support of small-scale investors. Kozhikode district panchayat and block panchayat have even set their own models for supporting such initiatives within their limits. Efforts are also on to identify more local tourism resources and enrol more grama panchayats under the network. District panchayat president Babu Parassery says some of the local panchayats in Kozhikode district have bigger opportunities in the promotion of water tourism destinations. “We are supporting them to launch boating service and water sports activities. It can be planned to attract new-generation travellers,” he adds. Promotion activities Tourism Department officials say the preparation of an exclusive tourism resource directory with details of such initiatives and their contact numbers for booking is under way as part of promotion activities. To explore new village tourism opportunities, the Certificate of Association has been issued to 53 leading tourism industry partners. Coordinators of the Responsible Tourism Mission say regional units specialised in the promotion of ethnic cuisines, traditional crafts and art forms have better opportunities on the cards with them forming tie-ups with leading tourism industry players in the district. There is also an option for exploring online sales, they add. According to K. Roopesh Kumar, State Coordinator of Responsible Tourism Mission, about 1,000 more persons in the district will be given training during the fiscal to emerge as successful entrepreneurs in the sector. Considering the COVID-19 challenge, the training will be conducted online, he adds. Sreekala Lakshmi, District Coordinator of the Mission, says the improved participation of women entrepreneurs in training programmes has been a noteworthy experience in the district. She also points out that women entrepreneurs in the area will be able to explore many emerging opportunities in the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/responsible-tourism-units-offer-a-ray-of-hope/article32737496.ece

Krishnamenon Indoor Stadium and the mofussil bus stand  in Kozhikode will be thrown open to the public soon. The bridge with escalators and lifts on both sides of the road, the first of its kind in any municipal corporation in the State, is expected to ease the traffic congestion on the stretch to a large extent. “Finishing works of the bridge is going on. It can be opened in the first week of October,” Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said. The construction of the foot overbridge and the attached amenities began in February 2019 and was expected to be completed by March 2020. But the pandemic put a damper on the plans. Some of the machinery had to be imported from China, further delaying the completion. The 25.37-metre-long and 3-metre wide bridge is built 6.5 metres above the road. Around 1,140 square-feet space on the premises of the bridge will be used for commercial purposes. The regular pedestrian crossing near the bus stand has been a major reason for the traffic congestion on the stretch. A foot overbridge that existed in the same location earlier was brought down as it fell out of use, with pedestrians preferring to walk across the road instead of using it. To avoid this, the Corporation plans to barricade the renovated footpaths with hand rails, forcing pedestrians to use the new facility. The bridge, escalator, lift and the new tiled footpaths are being constructed at a cost of Rs. 11.35 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mechanised-foot-overbridge-to-be-thrown-open-to-public-soon/article32737502.ece
01 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||TCMC censures three doctors||The Travancore-Cochin Medical Council (TCMC) has censured one doctor in Thiruvananthapuram and two in Kozhikode for allowing themselves to be featured in advertisements in media in violation of the provisions of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette, and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. The action follows a complaint filed by the Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE) Kerala, a platform launched by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad. Orders issued According to the TCMC orders issued on August 14, copies of which are available with The Hindu , a photo of the doctor attached to V Care Skin and Piles Centre, Kattakkada, Thiruvananthapuram, was carried along with an advertisement in a Malayalam newspaper on March 19, 2019 claiming that the clinic offered haemorrhoid symptoms treatment for the first time in Kerala. The names of the two doctors attached to PVS Hospital, Kozhikode, were found in an advertisement offering treatment for varicose vein in the April 2019 issue of a popular health magazine. Professional norms Section 6.1. of the Indian Medical Council Regulations Act says soliciting of patients, directly or indirectly, by a physician, by a group of physicians, or by institutions or organisations is unethical. “A physician shall not make use of him/her (or his/her name) as subject of any form or manner of advertising or publicity through any mode either alone or in conjunction with others which is of such a character as to invite attention to him or to his professional position, skill, qualification, achievements, attainments, specialities, appointments, associations, affiliations or honours and/or of such character as would ordinarily result in his self-aggrandizement,” it says. Doctors’ stand The doctor from Kattakkada claimed that the advertisement was placed without his knowledge. While one of the two doctors in Kozhikode said he had snapped ties with the hospital much before the advertisement was placed in the magazine, the other claimed that his consent was not taken before it was published. The modern medicine ethics committee of the TCMC, however, pointed out that the doctors cannot wash their hands of the act of being featured in advertisements. Later, they tendered apologies and the TCMC censured them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tcmc-censures-three-doctors/article32737577.ece

Mayor Thottathil Raveendran announced the landmark achievement on Monday on the occasion of World Rabies Day. The ABC centre that began at Poolakkadavu in March 2019 completed 5,004 vaccinations and sterilisations as of Monday. The achievement that was planned as part of the Corporation’s Mission 360 to be completed in August got delayed due to the pandemic. “The ABC centre in Thiruvananthapuram is the only one in the State that has passed this landmark earlier. But the centre has been in existence for more than a decade,” said Corporation Secretary Binu Francis. The ABC assistants associated with the Corporation capture stray dogs from different parts of the city and take them to the centre for surgery. The animals are accommodated at the centre for a week or more to allow them to recuperate and are then let loose at the same place from where they were picked up. “If you find stray dogs with a cut on the ear, it means they have undergone the surgery,” said Mr. Francis. According to a 2008 census, there were 13,000 stray dogs in the city. The number may have increased to at least 20,000 now. In the last one-and-half years, more than one-third of the stray dogs have been sterilised and vaccinated. The Corporation plans to elevate the ABC centre into a training centre for local body workers from other parts of the State. “At present, the nearest training centre is in Ooty. Since we have competent staff and experience, we could train representatives from other local bodies,” said Mr. Francis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-corporations-abc-centre-completes-5000-surgeries/article32737500.ece
01 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Dancing in memory of a singing legend||Methil Devika first watched Sankar abharanam as a little girl at a cinema in Dubai. She was so moved by the dance and music of the film, she ran up to the screen and began to dance; her mother had to drag her back. The man who sang those timeless songs in Sankarabharanam is no more. Like most south Indians of her generation, Devika grew up listening to S.P. Balasubrahmanyam’s songs. She felt she needed to a pay a tribute to the gifted singer who gave so much happiness to her and millions of others. It had to be through dance. Though she is primarily known as a Mohiniyattam dancer – she is one of the leading practitioners of the art – she chose Kuchipudi for her tribute. That was apt, for Kuchipudi is from Andhra Pradesh, where SPB belonged to. She did not choose one of his popular film songs though, but a Telugu devotional song – Sri Narasimha dandakam . Why the song “I had stumbled on the song years before and loved it,” she says. “I choreographed and performed it in Mohiniyattam, after making the necessary changes in music.” Not many know that Devika is trained in Kuchipudi, that too from the legendary Vempatti Chinna Satyam. She has not performed Kuchipudi on stage for a while, though. But one would not realise it while watching her tribute to SPB.  The response She is pleasantly surprised by the response the video has generated. “Actress Menaka told me she loved it; she could have related to it better than many because Telugu is her mother tongue,” says Devika. “It was also nice to find that many others, including actor Mohanlal, liked it.” It has already been watched by nearly 14,000 people on YouTube, within a day of its release. That is not a bad number, for a video of classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dancing-in-memory-of-a-singing-legend/article32737579.ece

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) demanded that the investigation agencies go in appeal against the verdict. “It’s unfortunate. It’s sad to see the people who committed such a serious crime going scot-free,” said IUML chairman and State president Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal. However, Mr. Thangal called upon the people to uphold communal harmony. IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, said the verdict amounted to saying that the Babri Masjid was not demolished. “It is an unfortunate verdict in a crime committed 28 years ago. Justice is denied,” he said. “It is extremely disappointing,” said Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (AP group) president E. Sulaiman Musliar and general secretary Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar. ‘Blow to democracy’ “It’s a twin blow to Indian democracy,” said Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (EK group) president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal and general secretary K. Alikutty Musliar. The Samastha Kerala Sunni Mahallu Federation too described the verdict as unfortunate. The Indian National League (INL) said the verdict challenged the people’s democratic conscience. The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Fraternity Movement took out protest marches across the district. CPI(M) reaction CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the judgment had left secular and democratic forces anxious. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had saved the accused by failing to ferret out evidence and submit it in court. The outcome was illustrative of how the Centre used the CBI for its political ends. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the verdict was a strike at the secular foundations of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court had found that the destruction of the Babri Masjid was a criminal act. However, the CBI failed to furnish proof. Its conduct in the case was dubious. BJP State president K. Surendran said the verdict had ended a three-decade-long witch-hunt of party leaders. The Congress had used the incident to tar and feather senior BJP leaders such as L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti. They have finally got justice, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/masjid-order-evokes-disappointment/article32737590.ece

01 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State’s COVID caseload doubled in Sept.||September has indeed been the cruellest month as far as Kerala and its COVID-19 case burden is concerned. In September alone, Kerala recorded almost double the number of cases it had cumulatively registered till August 31. Till August 31, the total number of COVID-19 cases registered in the State had been 75,385. The cumulative number of deaths reported till August 31 was 294. In September, Kerala recorded 1,20,721 cases of COVID-19 and 448 deaths. This essentially means that over 60% of the State’s cumulative case burden as well as the burden of COVID deaths were recorded in just one month. And the scariest part seems to be that since the disease spread is not uniform across districts, in many districts, the case graphs could be peaking only in the next few weeks, extending the State’s collective agony over the month or more. However, public health experts point out that Kerala has held out till now and with a remarkably low case fatality rate only because the epidemic has been spread out over the months. The disease containment interventions and the general vigil exercised by people – mask wearing being the most prominent, as Kerala was the first State to implement universal mask-wearing – have resulted in a lag in the progress of the epidemic. This has helped the State because the patient numbers did not peak overnight and threaten the health system capacity. Plateauing in capital? The good news for Thiruvananthapuram district, which has recorded the highest number of new COVID-19 cases every day consistently for over two months, is that the case graph could be plateauing, while in other districts cases are all set to climb. The district still would be recording 800-900 cases daily but the statistics over the past few days have given rise to hopes that the worst might be over and that the case fatality rate might be contained at 1%.  The containment interventions and caution exercised by people – mask wearing being the most prominent – have resulted in a lag in the progress of the epidemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-covid-caseload-doubled-in-sept/article32737585.ece

This year, the day comes amid a spurt in COVID-19 cases in the State. With the elderly being particularly vulnerable to the disease, the government has been taking extra care to prevent them from getting infected. This year, the programmes in connection with International Day of Older Persons are being observed online so as to minimise the risk of infection, a statement from Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said. Steps have been taken to convene the district-level councils for the elderly. Directions have been given to panchayats for helping the elderly and starting ward-level community support groups with participation of various stakeholders, review the functioning of Sayamprabha homes in all districts and take steps to improve their functioning, provide mental and social support to the elderly who are in reverse quarantine, and ensure medicines and other requirements for those living alone.  Maintenance tribunals The online adalats will hear cases pending in the maintenance tribunals established under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and dispose them of and take steps to address problems. Call centres attached to the elderly cells have started functioning in all 14 districts in the State. These call centres function from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and from here, calls are made to the elderly to ascertain their needs and difficulties. Awards will be given to one non-governmental organisation in each district that works for the elderly as part of the National Action Plan for Senior Citizens.

The four-storey building is the first facility to be commissioned in the Phase I of the PPP project by Adani Vizhinjam Ports Private Ltd. (AVPPL) that is executing the project. Minister for Ports Kadannappally Ramachandran inaugurated the facility through video conference as part of the LDF government’s “100 day, 100 projects.” All managerial staff and critical port control systems such as marine control, tower control, port control and security control will be operating from this building. The Minister said the government was extending all support to the AVPPL to complete the 3.1-km breakwater and the delayed Phase I of the project. 97% of land acquired The Minister said the government had already handed over 97% of the land and the remaining 4.2 hectares would be acquired soon. He said the government had so far provided Rs. 83.11 crore as compensation to local residents. Seeking the cooperation of the people in and around the project site in completing the sea port, he said the issues flagged would be sorted out by the government through talks. Three quarries had been sanctioned for procuring granite for the breakwater. To be commissioned The Minister said the AVPPL had informed that other facilities in the seaport would be commissioned in the coming months. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, in his presidential address, said the AVPPL should complete the Phase I of the seaport in a time-bound manner as apprehensions of sea erosion due to the work had been raised. Shashi Tharoor, MP, said the seaport could emerge as the country’s transshipment hub catering to mother vessels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/first-facility-of-vizhinjam-project-ready/article32738169.ece
01 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||An SPB fan who sounds like him||In the mid-1980s, Manacaud Gopan was taking his first steps in the ‘ganamela’ circuit when one of the instrumentalists in his troupe took him aside and told him to concentrate more on Tamil and Hindi songs since his voice texture was similar to that of S.P. Balasubrahmanyam (SPB). Since that day, for much of the past three decades and more, Gopan has been singing SPB’s songs on stages across the State and outside. If one were to listen to one of his performances, without looking at the video, one could not be mistaken for assuming the voice to be that of SPB. Feel of the song More than mimicking his voice, he manages to capture the feeling of the original song, be it one of the moving tracks like Kaadhalin Deepam or the racy ones like Ilamai Idho Idho , which is his staple song to ring in the New Year during the annual midnight performances. “I used to sing for amateur events or for friends’ groups from around 1985. Three years later, I met music director Devarajan master, who took me in to be part of his music troupe. It was he who gave me the stage name of Manacaud Gopan. Though I began singing Malayalam songs, before long I was singing mostly SPB’s Tamil songs. I became known for it and event organisers sought me out for SPB ‘musical nites’, and numerous such events have been organised over the past few decades,” says Gopan. Meeting the legend In addition to his ‘ganamela’ work, he has been recording devotional albums, songs for TV serials, and albums of his SPB covers. In 1998, he met SPB for the first time, when he handed over a cassette of his recordings of SPB songs to the singer. In 2003, he had the good fortune of singing for an SPB tribute event for a television channel, when the legend himself listened to the vocalist who sings like him. “We became more familiar when he came to receive the Kamukara Foundation award. I have been part of the SPB Fans Charitable Foundation through which he provides help to a lot of struggling musicians and others in need,” says Gopan. For him, the news of his idol’s passing is yet to sink in, even as he gets into the morning routine of listening to SPB songs. “We had plans to bring him here. I did not expect him to go so suddenly,” says Gopan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-spb-fan-who-sounds-like-him/article32738178.ece
01 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Panel directive on child abuse cases||The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has directed the State Police Chief to issue a circular to all Station House Officers (SHOs) that on receiving information about sexual abuse of a child, police officers should record the statement of the survivor and register a case as per laws irrespective of the place the incident has occurred. Following this, the complaint should be sent to the police station under whose limits the place where the incident occurred falls, the panel has said. The commission has also directed the State Police Chief to ensure proper training for police personnel dealing with the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and that the officers are made aware of a child-friendly approach in such matters. The commission was acting on a complaint from the chairperson of the Malappuram child welfare committee that though the Tirur SHO was apprised of the sexual abuse of the girl by Childline, a case was not registered within 24 hours on the grounds that the incident did not occur in his station limits. Along with the petitioner, the SHO had been informed as the girl was in an area under his jurisdiction.  Delay of five days The commission observed that instead of recording the girl’s statement and taking further action, the SHO’s stance was that the incident had occurred in Thiruvananthapuram and information had been sent to the police station concerned in the capital district. Ultimately, the case was registered only after five days. This was a violation of Section 19 of the POCSO Act. Any delay in registering FIRs in instances of crimes against children will affect successful prosecution of such cases, the commission said, seeking a report from the State Police Chief on the action taken on its directions within 40 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hear-out-victim-says-child-rights-panel/article32737558.ece

01 October 2020||Thrissur,KERALA||Care of robot nurses for patients at Nattika||Robot nurses now attend to COVID-19 patients at the COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTC), Nattika, the biggest such centre in the State with 1,400 beds. The Government Engineering College, Thrissur, has deployed six robot nurses at the centre. The college has also developed an e-bike for food distribution and a patient management software for the centre. A team of young engineers, Sourav P.S. , Aswin Kumar K., Tony C .Abraham, Ajay Aravind, and Sidharth V. developed the robot. While Muhammad Arif O.S.; Evin Wilson; Glinz George ,and Pranav Balachandran developed the e-bike, Kowsik Nandagopan, Irshad P.I., and Arun Jishnu are the brain behind the patient management software. Dr. Ajay James, Assistant Professor, is their mentor. The same team has developed Sanitizer Kunjappan, a robot for sanitisation; aerosol box and WISK for collecting samples from people for COVID-19 tests. The project is funded by NABARD under the Rural Infrastructure Promotion Fund (RIPF) and implemented under the leadership of Dr. Satheeshan T.V., district programme manager, Arogyakeralam, Thrissur. “The automatic robot nurse is an implementation of the industrial line follower robot. This robot is capable of taking health values like temperature, pressure and oxygen levels of patients. Such robots with automated controls and minimum human assistance can cover a large number of patients in a single stretch. The robot can work in three shifts to monitor patients. It can cover about 250 patients in a shift. The doctors can communicate with patients using the telemedicine feature implemented in it,” explained Dr. Ajay James. The robot can not only reduce the workload of the medical staff in monitoring the patients but can also check the chances of infection. It can check whether a patient is active in a bed or not. The robots can also interact with patients and their needs can be communicated with the control centre. The patient status, values, and details can be transferred to the control centre. The robots are deployed in each section with 200 beds. The e-bike is a manned vehicle, which is able to carry food and other materials inside the COVID-19 centre. About 100 kg can be carried at a single stretch, which empowers the FLTC in efficient distribution of food in the minimum time. As it is an electric bike, it does not have problems such as pollution and noise disturbances. Layout of beds A patient management software developed for making bed allocation and patient management efficient is also deployed in the FLTC. It has features such as a pictorial layout of beds, patients’ register and communication channel for data transfer between the control centre and nursing stationsCase .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/care-of-robot-nurses-for-patients-at-nattika/article32738190.ece

01 October 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Scientists expect very low groundnut yield in Anantapur||Farmers were overjoyed when the southwest monsoon brought rains abundantly, but it has turned into a woe with the groundnut crop sown in close to 5 lakh hectares in the district getting badly affected due to water stagnation or excess mixture in the soil. The scientists at the Agriculture Research Station, Rekulakunta have tested the crops sown in June, July and August to assess the likely yield, which brought the bad news that the average final yield is likely to be below 500 kg per hectare. “Commercially to break even for a farmer, at least 700 kg per hectare is what we look forward to. With 539 mm rainfall recorded from June 1 till September 27, the groundnut crop has been badly damaged. We witnessed some lanky green crops, but with no pod formation or a very small one. Most of the crop sown in July had suffered a change of leaf colour from green to yellow with leaf spot disease setting in. Sucking pests ‘jassids’ attacked crop in a large area,” ARS Principal Scientist B. Sahadeva Reddy told The Hindu . Poor flowering The groundnut crop sown in June and July (47,050 hectares and 4,11,128 hectares respectively) witnessed thick vegetative growth with poor flowering and formation of pegs and conversion of pegs into pods. A high incidence of leaf spots and sucking pest attacks were seen on a large scale on K-6 variety of seed supplied on subsidy by the government as that is the most popular variety in the district. In August it was sown in 41,693 hectares. In Rapthadu a tenant farmer, Vasundhara, who had sown in 10 acres has already incurred Rs. 2 lakh loss and many others are facing a similar fate. Mr. Sahadeva Reddy suggests diversification of crops to avoid losses. High failure rate In 2008 when there was excess rainfall like the current season, the yield was 88 kg/hectare. In the last 25 years profitable groundnut yields were recorded only in seven years – 1995 (1,310 kg/ha), 1996 (711), 1998 (1,145), 2000 (1,116), 2004 (798), 2007 (1,258) and in 2017 (992).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scientists-expect-very-low-groundnut-yield-in-anantapur/article32738084.ece

CPI national general secretary K. Narayana, along with CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal, was arrested for staging a demonstration in front of the BSNL office here. Leaders of four Left parties participated in the dharna protesting against the “anti-worker and anti-farmer” of the Modi government at the Centre. Mr. Narayana said the three farm Acts, which were passed in Parliament without any discussion, would reduce small landholders to farm labourers. In the guise of removing (retail) middlemen, the Central government was handing over the entire business to ‘wholesale middlemen’ such as Reliance, Microsoft and other large MNCs, he added||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/left-parties-oppose-anti-farmer-policies/article32738098.ece

01 October 2020||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Advanced X-ray scanners installed at Visakhapatnam airport||In an attempt to ensure effective detection of contraband concealed in the baggage of passengers and fool-proof security amid the growing threats, advanced X-ray scanners have been installed at Visakhapatnam International Airport. Vehant Technologies, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and machine learning-based surveillance, has installed Kritiscan 100100 DV – dual-view X-ray scanner for scanning of registered baggage and a Kritiscan 6040 DV for hand baggage, at the airport. Dual-view technology The traditional baggage scanners work on X-ray attenuation technology. The detection of objects which pose a threat relies on how various objects attenuate the X-ray beams passing through them. Of late, this capability has been enhanced by the use of dual-energy and view X-ray scanners. The dual-view technology produces two screening perspectives that enhance the operator’s ability to identify potential security threats with increased accuracy and speed. The Kritiscan 100100 DV is an advanced multi-energy X-ray baggage scanner which is designed and developed by the Vehant Technologies. It uses dual-view technology for generating horizontal and vertical views of the object under inspection. A system provides multi-dimensional views of the scanned object, helping enhanced detection of the objects. The indigenous manufacture of high quality X-ray scanners has come as a boon to Indian airports as earlier the authorities had to wait for long, after placing the orders, in view of the procedural delays in the import of scanners from abroad. The indigenous manufacturers will help overcome delays in the import of X-ray scanners and do away with the issues concerning maintenance of the equipment, said an airport official, who preferred anonymity. “We have installed the scanners at the Visakhapatnam airport and are planning to handover the equipment to the airport authorities by the end of this week. We have installed a DV X-ray scanner at Patna airport recently. We are in the process of installing scanners at Kolkata and Udaipur airports too,” Kapil Bardeja, CEO of Vehant Technologies told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/advanced-x-ray-scanners-installed-at-visakhapatnam-airport/article32738122.ece
01 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Treasure-hunter’ gang busted in Chittoor, eight arrested||The Chittoor police on Wednesday nabbed an eight-member inter-State gang allegedly involved in the desecration of a Nandi idol at an ancient temple near Chittoor in the early hours of September 27. Addressing a press conference here, Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said the Nandi idol at an ancient temple at Agaramangalam village of GD Nellore mandal was uprooted from its pedestal and was allegedly broken to pieces by the accused. Three special parties were formed to nab the culprits. After three-days of investigation, it was found to be the handiwork of a treasure-hunting gang. Acting on a tip-off that a six member gang was moving about in the surroundings of Kanipakam temple, 12 km from Chittoor, a police team rushed to the spot and nabbed six members, while they were about to flee the place. During interrogation, it was revealed that the accused, identified as Somasekhar (24) of Kurnool; Saravanan (30) and Peddabala (35) of Chittoor district; Manikanta (30), Naveen (35), Kiran Kumar (39), Vikas (34) and Ashok (57) from Karnataka, had been targeting ancient temples with poor and no surveillance, to unearth “hidden treasures”. The gang had chalked out an action plan to target temples of Kanipakam and other ancient temples in Chittoor district. They reportedly collected information regarding “hidden treasures” from the local people. The gang also used to allegedly lure the local people in accomplishing its tasks. The police seized two cars, gas cutters, small cylinders, and sharp objects meant to break into temples and for digging. A case was registered and the accused were sent for remand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/treasure-hunters-gang-nabbed-in-chittoor/article32737224.ece
01 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tourists begin trickling in at Chittoor waterfalls||Many of the major waterfalls in Chittoor district are brimming again after a gap of several years, thanks to copious rains this year. The waterfalls are a prime tourist attraction, particularly for tourists from Tamil Nadu. This year, however, all of the picnic spots were closed to visitors due to the COVID-19 lockdown that was clamped in March. Now, visitors are arriving at the waterfalls in increasing numbers over the past few days with restrictions on inter-State travel gradually being eased. The Ubbalamadugu eco-tourism project, popularly known as Tada falls, is a major attraction for nature lovers who keep thronging the spot round the year. The visitors are mostly from Chennai and bordering areas of Tamil Nadu. Due to the lockdown, forest officials and the Satyavedu circle police intensified surveillance on the forest road leading to the falls here, preventing youth from visiting the falls. But for the last month, visitors are going all the way up to the waterfalls by taking a detour through forest areas and avoiding checkposts. The Bhupateswara Kona falls near Nagalapuram has also emerged as an alternative picnic destination for youth. These two falls, over the years, have witnessed many youth from Tamil Nadu drowning in the swirling waters. Compared to previous years, the flow of water is much stronger this year due to four months of heavy rains, say officials. The Kailasakona waterfalls near Puttur at the Nagari foothills are another haven for picnic lovers, with a large number of them making their way to the spot in the absence of surveillance. At present, the forest post at the area is defunct with no personnel to guard it. The presence of police personnel too is missing at the archway, besides the Puttur-Chennai NH. The waterfalls at Sadasivakona hill, Moolakona, Singiri Kona and Pasupu Kona in the eastern mandals are also witnessing considerable crowds now. The Talakona waterfalls, nestled in the Seshachalam biosphere, 40 km from Tirupati, sees several youth try their best to reach the spot but in vain. In addition to the forest checkpost, 3 km away from the waterfalls, a police picket has also come up at the local Shiva temple there in recent weeks. “Though the Unlock measures have begun, visitors at Talakona waterfalls are not seen now as the ban on picnic activity continues there. Booking of guest houses is also blocked for visitors at present,” said Circle Inspector (Piler Rural) Murali Krishna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tourists-begin-trickling-in-at-chittoor-waterfalls/article32738089.ece

The department has suffered a revenue loss of Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 crore in the Visakhapatnam region compared to previous year, due to the pandemic. After nearly six months, tourism spots under the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) in the district were reopened in the district on September 5. Local beaches and spots maintained under the APTDC including Borra Caves and boating activities were started immediately. From September 10, several parks, including Kailasagiri, YSR City Central Park, which come under Visakhapatnam Metropolitan region Development Corporation (VMRDA), have been opened. However, some tourist spots such as TU-142M and Kursura submarine museum are yet to opened. The tourist spots have been receiving moderate response from the visitors, according to the officials from the Tourism Department. “Local beaches have been receiving higher number of visitors. Borra Caves is witnessing 200 visitors per day, while during weekends, the figure is touching about 300 to 400,” said APTDC Divisional Manager T.G. Prasada Reddy. He said that APTDC hotels were opened on June 8. While the APTDC hotel at Rushikonda is witnessing 40% occupancy, hotels at Araku and Agency areas in the district are having 25% occupancy, he said. The period from October to January is considered to be the peak season for tourism in the district. According to the tourism officials, on an estimate, Araku draws nearly 10,000 visitors per day and it doubles during weekends. Lambasingi has been one of the major attractions for the tourists since the last few years. The tourists visiting local beaches and facilities in Visakhapatnam are also very high during this season. “Majority of domestic tourists are from West Bengal, Odisha and a few other areas. This tourism season will depend on the COVID-19 curve, running of passenger trains and providing special attractions again like Vistadome coaches. We need to wait and see,” Mr. Reddy said.

Giving finishing touches to the sculpture at Eruru, near Chillakur in Nellore district, Mr. Sanath Kumar said the UN body had aptly recognised the actor who had helped stranded migrants during the COVID-19 lockdown by arranging food and transportation for them to go back to their hometowns. The artist took over three hours to create the sculpture using two tonnes of sand. The aim behind the sculpture is to inspire like-minded individuals here to reach out to vulnerable sections hit hard by COVID-19, Mr. Sanath Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-fitting-tribute-to-the-hero/article32738125.ece

The combined toll in the districts of Nellore and Prakasam, which had been in the double digit each day during the previous week, increased only marginally by seven to 930. With six more deaths, the toll went up to 484 in Prakasam district while the toll stood at 446 with one more death in Nellore district, according to a health bulletin released by the State government. With 324 persons testing positive for the disease, the cumulative confirmed cases rose to 48,249 in Prakasam district and the count climbed to 53,901 with 415 cases in Nellore district.

01 October 2020||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||FPOs help Srikakulam farmers get decent prices for produce||The lockdown imposed in the wake coronavirus witnessed middlemen exploiting farmers, especially those in the rural areas, who were unable to transport their produce to the markets in the nearest towns and cities in the absence of proper transport facilities. However, the farmers from Saravakota, Meliaputti, Vajrapukotturu, Pathapatnam and Jalumuru of Srikakulam district could check the domination of middlemen by forming into Farmers Producers’ Organisations (FPOs). The FPOs also helped them fetch good price for their produce, apart from ensuring marketing facilities and financial assistance. Unable to afford the exorbitant prices the private transporters were charging to shift the produce to the markets, many farmers were forced to sell their yields to middlemen at lesser prices. Lack of transport and limited market hours also fuelled the distressed sale. Now, the FPOs are helping the farmers decide the prices of cashew, paddy, banana, broomsticks, flowers and vegetables. For instance, middlemen forced the farmers to sell raw cashew at Rs. 80 or Rs. 90 per quintal when compared to the regular price of Rs. 110 per quintal. The middlemen offered lesser prices under the pretext of lack of transport facility, inferior quality of produce and others. Farmers were forced to sell banana for Rs. 260 a bunch when compared to the wholesale market price of Rs. 350 a bunch. Middlemen bought broomsticks at Rs. 40 a kg against the local market price of Rs. 50 per kg. Thousands of farmers are now getting benefited with the formation of FPOs recently. Bapuji Rural Enlightenment and Development Society (BREDS) Chief Executive Officer A. RamaKrishna Raju helped the farmers register as FPOs under the Companies Act. The BREDS has trained more than 4,000 farmers in modern farming technologies in the last two decades. However, we observed that it is not adequate unless the farmers fetch good prices for their produce. Four FPOs —Green Blend, Mana Sedyam, Siridhanyalu and Farmbowl have been formed with the support of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), he said. “Now, the trained staff of the FPOs are verifying the market prices of produce in the markets in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam and nearby Odisha. The produces are sent to the markets wherever decent prices are offered. Bulk transport also helps reduce the expenditure. FPOs are distributing the dividend among the member farmers,” he said.  Organic farming Now, the FPOs are focussing on organic farming to minimise the farming expenditure. For instance, the farmers were spending nearly Rs. 18,000 per acre in paddy cultivation under conventional methods in which usage of fertilizers and pesticides were compulsory and the actual income was around Rs. 35, 000 per acre. Now, many farmers are being trained in organic farming methods. “Our expenditure has come down to Rs. 8,000 per acre after we adopted organic farming methods. The demand for organic paddy is also more,” said B. Anand and Lova Suryanarayana, farmers of Patapatnam. BREDS Secretary V. Sambamurthy said that the farmers are being trained in agriculture byproducts. “Dry fruits and honey are in much demand after the coronavirus outbreak. We are trained farmers in packing and preservation techniques too,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fpos-help-srikakulam-farmers-get-decent-prices-for-produce/article32738120.ece
01 October 2020||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bad roads prove a bane for motorists||Illegal quarrying and transport of mining material in heavy vehicles have become a bane for thousands of people living in Laveru, Ranasthalam, Tekkali, Santabommali and surrounding mandals. The Panchayat Rraj Department laid roads a couple of years ago in many routes including Bejjipuram-Bontalapeta of Laveru mandal of Srikakulam district. The roads’ condition is also horrible in several places including Mettavalasa, Rowthupeta-Ravada, and other villages of Srikakulam district. According to sources, many contractors are supplying gravel for the extension of National Highway between Pydibhimavaram-Narasannapeta stretch. “Many contractors are close to political circles and because of it, the Panchayat Raj Department is also silent in spite of heavy damage to roads. Their condition is horrible during rainy days,” said a teacher who met with an accident due to many potholes on the Bejjipuram-Bontalapeta-Mettavalasa route. Illegal quarries According to locals, as many as ten accidents take place and many two wheeler drivers became victims. Jana Sena Party Tekkali in-charge Kaniti Kiran urged the district administration to take action against all illegal quarries. “Many stone crushing units and quarries ignore safety norms. They have been using heavy explosion material. It leads to damage of many houses in Kakarapalli and surrounding areas of Santabommali mandal. There is no check on movement of heavy vehicles in the rural areas,” he added. He said that JSP would bring the issue to the notice of Collector J. Nivas since villagers turn victims of road accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bad-roads-prove-a-bane-for-motorists/article32738082.ece
01 October 2020||T. Appala NaiduKAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kotaiah family to apply for GI tag for ‘Kakinada kaja’||The family of Chittipeddi Kotaiah is all set to apply for Geographical Indications Registry’s (GIR) tag for ‘Kakinada kaja’, a unique sweet of Andhra Pradesh being made and promoted by the family since 1891 in Kakinada town of East Godavari district. The Kotaiah family claims that it had migrated from Chinna Parimi village in Guntur district in 1891 and was engaged in production of the sugary delicacy since then, using four prime ingredients — maida, besan, ghee and sugar. “Having a glorious tradition of 129 years in the production of the sweet, our family is determined to apply for the GI tag. We are geared up for the application process by documenting the history of our family and association with the trade and promotion of the sweet. In recent years, some people have started production of ‘Kotaiah kaja’ in various cities to exploit the market for it. However, we do not wish to go for legal battle against them,” Chittipeddi Ram Kumar, 38, told The Hindu . Mr. Kumar runs the store set up by the founder in Kakinada. He has taken upon himself the responsibility of taking forward the family’s legacy in the history of the sweet after his father, Ch. Rama Krishna, died in 2009. The Kotaiah family owns four stores in the State —three in Kakinada and one in Rajamahendravaram — geographically limiting the production and trade only to East Godavari district. Challenges “In recent years, our family witnessed a few challenges from various sections of people, who attempted to tap the brand image and demand for it by wooing our chefs for its authenticity. However, they have failed as people from across the State prefer the kaja from our stores,” said Mr. Kumar, the fifth-generation member of the Kotaiah family. Mr. Kumar cites lack of awareness and flourishing trade as the prime reasons for which his ancestors did not find the need to obtain the GI Tag for the sweet. “We never received any support from the respective governments to begin the exercise of obtaining the GI Tag to protect the delicacy from any exploitation. Being non-literate, my father was ignorant of the GI Tag. The maximum support received from the State government to promote the sweet is to get a space in various exhibitions,” adds Mr. Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kotaiah-family-to-apply-for-gi-tag-for-kakinada-kaja/article32738107.ece

01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Renovated Bapu Museum to be inaugurated by CM today||The renovated Bapu Museum is all set for re-opening by Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Thursday. “Using latest technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality, digital display panel and an immersive projection theatre, we have transformed the museum into an interactive space,” said G. Vani Mohan, Commissioner, Archaeology and Museums, at a press conference on Wednesday. She said that the 1,500 antiquities at the museum, belonging to different eras from 10,00,000 BC to the 19th century, would be used to promote heritage and culture education. The displays include pre, proto and early historical objects, Jain and Buddha sculptures, pottery, plaques, beads and bangles, iron implements, coins, inscriptions, textiles, paintings and celadon ware, among other things. The nine galleries are categorised under pre- and early historic gallery, Jain and Buddhist gallery, Hindu sculptures, epigraphy, numismatic, textile, painting, medieval century prospective and arms and weapons galleries. A project mapping with a theme ‘Glories of Andhra’ had been developed to educate the younger generations about the culture and heritage of the Andhra land. Ms. Vani Mohan said that the cabinets were furnished with Korean sheets for greater life, longevity and a fine look. There are four interactive cabinet displays on Buddhism and Jainism, temples in Andhra Pradesh, forts and monuments and excavations and epigraphy. A 16-feet digital interactive wall panel will serve as a one-stop place to know all about the antiquities in the museum. The automatic scroll and display of the 1,500 exhibits at a time and detailed information on them along with historical nuggets is a highlight. Novel initiatives The Commissioner said use of Augmented Reality for sculptures in a museum was the first of its kind initiative in the country. “One can hear the images speak by scanning them on their smartphones. So is the case with VR (Virtual Reality) technology, which will allow visitors to experience real environment in a more immersive way,” she said. A digital book, yet another first of its kind initiative, displays the top 10 Buddhist heritage sites in the world using a projector. Besides, there is an interactive kiosk with questions and answers awaiting visitors at the end of their journey. She said visitors will have the privilege to participate in a quiz and a certificate of appreciation would be given to the participants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/renovated-bapu-museum-to-be-inaugurated-by-cm-today/article32737312.ece

The works will begin on Thursday. They interacted with local shop owners and hawkers and told them that the works would be completed in time without causing much trouble to them. However, they were asked to cooperate with the authorities. Officials said that fabricated concrete moulds would be used to cover the ground instead of CC road and drainages would be constructed only during night time so that shoppers would not face inconvenience. The entire stretch of Besant Road between Eluru Road and Bandar Road would be transformed into a pedestrian-friendly stretch and all the hawkers and other vendors would be provided sufficient space, officials said. Mr. Vishnu asked hawkers not to leave their pushcarts on the road during the night so that works can be carried out without any hurdles. Later, they also inspected Raghavaiah Park and enquired the staff about the ongoing civil works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/work-on-transformation-of-besant-road-to-begin-today/article32738222.ece

01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||APSRTC takes freight route to stay afloat in COVID times||Despite reducing the volume of bus services due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, the AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has managed to stay afloat by relying on its cargo services. The APSRTC evolved dedicated freight corridors to augment cargo services and the move is yielding encouraging result, according to its Executive Director (Operations) K. Brahmananda Reddy. The cargo sector has never disappointed the RTC officials who have been seeing a steady growth in the volume of business, thanks to the wide connectivity. To further expand services, the officials held a series of meetings with government departments and suggested that they could rely on their buses for safe and timely transport of goods. The corporation also re-fabricated some of its buses as dedicated goods carrying vehicles with a GPS live tracking facility. “We have taken contracts from government wings such as AP Seeds Development Corporation. Currently, we are operating these Departmental Goods Transport (DGT) vehicles in 14 select routes identified in high network corridors,” says Mr. Reddy, adding that the dedicated corridors are fetching Rs. 40 Earnings Per Km (EPK) to the organisation. The routes have been evolved after a careful study based on the data sourced from the booking orders in the last one year. Profitable routes The 14 cargo routes identified from May to September this year are Vizianagaram-Guntur, Srikakulam-Guntur, Vijayawada-Rayadurgam, Kuppam-Vijayawada, Madanapalle-Vijayawada (all both directions), Chirala-Hyderabad, Tirupati-Hyderabad, Tirupati-Parrys and Chennai-Vijayawada. From May 19 to September 15, these cargo vehicles covered a distance of 5,92,738 km and delivered 2,63,827 parcels, which got the RTC a revenue of Rs. 2.37 crore. It translated to an EPK of Rs. 39.99. The APSRTC was earning Rs. 18-20 lakh per day while it was operating 45% of its vehicles and, interestingly, it earns the same amount today even after reducing the volume to 25%. The distance has also shrunk from 42 lakh km in the past to 12 lakh km now. “We had to bring down the volume of buses due to the pandemic but the revenue we earn has not changed because of the cargo sector going strong,” says Mr. Reddy. The RTC is developing a software to handle bulk bookings efficiently. City services The EPK for RTC buses in Vijayawada is Rs. 14 but in Visakhapatnam it is Rs. 21. “This is because the travel distance is more in Visakhapatnam city which is spread along the coastline,” says the official, informing that in terms of distance, the buses used to cover 4 lakh km per day in the past but from September 19, they have been covering only 1.4 lakh km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsrtc-takes-freight-route-to-stay-afloat-in-covid-times/article32738118.ece
01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Repatriate children staying in CCIs with families: NCPCR||The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has recently directed the State government to take measures for repatriation of eligible children staying in Child Care Institutions (CCIs) with their families. The Commission observed that the number of Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) staying in children homes (CCIs) are in excess numbers, posing a risk to their rights and protection, and are deprived of a natural home atmosphere and parental affection. The country’s apex child rights body noted that 1.84 lakh children (about 70%) are residing at CCIs in eight States, including Andhra Pradesh, out of a total of 2.56 lakh staying at children homes across the country. Women Development and Child Welfare (WD&CW) Director Krithika Shukla said that 27,243 children were residing in 894 CCIs in the State before the lockdown. As per the directions of the Supreme Court, and in view of the COVID-19 rules, the WD&CW Department directed the CCIs to close schools running on their premises and repatriate eligible children with their families or guardians. “At present, 2,675 children are staying at 265 government and private CCIs. Children who are orphans and could not be repatriated are residing in children homes,” Ms. Shukla said. Child rights activists allege that child labour, abuse in some children homes, minor marriages and child trafficking were high, and the laws and Acts aimed for protecting children were not being implemented properly in the State. “Due to poor coordination between Education, Endowments, Revenue, WD&CW and other departments, child marriages and child selling is rampant in the State. Some organisations are conducting meetings on implementation of related laws and sensitisation programmes just for the sake of formality and the resolutions are limited to paper,” an NGO representative fighting for child rights said. Worrying figures Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang, at a press conference held recently, said police rescued nearly 11,000 children under ‘Operation Muskaan’ in A.P. in the last four years. Many children who were separated from their families by being kidnapped and trafficked, or those who ran away from homes due to broken family conditions and poverty, were slogging at NGO homes, police officers who participated in the drive said. Crime Investigation Department (CID) Additional Director General P.V. Sunil Kumar, who monitored the drive, said that around 4,800 children, including 3,600 girls and 59 from other States, were rescued during the sixth phase of Operation Muskaan conducted in June this year. Commissioner (Labour) G. Rekha Rani, who participated in a meeting on child labour recently, said that steps are being taken to increase the number of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Schools, also known as Special Training Centres, in the State as the number of children engaged in child labour was high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/repatriate-children-staying-in-ccis-with-families-ncpcr/article32737319.ece
01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Congress seeks review of Babri verdict||The APCC on Wednesday sought a review of the Special CBI Court’s verdict on the demolition of Babri Masjid. The court acquitted senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani and 32 others in the case. In a statement, APCC president S. Sailajanath said, “If none is guilty, who had razed the ancient mosque to the ground?” “Of the 49 accused, 17 had died, and the remaining have been acquitted. In a verdict delivered 28 years after the incident took place on December 6, 1992, the CBI says there is no need for any witnesses,” Mr. Sailajanath said. Referring to the court’s ruling that the “demolition was a spontaneous act and not a pre-meditated conspiracy,” the Congress leader sought to know why did it take 28 years for the court to arrive at this conclusion. Black day: CPI In Anantapur, CPI national general secretary K. Narayana said, “Letting off the accused in the Babri Masjid case because the CBI does not have any evidence is a ‘black day’ for the justice delivery system, democracy, and secular principles of the country.” ‘Rape cases on the rise’ Mr. Sailajanath, in his statement, expressed anguish over the death of a Dalit girl, who was allegedly gang-raped at Hathras in U.P., while undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital. Demanding stringent action against the culprits, he said instances of rape were on the rise in U.P. “In A.P., atrocities against Dalits have increased,” he alleged. Signature campaign Meanwhile, APCC vice-president Gangadhar told the media in Vijayawada that the party would launch a signature campaign on October 2 against the Centre’s “anti-farmer policies” reflected in the three farm Acts. He said the YSRCP government was toeing the Modi government’s line by proposing to fix smart meters to agricultural power connections. Two-crore signatures would be collected from farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-seeks-review-of-babri-verdict/article32738111.ece
01 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anantapur chosen for banana farming project||In what could be a major boost to promotion of banana cultivation in the State, the Central government has selected Anantapur for a pilot project under Cluster Development programme. Theni in Tamil Nadu is another place in the country to be identified for the pilot project. According to information, the objective of the programme is to tap the vast potential of crops such as apple, mango, grapes, pineapple, pomegranate and turmeric apart from banana in the horticulture sector. The Union government wanted to address the issue of inadequate and fragmented supply chain. As part of it, the Centre has identified Anantapur for launching the project. Horticulture officials say that Andhra Pradesh has been selected for launching the pilot project in view of its achievements in banana cultivation and production. The State occupies the top slot in banana cultivation in the country. From a mere 79,360 hectare (ha) in 2015, the area under banana cultivation increased to 1,03,728 ha in 2018-19. The production touched 62,23,680 metric tonnes (mt) in 2018-19 from 34,87,308 mt in 2015. Holistic approach When contacted, Horticulture Commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary says the cluster will be developed in a holistic manner by providing linkage to domestic and export markets. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) will include both soft and hard intervention. Financial assistance would be provided as per the existing norms of the National Horticulture Board (NHB)/ Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for different project components, he says. Capacity building, export-oriented training and skill development for producers, processors and exporters will be taken up under the programme. The capacity building of farmers includes post-harvest management (PHM) practices comprising ripening, packaging and transport of produce commensurate to export requirements. Interventions by the State Agriculture and Horticulture Department, Food Processing Department and the concerned Central departments and ministries are required, he says. Key role for FPOs The government proposes to focus on leveraging the Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs) and creation of FPOs for aggregation and primary processing of produce at field level. Establishment of a model supply chain comprising ripening chambers, integrated pack houses, controlled atmosphere stores, reefer vehicles etc. as per requirements will also be taken up to ensure seamless backward and forward linkages. In a way, end-to-end solutions will be provided, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anantapur-chosen-for-banana-farming-project/article32738116.ece

01 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP decries non-payment of salaries to Simhachalam priests||The priests of Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Simhachalam were paid half salaries till August since the outbreak of COVID-19, and not at all paid since then. Similarly, suppliers of flowers and other material were also not paid their dues for several months, said former MLA and BJP leader P. Vishnu Kumar Raju. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Raju wondered as to how the Minister for Endowments and MLAs were getting their salaries on the 3rd of every month, when there was no money to pay the salaries of priests and to clear the dues of suppliers. Such a situation was not seen at the temple in the past. He suggested that the temple has fixed deposits to the tune of over Rs. 60 crore and temporary loans could be raised, if required, for payment of salaries. The BJP leader suggested that an emergency reserve fund could be set up with 20% of the revenue of the Endowments Department for use in emergencies. He recalled that the ancestors of hereditary trustees like P. Anand Gajapathi Raju and P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju had donated hundreds of acres of land to the temple. Referring to the tweets of Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy, who allegedly tried to portray BJP national general secretary D. Purandeswari in bad light, Mr. Raju said that Ms. Purandeswari was elected twice as MP in the past and had served as a Union Minister and was now an active BJP leader. He condemned the attitude of Mr. Reddy towards her. Commenting on the non-allotment of houses constructed for the poor under the 'Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna' in the past, he appealed to the State government to ensure their early completion and allotment to the beneficiaries without any further delay. Beach development BJP Parliamentary district president M. Raveendra said that the Centre had announced the development of Rushikonda Beach as a ‘Blue Flag’ beach and works were going on since long. Water purification, beach beautification and construction of toilets were done as part of the project. Similarly, Simhachalam temple was sanctioned Rs. 53 crore under the PRASAD scheme of the Government of India for development of pilgrim amenities, transport facilities and power generation apart from promotion of local art and culture. These activities were designed to promote local employment. He said that the Centre wants a committee of the heads of religious organisations to decide on the works to be taken up under the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-decries-non-payment-of-salaries-to-simhachalam-priests/article32738230.ece

01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP demands EVMs for GHMC polls||Telangana BJP has appealed to the State Election Commission to ensure that the forthcoming elections to the GHMC is conducted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) instead of ballot papers/boxes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In a memorandum presented to State Election Commissioner Parthasarathi on Tuesday, a delegation of the party led by general secretary G. Premander Reddy, city president N. Ramchander Rao and others informed that resorting to ballot papers/boxes will not only be a logistical challenge but will require more personnel, hence reducing the chances of social distancing while also making it tough for sanitisation. In the case of EVM, voters can be provided with gloves and hand sanitisers can be kept near the machine for use as soon as the required poll symbol button is pressed. The Election Commission has decided to make use of EVMs for the Bihar elections as it is more convenient and easier to operate unlike the ballot papers/boxes where a lot of paperwork is to be handled. Use of EVMs will also prevent electoral mischief as they are standalone machines and results can be obtained sooner, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-demands-evms-for-ghmc-polls/article32737956.ece

Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar on Wednesday inaugurated the 13-KV LOT installed at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh under the aegis of the Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMSIDC) on the hospital premises. The tank has the capacity of 13,000 litres of liquid oxygen equivalent to 1,400 oxygen cylinders, sources said. Once filled, it will help maintain a reserve stock of oxygen and facilitate uninterrupted oxygen supply through the internal pipeline system to the COVID-19 ward, Intensive Care Units and ‘Mata-Sishu Kendram’ at the hospital for nine days continuously, sources said. Thanks to the initiative of Collector R.V. Karnan, the long-awaited facility has become a reality at a time when the demand for oxygen has increased multifold amid the pandemic. Last month, the demand for oxygen exceeded the supply in several hospitals in the district as the authorised private suppliers struggled to cope with the surge in demand for the life saving gas for a couple of days, when the COVID-19 cases surged suddenly. Timely intervention of the district administration helped improve the supply of oxygen cylinders in the last couple of weeks. Speaking after inaugurating the tank at the hospital here on Wednesday, Mr Ajay said the facility will help ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen to cater to the requirements of needy patients at the hospital round-the-clock. Khammam district headquarters hospital is the second government healthcare facility in the State to get the LOT after Siddipet district, he added.  Once filled, it will facilitate uninterrupted oxygen supply through the internal pipeline system to the COVID ward, ICU and Mata-Sishu Kendram at the hospital for nine days continuously.

01 October 2020||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||By-poll: TRS eyeing voters of reservoir submerging villages||During elections every vote counts. As the schedule for Dubbak Assembly by-election was announced by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been focusing on voters in submerging villages under Mallannasagar. Except Erravalli and Singaram in Kondapaka mandal, all other villages submerging in the reservoir will fall under Toguta, which is one of the mandals under Dubbak constituency. On Tuesday, sarpanch of Pallepahad in Toguta mandal along with his supporters met Finance Minister T. Harish Rao at his residence at Siddipet and joined the party. It was stated that he was with BJP in the past. The presence of large number of activists participating in the programme created an impression that even voters in submerging villages are with the ruling party. A few days ago, sarpanch of a submerging village reportedly met Mr. Harish Rao and tied a rakhi to him. He requested the Minister to address some problems, including HT power lines being faced by the oustees in the newly established locality by them. The Minister assured to look into the issue. Villages that are submerging include Etigaddakishtapur (Lambadi tanda and Tiruamalagiri hamlets), Vemulaghat (Turkabanjerpally), Pallepahad (Dastagiri Nagaram and Nagaram Tanda), Laksmapur, Rampur (Vaddera colony), Brahamana Banjerpally, Toguta and Tukkapur. However, in Toguta and Tukkapur, only land are being lost by farmers while villages will be intact. “There are several problems in submerging villages, including oustees yet to get compensation. Elected representatives are luring public that money will be released only if TRS is voted to power,” said an oustee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/by-poll-trs-eyeing-voters-of-reservoir-submerging-villages/article32738157.ece

01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Activists take to streets, seek justice for Hathras rape victim||Protests erupted across the national capital for the second consecutive day, following the death of the Hathras gangrape victim, with students, women activists and political outfits taking to the streets demanding justice for the 19-year-old woman. Protests began outside Uttar Pradesh Bhawan here, demanding the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the rising atrocities against women and Dalits in the State. They said that the rape of the Hathras victim, a Dalit woman, was not an isolated incident and that under the regime of the BJP government life had turned into a nightmare for women and Dalits. Allege harassment Members from the AISA, the AIPWA, the Indian Youth Congress, the Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress and other activists had gathered at the venue. Some activists managed to stage a candle light vigil at India Gate later in the evening but were detained later. Members of the AISA and other activists alleged that the Delhi police detained women after 6 p.m. and that they were forcefully removed from the spot and that women protesters were harassed. “All students and activists were forcefully detained and taken to Mandir Marg police station where the protests continued,” AISA Delhi State secretary Prasenjeet Kumar said. Indian Youth Congress national president Srinivas B.V. said, it was unfortunate that the victim did not get a proper funeral, instead she only got humiliation. “As the protesters have violated orders under Section 144 CrPC in force and other laws regarding COVID-19, an FIR under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant sections of the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act has been registered against the protesters in both the instances, the police said. Thirty-two male protesters have been detained for illegal protest near Mansingh Road, the police added. “The protesters belonged to the AISA and the Bhim Army. Legal action under relevant sections of law is being taken,” said Additional DCP (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav.

The whole episode is very painful,” said AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet on Wednesday. In another development, AAP MLA Ajay Dutt alleged that he was beaten up by three Delhi Police officers when he was enquiring about the Hathras victim on Tuesday at Safdarjung Hospital in the city. Addressing the media, the AAP MLA requested Home Minister Amit Shah that the three officers should be suspended. “I stood beside the Dalit family of Hathras. Is it a crime to be a Dalit?” he said. Caste slurs “The SHO, ACP and DCP all three manhandled and assaulted me at the Safdarjung Hospital. The DCP slapped me and kicked me as well. They also used caste slurs against me. The way the police behaved with an elected representative is unfortunate. The police also denied the family of the survivor to see the body and also did not allow them to participate in the last rites,” Mr. Dutt said. AAP Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said that FIRs should be registered against these three police officers. The Minister said that the Hathras case should be investigated by CBI in a time-bound manner. “The trial of the case should be done by a fasttrack. Also, Rs. 2 crore compensation should be given to the family of the victim,” Mr. Gautam said. Meanwhile, Dalit leaders of the Congress party lashed out at the U.P. government for allowing the police to cremate the victim in violation of Dalit rituals without informing her parents.

01 October 2020||New Delhi,||Incentive for not burning stubble unviable: EPCA||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, in a report submitted to the top court, said that giving an incentive of Rs. 100 per quintal of paddy to farmers for not burning stubble may not be a “viable” option. “After deliberations it was found that inclusion of cost of stubble removal in MSP may not be a viable option. It has been agreed that any such incentive, if at all necessary, should be provided by the State government from their own budget,” the report said. The report said that efforts should be to give them machines for straw management. “While there is a demand for additional funds to be paid to farmers for doing stubble management, but as this could be a perverse incentive it may not be advisable. Therefore, the funds already provided and the plan that exists should be implemented this season and in the coming period. The effort must be to ensure that farmers have easy and affordable access to the machines which allow them to do smart straw management,” the report further said. In 2019, Haryana had given incentives of Rs. 1.63 crore to farmers for not burning stubble. Similarly, Punjab had given Rs. 28.51 crore to farmers. But for this year, Punjab has sought funds from the Centre for the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/incentive-for-not-burning-stubble-unviable-epca/article32737934.ece

The Centre had last week advanced Kharif paddy procurement, allowing operations to begin on September 26, instead of the scheduled date of October 1, but the farmers in Haryana alleged that the procurement was yet to begin. Additional Chief Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, P.K. Das, did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a response on the matter. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains claimed that farmers in Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, Ambala and Panchkula staged protests outside the grains market and blocked roads. Demands BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni told The Hindu over the phone that the farmers were demanding to raise the moisture content limit for procurement to 22%. “Since the farmers do not have space to dry paddy before bringing it to the grains market, we have been demanding that the government procure those with higher moisture content. We are also ready for price cut as per the moisture content. The government has agreed to marginally increase the moisture content limit to 18-19% from the 17%, but it is not enough,” said Mr. Charuni, who also addressed the agitating farmers at Pehowa and Ismailabad in Kurukshetra. He also demanded that the farmers be allowed to bring their crops to the market as per their convenience soon after it is harvested, instead of the government imposing a schedule on them. He alleged that the government has yet to start the procurement, causing resentment among the farmers. Sandeep Beniwal, commission agent, Samalkha New Grains Market, said a few farmers gathered to stage a protest in the mandi against the delay in procurement. “Though farmers are bringing the paddy for the past few days, the procurement is yet to begin,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-farmers-protest-outside-grain-markets/article32737942.ece

01 October 2020||Washington,||Trump, Biden clash in chaotic first debate||U.S. President Donald Trump and his opponent, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, clashed in their first presidential debate on Tuesday night — an interaction characterised by chaos and acrimony, not seen before in recent debate history. This was caused primarily by Mr. Trump repeatedly talking over Mr. Biden, interrupting him and attempting to commandeer the debate from the moderator. During the debate, Mr. Trump failed to denounce White supremacists when provided an opportunity to do so and sought to undermine the legitimacy of the November elections, in which an unusually high number of Americans are expected to vote by mail, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When he was asked to condemn White supremacism and armed militias, specifically the Proud Boys — a group of men who call themselves “western chauvinists” — Mr. Trump said, “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by! But I’ll tell you what... somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left.” Members of the group celebrated the comment on social media. Mr. Trump repeatedly tried to throw Mr. Biden off balance, including by insinuating that Mr. Biden was controlled by the “radical left” or by bringing his son Hunter Biden — whose relationship with the government of Ukraine had been questioned by Republicans during the Trump impeachment hearings — into the discussion. ‘Putin’s puppy’ The debate had frequent acrimonious exchanges, with Mr. Biden visibly frustrated by Mr. Trump’s interruptions. At one point, Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump a “clown” and at another, said, “Will you shut up, man?” He also called Mr. Trump, “Putin’s puppy”, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Biden’s intelligence at one point. “Show us your tax returns,” Mr. Biden said when Mr. Trump was asked if he paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 as reported by the New York Times . Mr. Trump challenged Mr. Biden to say “law and order”. Mr. Biden said it but also said, “with justice where people are treated fairly”. In recent months, the U.S. has witnessed mass protests set off by police killings and violence against African Americans. Some of these have been violent. Mr. Biden has supported the right to protests but has condemned the violence. Mr. Trump, keen to win the suburban women demographic, repeated a claim — one with racist undertones — that the Democrats under Mr. Biden were out to destroy suburbs. “He wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn,” Mr. Biden said. “This is not 1950... all these dog whistles and racism don’t work any more.” Mr. Trump, who has been making unsubstantiated claims on fraud around mail-in ballots, was asked by the debate moderator, Chris Wallace, if he would urge his supporters to stay calm and not engage in “civil unrest” as the election was being decided. The President used the opportunity to once more cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election. He also urged poll-watchers to go into the polls and “watch very carefully”, and said the Supreme Court would need to look at the ballots. “I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election, I am a 100% on board,” Mr. Trump said. “But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that.” There is no evidence of mail-in voting being a source of significant election fraud. Republican and Democrat-run States use the process and Mr. Trump has used it personally to cast his vote in the past. From time to time in the debate, Mr. Biden looked directly at the cameras and addressed the American public. He said Mr. Trump was trying to dissuade people from voting by scaring them into thinking their vote was not going to be legitimate. “Show up and vote... you will determine the outcome of this election... He [Mr. Trump] cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election,” he said. Mr. Biden said voters had the power to choose between changing the country or getting “four more years of these lies.” Comments on India India received two mentions in the debate — along with U.S. rivals China and Russia. On India, China and Russia, Mr. Trump said the number of COVID-19 deaths was unknown because “they don’t exactly give you a straight count”. Mr. Trump clubbed India with Russia and China again during a segment on pollution. “China sends up real into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-biden-clash-in-chaotic-first-debate/article32737219.ece
01 October 2020||Yerevan,||As fighting rages on, Armenia, Azerbaijan reject talks||Armenia and Azerbaijan rejected international calls for negotiations and a halt to fighting as fierce clashes over the disputed region of Nagorny Karabakh spilled over into a fourth day on Wednesday. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces are engaged in the heaviest fighting in years over Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian province that broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s during the collapse of the Soviet Union. The conflict erupted on Sunday with the two sides trading heavy fire. Nearly 100 people are confirmed to have died in the flare-up and both sides are claiming to have inflicted heavy losses on opposing forces. Azerbaijan has not admitted any military deaths but an AFP journalist in the southern Beylagan region saw dozens of women wailing over the coffin of a soldier killed in the clashes. Azerbaijan on Wednesday vowed to pursue military action against Armenian separatists in the Nagorny Karabakh region until a full Armenian withdrawal from the disputed territory. There has been increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, as fears grow that the conflict could escalate into a devastating all-out war and draw in regional powers like Turkey and Russia. Defence officials in Yerevan on Wednesday accused Turkish jets of performing “provocative flights” along their shared border and of violating Armenia airspace, a day after Yerevan said a Turkish jet had downed one of its warplanes. Moscow has called for an end to the fighting and offered to help with talks. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday condemned what he called Turkey’s “reckless and dangerous” statements backing Baku, saying they “remove any inhibitions from Azerbaijan”. Ankara said on Tuesday it was “fully ready” to help Azerbaijan recover Nagorny Karabakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-fighting-rages-on-armenia-azerbaijan-reject-talks/article32737209.ece
01 October 2020||Berlin,||German Chancellor accuses China of ‘cruel treatment’ of minorities||German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday accused China of “poor and cruel treatment” of minorities and underlined deep concerns over the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. In a speech at the Bundestag a day before an EU summit, Ms. Merkel vowed to bring up rights issues and Germany’s worries over the situation in the former British colony in any future dialogue with Beijing. “Of course we have to bring up our different opinions in talks,” said Ms. Merkel, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. “That’s why we have flagged up our deep concern about the development in Hong Kong. The principle of one country, two systems stands but again and again it’s being undermined. “We will bring that up, as well as the poor and cruel treatment in part of the rights of the minorities in China.” She did not name the minorities bearing the brunt of poor treatment but activists have accused China over the mass internment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. More than one million ethnic Uighurs and other minorities have been herded into internment camps to undergo political indoctrination, according to rights groups and experts. China insists the camps are training centres aimed at providing education to reduce the allure of Islamic radicalism. Beijing is also under fire over a security law it imposed on Hong Kong in June that radically increased its control over the financial hub and led to a brutal crackdown on dissent. Hong Kong was guaranteed autonomy under the “One Country, Two Systems” deal agreed ahead of its 1997 handover from Britain. But critics say the security law, imposed following months of large and often violent protests calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability, spells the end of the agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/german-chancellor-accuses-china-of-cruel-treatment-of-minorities/article32737214.ece
01 October 2020||Kuwait City,||Sheikh Nawaf takes oath as Kuwait Emir||Kuwait’s Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was sworn in before Parliament on Wednesday as the ruling Emir of the tiny oil-rich country, propelled to power by the death of his half-brother after a long career in the security services. Sheikh Nawaf, 83, is not expected to deviate from the diplomatic path charted by his predecessor, the late Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah. But his accession touched off speculation about who will become the next crown prince in the country known for its lively elected Parliament and relative independence in the neighbourhood of Gulf Arab monarchies. The late Sheikh Sabah, 91, made his final journey to Kuwait later on Wednesday, his remains flying back to Kuwait City from Rochester, Minnesota, where he had been receiving medical treatment after surgery. Although his funeral would ordinarily draw tens of thousands of Kuwaiti mourners and scores of foreign leaders and dignitaries, because of the coronavirus pandemic the burial was restricted to relatives, Kuwait’s state-run news agency KUNA reported. Yet Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, came to pay his respects, alongside an Emirati official, underscoring the late ruler’s deft navigation of the region’s stark political divides. The breadth and depth of emotion over the loss of Sheikh Sabah, known for his diplomacy and peacemaking, was reflected in condolence messages that streamed in from countries on opposite ends of regional feuds, from Saudi Arabia to Iran and Qatar. Calls for unity Sheikh Nawaf took office as the new ruler of Kuwait in the Parliament building before rows of applauding lawmakers. “Kuwait throughout its history has seen serious and tough challenges, which we have succeeded in overcoming through cooperating together,” said Sheikh Nawaf, reading from prepared remarks. “Today, our dear country also faces risky circumstances and difficulties that there is no way to bypass except through unity.” The challenges are manifold. Gridlock in Parliament has blocked the passage of a public debt law needed to raise $65 billion and mitigate the country’s looming liquidity crisis. A major credit agency last week downgraded Kuwait for the first time in its history, citing the government’s swelling budget deficit. Plunging oil prices amid the pandemic have robbed the wealthy country of cash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sheikh-nawaf-takes-oath-as-kuwait-emir/article32737212.ece
01 October 2020||Rome,||Pompeo urges Pope to show ‘courage’ over China||U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived a spat with the Vatican on Wednesday during a visit to Rome, calling on the Pope to take a stand against China on religious freedom. Mr. Pompeo is not meeting Pope Francis because the pontiff avoids such audiences in campaign periods, a Vatican source said. Analysts say the Pope has been angered by Mr. Pompeo’s public calls for a historic Vatican-China accord to be scrapped. Instead, Mr. Pompeo spoke at a symposium organised by the Holy See’s U.S. Embassy, where he renewed an appeal for the Vatican to take a stand against China. “Nowhere is religious freedom under assault more than in China,” said Mr. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian. “I call on every faith leader to find the courage to confront religious persecution,” he said Mr. Pompeo had gone on the offensive earlier this month, calling a Sino-Vatican 2018 agreement on appointing bishops, which is up for renewal, a risk to the church’s “moral authority” given Beijing’s human rights record. Pope Francis has been working hard to repair ties with China and the Vatican has not appreciated Mr. Pompeo’s public interference. Mr. Pompeo also met Italy's PM Giuseppe Conte to discuss U.S. efforts to deter allies from using equipment made by Huawei in developing their 5G networks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pompeo-urges-pope-to-show-courage-over-china/article32737218.ece

A court in the central Chinese province of Henan said Wang Yun put sodium nitrite into porridge being prepared for her colleague’s students, sickening 25. The attack took place in March 2019 and left one boy severely ill for months before he died in January this year, according to news reports. The court on Monday said Wang knew sodium nitrite was harmful but went ahead “with no regard for the consequences”, leaving many innocent children in hospital. It was not the first time Wang used sodium nitrite to poison someone, authorities said. In 2017, she put it in her husband’s mug, causing him minor injuries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/death-penalty-for-teacher-who-poisoned-pupils/article32737210.ece

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Time to shift focus to the maritime sphere||For a country that has been traditionally obsessed with a continental approach to war and peace, India’s continental ‘grand’ strategy is facing an existential crisis today. Given that reconciliation with its key adversaries, China and Pakistan, is unlikely at this point and pursuing its ambitious territorial claims on the ground is almost impossible, New Delhi’s continental options seem restricted to holding operations to prevent further territorial loss. Put differently, New Delhi’s grand strategic plans in the continental space may have reached a dead end. State of continental strategy The current state of India’s continental strategies is hardly flattering. China has begun to push the boundaries with India, quite literally so, and Beijing is neither keen on ending the ongoing border stalemate nor reinstating the status quo with India as of March 2020. The peaceful India-China Line of Actual Control in the Northeast is now a thing of the past with China pushing back New Delhi’s claims on Aksai Chin and New Delhi defending against Beijing’s expansive territorial claims and their slow but aggressive implementation. China has crossed the red line with India and India’s LAC with China is not going to be the same ever again: It is the beginning of a long, bitter winter in the Himalayan borders between the two Asian giants. In the Northwest, the Pakistan front has also been heating up. Ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC) have spiked since last year as has the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC. With the change of the status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) by New Delhi in 2019, and Pakistan altering its political map a few months ago to include all of J&K, the India-Pakistan contestation over Kashmir has become fiercer. Equally important is the geopolitical collusion between Islamabad and Beijing to contain and pressure New Delhi from both sides. While this is not a new phenomenon, the intensity of the China-Pakistan containment strategy against India today is unprecedented. The extent and intent behind this collusion will determine the future of the high stakes game in the Himalayas for a long time to come. Changes in Afghanistan The ongoing withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan (the loss of a friend in the region for New Delhi, and the consequent reduction of India’s influence in Afghanistan) and the return of the Taliban, with whom India has very little contact, could turn the geopolitical tide against New Delhi — similar to the situation in the early 1990s. But unlike in the 1990s, tables have turned in Afghanistan: the Taliban is no more an outcaste, and with the withdrawal of forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from Afghanistan, the geopolitical interests of Pakistan, China and Russia would broadly converge in the region. The change of the geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan and the frictions in Iran-India relations will further dampen India’s ‘Mission Central Asia’. In sum, this is perhaps the end of the road for New Delhi’s north-eastern and north-western geopolitical forays. For sure, India needs to find a way out of this situation. One key part of the solution is to creatively deal with its continental dilemmas. To begin with, New Delhi must seek ways to break up the ‘nutcracker situation’ that the Pakistani and Chinese strategies have forced India into. To do so, India would need to deal with the comparatively easier part first — the Pakistan front. Pressure from the Pakistan front could be eased by addressing the Kashmir question with Islamabad. Creating a modicum of normalcy on the LoC by activating existing mechanisms such as the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) hotline is another way to deal with the Pakistan front. However, there is little appetite in New Delhi to do so. So, unless there is political will in New Delhi to put in place a strategy to address the Pakistan front, there will be little respite from the nutcracker situation that it faces today. And yet, it is time for New Delhi to think beyond its continental fixation. Maritime strategy explained It appears abundantly clear now that New Delhi’s excessive focus on the continental sphere since Independence has not yielded great returns in terms of secure borders, healthy relations with its neighbours or deterrence stability vis-à-vis adversaries. If so, it is time for India to change its grand strategic approach — by shifting its almost exclusive focus from the continental sphere to the maritime sphere. Clearly, New Delhi has already begun to think in this direction with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) establishing a new division to deal with the Indo-Pacific in April 2019. The work in this direction, both ideational and practical, needs to be fast-tracked to keep pace with the emerging realities and to make use of new opportunities. There are several reasons why a maritime grand strategy would work to India’s advantage while still struggling with a continental dilemma. To begin with, unlike in the continental sphere where India seems to be hemmed in by China-Pakistan collusion, the maritime sphere is wide open to India to undertake coalition building, rule setting, and other forms of strategic exploration. Visualise this: while India seems stuck between Pakistan and China from a continental perspective, the country is located right at the centre of the Indo-Pacific geopolitical imagination, in the midst of the oceanic space spanning “from the shores of Africa to that of the Americas”, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi put it at the Shangri La Dialogue two years ago, on June 1, 2018 (https://bit.ly/30kdRHg). Second, unlike in the continental sphere, there is a growing great power interest in the maritime sphere, especially with the arrival of the concept of ‘Indo-Pacific’. The Euro-American interest in India’s land borders with Pakistan and China is negligible, and more so, there is little any country can do to help India in its continental contestations. The situation in the maritime sphere is the exact opposite: great powers remain ever more interested in the maritime sphere and this interest has grown substantially since the coinage of Indo-Pacific. For instance, Germany recently released its Indo-Pacific guidelines following the example of France which brought out its Indo-Pacific strategy last year. Third, Beijing’s bullying behaviour in the South China Sea in particular and the region in general has generated a great deal of willingness among the Euro-American powers and the countries of the region, including Australia and Japan, to push back Chinese unilateralism. This provides New Delhi with a unique opportunity to enhance its influence and potentially checkmate the Chinese ambitions in the region. Finally, the maritime space is a lot more important to China than engaging in opportunistic land grab attempts in the Himalayas, thanks to the massive Chinese trade that happens via the Oceanic routes and the complex geopolitics around the maritime chokepoints which can potentially disrupt that trade. A revitalised Indian maritime grand strategy may or may not checkmate China in the Himalayas; it may even prompt Beijing to increase pressure there. But it will certainly provide New Delhi a lot more space for manoeuvre in the region and message Beijing that its Himalayan adventure could become costly for it. New Delhi must use its Indo-Pacific engagements to dissuade Beijing from salami-slicing Indian territory in the high Himalayas. Think beyond a division Therefore, it is high time New Delhi shifted its almost exclusive focus from the continental space to the maritime space, stitching together a maritime grand strategy. The MEA’s Indo-Pacific Division is a good beginning; so is the decision in 2019 to elevate the Quad meetings among India, Japan, the United States and Australia to the ministerial level. New Delhi would do well to ideate on the current and future maritime challenges, consolidate its military and non-military tools, engage its strategic partners, and publish a comprehensive vision document on the Indo-Pacific; the current ‘Indo-Pacific Division Briefs’ document put out by the MEA does not make the cut. More so, New Delhi should consider appointing a special envoy for Indo-Pacific affairs. The Asian geopolitical chessboard awaits bold moves by New Delhi.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||On the Quad, define the idea, chart a path||It is reported that the second Ministerial meeting of the four countries under the Quad will be held in Japan. Sadly, the person who conceived this idea, Shinzō Abe, has stepped down as the Prime Minister of Japan. Mr. Abe was a strategic thinker who thought beyond the limited timeframe of Japanese revolving-door politics. In 2007, the Quad (the United States, Japan, India, and Australia) was an idea whose time had not yet come. That was a different world. An evolution The global financial crisis was still lurking in the shadows as America continued to enjoy its ‘unipolar moment’. The American establishment still believed that it could, somehow, persuade China to become a ‘responsible stake-holder’ and, in any case, required Chinese goodwill in dealing with America’s priorities — the nuclear issue with North Korea and Iran, and the War on Terror. Japan and Australia were riding the China Boom to prosperity. If India was ambivalent at the time, it was because this mirrored the uncertainties of others. China’s shrill reaction to the idea of four like-minded countries establishing a plurilateral platform was, prima facie , intriguing. The idea was barely on the table; there was no clearly enunciated concept or proposed structures, much less joint understandings. The Chinese, however, labelled it as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It became evident years later that the real reason for China’s hyperreaction was out of concern that such a grouping would “out” China’s plans for naval expansion by focusing on the Indo-Pacific maritime space. China was hoping that its naval build-up might slip under the radar because the Americans were distracted by continental challenges including Russia, Afghanistan and Iran, and would not look sea-ward. Once the idea of Quad 1.0 had died down, China gained in confidence to reveal its hand. It advanced a new claim — the Nine-Dash Line — in the South China Sea; it undertook the rapid kind of warship building activity reminiscent of Wilhelmine Germany before 1914; it built its first overseas base in Djibouti; and it started systematically to explore the surface and sub-surface environment in the Indian Ocean beyond the Malacca Straits. This entire activity was coordinated by a Central Leading Small Group for Protecting Maritime Rights and Interests, established in 2012. The manner of China’s dismissal of the Arbitral Award in the dispute with the Philippines on the South China Sea and its brazen militarisation of the islands after its President had publicly pronounced to the contrary, has once again brought the four countries onto the same page and given a second chance to the Quad. A plurilateral mechanism The Chinese are skilled at obfuscation. They will, perhaps, endeavour to conflate the Quad with the Indo-Pacific vision, and link both to the so-called China Containment Theory. The Quad nations need to better explain that the Indo-Pacific Vision is an overarching framework that is being discussed in a transparent manner, with the objective of advancing everyone’s economic and security interests. The Quad, on the other hand, is a plurilateral mechanism between countries that share interest on specific matters. There are other such mechanisms in the region. In 2016, China itself established a Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan and, more recently earlier this year, another one with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal. The Quad is no exception.  The world today This time around, the four countries are navigating through more turbulent waters. The global pandemic and the faltering global economy are taking a toll on the region’s growth and prosperity. The two major Pacific powers (China and America), are moving into a more adversarial phase of their relationship. Public opinion about China in all four countries is different from what it used to be in 2007. The fact of the meeting itself will signal to China that assertive or aggressive behaviour is not going to derail this mechanism. The forthcoming Ministerial meeting will be an opportunity to define the idea and chart a future path. Needless provocation of China should be avoided. There is no gain in actions that anger the Chinese with no commensurate benefit to the others. In a recent address to the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on August 31, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Stephen Biegun, spoke about making sure that all the countries were moving at the same speed. This is an important statement because a plurilateral mechanism should also serve national interest. He also suggested that other countries might be invited to join in the future. This too is welcome; India has many other partners in the Indo-Pacific. Reaching out A positive agenda built around collective action in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, monitoring shipping for search and rescue or anti-piracy operations, infrastructure assistance to climatically vulnerable states, connectivity initiatives and similar activities, will re-assure the littoral States that the Quad will be a factor for regional benefit, and a far cry from Chinese allegations that it is some sort of a military alliance. An outreach to the Indian Ocean littoral states is especially important since there are motivated reports from some quarters suggesting that India is, somehow, seeking to deny access, or to create infrastructure that impedes the legitimate movement of some extra-regional countries through the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Abe had presciently said in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India on August 22, 2007 (https://bit.ly/2HFYS45) - “A ‘broader Asia’ that broke away geographical boundaries is now beginning to take on a distinct form.” It is the right time to realise Mr. Abe’s dreams.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The challenge of changing health behaviour||The role of health behaviour (our diet, physical activity, sleep, smoking, substance use, and so on) in public health practice needs special attention during an epidemic. The challenge is that the onus of altering health behaviour lies with the individuals who often don’t have the option of changing their livelihood. We see this during this pandemic. This demonstrates the failure of public health in internalising the knowledge about the social origins of human behaviour. Let’s examine four aspects of our response to COVID-19. Identifying ‘at risk’ sections The real skill of public health professionals during an epidemic is to identify those social groups which can be at greater risk to disease at any given point of time. The screening of those groups becomes efficient when the high-risk groups are identified and targeted for systematic surveillance to prevent potential spread of a disease. In other words, the real skill of public health surveillance is to pick up those who are at risk from a general population, even before they know that they are at risk. To know whether any group is at risk or not is possible only if we have a deep understanding of the society and its people and their livelihood-related behaviour of which health behaviour forms a part. It is this classic public health act of identifying an ‘at risk’ population that calls for an anthropological understanding of human lives for which understanding risky health behaviour becomes inevitable. Laboratory tests only categorise the population as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. These can be matched with those with risky health behaviour and non-risky health behaviour. These categories are further linked to their livelihood characteristics and are crucial for effective public health action. Any attempt to over-emphasise laboratory tests during an epidemic without capturing the health behaviour of people is actually putting the cart before the horse. This is what happens when very little is known about people, their occupation and health behaviour. Another related but crucial aspect of health behaviour is the significant linkage it has with the prevention of an epidemic. The primary purpose of public health action during an epidemic is to prevent the spread of a disease in the community. When laboratory tests that are meant for clinical practice become the starting point, and when guidelines state that only those with symptoms be tested, this does not help prevent the spread of the disease. This is because testing is done among those who already have symptoms and who have the potential to transmit the disease to others by the time test results are available. The overreliance on laboratory tests not only means that we lose the opportunity to detect those who are possibly at high risk of transmission but also the opportunity to look for high risk behaviour among people. In other words, the approach to tackle COVID-19 allows, by design, silent transmission of the disease within populations. Capacity to modify behaviour The third important aspect is the the role of health awareness in health behaviour. Many who are at risk find it difficult to modify their health behaviour despite being aware that they are at risk. People are aware that taking precautions like wearing masks, hand washing and maintaining physical distancing can prevent transmission of the disease. Yet we hear of politicians, celebrities, healthcare workers and those travelling in public transport testing positive for COVID-19. This implies that there is a limit to an individual’s capacity to modify his behaviour and sustain that behaviour without altering his living and working condition. Related to this is the fact that if there is success in controlling an epidemic, the credit goes to science and institutions and the government, whereas if there is a failure to control the epidemic, the blame is placed on the people. There is a failure to understand that health behaviour is only a subset of human behaviour and is closely linked to a person’s living and working conditions. Behavourial change takes place when society is organised in such a way that there is no option to engage in risky/ unhealthy behaviour by virtue of one’s occupation or social position. Right now, those who can afford to modify their life conditions without affecting their livelihood are the ones who are mostly able to keep away from the risk of COVID-19. Finally, it is important to examine ways by which States/ governments intervene to ensure that people follow a certain health behaviour. Most States invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and some gave the police the responsibility to ensure that people follow certain health behaviour. What is the expectation of public health professionals about people’s health behaviour during epidemics? Can we expect people to recognise the potential risks on their own and keep away from those risks? Disease control models focus on modifying individual risk factors. The role of public health in this case gets largely confined to ‘preaching’ with very little scope for action. The second approach has been to create fear of punishment as the basis of behavioural change. The police is given the responsibility to fine people when they violate rules. This has serious ethical implications, especially for those who cannot afford certain health behavioural practices. What history teaches us is that those health behavioural practices that are ‘natural’ and linked to living and working conditions are more acceptable and sustainable and are followed by people voluntarily. The task of public health professionals is to understand those health behavioural practices and the relationship of those practices with social structures and institutions. Anything short of this commitment in public health will ultimately result in putting the onus on the people to adopt ‘self-control’ which is the same as ‘preaching’, where there is little scope for action.  For real change Health behaviour plays a critical role in deciding the success of any public health intervention. The potential of health behaviour to transform the direction of any crisis is immense. The real change in health behaviour is possible only when there is acknowledgement of its societal roots and there are efforts to alter it at multiple levels. Instead, putting the onus of changing or modifying health behaviour onto individuals will only result in ‘victim blaming’ and create distrust between people and those responsible for epidemic control.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Is one language enough?||While negotiating independence from Dutch colonial rule, Indonesian nationalists decided that a reformed version of Malay (renamed Bahasa Indonesia) would become the official language. Malay had evolved due to the need in maritime Southeast Asia for a lingua franca for trade and other exchanges. In this region, hundreds of languages were spoken across thousands of islands that now comprise the modern nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. As it was grammatically simple, non-hierarchical, and easier to learn than other regional languages, Malay became an accepted language of communication. Bahasa Indonesia aimed to bring more than 300 ethnic groups together with no one ethnic group, including the Javanese, overshadowing the rest. From the outset of its independence, Indonesia recognised the importance of avoiding the inequality that was likely to occur by imposing the language of one dominant ethnic group over others. Debates in the Constituent Assembly In contrast, the issue of adopting a national language could not be resolved when the Constituent Assembly began drafting India’s Constitution. The adoption of a national language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written, and the language in which the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main questions debated. On the one side were members from the Hindi-speaking provinces who moved a number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole national language. One of the drafters declared, “People who do not know Hindustani have no right to stay in India. People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution... and do not know Hindi are not worthy to be members of this Assembly.” A member of the Assembly from the south said, “If we are going to be compelled to learn Hindi... I would perhaps not be able to do it at my age, and perhaps I would not be willing... because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need... will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language of the Centre.” Widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in Tamil Nadu, led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English for all official purposes. Hindi became the sole working language of the Union government by 1965 with the State governments free to function in the language of their choice. Meanwhile, the constitutional directive for the Union government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained within Central government entities in non-Hindi-speaking States. Later, Hindi speakers from the IT, construction and other sectors began moving for jobs to the south where many languages and dialects are spoken. Despite this migration to States that speak other languages, the Census found that while Hindi is the fastest growing language, the number of speakers of other languages has dropped. In Tamil Nadu, for example, over a 10-year period, the number of Tamil speakers of Hindi doubled largely because Tamilians needed to converse with those who came from the north. Loss of a language and a way of life According to the 2001 Census, India has 30 languages that are spoken by more than a million people each. The Constitution lists 22 languages and protects them in the eighth schedule. Many languages are kept out of this schedule even if they deserve to be included. This includes Tulu which is spoken by over 1.8 million people and has inscriptions dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries. When a refined language loses its status in literary and daily interactions, the way of life associated with it also vanishes. On the other hand, Hindi, a much younger Indo-Aryan language, has been gaining prominence since before independence. Old Hindi assimilated words from Persian. With the arrival of Islamic administrative rule in north India, it became Hindustani. The growing importance of Hindustani in colonial India and the association of Urdu with Muslims prompted Hindus in north India to develop a Sanskritised version, leading to the formation of a modern standard Hindi a century later. It was based on the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region and came to replace prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili and Braj. The literary value of these dialects diminished in due course. While discussing Hindi and its use, let us also focus on the merit of other Indian languages. It we don’t protect and promote other well-evolved or endangered and indigenous languages, our future generations may end up never understanding their ‘real’ roots and culture. Instead of focusing on one national language, why not learn a language beyond one’s mother tongue and get to know a different way of life too?

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Leaving no older woman behind||Perhaps one of the terrible aspects of COVID-19 is the harm it inflicts on older persons who face multiple and compounding threats, including being physically more vulnerable than others, at greater peril of the impacts of social isolation, and at significant risk from the likely long-lasting socioeconomic shocks of the pandemic. In the Asia-Pacific region, these impacts are particularly acute, adding to the challenge of grappling with accelerating population ageing. Women, who generally outlive men, constitute the majority of older persons in the region, but represent an even greater majority of the ‘oldest old’ population of 80 years and over. A vulnerable category of people Even before the COVID-19 crisis, elderly women in a majority of Asia-Pacific countries were facing significant challenges, exacerbated by the fact that many societies have been moving from traditional, nuclear family-oriented patterns to far more fluid, fragmented structures. The result has been that many older women, with a higher tendency to live alone, face poverty and are more likely to lack family and other socioeconomic support. The majority of older people do not have reliable and sustained access to a caregiver. Facing non-existent or only minimal safety nets, many have already slid into poverty during the pandemic or are on the cusp of doing so. The pandemic has brought into focus the urgent need for both governments and civil society to address the complex demographic shift of population ageing, with strategic solutions. To do so successfully, we need a life cycle approach to healthy ageing, with particular emphasis on girls and women, firmly grounded in gender equality and human rights. To unpack this, let us consider a woman in her 70s in the small village where she was born and raised. As with so many of her generation, she was made to marry early, with minimum education. She had children early, pregnancies were unplanned, childbirth was risky. Her husband, many years older, died a while ago, leaving her a widow, unprepared to enter the workforce or properly fend for herself. Her children left the village for the city, adding to her isolation. This is the scenario many older women now face, with the added risks and effects of COVID-19. But imagine if, as an adolescent, this woman had been able to complete higher education; achieve gainful employment; marry as an adult and of her own choice; have healthy children and invest in their well-being; and enjoy a secure old age. Plans in place If there are better policies, more resilient social systems and gender equality, the lives of older people, especially women, can be improved significantly. This would also allow societies to harness the valuable experiences of older persons as they age. In fact, the commitment to advance a better world in an ageing society has already been articulated by the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. This agreement commends the development of evidence-based policies that help create “a society for all ages”. In addition, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals underscore the basis of this approach to healthy ageing. We must collectively prioritise greater action, funding and implementation. Our mandate in the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) incorporates the need to enable and strengthen the self-reliance of older persons. The ICPD Programme of Action is our foundation, and our guiding principle. UNFPA is committed to helping governments in full partnership with civil society and communities. This is the Decade of Healthy Ageing as well as the Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs. As Asia-Pacific, with the rest of the world, seeks to ‘build back better’ from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, let us seize this moment to transform the challenge of population ageing into an opportunity.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Justice in ruins||The ruins of the Babri Masjid were cleared in record time by the hordes of vandals mobilised for demolishing it. Some detritus was still left, though: a belief among many that justice would be done and the Constitution and the rule of law would be upheld if the criminal court punishes those who plotted the events of December 6, 1992. Even when the Supreme Court handed over the empty site to those who wanted the mosque brought down to build a Ram temple, its recognition of the demolition as an “egregious violation of the rule of law” gave rise to hope that the ends of justice would be served by the punishment of those who mobilised the vandals. A Special CBI Court in Lucknow has now cleared the remaining debris with an unconscionable judgment. Throwing to the winds the Supreme Court’s observations on the demolition, the trial court has in effect given judicial legitimation to the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi movement’ by acquitting all those indicted for conspiracy to bring down the structure. Its conclusions are drastic and defy logic and fact. The court’s finding that the demolition was not planned in advance flies in the face of the entry of more than a hundred thousand volunteers into Ayodhya that day, armed with crowbars, spades, hoes and ropes and every implement needed to bring down a sturdy structure and clear the site. The proponents of the movement, headed by L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti among others, had positioned themselves in vantage points to witness the occasion and celebrate with pride what ought to have caused shame and disgust. It is indeed true that it is not easy to prove a conspiracy, as it essentially takes place in secret. This is where courts must draw reasonable inferences from the circumstances. But in a conspiracy of this nature, it is easy to see that those involved were “marching under a banner”, an image the Supreme Court had once referred to while explaining the ingredients of a conspiracy. In this case, apart from the political mobilisation and the purported intent to assemble on a particular day, the court had with it sufficient evidence that there was studied inaction on the part of the State, whose Chief Minister was one of the accused, and the unambiguous and open threats to the structure voiced by many of the movement’s protagonists. The dissembling Kalyan Singh, as Chief Minister then, had given what, in hindsight, was an obviously false assurance to the highest court and the National Integration Council that nothing but a symbolic ‘kar seva’ would take place. Specific instructions appeared to have been given to the security forces not to stop the ‘kar sevaks’ or hinder their plans. How else would one explain the events? When the crowd went into a frenzy, goaded on by provocative speeches by the dignitaries, and vandals went up the dome, the accused would have the court believe that they were actually trying to restrain the mob and prevent the demolition! The possibility of tampered audio and video evidence or even disavowals on record would not undo the cumulative effect of the logistical and financial preparation, besides the communal mobilisation. Mr. Advani, who had then claimed it was the saddest day of his life, now says the en masse acquittal is a vindication of the movement. This indicates that the objective of the mobilisation, exemplified by his rath yatra, was always to alter the status quo with violence. The Manmohan Singh Liberhan Commission had laid bare the entire conspiracy in its damning report, but unfortunately, a probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act has no binding value, whereas the evidence adduced at the trial alone matters. It is, of course, the responsibility of the CBI to prove the element of conspiracy, the details of the advance mobilisation, the “meeting of minds” that is required to prove a plot and its broad contours. That the agency failed is no surprise. From the beginning, the police investigation has been marked by bungling. When the main events were covered by two FIRs, the U.P. government initially failed to notify both of them while designating courts for trial. The Allahabad High Court quashed the flawed notification, and the State government’s failure to rectify the irregularity resulted in separate proceedings in Lucknow and Rae Bareilly. The CBI, instead of challenging the State’s rejection of its request for curing a technical defect, filed a supplementary charge sheet after omitting the ‘conspiracy’ charge. The Supreme Court later said this derailed the joint trial and resulted in separate proceedings in two places. In 2017, the Supreme Court revived the conspiracy charge, directed the trial court to resume day-to-day trial and sternly reminded the agency that it was because of its failure and that of the State government that a crime that shook the secular fabric of the Constitution had not seen justice for 25 years. Whether a politically hamstrung agency could have successfully prosecuted such a sensitive case is a moot question. But the results are there for all to see. Even allowing for the possibility that the judiciary is in close alignment with the executive, it is unacceptable to see a court going so far as to parrot the specious theory advanced by the demolition squad from the BJP-VHP-RSS family for years that the destruction was a “spontaneous act”. All those who went through that disgraceful phase in India’s political history know that the demolition was only the culmination of a revanchist movement. The period was marked by communal mobilisation, holding of processions to gather ‘bricks’ meant for constructing a temple, and an attempt to storm the site in 1990, which ended in bloodshed. Given this grisly background, and the grave implications that the exoneration of those who demolished a religious structure would have on public trust in the judicial system, it is imperative that the CBI goes on appeal. The cause of communal amity cannot afford successive judicial setbacks to both secular values and the rule of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/justice-in-ruins/article32737193.ece

Dalvi, Honorary Secretary, Postmen’s Union explained to the men the offer of the Post Master General to pay off the men on their returning the uniforms and pointed out the letter was not clear as to whether the men would be reinstated or not. Mr. Dalvi further advised the men not to while away their time but to learn typewriting, weaving and other skills which would be useful to them in a city like Bombay. A letter has been sent on behalf of the men to the Post Master General stating that it is not understood why the return of the uniform has been made a condition to the payment of salary due to them. During the last two strikes of 1906 and 1917, uniforms were not taken from the men. So long as the men are in the service of the department they are entitled to keep the uniforms with them.

01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. retains Rs. 12-lakh cr. borrowing plan||India’s fiscal deficit soared to 109% of the Budget target in just the first five months of the year, with revenues remaining muted. However, the Centre stuck to its Rs. 12 lakh crore borrowing plan for the year with the Finance Ministry exuding confidence that it would manage to meet its expenditure commitments within this plan. The Centre had already enhanced its borrowing target for the year by Rs. 4.2 lakh crore to Rs. 12 lakh crore in May this year as the initial adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown became apparent. The government has borrowed Rs. 7.66 lakh crore in the first half of the fiscal and plans to borrow the remaining Rs. 4.34 lakh crore between October 2020 and January 2021, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday. The borrowing was done at a weighted rate of 5.82%, the lowest in the last 15 years, he said. “Based on our estimates of revenues… revenues are looking up, keeping in mind the expenditure and keeping some space for some unforeseen items, we anticipate that the Rs. 12 lakh crore should suffice till the end of the year,” Mr Bajaj said. The government is leaving some room for States who also have to do ‘major borrowings’ as well as the private sector to raise money in the second half of the year. “With the opening up of the economy… we are expecting to see more activity from the private sector in the third and fourth quarters,” he said. ‘Deficit may still grow’ Revenue collections were largely to blame for the fiscal deficit hitting Rs. 8.70 lakh crore compared to the target of Rs. 7.96 lakh crore, as tax revenue declined across the board. Rating agencies expect the fiscal deficit slippage to be much higher by the end of the year. Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, reckoned that the deficit will rise to Rs. 14 lakh crore and the Centre would have to scale up its borrowings by at least Rs. 1.1 lakh crore, even if no further fiscal support measures were announced. Care Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis agreed that fiscal slippage would be quite wide. “We expect central government deficit to be in the region of 9% this year. This is notwithstanding the fact that there may be no new stimulus involving additional expenditure,” he said. Budget 2020-21 had set a fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-retains-rs-12-lakh-cr-borrowing-plan/article32737181.ece
01 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Current account surplus widens to $19.8 billion in Q1||India recorded a surplus of $19.8 billion (3.9% of GDP) in its current account balance in the first quarter of FY21, on top of a surplus of $0.6 billion (0.1% of GDP) in the preceding quarter, according to RBI data. A deficit of $15 billion (2.1% of GDP) was recorded a year earlier. The surplus in the current account in the first quarter of 2020-21 was on account of a sharp contraction in trade deficit to $10 billion due to a steeper decline in merchandise imports relative to exports on a year-on-year basis, RBI said on Wednesday. Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA, said, “The current account surplus in Q1 was well above our expectations, as the fall in remittances was remarkably muted, despite the adverse economic conditions globally amid the ongoing pandemic.” “With domestic and global lockdowns to fight COVID-19 [having] a differentiated impact on exports and imports, the merchandise trade deficit shrunk to just $10 billion in Q1, most of which was accounted for by the net oil balance,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/current-account-surplus-widens-to-198-billion-in-q1/article32737173.ece

The June 2020 external debt level was lower by $3.9 billion over its level of $558.4 billion at end-March 2020, the RBI said on Wednesday. The year-on-year percentage variation was -0.4, while the month-on-month percentage variation was -0.7, it said.

Valuation loss due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis major currencies such as the euro, yen and SDR were at $0.7 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, the decrease in external debt would have been $4.5 billion instead of $3.9 billion at end-June 2020 over end-March 2020, RBI data showed. Commercial borrowings remained the largest component of external debt, with a share of 38.1%, followed by non-resident deposits (23.9%) and short-term trade credit (18.2%).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/external-debt-declines-to-5545-bn-at-end-june-2020/article32737177.ece

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Knight Riders bring high-flying Royals crashing down to earth||There was no third 70-plus score on the trot for Sanju Samson. There was no second miraculous knock from Rahul Tewatia. And there wasn’t another great chase from Rajasthan Royals. Kolkata Knight Riders brought Royals, who had won both their games in Sharjah, crashing down to earth at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday, winning their IPL encounter by 37 runs. Responding to Knight Riders’ 174 for six, Royals finished with 137 for nine. Steve Smith, who didn’t look as composed as he did in his last two outings, tried to hit Pat Cummins high and far down the leg-side, but only managed to edge it to rival captain Dinesh Karthik. His dismissal brought to the wicket the other in-form Royals batsman, Samson. Shivam Mavi, after bowling a tight first over, ensured that the dasher from Kerala would not make it a hat-trick of awards. Samson failed to time his pull and ended up giving a comfortable catch to Sunil Narine at mid-wicket. The 21-year-old from Uttar Pradesh wasn’t done yet. In his next over, he took one of the most prized wickets in white-ball cricket. Jos Buttler went for a slash off a wider ball and was taken at short third man by Varun Chakravarthy. Kamlesh Nagarkoti, another young pacer from India’s under-19 World Cup-winning team in 2018, took over from Mavi. He dismissed Robin Uthappa and Riyan Parag cheaply to reduce Royals to 42 for five. The stage was now set for the man-of-the-moment, Tewatia. But he lasted only 10 balls, his middle-stump uprooted by mystery-spinner Varun. Now, somebody else had to do a Tewatia — and more — if Royals had to pull off another incredible chase. Nobody could manage it, although Tom Curran (54 n.o., 36b, 2x4, 3x6) tried. Earlier, an assured innings at the top of the order from Shubman Gill (47, 34b, 5x4, 1x6), and a calculated assault towards the end by Eoin Morgan (34 not out, 23b, 1x4, 2x6) got Kolkata to a total it could defend. That was after Jofra Archer had threatened to restrict the side to far less. The England quick came up with a superb spell. He bowled with express pace and was used well by Smith. The beauty to take the outside edge of Karthik’s bat was one of the balls of the IPL thus far. But this was Knight Riders’ night.   Royals 61 for five  Royals were 61 for five in 10 overs, with Curran (7) and Tewatia (13) at the crease. Buttler (21), Smith (3), Samson (8), Uthappa (2) and Parag (1) were the batsmen dismissed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gill-and-morgan-take-kolkata-knight-riders-to-a-challenging-total/article32737286.ece
01 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||MI and Kings XI look to emerge stronger||Coming off heartbreaking losses, the Indian Premier League game between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab will be a test of character for both sides as they look to regain momentum here on Thursday. KXIP was at the receiving end of the highest successful run-chase in the tournament’s history as Rajasthan Royals overhauled a target of 224 with three balls to spare on Sunday. Remarkable fightback While Kieron Pollard and Ishan Kishan led a remarkable fightback, chasing 202, before Mumbai went down to Royal Challengers Bangalore in a Super Over. Defending champion Mumbai Indians lost its opening game but bounced back to beat Kolkata Knight Riders. However, Rohit Sharma’s men failed to cross the line against RCB. Similarly, after losing to Delhi Capitals in their opener, KXIP came back strongly to register its first points by defeating RCB. But, despite a fabulous batting display, the Punjab team lost to Rajasthan.  KXIP has failed to tighten the screws when it mattered most. In its two losses, the team was in a good position but could not grab the moments. Kings XI’s bowling looked out of sorts against Rajasthan as it failed to defend a big total with Rahul Tewatia hitting pacer Sheldon Cottrell for five sixes in an over to win the match for his team. Even Mohammed Shami (3/53), who has been in brilliant form prior to that onslaught, was taken to the cleaners. Barring an economical spell by leggie Ravi Bishnoi (0/34), the other KXIP bowlers had an off day against Rajasthan.  Skipper K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal have made inspiring starts this season, hitting a century and a fifty each, and getting the duo out early will be the key for Mumbai. Against Rajasthan, the pair shared a 183-run opening stand with Agarwal scoring his maiden ton while Rahul, fresh from recording the highest score by an Indian in IPL history, hit a 54-ball 69. Mumbai Indians is endowed with a splendid batting firepower with the likes of Rohit, Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan at the top-order, followed by the big-hitting Pollard and Hardik Pandya. A major cause of concern for Mumbai Indians will be pace ace Jaspirt Bumrah’s inconsistency. The speedster has picked up only three wickets in as many games and has failed to make the kind of impact that is expected from a bowler of his calibre. Mumbai, though, will have the psychological advantage having played a game here before.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mi-and-kings-xi-look-to-emerge-stronger/article32737289.ece
01 October 2020||MADRID,||Getafe jumps to top||Getafe jumped to the top of the LaLiga on Tuesday with a 3-0 victory at home over Real Betis, dislodging Valencia, which had moved into first place earlier in the evening. Both Getafe and Valencia have seven points after the opening games in the fourth round of the season. Getafe had only scored once in its opening two games but struck three times in the first half against Betis, which started the day as the league leader. Angel Rodriguez put the visitor ahead with an overhead kick after 13 minutes. Marc Cucurella added a second in the 39th and two minutes later, Angel added a third with a cross shot.  Earlier, Valencia won 1-0 at Real Sociedad in a match the home team dominated.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The King takes centre stage against gritty Miami||In 2019, LeBron James missed the NBA Finals for the first time in nine years. There were whispers that Father Time was whittling down his abilities, that he was past his prime. LeBron clearly listened to the critics and bristled. His agent and close friend Rich Paul orchestrated a massive trade for the Los Angeles Lakers, recruiting superstar forward Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans. With this, the Lakers had two of the league’s top five players. High-IQ role-players The rest of the roster was fitted with high-IQ role-players — shooting guard Danny Green and point guard Rajon Rondo — and centres — Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee — who wanted to prove their relevance in a league tending towards ‘small ball’. Bolstered by a new, defensive-minded head coach in Frank Vogel, the Lakers ran up the best record in the competitive Western Conference. Their stars revved up the intensity in the Playoffs — LeBron continuing to dominate the paint and dissect the defence with incisive passing, and Davis proving a match-up nightmare for everyone with his near-flawless inside and outside game. Fourth ring Even the giant-killing Denver Nuggets couldn’t really challenge the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. So, on paper, the Lakers should have it easy in the NBA Finals (LeBron’s 10th) and get The King his fourth ring. Except, the Miami Heat, as its All-NBA forward Jimmy Butler asserted, is no underdog. The well-conditioned team might not match the Lakers’ star power but has impressive depth. The Heat finished fifth in the Eastern Conference but arguably had the easier route to the Finals. Coach Erik Spoelstra’s team has a nice combination of trigger-happy shooters in forward Duncan Robinson and fearless rookie Tyler Herro. It also has a unique centre in hard-working Bam Adebayo, who can make plays from the post, rim-run, defend five positions and block shots, while playing within the intricate Heat system. Veteran guard Goran Dragic probes defences with ease and still retains a strong passing and shooting ability at age 34, while Andre Iguodala and forward Jae Crowder shore up the defensive end. Butler is the lynchpin, his grit exemplifying the Heat’s determined disposition on the court. The Lakers will have to summon the best of their role players, for Spoelstra, who coached LeBron during his strong stint with the Heat, will devise ways to constrain him — pack the paint and will him to shoot or, better still, pass. The X-factor Davis is the Lakers’ X-factor and will probably be the difference for the club that has won 16 NBA titles so far.  The schedule (India dates): Game 1: Oct. 1; Game 2: Oct. 3; Game 3: Oct 5.; Game 4: Oct. 7; Game 5: Oct. 10; Game 6: Oct. 12; Game 7: Oct. 14 .

01 October 2020||Chennai,||Natarajan knows how to use his weapon — the yorker||“That’s how you bowl at the back end of an innings! Outstanding Natarajan.” Australian pace great Brett Lee had tweeted these words after a remarkable 18th over of the innings by left-arm paceman T. Natarajan for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Delhi Capitals on Monday. The Tamil Nadu seamer sent down an astonishing five yorkers — one delivery was a misdirected full toss — in an over that all but finished the match as a contest. Marcus Stoinis, one of the hardest hitters in the game, who faced most of the over, played across to the final delivery and was trapped leg-before by that ball again — the yorker. Until Natarajan’s captivating exhibition, yorkers were few and far between even by renowned exponents of it such as Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in this IPL.  Adding an extra yard of speed had provided the cutting edge to the 29-year-old Natarajan’s bowling. He has filled out well and there is greater thrust in his run-up and final delivery stride. When velocity combines with precision, the effect can be lethal. Bowling an effective yorker is a lot about understanding the release point and it is here that Natarajan has done well. He comprehends his craft, knows how to use his weapon. Last season, Natarajan was the lynchpin of the Tamil Nadu attack as it made the final of both the Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali tournaments. High-risk delivery The yorker is also a high-risk delivery since it can so easily turn into a full toss and disappear into the stands. On Tuesday, though, Natarajan displayed the control and the confidence to bowl a string of toe-crushers. A late developer from a humble background, this Salem lad first made headlines when he was snapped up for Rs. 3 crores by Kings XI Punjab in 2017. Mentally and physically, he was not ready then. Now, the rediscovered Natarajan’s yorkers are on target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/natarajan-knows-how-to-use-his-weapon-the-yorker/article32737339.ece
01 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||SAI’s new logo unveiled||The Sports Authority of India (SAI) will have a new identity to keep in sync with its ambitious flight towards helping India emerge as a top-10 country in the medals table at the 2028 Olympics. Unveiling the simple but dynamic logo at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium here, Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju commended SAI for being the driving force behind Indian sports over the years. He said a new logo was required, even though there was nothing wrong with the original. “It is three simple letters along with the flight symbol,” said the Minister. “Aim and objective are important to achieve anything. Our target is challenging and we have eight years. “We are taking many steps and I am confident that the results will come. I have no doubt that we will achieve our target,” said Rijiju.

He also thanked the government for its support, revealing that the women’s hockey team had reached 90% of its fitness level on resumption of training from the lockdown. SAI secretary-general of SAI Sandip Pradhan welcomed the gathering and hundreds who were connected on the web from across the country.

01 October 2020||MUMBAI,||‘Will try to attack Rahul even in middle overs’||Kings XI openers K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal have been in sizzling form in this IPL. It’s a no-brainer that the team will be banking on them to negate Jasprit Bumrah’s threat during Thursday’s clash against defending champion Mumbai Indians. Bowling coach Shane Bond hinted at MI trying to attack Rahul even in the middle overs. ‘Dynamic player’ “KL is a dynamic player who scores all around the field. We also know that he takes his time generally through the middle overs, so that’s perhaps an opportunity to create pressure on him and the batsmen around him,” Bond said on Wednesday. “We will have specific ideas about how we can get him out… mind you, the two key batters for Kings XI Punjab have played brilliantly so far. “If we can create some pressure and get those boys out, and put little bit more pressure on the middle-order early, we can restrict them to a score, stop them from scoring (big) runs.” While Rahul sits atop the run-getters’ list with 222 from three games, Agarwal in just a solitary run behind. Despite the duo’s heroics, Kings XI has fallen short of the finish line twice in its three games so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-try-to-attack-rahul-even-in-middle-overs/article32737282.ece
01 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Our death bowling was outstanding: Warner||Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) captain David Warner said his bowlers held their nerve and hit the right line and length to help the team to victory against Delhi Capitals in the IPL on Tuesday. In a virtual media conference, Warner said batting first and putting runs on the board was good. “They (Delhi) bowled very well in the PowerPlay. It was a clever change of pace and set a good field for us,” Warner said about his team’s slow start. “It was a big call including Kane Williamson. For us, it is important that we establish a very good middle-order. Four set batters at the top. Obviously, there are going to be opportunities for Nabi to come in as well. We try to put or chase big totals,” he added. Exceptional “But credit to our bowlers, especially through the middle. And, death bowling was outstanding. Rashid (Khan) was exceptionally great. He knows exactly what he has to do. He bowled stump to stump and built lot of pressure. With left-arm spinner Abhishek playing, Rashid knew his role today.” “On Abdul Samad, the SRH captain said: “I was very, very impressed with him.” Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting said the team was just outplayed. “The top-order partnership for SRH was the difference in the game. And in bowling, they executed their yorkers better than we did.” Shreyas fined Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was fined Rs. 12 lakh after his team maintained a slow over-rate against Sunrisers Hyderabad in their match on Tuesday. Since this was Capitals’ first offence of the season, Shreyas was docked Rs. 12 lakh under the IPL’s Code of Conduct relating to over-rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/very-very-impressed-with-samad-warner/article32737292.ece

The American, who turned 39 this week, had been due to play Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova in the second round later, but after a warm-up decided the injury was too severe. “I warmed up and it was a very short warm-up and then I spoke to my coach and said ‘what do you think?’” she said. “I was struggling to walk so that’s a tell-tale sign that I should try to recover. “I adore the clay. I really wanted to give an effort. It is my Achilles that didn’t have enough time to heal after the US Open. An Achilles injury is a real injury you don’t want to play with as it can get worse and I don’t want to get to that,” she said.

Mirabai, a world champion in the women’s 48kg category, had to skip the 2018 Asian Games when she experienced pain in her lower back.

She continued to compete in different events till the pandemic-induced break. “Mira’s lower back issue resurfaces occasionally. I was looking for an expert and came across the profile of Dr. Horschig. There is enough time (before the Olympics) for her to rectify the problem and become stronger,” Sharma told The Hindu . “We had sent the proposal to the government about 15-20 days ago.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Pure devotional experience||The Nalayira Divya Prabandha hymns of the Azhwars in Tamil are held to contain the very essence of the highest philosophy of the Vedas and the Upanishads. The analogy of the cloud that absorbs ocean water and distributes it as pure drinking water for sustenance is often quoted to show how the Divya Prabandha hymns bring the very essence of the esoteric truths of the scriptures in simple Tamil language to the common man. More importantly, each of the Azhwars, being inspired by the Lord Himself, has sung hymns that sensitise the common man to rise to the level of pure devotional experience, which is after all the aim and end of bhakti yoga, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. Among the Azhwars, Kulasekhara Azhwar has many specials to his credit. There is a karna parampara story that shows this Azhwar’s association with the three foremost Vaishnava Divya Desams, Sri Vaikunta, Tiruparkadal and Srirangam. It is believed that the Lord gave darshan to Kulasekhara and instilled bhakti in him directly when He had instructed Vishvaksena to bring him to Vaikunta. Tiruparkadal happens to be the source of his emergence since he is believed to be the incarnation of the Lord’s Kaustuba gem that was obtained during the churning of the milky ocean. His penchant for Srirangam Kshetra is well known and in his magnum opus Perumal Tirumozhi, acclaimed for its poetic beauty and devotional fervour, he pours out his heart and his love for the Lord in moving terms. In addition, he is the only Azhwar who has composed a hymn in Sanskrit, the Mukunda Mala Stotra. Ramanuja has composed a taniyan in honour of this Azhwar and in it he extols the unique ways in which the Azhwar exemplifies both Bhagavad bhakti and Bhagavata bhakti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pure-devotional-experience/article32737280.ece

01 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC refuses to allow PCMC to remove encroachments||Stating that it cannot allow anyone to be rendered homeless during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bombay High Court refused to grant permission to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) for removal of encroachments along riverbeds in areas under its jurisdiction. The PCMC had moved an application before a four-judge Bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, seeking permission to comply with the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) June 16 order about clearing encroachments from some riverbeds. The larger Bench, however, pointed out that it had previously passed an order restricting any demolition or eviction work during the pandemic. The special larger Bench was constituted in March after the COVID-19-induced lockdown was announced. On March 26, it issued a suo motu order stating that orders for eviction, dispossession and demolition already passed by the courts will also remain in abeyance until April 30. At the time, the Bench had also asked authorities across the State to go slow while taking coercive steps that may drive citizens to the court of law, in view of the pandemic. On Wednesday, the Bench refused to grant relief to the PCMC in view of its previous suo motu order. As removing the encroachments would render some people homeless, the court could not allow the same during the pandemic, the Bench stated. It also noted that persons who would be affected by the implementation of the NGT’s order, were not before the high court as a party to the application. The Bench, therefore, directed the PCMC to inform the NGT of the court’s suo motu order if it insisted on compliance of its order. “You tell the tribunal that a larger Bench has passed such an order. In fact, all high courts across the country have passed similar orders against eviction demolition, dispossession in view of the pandemic,” the Bench said. “We can’t allow anyone to be rendered homeless during the pandemic,” it added. The Bench also extended the operation of the suo motu order till October 31, observing that courts are yet to begin functioning at their full capacity and the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra continues to be grim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/hc-refuses-to-allow-pcmc-to-remove-encroachments/article32738062.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||Adityanath should quit over Hathras gang rape: MVA||The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the gangrape and death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras and the hasty handling of the case by the U.P. Police. The three MVA allies — the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress — demanded justice for the woman, who succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on Tuesday and was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday. Nawab Malik, NCP spokesperson and State Minority Affairs Minister, said, “There is no longer rule of law in Uttar Pradesh. It belongs to a special few chosen by Chief Minister Adityanath. He has given a free hand to his workers and colleagues. From initially denying the gangrape of a Dalit woman and terming it fake news to secretly cremating the body in the dead of the night, the State has shown there is no longer rule of law.” Mr. Malik said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi has even a bit of sadness over the incident, then he must ask the CM to step down. On Wednesday evening, Ministers from the MVA government and senior Congress leaders took part in a ‘Sanvedna’ (empathy) candlelight march in Mumbai. “The gangrape in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras is a blot on humanity. The family members of the woman were not even given the opportunity to perform the last rites. This is shocking. The recent happenings show that women and girls are not safe in Uttar Pradesh,” said State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat. Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said she was “stunned by the cruelty and shamelessness” of the Uttar Pradesh government and its police. “Those who talk of religion are committing anti-religious activities. The secretive manner in which the last rites were performed, by keeping the family away, is nothing less than a sin and a crime,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/adityanath-should-quit-over-hathras-gangrape-mva/article32738061.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||Cabinet committee set up to look into implementation of farm Acts||In a clear indication of its reluctance on the agriculture Bills cleared at the just-concluded monsoon session of Parliament, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday set up a Cabinet sub-committee to discuss their implementation in the State. Interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi has opposed the implementation of the Bills in States where the party is in power. The State unit of the Congresshad discussed the issue with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray where he is reported to have agreed to look into the matter and not hastily implement the Bills. The Cabinet sub-committee will discuss the farm Bills and its impacts on farmers and agriculture in the State. “The sub-committee will also hold discussions with organisations representing farmers. Based on these discussions, a draft of suggested modifications will be submitted before the Cabinet and a final decision taken thereafter,” said an official. Last week, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar had said that the State would not be implementing the Bills. The State Co-operative department had on August 10 issued a notification to implement the ordinances across the State. “Now technically, ordinances have been converted to a law and the State government has formed a sub-committee to discuss its implementation,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/cabinet-committee-set-up-to-look-into-implementation-of-farm-bills/article32738059.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC asks developer to pay Rs. 5 cr. for delay in handing over property||The Bombay High Court has directed a real estate developer to pay Rs. 5.04 crore as compensation to a person who had not been handed over his property in Mumbai even after a delay of over 80 months. A single judge Bench of Justice S.C. Gupte on September 25 upheld the ruling, in January, by the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority and the RERA Appellate Tribunal ordering the compensation to the purchaser.The developer, Renaissance Infrastructure, challenged the orders of RERA and the RERA Appellate Tribunal in the HC. The Bombay HC said, the purchaser bought six plots of land and some warehousing buildings from the developer in December 2009. According to the sale agreement, the warehousing buildings and plots were to be handed over to the purchaser by March 9, 2010. The agreement also said that if the developer failed to hand over the properties on time, he would be liable to pay a compensation amount at the rate of Rs. 10 per sq ft per month. When the developer failed to hand over the property, the purchaser approached the RERA which calculated the compensation amount as Rs. 5.04 crore. The appellate tribunal, had also asked the developer, Renaissance Infrastructure, to deposit 50% of the compensation amount as per the RERA Act for entertaining the appeal. But, when the developer failed to pay the pre-deposit, the tribunal dismissed the appeal. The developer then filed a second appeal in the High Court. In his order, Justice Gupte dismissed the second appeal after holding that there were no infirmities in the orders passed by the RERA and the appellate tribunal. He held that the orders do not give rise to “any substantial question of law for the consideration of the High Court”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/hc-asks-developer-to-pay-rs-5-cr-for-delay-in-handing-over-property/article32737939.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||Govt. considering resumption of local trains for all: Aaditya||The Maharashtra government is seriously considering resumption of normal local train services in Mumbai by October 15, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Wednesday said quoting Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray. According to the Sena publication, Mr. Thackeray said the issue of resumption of suburban train services for common citizens is being considered as part of efforts to bring the State’s economy back on track. In a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, the local trains are currently being run only for essential services staff, State and Central government staff, and employees of nationalised and private banks, PSUs and pharma companies, and QR code-based identity cards are mandatory for them. “The government is seriously considering starting normal train services for citizens by October 15. The decision will be taken after ensuring all COVID-19-related safety protocols are followed,” Mr. Thackeray said. He also said that to reduce vehicular traffic, a proposal to keep offices and commercial establishments working for 24 hours is being considered. It is difficult to reschedule the office hours since there are different kinds of offices and commercial establishments in Mumbai, the minister said. He said the government was in talks with offices, establishments and corporates regarding working hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/govt-considering-resumption-of-local-trains-for-all-aaditya/article32737941.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||‘All interim orders to continue till Oct. 31’||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday said that all interim orders passed by all courts in Maharashtra and Goa would continue till October 31 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. A four-judge Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, Justices A.A. Sayed, S.S. Shinde, and K.K. Tated said, “The situation in Maharashtra, because of the pandemic, continues to be grim. Normal functioning of the courts is yet to be restored. In view of which, we consider it just and appropriate to extend all interim orders till October 31.” This implies that all orders for eviction, dispossession and demolition already passed by the courts will remain in abeyance until October 31, in same terms as directed earlier. After six months, on Wednesday, a Bench headed by the Chief Justice heard a matter physically on removal of encroachments along riverbeds in areas that come under the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. The corporation sought permission to comply with the order of the National Green Tribunal on clearing encroachments. The court said, “Removing the encroachments would render some people homeless; the court cannot allow the same during the pandemic.” Meanwhile, the Principal Bench at Bombay will commence physical hearings from October 1 to October 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/all-interim-orders-to-continue-till-oct-31/article32737938.ece
01 October 2020||Mumbai,||Police summon Anurag Kashyap in rape case||Film director Anurag Kashyap, who has been accused of rape by an actor, has been summoned for questioning at Versova police station on October 1. Talking to The Hindu , DCP Abhishek Trimukhe confirmed the development. An FIR was registered against him on September 23 under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code. The complaint filed by the actor said the director raped her at her house in Yari Road in 2013. On September 19, the actor tweeted, “Mr Kashyap has forced himself on me and extremely badly. Narendra Modiji kindly take action and let the country see the demon behind this creative guy. I am aware that it can harm me and my security is at risk. Pls help!” Mr. Kashyap put out a press statement by lawyer Priyanka Khimani on Twitter on September 21. It read, “My client, Anurag Kashyap has been deeply pained by the false allegations of sexual misconduct that have recently surfaced against him. These allegations are completely false, malicious and dishonest. It is sad that a social movement as important as #metoo movement has been co-opted by vested interests and reduced to a mere tool for character assassination. Fictitious allegations of this nature seriously undermine the movement and seek to unconscionably trade upon the pain and trauma of actual victims of sexual harassment and abuse.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/police-summon-anurag-kashyap-in-rape-case/article32737944.ece

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The big top on your laptop||“I received so many messages saying ‘I miss you’; paintings, cards and phone calls from children across India. I didn’t know so many children knew me. I called my son in Kerala and began to cry,” says Biju Pushkaran, a clown with Rambo Circus. He is overwhelmed by the response to their maiden online show ‘Life in a Circus: Save the Circus’ that was held on September 25. Last week, in an innovation triggered by the pandemic, Rambo Circus went virtual. A month before this digital show, a fully made-up Biju, complete with a bulbous red nose and wig of golden hair, performed in an empty big top for the first time along with 30 other artistes in a one-hour scripted and directed show. ‘Life is a Circus’, relayed eight times over the weekend, was a sell out. The response has left its ideators and artistes both overjoyed and surprised. Biju has been the clown at Rambo Circus for 21 years and was hoping to represent India at the Monte Carlo International Circus Festival this year. However, COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the festival as well as the first leg of Rambo Circus’ scheduled launch at Airoli in Navi Mumbai. “We had put up the big tent and our artistes were getting ready. But the lockdown halted everything. We were stranded there with 100 artistes from different parts of India. Many of the senior ones wanted to go back home. With the help of the local police and corporators, we managed to send 40 people back but the others had to be looked after,” says Sujith Dilip, one of the proprietors of the Pune-based circus company, adding that it was one of the lowest moments in his career: “I was concerned with how to protect the health and livelihood of the artistes.” He goes to talk about his plans to upgrade the circus this year. He was negotiating with a Moscow-based company to introduce Russian acts, with an Italian firm to change the architectural landscape of the big top and the seating arrangement and with a German firm to introduce technology-driven acts like holograms and mechanical animals. This was when Dinesh Shetty of Production Crew and Navneeth Mohan and Saurab Khurana of LaQshya Live Experiences came up with the idea of a digital circus. “We were figuring out ways to help artistes and performers and get entertainment going in these tough times. We thought of the circus, which was scheduled to come to town,” says Navneeth, adding: “The circus is already a dying art form and the present generation do not know how much fun it is. We wanted to bring it to them in these times of isolation.” Dinesh discussed the concept with the artistes, explaining the alterations required for a digital show. “We wanted to tell the audience about the challenges faced by the artistes during the pandemic and by the art form itself. We scripted a story and directed it,” says Dinesh. Dance choreographer Rahul Saxena choreographed the show and Vipul Roy narrated the story of the pandemic-affected circus. As a senior artiste, Biju recalls that he was sceptical about the idea. “But I encouraged the artistes to take up the challenge,” he says. The tent with a capacity to host an audience of 1,200 was put up with the help of 30 artistes and supporting staff. Dinesh says that help from industry vendors poured in. “As it was not a live show, we had to amp up the effects,” he says. After a week of diligent rehearsals, the final show was staged. When the lights came on, a gamut of aerial acts, ladder balance, juggling feats, clown comedy and more unfolded. Popular acts like The Wheel of Death, a daring stunt on rotating rings could not be staged as it requires manpower to put up big equipment. Trampoline acrobatics were missing as well since specialist artistes had returned home. Three Ethiopian artistes who could not travel back to their country added their distinctive acts to the show. For Rambo Circus, founded in 1991, this was a watershed moment. Biju remembers the strange feeling of entering the stage to no applause or “shouts of hi joker”. “There was no standing ovation, no noise. I froze and could not perform; but sir told me that thousands are watching me through the screen.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-big-top-on-your-laptop/article32737812.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The hen who doesn’t give a cluck||Monique the hen has probably travelled to more countries than you have. And no, she is not smug about it. She just clucks and goes about her life, laying an egg a day. The now seven-year-old, met Guirec Soudée when he had docked at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, during the course of his world cruise. He adopted the six-month-old hen and they have been inseparable since. As a 20 year old, Guirec set off on what he calls his “dream journey” in 2013. His choice of transport: a rusty, motorised fishing boat with a small diesel engine for manoeuvres in ports, or to escape the current when there is no wind. He named it Yvinec, after the French island that is his home. The sailing expedition took him five years to complete. He received a hero’s welcome when he returned. Though, he admits, it was hard to come back and not find his father at home. “He passed away while I was on the high seas,” he says. Since then Guirec has become a local celebrity with three books ( The Hen Who Sailed The World, Le Monde Selon Guirec et Monique and La Fabuleuse Histoire de Guirec et Monique) to his credit as well as a 60-minute documentary titled Du Pôule Nord au Pôule Sud. “We started the theatre tour with it in France in January this year and received more than 10,000 spectators. But due to the pandemic, we had to cancel everything.” Last week, the documentary was screened at Le Grand Rex, one of the biggest theatres in Paris. (With physical distancing, they could accommodate only an audience of 1,700.) For now, the 28 year old is more than happy to recount his adventure over an email interview onboard Yvinec. “I first crossed the Atlantic leaving France from Brittany, stopped by Spain, Portugal, Madeira, Canary Islands then straight to the Caribbean,” says Guirec, explaining his route. At the Caribbean, he worked for a year to get his boat ready for ice, as he headed North through Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands, on to Greenland. “After wintering in autarky in the ice, I sailed through the Northwest Passage under the Arctic Circle, and became the youngest sailor to cross it without any assistance,” he says. Next stop, Alaska, followed by San Francisco, before setting sail on a long stretch through Cape Horn, Antarctica, South Africa, Brazil, French Guiana, the Caribbean again and back to France. Monique, meanwhile, had no problems with the swinging of the boat and was out and about most of the time. “She loves fish and soon become very good at catching the flying fish on the deck,” says Guirec. The rest of the day for Monique was spent at leisure as she sat back taking in the scenes and watching her friend do all the hard work.  Throughout the voyage the two spent the nights on Guirec’s boat, except in Canada, where the hull needed to be fixed. Guirec never planned how long he would dock at each city. But he was keen on spending a few months, at Saqqaq in Greenland. “The plan was to spend the Arctic winter trapped in the ice. By that I mean, the boat stuck in the ice. I chose a remote bay and dropped anchor waiting for the ice floe to form around the hull,” he says. He had also willingly planned to be cut off from civilisation with no food other than some rice, no communication or connection with anybody. The temperature was -60 degree Celsius and most of the time was spent inside the cabin on board. “I spent four months like that with Monique,” says Guirec. Fortunately for him, Monique laid eggs the entire time. It was hard to source food and his fishing through the ice did not quite work out. He was told that a stressed hen would not give eggs. But given this globetrotting hen’s record, she seemed far from stressed. “She is a special chick,” he says. As he travelled, he paused at port cities to make money: fixing boats, giving kite-surfing lessons, cleaning swimming pools and working at nautical beach schools. That is how he managed to pay off the port fee and buy food. Once the international media started taking note of him, he was able to sell a few images that he shot of himself, Monique, the high seas and the surroundings. “The challenge was to manage on my own and hold on to my dream,” says Guirec, adding that he who had no skills in sailing solo, nor in sailing far from shore. “Everybody thought I was crazy to leave like that with a boat in bad shape. But I am the happiest man in the world to have succeeded and lived through it,” he says. He is already chalking out his next adventure. “It’ll take place in 2021, on a faster and bigger boat. But before that, in November, I am crossing the Atlantic in a small paddle boat. This time without Monique.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-hen-who-doesnt-give-a-cluck/article32737838.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Wheels of yore||The Chevrolet Fleetmaster is a bonafide headturner; one of those cars that was oft-featured in films of the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s. The novelty of having grown up around the car is perhaps what makes the Fleetmaster a coveted possession among vintage car enthusiasts in the city. The lockdown, however, made it harder for the collectors to connect with their passion, especially since these automobiles need to be tended to a lot more than your average car. “It was such a hassle. We didn’t have the mechanics and the shops were also shut. These cars have to be started at least once a month. If you don’t, the brakes get jammed, the carburettors get clogged, and because our fuel content is high on sulphur, we also encounter a lot of issues with the cars’ fuel systems, if left unattended,” says Ranjit Pratap, managing director, Rayala Corporation. But the lockdown was also a blessing in disguise, for these hobbyists also bought cars like never before. Ranjit, who owns 85 vintage cars, describes the situation with a laugh: “An idle mind is the devil’s workshop,” and adds that he purchased six vintage models — including a Toyota Camry and a 1975 Toyota Land Cruiser. “I have no place left to park in my garage now,” he exclaims. Durable passion This past Sunday, for the first time since lockdown in March, as many as 15 vintage cars, including the aforementioned Fleetmaster, rolled down Kamarajar Salai near Marina Beach for much-needed fresh air; the cars and its owners embarked on a short rally towards OMR. “It is a nice feeling since the pandemic restricted us from moving around for so long. But this is a passion and we want to share the enthusiasm,” says Ranjit, who is also president of Historical Cars Association of India. “We usually do activities for Madras Week, which wasn’t possible this year. So we thought we would combine both occasions and organised the rally,” he adds. Held to mark World Tourism Day, which fell on September 27, the rally had a 1949 Cadillac, a 1949 Buick, a Mini Cooper, Jaguars, Mustangs and Mercedes’ besides other vintage models. “If the situation gets better next year, we plan on doing more rallies and exhibitions as before,” says Ranjit. At 60, VS Kylas, who is the secretary of Historical Cars Association of India — and for whom owning a vintage car is not just about the novelty — describes himself as a “do-it-yourself” person when it comes to restoring his cars. “These cars were built to last generations,” he says. Likewise for V Durai Mohan, who owns Varadharaja theatre in Chitlapakkam, and for whom collecting vintage cars started as a serious business over 25 years ago. He counts the 1924 Chevrolet he owns as the most prized among the dozen vintage cars he owns. Their passion is set to carry over to the next generation. A good example is one of the participants at Sunday’s rally, 24-year-old Abhinav Shankar, the son of Shankar Sundaram of Amalgamations Group. The Automobile Engineering student calls himself an aspiring collector, and speaks passionately of gasoline-powered cars. The first time he drove a vintage car was a few months after he turned 18, when his father asked him to drive the 1975 Mini 1275 GT to the Puducherry rally. “It is something that has since grown on me,” he says. Prior to the pandemic, vintage car owners routinely convened for a weekend trip to Mamallapuram. Ranjit now encourages automobile lovers to take enough safeguards and slowly resume pursuing their interests, like going on a road trip. “This pandemic is not going to leave us at least for the next one year or so. I’m not saying we should be careless, but we cannot lock ourselves up. You have to be cautious, take enough precautions and then enjoy yourself to the extent possible.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wheels-of-yore/article32737805.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||On the pineapple tart express||“To tell you the truth, I am a little shattered,” confesses Nasrin Karimi over phone from her newest avatar of Shiraz. The elegant restaurant, popular for its delicate Persian food, laced with dried mint, rosewater and saffron, launched at the Cholamandal Artists’ Village in 2010, and moved locations twice after that. Early this year, Shiraz moved again, this time to a beachside café in Neelankarai, and Nasrin was just settling into her new space when COVID-19 struck. She quickly pivoted into delivery, creating a flexible new menu featuring classics, like berry pulao, chelo kebabs and ghormeh sabzi (a comforting stew bursting with the freshness of cilantro and celery). She also began baking cakes for lockdown birthdays: her Shiraz cake, woven with saffron, pistachios and almond, and the ‘Persian love cake,’ a fluffy sponge slathered with fresh cream, pistachios and rose water. However, realising that a keeping a large restaurant runninng is impractical now, given current physical distancing norms, she has relocated again, this time to a small space in Akkarai. “This Shiraz will be more affordable. And I will focus on sea food — locally caught crabs, prawn and fish,” she explains. The menu will also feature easy takeaway food: a range of sandwiches (tuna, chicken, cheese), sausage rolls, tall glasses of guava-barley slush and steamy cups of saffron tea. Ideal for picnics on ECR, now that people are slowly venturing out again on weekends. Honestly, after six months on the couch, a sandwich in the car sounds like a delightful adventure!

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||‘The best is yet to come’||“It is supposed to be played like this,” says percussionist Thumba Raja holding up a risa risa . The hand-held instrument, a hollow wooden cylinder with indentations on its surface, has an accompanying stick which is run along the surface to create a light percussive sound. “But, in Rahman recordings, I play like this,” says Raja, wedging the instrument between his thigh and that chair and proceeds to strike its hollow top — creating a muffled percussive sound that has never been heard before. That is AR Rahman for you. And, this scene from an episode of National Geographic’s Mega Icons Season 2 about the composer’s journey, rightly captures his creative whims. Shot in the style of a documentary, the episode promises to be a comprehensive retelling of Rahman’s journey. And, the pitfall of being comprehensive? Most of what is told is already known to an Indian audience. But, for an international audience, the narrative takes a fresher’s course on the musician. Born into music A big part of what Rahman remembers from his childhood is taken up by his father RK Shekhar’s battle with cancer for three years. “But, the aura of his [father’s] musicianship and humanity set up the whole foundation for my character. ” says Rahman, wearing his characteristic smile in an interview over a Zoom call from his Chennai home. He had just finished his evening prayers. “My mother [Kareema Begum] had suffered a lot of humiliation. After my father’s passing, she was in control of business, renting out the equipment and some of the relatives were jealous of it. But, she stayed strong and lived for us [him and his sisters] and is still living for us,” he continues. His mother was also the one responsible for pushing him to take up music professionally, as early as when he was a seven-year-old, carrying rented equipment for concerts. And, while receiving the Oscar in 2009 for Best Original Score and Best Original Music Score for Slumdog Millionaire , as part of the acceptance speech, he said, “ Mere paas maa hai [I have my mother with me].” In 1999, he set up his first home studio in Chennai. A one-man space, the studio would often see Rahman flit between multiple roles — from recording and editing to arranging and even propping up the mic. “What it taught me was to be independent, to be free. The freedom of not getting judged by others and listening to your own thing; that’s what changed me. It’s unfortunate to see that a lot of people still need someone to do things for them, like even setting up a chair. But, if I have to set up a mic stand, I do it myself.” He adds that he enjoys seclusion. “I don’t want 10 people hanging around with me. When I am ideating, I like to be alone,” says the composer. And, he is not someone who likes to plan — “My mind sets a tone. There are many gurus for every creative person. Even though we don’t directly get influenced, we are indirectly inspired by different collections, groups and bands. Then you play with the tools and see what can be done.” The sound of Michael Jackson particularly inspired him. “The production, perfection, detail and how it would pop out of the speakers was just fascinating. Not just as an artiste but how under his umbrella, people excelled. That set an example for us. Even now, when we want to test a speaker, we play Michael Jackson.” The journey inward Rahman is of the opinion that the “best is always yet to come”. He adds that he has been lucky in this journey: “Getting everything mostly on the first attempt — be it my first movie, Western musical or Hollywood movie.” 2020 too has been a busy year — from finishing the track ‘Hum Haar Nahi Maanenge’ to revisiting the ambitious virtual reality musical Le Musk, currently in post production. “The tools are changing, and it is becoming cheaper and less cumbersome,” explains Rahman. “One of the beautiful things I learned this year is that ‘the moment you know that you know is when you don’t know. The sense of discovery is more interesting in life than knowing something absolute,” concludes Rahman. “It creates curiosity and this creates the art... the ‘what if’.”  AR Rahman’s episode in Mega Icons Season 2 will premiere on National Geographic on October 4, 7pm. It will also be available on Disney + Hotstar VIP.   ‘SPB was a superman’   The composer reminisces his time with the legendary singer: “Forty thousand songs is like almost 1,000 people’s bandwidth. Some people do 20 songs in their lifetime. And, he succeeds everytime. In January, I saw a recording of him singing ‘En Kadhale’ and it sounded just the same. In fact, after seeing the recording, I called him and said, ‘why don’t we take songs that you have not sung for me, of the past 10 years, and do an unplugged version?’ He was very excited. We almost planned the recording and even the arrangement was fixed and that’s when COVID-19 happened. There’s no use brooding over his loss, we should celebrate him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-best-is-yet-to-come/article32737828.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||A PowerPoint from||Aditya Kamat logged into work from a bench under the cover of trees, basking in misty sunshine. The IT professional shifted base from his home in Bengaluru to Pollibetta hills in Coorg, where he stayed at the Porcupine Castle Resort with a friend on a workcation. India’s hill stations and beaches are slowly coming alive again as professionals, who have been working from home since the first lockdown in March, escape the monotony of being confined to their houses. “As one can be location neutral now, my work was not hampered. Trekking and bird-watching filled our leisure time,” says 24-year-old Aditya. Prashant Shekhar Singh, a software engineer based in Noida, has been on a workcation for the last 20 days in Kasol, Himachal Pradesh, and plans to stay for another 10 days. Pune-based brand consultant Arjun Samaddar set off on a road trip to Kerala with his wife and four-year-old daughter soon after Karnataka opened its borders in September. At the time of writing, the trio has been on road for 24 days; they did stopovers at Gokarna, Coorg and a longer break at Coral and Cliff, Varkala in Kerala. Recharging batteries A workcation helps the city-weary traveller caught between work-from-home and work-at-home to blur the line between work and leisure. It also helps the hospitality industry, which has been reeling under the economic impact of lockdown. “There is a trend of people opting for longer stays to either spend time with family and friends in other cities or to work remotely,” says Amanpreet Bajaj, general manager, Airbnb India, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. “In the past three months, 45% of searches by travellers have been for unique accommodations such as tree houses, farm stays, lodges and campsites,” he adds. So popular is the trend that Govind Gaur, co-founder of travel community WanderOn, has founded a new company and named it Workcations. It is not just individuals. Families and corporates are also making the most of these curated packages. “In Goa, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and certain places in Karnataka and Maharashtra, individuals and families have rented houses for periods ranging from one week to two months,” adds Govind, who plans to begin workcations for teams in MNCs. Travel services company Thomas Cook offers stays at picturesque destinations all over India; its packages range from rejuvenating Ayurveda packages in Kerala to a taste of royalty in Jaipur or wildlife safaris in Rathambore, Rajasthan and beachscapes in Mamallapuram. “Given the pent up demand for travel and in the absence of a summer vacation this year, Indian consumers are seeking opportunities to avail themselves of quick breaks around the country, to destinations that are located at short, drivable distances,” says Rajeev Kale, president & country head — Holidays, MICE, Visa, Thomas Cook (India). Packaged goodness Homestays, boutique hotels, resorts and hotel chains in hill stations, besides beachside and upmarket properties in metros, too, are rising to the occasion with curated packages that follow safety protocols, have excellent WiFi connection, and also offer memorable stay-and-work options. Sterling, ITC and GRT Hotels and Resorts are some of the majors in the hospitality industry offering ‘workcations’ on their prime properties. “We noticed a spike in the number of weekend travellers. Accessibility and digital connectivity are the two main criteria. Guests prefer spacious rooms with access to open and green spaces,” says Vikram Lalvani, chief of sales, Revenue and Destinations, Sterling Holiday Resorts. The green outdoors is the USP of Yercaud-based Shambala, for instance. “Situated inside a coffee plantation, cottages are spread out on the property and there is alfresco dining,” says proprietor Deepa Palaniappan. While ITC Hotels and GRT Hotels and Resorts offer one-day packages, in addition to longer packages for customers on some of their prime properties in the Indian metros and other cities, Sterling and certain homestays insist on a certain number of days for those availing themselves of the workcation packages. “We have ‘Staycation’, ‘Daycation’ and ‘Workcation’ packages for all hotels post lockdown relaxation. Included in the package are free meals, upgrades, stay for kids, sightseeing and so on,” explains Pooja Parameswaran, marketing manager, GRT Hotels and Resorts. To assure customers of a safe travel environment, many leading hospitality chains and travel companies have tied up with healthcare providers to conceptualise safety protocols at different stages of a client’s journey. However, rules regarding travel are fluid and keep changing from one State to another. Thus, it is necessary to have updated information on COVID-19 related travel regulations. Veterans in the hospitality and travel industry feel that the pandemic’s impact will be felt in 2021 as well. As companies cut back on office space, thus saving money on rent, it is likely that even post-pandemic a percentage of people will continue to work-from-home. As Govind says, “Workcations are likely to be in demand in 2021 as well. The nature of the demand might be different but workcation is here to stay.” (With inputs fromAnusuya Menon)  Top workcation choices Rajasthan and Goa are the top destinations, followed by Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-powerpoint-from/article32737834.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Sweet tales from a seaside town||When the dust of the day settles and people wait out the afternoon sun indoors, the ‘ puttu kaara paati ’ arrives. She walks from one street to another in the seaside village of Kayalpattinam in Thoothukudi, a basket balanced on her head, singing-announcing fresh puttu . The old woman — her name is Samudrakani — was a fixture in Jariya Azeez’s childhood. “She’s unable to walk long distances now, so doesn’t sell puttu any more,” says Jariya over phone. Twenty-eight-year-old Jariya, who was raised in Chennai, is from Kayalpattinam. She runs Abati, a store that focusses on sustainable and handmade products, from her ancestral home in the town. During the course of curating products for her venture, she came across palm-based edibles such as puttu , paavu , and pudisakkaram . “These are locally produced and are popular in a few other villages around Kayalpattinam as well,” she explains. Made by families who have been in the business for generations, they are sold in small quantities in the villages during summer. “But these delicacies have been confined to our region; not many people outside are aware of them,” points out Jariya. Which is why during lockdown, she decided to document the making of these desserts. She met and interviewed families involved. “Puttu,” explains Jariya, “Is available for six months a year. In Kayalpattinam, there are a handful of families making it. The men head out early in the day to climb palm trees and bring down padhaneer (palm sap).” The preparation is mostly done by the women in the family. They empty fermented palm sap into huge cauldrons and stir them over a wood-fired stove until it takes on a golden colour. “Then the flavouring is added: this can be mango, dry ginger, moong dal , sesame seeds, coconut, or cashews,” says Jariya. This concoction is then poured into moulds and let to harden. So puttu , in essence, is flavoured palm jaggery. “To make paavu , the women continue to stir the same mixture until it takes on a thick, fudge-like consistency,” she adds. “Rice flour is added to this mixture to make pidisakkaram that derives its name from ‘pidi’, meaning, to shape by hand.” Jariya laughs as she recalls how her great grandmother stored the jaggery in earthen pots, hung high up from the ceiling, out of reach of children. Today, if you visit Kayalpattinam or its neighbouring villages in the summer months, you can buy flavoured jaggery by the kilo. “But these days, though, the women make them only in small batches as per demand.” Jariya, with help from Mohideen MSL and Mubarak VMH, both college students from the town, and Ahamed Mujahidha, a local, is making a documentary film on the process. “I remember how in the past, women from our village would walk to nearby Poonthottam, where paavu was made every summer. They carried coconut, fruits, and vegetables of their choice and handed them over to the paavu makers, waited until it was done and brought the dish back home,” she recalls. These days, though, this practice has become a thing of the past. “These are signs that this craft is dying, and we wanted to document it to showcase this to our future generations and the outside world,” explains Jariya. This summer, Jariya even sold the desserts on her Instagram page. In a hand-woven palm box, she packaged 50 grams each of five different flavours of the jaggery in small, colourful palm leaf pouches; a box of paavu ; a multi-millet mix; and a sweet seeni maavu made of rice flour and coconut milk. “I wanted to share what Kayalpattinam had to offer with everyone else; we take pride in what we make and designed this assortment as an alternative to a box of chocolates,” she adds. The jaggery and the seeni maavu can be incorporated into breakfast. “They can be added as topping to a lot of dishes, had with tea... paavu can be used like jam.” ‘ Puttu paati ’ Samudrakani, meanwhile, despite not stepping out for work, is hale and healthy. Jariya and team met her recently for their documentary. She even posed for a photo with them, sporting dark glasses.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Cake of good hope||The lockdown was tough on the inhabitants of Little Drops, a shelter for destitute people and the aged, in Porur. They stopped getting visitors, many of whom make donations to help meet the needs of the women. “Corona pushed us to a corner,” says Edgar Paul, who started the shelter with a friend in 1991 “with just Rs. 500 in hand”. They rescued people from the streets, and gave them food and shelter. Today, Little Drops has nine branches across Tamil Nadu and two outside the State too, and looks after as many as 1,000 people. Realising that they needed to keep their spirits up as well as support themselves financially now, an idea occurred to Edgar: why not start a patisserie? Just a month old, Madico’s kitchen is now in the able hands of Stephanie Govinda, who has 35 years of experience as a cabin crew member with Indian Airlines. “She is the cakes in-charge,” smiles Edgar. Stephanie does all the baking at home, and keeps the glass shelves of the bakery filled with fresh sandwiches as well. “Right now, we have egg, cheese, vegetable, and paneer sandwiches, apart from puffs, bondas , and vadas ,” says Stephanie. The team also plans to involve women from Rehoboth Home for the mentally challenged. “Things should fall in place in a month,” says Edgar. Come Deepavali and Christmas, they hope to involve people at the shelter in making sweets. There isbiryanitoo on the anvil, as well as easy-on-the-pocket variety rice options — such as lemon and curd rice for Rs. 15 — for those struggling to make ends meet. “By working together, we hope to finance our medical needs ourselves,” he adds. “This is one major expenditure for us,” he points out. For, most of their residents were abandoned due to one medical condition or another since their families could not afford to treat them. Instead, if all goes according to plan, they will be able to support themselves. Edgar says that plans are afoot to introduce live vada and tea counters. The expertise will come from the elders in their dormitories. He says, “We have people with a culinary experience of 20 to 30 years with us; a man who ran a tea stall; another person who was into baking…there is no substitute for experience. This way, these people will get to pass on their knowledge to the next generation.”  Madico is located at 101/1, Kundrathur Main Road, Porur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cake-of-good-hope/article32737819.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||I believe I can fly||Gravity hardly seems a universal truth when Anusha Swamy is on the pole. Round and round she moves, twirling her arched legs around it as if cutting through water. In a one handed motion, she inverts herself until her hair falls away from her face, striking a graceful pose to the music of violins from the late SP Balasubrahmanyam’s ‘Thoda Thoda’. “Ask people what superpower they would want to have, and most would say flying,” says 29-year-old Anusha. Chasing after this freeing sensation, the multi-hyphenate choreographer who has worked for movies such as Maryan and Shuddh Desi Romance , has found her latest passion — pole art. “When you’re on the pole, it feels like you are flying. But at the same time, you are in complete control of your body. If you’re not in control, you will fall, so it keeps you at a higher level of consciousness.” After just one class in Melbourne last year, on an introduction to pole art, Anusha had a pole installed in her Chennai home in March this year. “A friend of mine ordered it from the US and we self assembled it. I don’t think there are companies here who do that,” she says. Since then, she has been putting out videos of her pole dances on Instagram every few days, garnering over 73K views on her latest one. The songs of her choice include classics like Sid Sriram’s ‘Ennadi Mayavi Nee’ and Hariharan’s ‘Pachai Nirame’ — those that bring melody and rhythm to the pole and make her movements look soft and powerful at the same time. There is a bigger reason behind the selection of these songs, she explains, “The pole fitness community abroad is huge. They take it as seriously as we take Classical dance. But here pole dance is associated with eroticism. Like, if you’re on a pole, you’re a stripper.” With these well-loved songs, she hopes to break the art form free from that idea and earn respect for the strength it requires. “Pole dancing needs full body strength: upper body to pull yourself up against gravity, core to hold on to the pole without using your arms, and lower body to perform mid-air inversions. So it is a combination of strength, flexibility and endurance,” she says. Anusha recalls how she would practise day in and out when she first got the pole, resulting in a shoulder injury. “My trainers sat me down and made me realise that I was trying to get the perfection of Day 1,000, on Day 1. So after that, I started taking it step by step. They moulded my fitness training around the pole, working on my hip strength, core ability and pull-ups.” With this level of fitness also comes a confidence boost — “it makes you feel powerful, every time you unlock the next feat or trick,” says Anusha. This is why, by next year she hopes to start a community of pole artists in South India, as Indian pole artists are far and few in between. “The pole is for everybody but for women especially, I think it’s a great way to interact with each other,” she says, adding, “I don’t think I would have survived the lockdown if not for the pole.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-believe-i-can-fly/article32737844.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||A voice like SPB||‘Mouna Raagam’ Murali’s orchestra did 78 shows with SP Balasubrahmanyam in the last 12 years, the highest that any musical band did with the maestro. With him on stage, Murali never sang SPB songs. “When the original is present, how can I dare?,” he would tell the audience. Today, he is unable to fathom what made him break the rule just two months ago. Through the lockdown, Murali has been streaming live musical programmes for two hours daily on Facebook. To mark the 100th day, on July 18, he invited SPB, who willingly offered to come to the studio. While SPB sang from his playlist, Murali rendered ‘Iru Manam Konda’ from Avargal . “Before starting, I told him this was the first and the last time I was singing his song in front of him. He gave a thumbs up and even corrected and appreciated my rendition. But I never imagined my words would turn true in this manner,” he says. Now, Murali has decided to sing only SPB songs for all his live shows hereafter. “I will vigorously plan more shows and sing Balu sir’s devotional songs.” A seven-minute song penned and composed by Murali for the Tamil Nadu Police department highlighting their work in a positive way was scheduled to be recorded in SPB’s voice. “But destiny has thrust it upon me; I will sing it now,” says Murali, who has been associated with the singer since 2008.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Delhi’s early visitor||It was August 22, 2020, and with the pandemic travel guidelines slightly lifted, I made a quick dash to Gurugram to catch up with a former intern who was leaving for Oxford University. I hadn’t expected to hear the shrill, loud disyllabic ‘chee-wee’ cry of the Greenish Warbler, in a stray wild patch outside her high-rise apartment. I silently excused myself and recorded the call of this dainty medium-sized (10 cm) warbler on my phone. A few birds are fairly easy to spot, owing to their size, colour, and behaviour, but not this one, of the leaf-warbler species, the members of which are so similar in appearance it’s difficult to differentiate one from the other: brightly coloured and slim in appearance. The timid behaviour of inhabiting the canopies of trees (where they feed on insects) and flittering around from branch to branch, often makes a skittish bird like the Greenish Warbler ( Phylloscopus trochiloides ) hard to spot through the thick foliage. The term Phylloscopus has been derived from the Greek words phullon meaning ‘leaf’ and skopos meaning ‘seeker’. The Greenish Warbler is one of the earliest migrants to travel from its breeding grounds in Europe to our region late in August, before moving further to South India in November, though a few stray birds do stick around until later. The bird has a pale greyish-olive plumage above and dull clean white breast, with a dusky grey wash to the sides. Like most arboreal warblers feeding in the canopy of trees, the Greenish Warbler has thin legs (dark in this species) unlike the stouter legs in other kinds of warblers that prefer to feed on ground. The spiky bill and reflexes help them catch insects in air. The species has a strong clearly marked head pattern with a long yellowish-white supercilium (eyebrow), prominent white ring around the eye, and a broad eyestripe. Typically, they have a short square-shaped tail and the wings have a single short, quite broad yellowish-white wingbar. Sometimes there is a second narrower wingbar difficult to see on the field. Both sexes are similar looking, and they’re mostly found singly or in pairs. They mostly nest in shrubs, to avoid predatory attacks in high trees. Although found in a variety of habitats and altitudes, they are forest-dwellers. In the city, look for them in wooded areas: gardens with old dense trees, and places like Vasant Kunj, Saket, and North Campus. One way of identifying them is to look for fidgety birds that flick their wings and occasionally their tails. Another way, is to listen for the ‘chee-wee’.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The hen who doesn’t give a cluck||Monique the hen has probably travelled to more countries than you have. And no, she is not smug about it. She just clucks and goes about her life, laying an egg a day. The now seven-year-old, met Guirec Soudée when he had docked at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, during the course of his world cruise. He adopted the six-month-old hen and they have been inseparable since. As a 20-year-old, Guirec set off on what he calls his “dream journey” in 2013. His choice of transport: a rusty, motorised fishing boat with a small diesel engine for manoeuvres in ports, or to escape the current when there is no wind. He named it Yvinec, after the French island that is his home. The sailing expedition took him five years to complete. He received a hero’s welcome when he returned. Though, he admits, it was hard to come back and not find his father at home. “He passed away while I was on the high seas,” he says. Since then Guirec has become a local celebrity with three books ( The Hen Who Sailed The World, Le Monde Selon Guirec et Monique and La Fabuleuse Histoire de Guirec et Monique) to his credit as well as a 60-minute documentary titled Du Pôule Nord au Pôule Sud. “We started the theatre tour with it in France in January this year and received more than 10,000 spectators. But due to the pandemic, we had to cancel everything.” Last week, the documentary was screened at Le Grand Rex, one of the biggest theatres in Paris. (With physical distancing, they could accommodate only an audience of 1,700.) For now, the 28-year-old is more than happy to recount his adventure over an email interview onboard Yvinec. “I first crossed the Atlantic leaving France from Brittany, stopped by Spain, Portugal, Madeira, Canary Islands then straight to the Caribbean,” says Guirec, explaining his route. At the Caribbean, he worked for a year to get his boat ready for ice, as he headed North through Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands, on to Greenland. “After wintering in autarky in the ice, I sailed through the Northwest Passage under the Arctic Circle, and became the youngest sailor to cross it without any assistance,” he says. Next stop, Alaska, followed by San Francisco, before setting sail on a long stretch through Cape Horn, Antarctica, South Africa, Brazil, French Guiana, the Caribbean again and back to France. Monique, meanwhile, had no problems with the swinging of the boat and was out and about most of the time. “She loves fish and soon become very good at catching the flying fish on the deck,” says Guirec. The rest of the day for Monique was spent at leisure as she sat back taking in the scenes and watching her friend do all the hard work.  Throughout the voyage the two spent the nights on Guirec’s boat, except in Canada, where the hull needed to be fixed. Guirec never planned how long he would dock at each city. But he was keen on spending a few months, at Saqqaq in Greenland. “The plan was to spend the Arctic winter trapped in the ice. By that I mean, the boat stuck in the ice. I chose a remote bay and dropped anchor waiting for the ice floe to form around the hull,” he says. He had also willingly planned to be cut off from civilisation with no food other than some rice, no communication or connection with anybody. The temperature was -60 degree Celsius and most of the time was spent inside the cabin on board. “I spent four months like that with Monique,” says Guirec. Fortunately for him, Monique laid eggs the entire time. It was hard to source food and his fishing through the ice did not quite work out. He was told that a stressed hen would not give eggs. But given this globetrotting hen’s record, she seemed far from stressed. “She is a special chick,” he says. As he travelled, he paused at port cities to make money: fixing boats, giving kite-surfing lessons, cleaning swimming pools and working at nautical beach schools. That is how he managed to pay off the port fee and buy food. Once the international media started taking note of him, he was able to sell a few images that he shot of himself, Monique, the high seas and the surroundings. “The challenge was to manage on my own and hold on to my dream,” says Guirec, adding that he who had no skills in sailing solo, nor in sailing far from shore. “Everybody thought I was crazy to leave like that with a boat in bad shape. But I am the happiest man in the world to have succeeded and lived through it,” he says. He is already chalking out his next adventure. “It’ll take place in 2021, on a faster and bigger boat. But before that, in November, I am crossing the Atlantic in a small paddle boat. This time without Monique.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-hen-who-doesnt-give-a-cluck/article32737516.ece
01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Sweet tales from a seaside town||When the dust of the day settles and people wait out the afternoon sun indoors, the ‘ puttu kaara paati ’ arrives. She walks from one street to another in the seaside village of Kayalpattinam in Thoothukudi, a basket balanced on her head, singing-announcing fresh puttu . The old woman — her name is Samudrakani — was a fixture in Jariya Azeez’s childhood. “She’s unable to walk long distances now, so doesn’t sell puttu any more,” says Jariya over phone. Twenty-eight-year-old Jariya, who was raised in Chennai, is from Kayalpattinam. She runs Abati, a store that focusses on sustainable and handmade products, from her ancestral home in the town. During the course of curating products for her venture, she came across palm-based edibles such as puttu , paavu , and pudisakkaram . “These are locally produced and are popular in a few other villages around Kayalpattinam as well,” she explains. Made by families who have been in the business for generations, they are sold in small quantities in the villages during summer. “But these delicacies have been confined to our region; not many people outside are aware of them,” points out Jariya. Which is why during lockdown, she decided to document the making of these desserts. She met and interviewed families involved. “Puttu,” explains Jariya, “Is available for six months a year.

01 October 2020||October 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The big top on your laptop||“I received so many messages, paintings, cards and phone calls from children across India,” says Biju Pushkaran, a clown with Rambo Circus. He is overwhelmed by the response to their maiden online show ‘Life in a Circus: Save the Circus’ that was held on September 25. Last week, in an innovation triggered by the pandemic, Rambo Circus went virtual. A month before this digital show, a fully made-up Biju, performed in an empty big top for the first time along with 30 other artistes in a one-hour scripted, directed show. ‘Life is a Circus’, relayed eight times over the weekend, was a sell out. Biju has been the clown at Rambo Circus for 21 years and was hoping to represent India at the Monte Carlo International Circus Festival this year. However, COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the festival as well as the first leg of Rambo Circus’ scheduled launch at Airoli in Navi Mumbai. “We had put up the big tent and our artistes were getting ready. We were stranded there with 100 artistes from different parts of India. With the help of the local police and corporators, we managed to send 40 people back but the others had to be looked after,” says Sujith Dilip, one of the proprietors of the Pune-based circus company. Dinesh Shetty of Production Crew and Navneeth Mohan and Saurab Khurana of LaQshya Live Experiences came up with the idea of a digital circus. “We were figuring out ways to help artistes and get entertainment going. We thought of the circus, which was scheduled to come to town,” says Navneeth, adding: “The circus is already a dying art form and the present generation do not know how much fun it is. We wanted to bring it to them in these times of isolation.” Dinesh discussed the concept with the artistes, explaining the alterations required for a digital show. Dance choreographer Rahul Saxena choreographed the show and Vipul Roy narrated the story of the pandemic-affected circus. The tent with a capacity to host an audience of 1,200 was put up with the help of 30 artistes and supporting staff. Dinesh says that help from industry vendors poured in. “As it was not a live show, we had to amp up the effects,” he says. After a week of diligent rehearsals, the final show was staged. When the lights came on, a gamut of aerial acts, ladder balance, juggling feats, clown comedy and more unfolded. Some popular acts were missing either because of the manpower needed for big equipment or because the artists had gone home. But for Rambo Circus, this was a watershed moment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-big-top-on-your-laptop/article32737917.ece

01 October 2020||Srinagar,||Bodies of Rajouri youths will be exhumed: police||Three families from Rajouri, whose kin were killed in an encounter on July 18 in south Kashmir’s Shopian, will be allowed to exhume their bodies, the police said on Wednesday. “Since the DNA samples matched with the families, the three dead bodies will be exhumed and handed over to families after the due process of law,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar told The Hindu . The district administration of Rajouri has approached the families to begin the process. “We have been called by the Rajouri administration for consultations. We demand immediate exhumation of bodies of our sons, compensation, and punishment to those involved in the fake encounter,” Muhammad Yousuf, father of one of the victims, said. The graveyard where the bodies were buried after the encounter is located in north Kashmir’s Baramulla, far from civilian areas. Three youth from the Pir Panjal valley’s Rajouri, identified as Abrar Ahmed (25), Imtiyaz Ahmed (20) and Mohammed Ibrar (16), were termed “unidentified militants” after a joint operation conducted by the police and the Army on July 18 in Shopian’s Amshipora area. However, three families from Rajouri contested the security forces’ version, claiming all three to be labourers who went missing the day the encounter was carried out. On September 25, the DNA samples of the slain youth was found to match that of the families. The police have arrested two locals, including a Special Police Officer from Poonch, so far. They are accused of “tipping off about the presence of militants in the area”.  ‘Incriminating material’ The police claim to have recovered “incriminating materials, including arms and ammunition, at the site of encounter”. The Army has already initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima facie answerable.  The three bodies will be exhumed and handed over to families after due process of law Vijay KumarInspector General of Police||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bodies-of-rajouri-youths-will-be-exhumed-police/article32737529.ece
01 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana farmers protest outside markets||Farmers in some parts of Haryana staged a protest outside grains market under the aegis of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) against the alleged delay in procurement of paddy, besides in support of their demands, including to relax the moisture content limit. The Centre had last week advanced Kharif paddy procurement, allowing operations to begin on September 26, instead of the scheduled date of October 1, but the farmers in Haryana alleged that the procurement was yet to begin. Additional Chief Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, P.K. Das, did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a response on the matter. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains claimed that farmers in Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, Ambala and Panchkula staged protests outside the grains market and blocked roads. Demands BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni told The Hindu over the phone that the farmers were demanding to raise the moisture content limit for procurement to 22%. “Since the farmers do not have space to dry paddy before bringing it to the grains market, we have been demanding that the government procure those with higher moisture content. We are also ready for price cut as per the moisture content. The government has agreed to marginally increase the moisture content limit to 18-19% from the 17%, but it is not enough,” said Mr. Charuni, who also addressed the agitating farmers at Pehowa and Ismailabad in Kurukshetra. He also demanded that the farmers be allowed to bring their crops to the market as per their convenience soon after it is harvested, instead of the government imposing a schedule on them. He alleged that the government has yet to start the procurement, causing resentment among the farmers. Sandeep Beniwal, commission agent, Samalkha New Grains Market, said a few farmers gathered to stage a protest in the mandi against the delay in procurement. “Though farmers are bringing the paddy for the past few days, the procurement is yet to begin,” he said.  Since the farmers do not have space to dry paddy before bringing it to the grains market, we have been demanding that the government procure those with higher moisture content   Gurnam Singh Charuni BKU president||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-farmers-protest-outside-markets/article32737537.ece

01 October 2020||Guwahati,||Differences crop up within Meghalaya BJP||Differences have reportedly cropped up within the BJP in Meghalaya over State unit president Ernest Mawrie’s accusation of financial irregularities in two tribal councils ruled by ally National People’s Party (NPP). With two MLAs, the BJP is a minor constituent of the multi-party alliance government in the State headed by the NPP that also rules the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC) and the Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council (JHADC). A few days ago, Mr. Mawrie had gone hammer and tongs against the NPP, accusing it of large-scale embezzlement of funds in the two councils. He also took a swipe at NPP president and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma. On Tuesday, the BJP issued a letter to Mr. Mawrie, asking him why he did not consult other leaders of the party – primarily MLAs Alexander L. Hek and Sanbor Shullai – before going public with the affairs of the two councils. The BJP said no one had the right, not even the party president, to take decisions in a democratic system without consulting senior leaders. Senior NPP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong has, meanwhile, slammed the BJP for failing to bring the alleged financial irregularities in the GHADC and the JHADC to the coordination committee of the alliance partners. “The BJP has not filed any official complaint with the government on the issue of alleged corruption in the councils. It was unfortunate that the matter was made public before any discussion among the constituents of the alliance,” Mr. Tynsong said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/differences-crop-up-within-meghalaya-bjp/article32737531.ece
01 October 2020||New Delhi,||Mayors criticise AAP govt. over water bills claims||Mayors of the three municipal corporations here on Wednesday hit out at the Delhi government over claims of pending water bills of over Rs. 6,600 crore to the Delhi Jal Board. They said that they would take action to recover outstanding property tax dues for Delhi government buildings. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation alone needs to get nearly Rs. 10,000 crore in property tax, Mayor Anamika Mithilesh alleged. With nearly Rs. 2,500 crore worth of property tax due in each of the corporation’s four zones, she said. Properties of the Public Works Department, the Delhi Secretariat, Delhi Transco Limited, Delhi Jal Board among others have never given property tax to the corporation, alleged North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash. Mr. Prakash also hit out at the Delhi government for charging exorbitant commercial rates on water bills from municipal facilities. For the North Corporation, he added that while the principal amount to be paid was only Rs. 261, the remaining Rs. 2,173 was penalty and interest. With regard to property tax, the Delhi Jal Board had to pay Rs. 216 crore and another Rs. 293 crore as road cutting cost was owed, he said. East Mayor Nirmal Jain said that the DJB had owed the EDMC Rs. 175.52 crore, about which he had written to the Chief Minister and that the civic body’s water dues of Rs. 49 crore could be recovered from that amount. AAP reacts “It is unfortunate that all the three Mayors united to give completely fake figures to the media. They have made a joke of their offices.

01 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘We will make liquid to stop stubble burning’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that the Delhi government would start the process of preparing a fermented liquid solution to be sprayed on 800 hectares of land in the city where farmers practise stubble burning. At a press briefing, Mr. Kejriwal said all arrangements for spraying the solution on farm fields will be made by the Delhi government and will be provided free of cost to farmers. The process will be executed under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute and the cost of the implementation of the entire project is less than Rs. 20 lakh. A few days ago, he had also written to the Centre over the issue of stubble burning, which poses a health hazard for people in parts of North India, particularly Delhi. “October is starting tomorrow. North India in its entirety is troubled by the smoke that covers the belt due to crop stubble burning every year. While Delhi and other cities have to suffer from the smoke, the farmers who are forced to burn the stubble and their villages have to suffer the most. Every responsible government must devise alternate systems for their farmers so that they are not forced to burn the stubble,” he said. “This year, the Pusa Research Institute has presented a very cheap alternate solution to the problem of stubble burning. They have formulated capsules, four capsules can be mixed with a liquid solution prepared by jaggery and gram flour and can be sprayed to cover one hectare of land,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The mixture, he said, when sprayed, softens hard straw and turns it into manure. This is a cheap alternative to stubble burning for farmers who usually start preparing for the next sowing season around October 15 every year. This schedule, he said, had also left no time for the Delhi government to have distributed capsules to farmers, training them and converting these capsules into a spray was a time-consuming process. So the Delhi government had decided to prepare the mixture itself under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute starting October 5, he said. “There are around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown following which stubble is collected and burned. The Delhi government will be starting the process of preparing this liquid solution by October 5 which will hopefully be completed by October 12-13 after which we will visit the farmers with the solution to be sprayed on their farmlands. The Delhi government will itself set up the entire spraying system through tractors on fields, free of cost for the farmers.After around 15-20 days, the stubble will soften and will convert into manure,” he also said.  The Delhi government will be starting the process of preparing this liquid solution by October 5 which will hopefully be completed by October 12-13 Arvind Kejriwal Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/we-will-make-liquid-to-stop-stubble-burning/article32737540.ece
01 October 2020||Guwahati,||Don’t allow recruitment board chief to quit: Cong.||The Opposition Congress in Assam has asked Governor Jagdish Mukhi not to let the chief of the State police recruitment board quit until the probe into the leaking of the question paper for appointing sub-inspectors is over. The Congress has also sought a directive to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for dropping Law and Justice Minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya because of his “close ties” with Bharatiya Janata Party leader Diban Deka, who is also an accused in the exam scandal. Mr. Deka has been absconding, along with another prime accused, former Deputy-Inspector General of Police Prasanta Kumar Dutta. The State police have announced cash awards for information on the duo believed to be either in Nepal or in one of Assam’s neighbouring States. “In the interest of a fair investigation, Pradeep Kumar should not be allowed to quit as Chairman of the State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB) till the probe is completed,” said Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Debabrata Saikia in a letter to Mr. Mukhi on September 29. He referred to Mr. Kumar’s statement that he had filed a complaint with the Crime Investigation Department in connection with the scam and had taken two accused – Mr. Deka and Gautam Mech – along before the former vanished. Mr. Kumar announced his resignation soon after.  ‘Drop Minister’ Mr. Saikia also referred to reports claiming Mr. Bhattacharya’s “close ties” with the absconding BJP leader. “As such, the Chief Minister should immediately drop Mr. Bhattacharya from the Council of Ministers, in consonance with parliamentary ethics,” he added. The Congress also sought a judicial inquiry into why a few private firms had been allowed to conduct “one controversy-marred recruitment test after another” during the tenure of the Sonowal Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dont-allow-recruitment-board-chief-to-quit-cong/article32737532.ece
01 October 2020||New Delhi,||Seroprevalence dips to 25% in Capital, HC told||The latest seroprevalence survey has found that the percentage of people in the Capital, who have antibodies against COVID-19, has reduced from 28.7% in August to 25.1% in September, the Delhi High Court was informed on Wednesday. “The seroprevalence has declined in North-West and Central districts but has increased in West, South, North-East and East districts,” said the report, which was submitted to the court. “Seroprevalence was found to be more in women during the three rounds of sero surveillance and least in the age group of 18-49 years, as compared to the age group of those below 18 years and those who are above 50 years,” it added. The conclusion of the sero surveillance-3 report is that there is a need to enhance the focus on sample representativeness of the survey in Central, North-West and north districts. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad took note of the report filed by the Delhi government.  Ramping up tests During the hearing, it also noted that despite directions to ramp up tests through RT PCR, it was not done adequately. “As against the testing capacity of 15,000 through RT PCR and other similar tests per day available in Delhi, the actual number of testing being conducted through this mode is still floating around 11,000 tests per day on an average,” the Bench said. The court has asked the Delhi government to submit its report by October 17, the next date of hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/seroprevalence-dips-to-25-in-capital-hc-told/article32737928.ece

Satyanarain, has constituted a three-member committee,” SP Arun Kumar Srivastava said. Earlier, a special investigation team (SIT) probing the case had said the bullet with which he was killed was fired from his own licensed pistol. The new committee will have Hamirpur ASP Santosh Kumar Singh, Baberu-Banda Circle Officer Anand Kumar Pandey and Inspector (Chitrakoot) Arun Pathak as members, the SP said, adding that Mahoba Sadar Circle officer Kalu Singh is currently probing the matter. The SIT probe had found that the bullet was fired from the front which had pierced through his neck and got entangled in the seat behind. Indrakant had levelled allegations of corruption against former Mahoba SP Manilal Patidar, who was suspended later. The trader was allegedly shot at under mysterious circumstances and succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Kanpur on September 13. The incident took place days after he had levelled allegations against Mr. Patidar. On September 9, Mr. Patidar was suspended with immediate effect by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/3-member-body-to-monitor-up-trader-death-probe/article32737546.ece
01 October 2020||Guwahati,||‘Probe molestation charge against Assam Rifles men’||A Mizoram-based rights organisation has asked the National Commission for Women (NCW) to probe the alleged molestation of two women by personnel of paramilitary Assam Rifles. The Zo Indigenous Forum said it wrote to the Commission on Tuesday after waiting more than a month for the Mizoram State Commission for Women to act on a letter with a similar plea. The forum said it requested NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma to take up the case of the two married women who were allegedly molested by Assam Rifles personnel near Sesih village in Champhai district bordering Myanmar on August 15. The two women were returning home from work at their ‘jhum’ (shifting cultivation) field in the evening when the alleged incident happened. The Assam Rifles authorities had trashed the allegation but said any complaint should be lodged with the officer heading the force. “An arrest warrant was issued on September 9 against the perpetrators following a complaint at the Champhai police station. It is learnt that no legal action has been taken till date,” said the forum’s coordinator, C. Lalremruata.  ‘Compensate victims’ He requested the NCW to penalise the authorities concerned for delaying the arrest of the culprits and issue a directive for compensating the victims. Mizoram’s Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Eastern Range) Lalhuliana said an arrest warrant was issued against an Assam Rifles soldier on September 9 but he could not be taken into custody as the paramilitary force wanted the case to be transferred to its own court. The Assam Rifles had sought an extension of the case during a hearing on it at the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Champhai town on Tuesday. The next hearing is on October 8, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/probe-molestation-charge-against-assam-rifles-men/article32737530.ece

A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said the other relief sought by the petitioner-lawyer, Kush Kalra, with regard to enhancing testing capacity in the Capital, use of indigenously developed kits, reformulating ICMR advisory on testing and validation of RAT kits were already being examined by it in another pending case. Mr. Kalra, in his plea, has contended that freely circulating the names of persons, who tested positive for COVID-19, to RWAs and on whatsapp groups was “leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention”. The petition has stated that COVID-19 positive persons “ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace and away from prying eyes”. It has claimed that this has resulted in persons “shying away and deliberately choosing not to test themselves” to shield themselves from “public embarrassment and stigmatisation” which is also caused by pasting posters outside homes of COVID-19 positive patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govts-reply-sought-on-plea-on-covid-19-posters/article32737534.ece

Noting a report furnished by a principal committee that made recommendations in favour of the Delhi Police, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said that the project could not be permitted due to the current state of the floodplains. “Having regard to the pitiable condition of river Yamuna, in spite of repeated directions of this Tribunal, what is necessary is stringent compliance of directions and not relaxation thereof. Activities which may be beneficial for the rejuvenation of the river like bio-diversity parks, artificial wetlands, afforestation and so on, are required and not the constructions.” “Idea of semi-permanent or temporary construction for utilisation of hte police officials may not be a very germane idea. Such requirement is not temporary. Alternatives for viable permanent constructions may need to be explored,” the Bench added. Referring to previous judgments of the Tribunal, the Bench observed, “The present project is right on the floodplains and has potential for generating solid waste and sewage unlike the project that was earlier allowed.” In 2015, the green panel had prohibited construction activity on the demarcated floodplain area and directed a principal committee to identify all existing structures which fall on the demarcated area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-building-on-yamuna-floodplains-plea-rejected/article32737545.ece
