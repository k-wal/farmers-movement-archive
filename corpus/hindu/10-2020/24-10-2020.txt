At a rally in Sasaram, his first in the poll-bound State, Mr. Modi clarified that the NDA in Bihar meant the BJP, the Janata Dal (United) [JD(U)], the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) [HAM(S)] and the Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP). He did not mention the Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). In the backdrop of the bitterness between the JD (U) and the LJP, with Mr. Paswan regularly attacking Mr. Kumar, it was much awaited what Mr. Modi would say on the issue.  Mr. Modi said, “For a self-reliant Bihar, an NDA government is necessary. We’re with Nitish Kumar for the development of Bihar, who got only three or four years to work and bring development to the State. For about 10 years, he was engrossed in battling the UPA government’ s politics of not allowing him to work.” The Prime Minister asserted that “even before the polls, people of Bihar have given their message… all surveys show that the NDA government will retain power”.  Article 370 Mr. Modi targeted the Opposition for “daring” to seek votes in the State while seeking restoration of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. “Everyone was waiting for Article 370 to be withdrawn but these people [Opposition] are saying they will revoke the decision once they are voted to power. And after making such statements, they dare to ask for votes from Bihar? Is this not an insult to the State, one which sends its sons and daughters to the borders to protect the country?” he said. Mr. Modi said the NDA government had worked for the development of the poor and the Dalits in the State. “Our government extended reservation to the poor and Dalits for 10 years.” Slamming the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, he said before the NDA rule, Bihar suffered from crime and corruption. “But now, there is no need for the lamp or the lantern in the State as it has electricity”. “People have decided that those who have a history of making Bihar bimaru will not be allowed to return in the State,” he said, in an oblique reference to the previous RJD governments. The RJD governments under Lalu Prasad and wife Rabri Devi were in power from 1990 to 2005.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bihar-needs-nitish-led-nda-govt-for-development-modi/article32933978.ece
24 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Using a city bus in the fight against drugs||Continuing with the work of using his fleet not only to ferry passengers but also for socially relevant causes, Dhiraj Alva, owner of Sri Ganesh Travels, has now one of his buses sporting stickers creating awareness on the harmful effects of drugs. This vehicle is among the five that operates on the State Bank-Mangaladevi Temple route in the city. Mr. Alva said that it was sad to see youngsters in the city getting addicted to drugs. “I am using my fleet to create awareness among people on issues of concern to society, more so, on the ill effects of using drugs that can ruin one’s life and also of one’s family,” he said. The stickers contain messages such as “Your life is in your hands”, “Drugs will be your doom” and “Life does not rewind” that are intermixed with drawings of drugs, alcohol and smoking. This was got done at the workshop of the travels company. “As this bus operates throughout the day, more people will get see these messages. I hope to see a positive impact on people,” said Mr. Alva, who is also president of the District City Bus Operators Association. In January this year, Mr. Alva got stickers containing Tulu vowels and hashtags #Tuluto8thschedule and #TuluofficiallnKA_KL pasted on one of his other bus in support of the demand for inclusion of Tulu in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. Two other vehicles of his also carry messages such as “Go Green” to save water and “Swachh Bharat Mission”. “Our buses are not just meant for travelling alone but they are also being used as a medium for creating awareness,” Mr. Alva said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/using-a-city-bus-in-the-fight-against-drugs/article32934804.ece
24 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Cabinet gives approval to upgrading Udupi District Govt. Hospital||In a boost to public health system, the State Cabinet has approved a proposal to construct a new building for the District Government Hospital in Udupi with 126 additional beds. It has also sanctioned 66 additional medical and para-medical staff. Udupi MLA K. Raghupati Bhat tweeted on Friday that it was a long pending demand of the people of Udupi. He congratulated the Chief Minister and the former and present Minister for Health and Family Welfare for giving approval to the new project in the Cabinet meeting on Thursday. The approval has been given 23 years after Udupi was carved out of Dakshina Kannada as a district, Mr. Bhat said. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Udupi B. Sadashiva Prabhu told The Hindu that with this, the total beds in the hospital will go up to 250 from 124. The staff strength will be go up to 195 from 129. District Surgeon and Medical Superintendent of the hospital Madhusudhan Nayak said that the new proposal, including the cost of building construction, salary of additional staff and some equipment, has been estimated at about Rs. 119 crore. Dr. Nayak said that existing building was constructed in 1961. Later, as the need arose, small extensions were constructed from time to time to add to the structure. Consequently, there are leakages in the roof of the building and maintenance problems as some buildings have concrete roof and others tile roof. The new building will have an operation theatre complex, laboratory facilities and in-patient wards. When the new building is ready, all facilities will come under a single roof. However, the present out-patient block, emergency block, geriatric wing (12 beds), burns ward (10 beds), Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Plus Centre, which were built a few years ago, would remain untouched, Dr. Nayak said. The old hospital building would be demolished in phases as the new building comes up without hampering medical services. Udupi district was carved out of Dakshina Kannada in 1997 by combining Udupi and erstwhile Kundapur and Karkala taluks. Though it is called the District Government Hospital, the hospital for all purposes, including infrastructure facilities, remained a taluk hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cabinet-gives-approval-to-upgrading-udupi-district-govt-hospital/article32934806.ece
24 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Maize procurement at Rs. 1,850 a quintal||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered procurement of maize by Telangana State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MARKFED) at a support price of Rs. 1,850 a quintal at food grains procurement centres to be opened in villages like in the last season. He made the announcement at a meeting with agriculture and civil supplies officials to discuss procurement of agricultural produce and regulated farming in the current season. He expressed dissatisfaction that the farmers cultivated maize in kharif despite a call by government restraining them from going for the crop as it was unlikely that they will get the support price. The government was actually not mandated to procure maize but farmers cultivated the crop despite being told not to go for it. Yet, with the sole objective to ensure that the farmers did not suffer losses, the government had decided to procure them in spite of financial drain on its resources. He warned that the government may not procure maize if it was again grown in the coming rabi. A release later said Mr. Rao recalled the government procuring nine lakh tonnes of maize through MARKFED at a cost of Rs. 1,668 crore in rabi last year. As the stocks did not fetch a good price in open market, it had to be auctioned off for a mere Rs. 823 crore. The MARKFED suffered a loss of Rs. 845 crore. The procurement price of MARKFED was Rs. 1,760 a quintal but incidentals and transportation escalted the price to Rs. 2,000 a quintal. The auction price, however, was only Rs. 1,150 a quintal. The government was forced to dispose of the produce at lower rate as it did not have market in the country. In this context, the government asked farmers not to cultivate maize in the just concluded kharif. It was suggested as an inter-crop over small acres of land with turmeric in Nizamabad, Nirmal, Jagtial, Mahbubabad and some other districts. However, the appeal of government and agriculture officials fell on deaf ears of some farmers, he said. This resulted in the danger of farmers losing heavily. As a farmer friendly government, it could not remain silent to the impending danger to the community, and, therefore decided to purchase the crop. Earlier in the day, hundreds of maize farmers staged a protest in Jagtial town for MSP of Rs. 1,850 a quintal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maize-procurement-at-rs-1850-per-quintal/article32934764.ece
24 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Lend liberally to the farm sector: CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has requested the State-Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) to provide loans amounting to Rs. 1,87,550 crore to the priority sector and Rs. 64,050 crore to the non-priority sectors in the financial year 2020-21 as targeted (total Rs. 2,51,600 crore). The loans required by the agriculture and MSME sectors have been pegged at Rs. 1,28,660 crore and Rs. 39,600 crore respectively. Participating in the 212th SLBC meeting at his camp office on Friday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy sought adequate financial support from the banks to the agriculture sector and welfare schemes. He stressed the need for banks to help in the implementation of YSR Rythu Bharosa and PM Kisan, and pointed out that crop loans provided during 2020-21 kharif season were Rs. 3,000 crore less than the loans given in the corresponding period last year. Price stabilisation fund He said the government created a price stabilisation fund of Rs. 3,500 crore for procuring various agricultural commodities when the prices plummet due to vagaries of the market. He requested the banks to support the cold storage network and establishment of Janata Bazaars. The Chief Minister asked the banks to help in augmenting the infrastructure in government hospitals and schools under the Nadu-Nedu programme. A major step towards improving the healthcare sector was the setting up of 16 new teaching hospitals. Besides, village clinics were planned to be set up to take healthcare services to the people's doorstep. The government contemplated to spend Rs. 13,000 crore on the health sector in the coming three years. The banks should also facilitate the implementation of ‘Jagananna Thodu’ which is scheduled to be launched in November. Interest-free loans were planned to be extended to petty businessmen under that scheme. Revival of MSMEs Also, the Chief Minister requested the banks to support revival of MSMEs that were badly hit by COVID-19, and to extend a helping hand to self-help groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lend-liberally-to-farm-sector-cm/article32933980.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Oli move on Nepal map hints at softer stand||After months of simmering dispute with India over the Kalapani issue, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli indicated a softer line on Friday when he used an old map of Nepal to greet everyone on the festival of Vijaya Dashami. The old map does not show the region of Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura, which is part of India’s Pithoragarh district. The triangular piece of land is, however, shown as part of Nepalese sovereign territory in the new map, which was unveiled on May 20, and made part of the insignia of the Nepalese state by an amendment on June 13. Prime Minister Oli’s use of the national insignia of Nepal carrying the old map has drawn strong reactions from the political class of Kathmandu, with leaders expressing surprise about the use of the old map during Dussehra, which is the biggest festival in the Himalayan country. “Prime Minister Oli at his individual level can use any map of Nepal that he wishes but as the Prime Minister of Nepal, he should have used the national map of Nepal that was passed by Parliament and dedicated to the Nepalese people,” said Bishwaprakash Sharma, spokesperson of the Opposition Nepali Congress, speaking toThe Hinduover phone. Mr. Sharma said Mr. Oli has undermined Parliament by not using the new map. Use of the old map also drew sharp reactions on social media, with Nepalese users connecting the move with Thursday’s discussion between Mr. Oli and Samant Kumar Goel, chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the external intelligence wing of India. Nepalese publicationMyrepublicareported that Mr. Goel led a nine-member delegation.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Pakistan to stay on FATF grey list till 2021||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday decided to keep Pakistan on the “grey list” till the next review of its compliance with the recommendations made in February next year. “Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 21 of 27 action items. As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021,” said an FATF statement issued in Paris at the end of the Plenary session, on the decision to keep Pakistan in the list of “Jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or grey list. At the FATF Plenary, sources said, Turkey proposed that members should consider Pakistan's good work and instead of waiting for completion of the remaining six of the 27 parameters, an FATF on-site team should visit the country to finalise its assessment. On-site teams are permitted only after jurisdictions complete their Action Plans. Such visits would signal exit from the grey or black list. When the proposal was placed before the 38-member Plenary, no other member seconded the move. It was not supported even by China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, according to sources. The FATF finally decided to keep Pakistan in the “grey list”. Pakistan has now almost four months to comply with the recommendations as its performance will now be put to scrutiny in the next plenary in February 2021. The points on which Pakistan failed to deliver included inaction against charitable organisations or non-profit organisations linked to terror groups banned by the UNSC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pakistan-to-stay-on-fatf-grey-list-till-2021/article32933983.ece

24 October 2020||Washington,||Trump remark on ‘filthy’ Indian air sparks row||Speaking during his second and final presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, U.S. President Donald Trump called India “filthy” and clubbed it with Russia and China — both considered U.S. rivals. The President’s comments were made in the context of the U.S.’s (former) emission commitments under the Paris Climate Accord. Mr. Trump had walked out of the agreement on the grounds that it was unfair towards America. “And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration; we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do: look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy,” Mr Trump said responding to a question on how he would combat climate change and support job growth. “The Paris Accord… I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly,” he said. Mr. Trump has previously compared the U.S. to India and China (and sometimes Russia) in the same breath in the multilateral climate change context or in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has treated the U.S. unfairly according to Mr. Trump. More recently his comparisons have been around the amount of known coronavirus cases versus the amount of testing and how the U.S. is testing far more than other countries, including India. Ahead of talks The language used on Thursday, however, was stronger than normal and comes a few days before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are scheduled to travel to New Delhi to meet their counterparts for the U.S.-India 2+2 ministerial. They are also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Trump’s comments predictably sparked strong reactions on social media: from the impact of the remarks on Indian American voters — a constituency both Republicans and Democrats are courting — to some users saying Mr. Trump was speaking the truth and that the air in Indian cities was indeed bad and there was “no point being outraged” by his words. One politician challenged Mr. Modi to respond to Mr. Trump. The Modi-led NDA government had rolled out the red carpet for Mr. Trump during his visit to India in February.  The Paris Accord… I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre slaps stock limits as onion prices shoot up||With onion prices crossing Rs. 100 per kg in several cities, the Centre imposed stock limits on wholesalers and retailers until the end of the year to prevent hoarding. This is the first time stock limits have been imposed on any commodity after the Essential Commodities Act was amended last month. Under the curbs, wholesale traders will not be allowed to store more than 25 tonnes of onions, while retailers will be limited to two tonnes only from October 23 till December 31. “We want to send a strong message that the government will not allow hoarding and price manipulation to hurt the ordinary consumer,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told journalists on Friday. Onion prices have been rising since early September. The Centre has slapped an export ban on the staple vegetable, taken steps for imports, and released more than 40,000 tonnes from its buffer stock of one lakh tonnes into retail markets to cool down the prices. Excess rainfall and flooding in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh has resulted in damage to the standing kharif crop, and the expectation of short supplies has led to soaring prices, crossing the Rs. 100 per kg mark in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. Nationally, the average retail price is more than Rs. 55 per kg as on October 21. This is only 22% higher than last year, when excess rainfall had similarly affected crops, damaged onions in warehouses and caused transport disruptions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-slaps-stock-limits-as-onion-prices-shoot-up/article32933986.ece

24 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Sharp rise in Punjab farm fires during kharif season||Punjab has witnessed a sharp rise in stubble-burning incidents this kharif season with paddy harvesting gaining pace. Government data based on satellite imagery show that between September 21 and October 21, as many as 9,434 cases of farm fires have been reported in the State. Punjab so far has seen 5,282 more such cases this season than last year. Highest in Tarn Taran District Tarn Taran has seen the highest number of farm fires at 2,086, followed by Amritsar and Ferozpur district with 1,657 and 1,033 such cases respectively, according to the Punjab Pollution Control Board. Advanced planting amid the novel coronavirus outbreak resulted in the harvesting process beginning earlier this year than the usual early October. Amid concerns of labour shortage during the nationwide lockdown, the Punjab government had advanced paddy nursery sowing and transplantation dates by 10 days. Consequently, arrival of the produce in markets across the State has also begun a tad early this season, in mid-September itself. Paddy has been sown on 27 lakh hectares of land in Punjab this year, including basmati on 7 lakh hectares. This is expected to cumulatively yield paddy residue of 16.50 million tonnes. Krunesh Garg, PPCB member-secretary, said early harvesting is a key reason for the higher number of farm fires. “Also, this year the weather conditions have been comparatively dry than last year. I am confident the final figure of the fire cases and burnt area would be lower than in previous years at the end of the season,” he said. As part of the State’s stubble management strategy, over 23,500 more agri-machines are being provided this year to farmers, either individually or in groups or through cooperative societies at a subsidy ranging from 50% to 80% by the agriculture department. This is in addition to 51,000 paddy straw in situ management machines provided over the past two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sharp-rise-in-punjab-farm-fires-during-kharif-season/article32934711.ece

However, there will be no alliance with parties outside the fold of the UDF. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who addressed a press conference after a committee meet here, declined to comment on whether the front would strike an alliance with the Welfare Party of India, the political wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami, ahead of the local body and the Assembly elections. A decision on cooperating with regional groups and parties standing against corruption and fascism would be taken at the local level, he said. Mr. Chennithala said the decision by the Kerala Congress (M) to join the Left Democratic Front (LDF) would not have any impact on the electoral prospects of the UDF. It had become clear that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] would stoop to any level to garner votes. It is a pity that the Communist Party of India (CPI) had surrendered to the CPI(M) decision to induct Jose K. Mani into the LDF, he said. Smuggling case Mr. Chennithala alleged that it had become clear that the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan provided all help to those involved in the gold smuggling case. Both M.

This is the first time stock limits have been imposed on any commodity after the Essential Commodities Act was amended last month to reduce such interventions. Wholesale traders will not be allowed to store more than 25 tonnes of onions, while retailers will be limited to two tonnes only from October 23 till December 31. “We want to send a strong message that the government will not allow hoarding and price manipulation to hurt the ordinary consumer,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told journalists on Friday. “Storage should meet current requirement; it should not be hoarded in expectation of a possible future price spike.” Onion prices have been rising since early September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-slaps-stock-limits-as-onion-prices-shoot-up/article32934940.ece

Addressing an election rally at Hisua in Nawada, Bihar, Mr. Gandhi said, “When migrant workers from Bihar were chased away by other States, what did the Prime Minister do?... He didn’t help them… This is the truth and I trust that this time, the people of Bihar will give a befitting reply to him and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.” He also alleged that Mr. Modi had lied to the nation on Chinese incursions in Ladakh. Mr. Gandhi said, “Our 20 soldiers were martyred and China took over 1,200 km of our land in Ladakh…Why did the Prime Minister say no one came inside Indian land... It is an insult to our soldiers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-did-not-help-migrants-says-rahul/article32933981.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||House panel mulls action against Amazon||Facebook India’s policy head Ankhi Das on Friday appeared before the Joint Committee of Parliament that is examining the draft Data Protection Bill. However, e-commerce giant Amazon declined to depose before the panel on October 28, stating that its “subjects experts” cannot take the risk of traveling from the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic. Stating that Amazon’s “refusal” amounts to a breach of parliamentary privilege, BJP MP and chairperson of the JPC, Meenakshi Lekhi, told reporters that the panel was unanimous about taking “coercive action” if no one from the company appears next Wednesday. Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Google and Paytm are among the companies from whom the committee has sought views on data security and protection amid concerns that the privacy of users is being “compromised” for commercial interest. The panel questioned Facebook India’s representatives, including Ms. Das, who has been in the eye of a storm over reports of alleged bias towards the BJP and refusal to apply hate speech rules to a BJP politician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/house-panel-mulls-action-against-amazon/article32933985.ece

24 October 2020||KOCHI,||HC stays Sivasankar’s arrest till Oct. 28||The Kerala High Court has stayed the arrest of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, till October 28 in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case. The court will pronounce its judgement on the bail application on the day. Appearing for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), S.V. Raju, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) of India, submitted that Mr. Sivasankar might be the kingpin of the entire smuggling activities and could have used Swapna Suresh as a pawn in the operations. Swapna was just a face of the operations and Mr. Sivasankar might have been pulling the strings. The agency was probing these aspects. Mr. Sivasankar might have had a direct role and involvement in the operations, Mr. Raju argued while opposing the bail application. According to the ASG, Swapna was under Mr. Sivasankar’s control and he might have benefited from the smuggling operations that were carried out 21 times. Mr. Sivasankar, being one of the senior-most bureaucrats of the State and the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, might have intervened to clear the obstacles that might have cropped up in the course of smuggling. Smuggling might have taken place more times than revealed by the accused, he submitted. ‘Proceeds of crime’ The ASG submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was well aware of the fact that the money found in the locker of Swapna was the proceeds of the crime. P. Vijayabhanu, counsel for Mr. Sivasankar said he had always cooperated with the investigation and there was nothing on record to prove the allegations of the agencies against him. While the Customs had questioned Mr. Sivasankar for 30 hours, the ED interrogated him for 36 hours. The National Investigation Agency had earlier submitted that they did not have any plans to arrest him, he argued. The counsel also submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was being hounded down and was even finding it difficult to rent a hotel room. Appearing for the Customs, K. Ramkumar submitted that the official was not cooperating with the interrogation and remained elusive and evasive on many important questions.  Sivasankar may have a direct role and involvement in the operations. S.V.

24 October 2020||PATNA,||Lalu will walk free, bid Nitish farewell: Tejashwi||Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and the grand alliance’s chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav said on Friday that his father, Lalu Prasad, would come out of jail on November 9. “Laluji has got bail in one case and will secure one in another case on November 9, which also happens to be my birthday. The next day, on November 10, Nitishji will have his farewell,” he said at an election rally at Hisua in Nawada district, where he shared the dais with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. RJD chief Lalu Prasad is currently undergoing treatment at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), while staying in Kelly’s bungalow inside the hospital premises. Two cases He was recently granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in one of the fodder scam cases, but could not come out of jail as his bail plea in another case was yet to be heard. He is expected to get bail when the petition is taken up on November 9 as he would have already completed more than half of the jail term in the case by that date. The three-phase election to the Bihar Assembly will end on November 7 and the results will be out on November 10. Mr. Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar government of failure to end corruption, create jobs and stop migration of workers to other States. “Nitishji, you are tired… You won’t be able to take care of Bihar now,” he said. Mocking Mr. Kumar’s recent statement that Bihar had missed the industrialisation boom as it was “landlocked”, Mr. Yadav reiterated his promise to create 10 lakh government jobs if voted to power. “Those who did not give you jobs, education, health facilities and industries in 15 years will not do all this in the next five years,” he said. Later, addressing the media in Patna, the RJD leader said he was expecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say something about the lack of development in the State. “Mr. Modi should ask Nitish Kumarji and tell us why in the last 15 years of his [Mr. Kumar’s] regime no industrialisation has taken place in the State and why no employment was generated. And I also want to ask the Prime Minister when Bihar will get the special State status and a special package,” he said. ‘Where are the jobs?’ “Now BJP says 19 lakh jobs will be created in five years if they come to power, but I would like to ask in which BJP-ruled State have they provided even 5 lakh jobs in the last five years?” the RJD leader asked. On the huge turnout at his public meetings, Mr. Yadav said, “it is because people hate the present regime. They’re angry.”  ... people hate the present regime. They’re angry.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Be ready for crucial 3 months: Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday that the next three months were going to be decisive for the country in determining the trajectory of COVID-19. “If we take adequate precaution and follow COVID appropriate behaviour in the coming festival and winter season, we will be in a better position to fight corona,” the Minister said while reviewing COVID-19 preparedness and measures for COVID-appropriate behaviour in Uttar Pradesh. ‘CFR declining’ The Minister said India has shown improvement over the past three months.“From recording over 95,000 COVID cases in a day, the cases have been substantially reduced to less than 55,000 cases in a day. The Recovery Rate of India is nearing 90%. The case fatality rate is also declining. CFR stands at 1.51% and is moving towards the target of having CFR less than 1%,” Dr. Vardhan said. “The number of active cases are less than 7 lakh and the doubling rate has increased to 97.2 days, as of now. The journey which started from having just one lab, we have come a long way in now having nearly 2,000 labs in the country. The number of total tests conducted across the country have surpassed 10 crore. This is a positive indication that we are moving in the right direction.” ‘Step up surveillance’ For Uttar Pradesh, Dr. Vardhan stressed the need to focus on increasing testing, surveillance, contact tracing, and early diagnosis to keep fatality rate low. The total number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the country touched 10,01,13,085 on Friday. As many as 14,42,722 tests were done on Thursday alone. The last one crore tests were conducted in nine days. “The country’s testing capacities have multiplied manifold with nearly 2,000 labs across the country and with collaborative efforts of the Centre and State/UT [Union Territory] governments. More than 15 lakh samples can be tested every day,” said a release issued by the Health Ministry. Increased testing It added that progressive countrywide expansion in testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise of testing numbers. “With 1,989 testing labs in the country including 1,122 government laboratories and 867 private laboratories, the daily testing capacity has got a substantial boost,” it said. The Ministry added that higher testing across wide regions had resulted in early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing and timely and effective treatment in homes and facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases. These measures in tandem eventually led to lower mortality rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/be-ready-for-crucial-3-months-vardhan/article32933943.ece
24 October 2020||Srinagar,||Restore Kashmir’s flag: Mehbooba||Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Friday said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the national tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5, 2019 were rolled back. In her first media interaction after her release from 14-month detention, the Peoples Democratic Party president said she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile State was restored. “As far as I am concerned, I have no interest in elections. Till the time the Constitution under which I used to contest elections is returned to us, Mehbooba Mufti has got nothing to do with elections. Let me tell you that,” she said.  Alliance meet today Asked if her party and the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration will contest the District Development Council (DDC) elections, she said a meeting of the alliance would be held on Saturday where these issues would also be discussed, apart from the general situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Asked whether not contesting these polls would be akin to conceding space to the BJP, Ms. Mufti said it was a hypothetical question. “You are discussing everything hypothetically. The alliance will sit and discuss it. It is not about the BJP and its cronies. Because people have to survive and God forbid, it should not happen that they [people] will come into the hands of those who will kick them out. So, we will take a decision keeping in mind all the pros and cons. Farooq [Abdullah] sahib is our leader, so we will take the right decision after everyone gives his opinion,” she said. The flag of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir was prominently placed on a table in front of the PDP president, along with the party flag, during the press conference. It was for the first time that the PDP displayed the flag of the erstwhile State at a party function or a press meeting. “This is my flag,” Ms. Mufti said, pointing to the flag of the erstwhile State, when a reporter asked her about her statement that if Article 370 was revoked, there would be no one left to hold India’s flag. “When this flag of ours is restored, we will hold that flag [tricolour] also. But we will not hold any other flag till the time our flag, which was robbed from us, comes into our hold,” she said. Ms. Mufti said the tricolour was part of the Constitution and the BJP had desecrated it and the Constitution. She said Jammu and Kashmir’s relation with India was because of the erstwhile State’s special constitutional position, which included a flag. She said the BJP had “demolished” the Constitution and wanted to replace it with its manifesto. She regretted that the Opposition parties, except a few, were silent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/restore-kashmirs-flag-mehbooba/article32934617.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Secular forces must come together’||Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D. Raja says all secular, democratic forces need to come together to fight against the BJP in the Bihar Assembly election, and elaborates on why the CPI decided to join the grand alliance.  In 1995, the CPI had 26 seats. It was the fourth biggest party in the Bihar Assembly and now you are reduced to fighting six seats. How do you explain such a decline? It is true, we used to win a good number of seats in the State Assembly and parliamentary elections. Over the years, many developments have taken place. But we continue to be a force to reckon with, especially when it is about protecting the interests of the people, particularly the poor and marginalised sections. We are a force to shape the political discourse. As far as our decline is concerned, we could not be part of a viable coalition for various reasons. But now things are different, we are part of mahagatbandhan [grand alliance]. Why did the CPI decide to join the grand alliance? Earlier, when Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Chief Minister, we fought Assembly and parliamentary elections together. It was only [for the] last general elections, despite our efforts, we could not reach an alliance. Similarly, in 2015 also, we could not have an alliance. But now, taking into consideration the situation in the country and Bihar, we came to the conclusion that the primary objective must be to defeat the BJP and its allies. All secular democratic forces need to come together for this goal. Now, the BJP-RSS combine has posed a grave threat to the Constitution, democratic polity of our country and secular fabric of our society. Our country and the Constitution need to be saved. This election will have larger ramifications in the future political course of the country. You are a Communist leader who comes from a Dalit family. Do you believe this election sees an end to the Mandal-Kamandal era? The Bihar election will be the beginning and rebuilding of the assertion of Dalits, backward classes and marginalised sections. The BJP has become too aggressive to promote their neo-liberal agenda. They are trying to hand over the whole economy to private hands. It means the government is abdicating all its responsibility. As far as caste-based politics is concerned, what is caste-based politics? What happened in Hathras? In India, we have a caste system, which is why B.R. Ambedkar gave a call for ‘annihilation of caste’. It is a long-drawn battle against caste system and patriarchy, which we will continue to fight. The opinion polls are indicating a huge lead for the NDA in the Assembly elections. Your comments? No opinion poll seems to be objective; the ground reality is that the mahagatbandhan has already emerged as the number one option of the voters. There is a huge anti-incumbency [mood]. And this anti-incumbency is not against Nitish Kumar alone, the BJP also faces it. They too have to share the blame. The BJP-JD(U) [government] was a failure, they failed to develop the State and now the people are looking for change.  This election will have larger ramifications in the future political course of the country||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/secular-forces-must-come-together/article32933935.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||A mistake to have left Quad, says Australia||Australia should not have walked out of the Quad, and subsequently the Malabar exercises with India, but was “delighted” at New Delhi’s decision to invite it to participate in this year’s naval exercises in November, Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell said. Referring to his government’s announcement in 2008 that it would not participate in the Quad exercises with India, Japan and the United States, he said it probably became the reason India took three years to accept Australia’s request to rejoin the exercises, despite requests from 2017-2020. “I can say that, with the benefit of hindsight, clearly that it [withdrawing from Malabar] was a mistake. I suspect earlier in the piece, that became a stumbling block, and that was not forgotten in terms of reassembling Australia as part of that exercise,” Mr. O’Farrell said in an interview to The Hindu . Earlier this week, the Ministry of Defence announced that all four countries of the Quadrilateral would take part in the Malabar exercises scheduled at the end of November to be held in two phases on both sides of the Indian coastline in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. This will be the first such exercise after India signed logistical agreements with all Quad partners, and is expected to see greater interoperability and use of common military platforms. China’s protests While Australia pulled out from the grouping a decade ago after China’s protests at the time, India’s hesitation in reinviting it back to the exercises in the past few years was also understood to be over China’s sensitivities over a possible “military alliance” in the Indo-Pacific ranged against it. However, experts believe that growing concerns in both countries over China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific and on the border with India have accelerated the pace of Quad cooperation this year. Asked if New Delhi’s turnaround this year was due to the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and tensions with China, Mr. O’Farrell said that the decision was a reaction to “challenges in the neighbourhood” over a period of time, not the last few months. “I don’t think the invitation came about because of activities over the last couple of months [at the LAC], I think it’s been the changing environment in which we live, and the recognition by countries like India and Australia, that they have to step up in the neighbourhood to deliver the sort of world we want,” he noted. However, Mr. O’Farrell said Australia’s policy did not envision formalising the Quad in any way, contrary to statements from U.S. State Department officials, who called for formalising and regularising the interactions on the platform. He said that Australia did not see the Quad, as U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo asserted, as a “tool” to counter the challenge from China’s ruling Communist Party (CCP). Positive agenda “We have a positive agenda for the Quad, which is about shaping the neighbourhood in which we live, you know, a free, open and resilient Indo- Pacific, one where, you know, rules and norms apply and one where any disputes are resolved according to international law. It's been clear in the comments of the three foreign ministers, who are three-quarters of the Quad, that whatever we develop there is intended to be shared by all countries across the Indo Pacific, so we're not exclusivist,” he stated. India and Australia would continue talks on a trade deal, although they would be delayed until after the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was completed later this year, which India decided to walk out from. Despite several requests from RCEP countries, especially Australia, the Modi government has refused to reconsider its decision, citing worries over Chinese goods flooding the Indian market. “RCEP will proceed. I understand and recognise and respect India's decision, and no one is forced to sign up to the agreement. It’s no secret that Australia was keen for India to be part of it. In the meantime, Australia will continue to engage with India bilaterally on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-mistake-to-have-left-quad-says-australia/article32933947.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||CVC amends SOP for procurements||The Central Vigilance Commission has amended the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on adoption of “Integrity Pact” in government organisations for procurement activities, and restricted the maximum tenure of Integrity External Monitors (IEMs) to three years in an organisation. The latest order revises the SOP issued in January 2017. In Para 5.2, the amended provision states that the choice of IEM should be restricted to officials from the government and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) who have retired from positions of the level of Secretary to the Central government or of equivalent pay scale. Such officials who retired as Chairman and Managing Directors (CMDs) of PSUs — Schedule ‘A’ companies and CMD/Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer levels in the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), insurance companies and financial institutions — should be at least of the level of Additional Secretary or its equivalent. Eligibility norms “Officers of the Armed Forces who have retired from the rank equivalent of General may also be considered for appointment. Preference would be given to persons who have worked in any other sector, other than their own, or have worked as CVO [Chief Vigilance Officer] in any organisation,” says the order. Under the 2017 order, the officials who had retired from positions of the level of Additional Secretary to the Central government and above, or equivalent pay scale, were eligible for the PSUs, board level officers in Schedule ‘A’ companies, PSBs, insurance companies and financial institutions. Officers of the Armed Forces who had retired from the rank equivalent to Lieutenant-General and above could also be considered for appointment. The amended Para 5.3 provides that for appointment as IEM, the Ministry, department or organisation concerned has to forward a panel of suitable persons to the CVC, of those persons who are in the panel maintained by the Commission.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||CVC amends SOP for procurements||The Central Vigilance Commission has amended the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on adoption of “Integrity Pact” in government organisations for procurement activities, and restricted the maximum tenure of Integrity External Monitors (IEMs) to three years in an organisation. The latest order revises the SOP issued in January 2017. In Para 5.2, the amended provision states that the choice of IEM should be restricted to officials from the government and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) who have retired from positions of the level of Secretary to the Central government or of equivalent pay scale. Such officials who retired as Chairman and Managing Directors (CMDs) of PSUs — Schedule ‘A’ companies and CMD/Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer levels in the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), insurance companies and financial institutions — should be at least of the level of Additional Secretary or its equivalent. Eligibility norms “Officers of the Armed Forces who have retired from the rank equivalent of General may also be considered for appointment. Preference would be given to persons who have worked in any other sector, other than their own, or have worked as CVO [Chief Vigilance Officer] in any organisation,” says the order. Under the 2017 order, the officials who had retired from positions of the level of Additional Secretary to the Central government and above, or equivalent pay scale, were eligible for the PSUs, board level officers in Schedule ‘A’ companies, PSBs, insurance companies and financial institutions. Officers of the Armed Forces who had retired from the rank equivalent to Lieutenant-General and above could also be considered for appointment. The amended Para 5.3 provides that for appointment as IEM, the Ministry, department or organisation concerned has to forward a panel of suitable persons to the CVC, of those persons who are in the panel maintained by the Commission. The previous corresponding provision stated that the panel could include those already in the panel maintained by the Commission, or they could propose names of other suitable persons. Earlier, Para 5.7 stated that the initial tenure of IEM would be three years and it could be extended for another term of two years on a request received by the Commission from the organisation concerned, fixing the maximum tenure at five years in an organisation. The latest orders provides that the IEM will be appointed for a period of three years in an organisation. According to the Commission, “Integrity Pact” is a vigilance tool that envisages an agreement between the prospective vendors/bidders and the buyer, committing both the parties not to exercise any corrupt influence on any aspect of the contract. The pact is also to ensure transparency, equity and competitiveness in public procurement. The IEMs independently and objectively review the documents to determine if the parties have complied with their obligations under the pact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cvc-amends-sop-for-procurements/article32933932.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Parts of Bengaluru flooded after 3 days of heavy rain||Heavy rain for the third consecutive day resulted in flooding in several parts of Bengaluru. Hosakerehalli, Nayandahalli, Basavanagudi, Bommanahalli, Kengeri and surrounding areas were the worst hit. With the southwest monsoon continuing well into October, beyond its June to September period, the city has been witnessing higher than normal rainfall. Until October 23 morning, the city received 179.3 mm rainfall. The normal rainfall for the period is 141 mm. “It is a departure of 27.2% from normal in Bengaluru city,” the IMD duty officer said. Drains overflowed, roads turned into rivulets and homes were inundated in many localities coming under Rajarajeshwarinagar, Bommanahalli and South zones. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said help from the National Disaster Response Force had been requisitioned. He said a team of 22 personnel, along with requisite boats, was on its way to affected localities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parts-of-bengaluru-flooded-after-3-days-of-heavy-rain/article32933915.ece
24 October 2020||Chennai,||30 vaccine programmes under way in India: scientist||India currently has some 30 vaccine programmes against SARS-CoV-2, “and they span every platform that is available in any part of the world,” said Gagandeep Kang, clinician-scientist at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. The country has four vaccines that are in clinical trials, and the first one — Covaxin, which is the inactivated vaccine made by Bharat Biotech — will be going into phase 3 clinical trials fairly soon, said Prof. Kang. She was speaking at the last of a three-part seminar jointly hosted by TNQ and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus. The virtual seminars aimed to discuss the latest research on COVID-19 and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the impact of the pandemic on human population and the state of development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Worldwide, there are some 154 vaccines in the preclinical phase, 44 in clinical trials, of which 10 are already in phase 3 trials, said Florian Krammer, Professor of Vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, U.S. However, even if vaccines are eventually licensed and enter the market, there will be hurdles to be crossed, he said: “There may be issues with large- scale production, distribution may be an issue with the number of vaccines needed, something that is true for administration too.” “We also have to keep in mind that it takes time for immunity to set in,” said Prof. Krammer — “most of these vaccines have to be given twice and it may take two months by the time you are protected.” He added that longevity could be an issue too. “We do not yet know how long immunity will last, but it might be that booster doses after one, two or three years might be needed.” In terms of therapeutics, we still do not have “a silver bullet,” said Prof. Krammer. “We need new drugs to deal with the virus during the early phases of infection and deal with the immune system in the late stage of infection.” Benjamin R. tenOever, an Arthur and Irene Fishberg Professor of Medicine and the Director of the Virus Engineering Center for Therapeutics and Research (VECToR) at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, spoke on leveraging innate immunity as a first line defence against SARS-CoV-2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/30-vaccine-programmes-under-way-in-india-scientist/article32933945.ece

The fire broke out on the second floor of the mall around 8.50 p.m. on Thursday. It spread to all three floors despite the fire-fighting efforts. At 2.41 a.m., the fire brigade announced the fire was a “brigade call”, meaning Level 5 one, the highest category, for which fire engines are called from all agencies in the city. The residents of nearby 55-storey Orchid Enclave building in Mumbai Central were shifted to safety. The mall is a ground plus three-floor structure. As per the primary information, the fire originated at the shops selling mobiles, stationery and furniture on the second floor from which it spread to the third floor, said an official communication from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A total of 24 fire engines and 16 jumbo tanks are on site, and around 250 officials are on the ground. The evacuated people were moved to a nearby ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-mall-fire-3500-people-shifted-from-nearby-tower/article32933949.ece
24 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Police unearth major organ transplant racket in Kerala||The State police have stumbled upon an organ transplant racket that supplied kidneys and liver tissue from living donors to affluent patients for sizeable sums of money. Inspector General of Police, Crime Branch, S. Sreejith, who conducted the preliminary inquiry, has recommended the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) to launch a criminal investigation. The probe is currently centred on hospitals in Thrissur district and could extend to other regions. In a letter to State Police Chief Loknath Behera, Mr. Sreejith said middlemen working for hospitals had “deceptively induced” persons from needy families to donate liver tissue or kidney to well-heeled patients requiring a transplant. Many of the donors had no links to the recipient. The police could find no evidence to conclude that the donors had any particular attachment, altruistic reason, or affection for the patient. What the law says Investigators said they suspected that the donors had received up to Rs. 10 lakh as compensation. However, middlemen and the suspect hospitals could have netted up to Rs. 40 lakh or more for arranging a live donor. Mr. Sreejith’s report said preliminary evidence pointed at the violation of Section 19 of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994. The law outlaws the sale of organs. The investigators said the middlemen had migrated from organising blood donation for money to deceptively inducing economically disadvantaged people to donate their organs for cash. Many of the donors could not explain the cash windfall they had received during COVID-19 when regular employment was hard to come by. Another official said agents working in tandem with unethical medical professionals had sought to exploit the gap between demand and supply of organs for transplant. They had found the pandemic conducive to their illegal but lucrative trade. Those involved The Crime Branch report said that some “public servants” had “connived and abetted” the crime. An official said government doctors could also be involved in the racket. The scale of the racket could be more extensive. Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thrissur, S. Surendran will head the investigation team. Mr. Behera and Mr. Sreejith will supervise the probe.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Congress lists BJP’s ‘unkept promises’||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the campaign trail in Bihar, the Congress on Friday asked if Mr. Modi would show the “courage” to announce special status for the State. The party also posed several questions on the promises that the Prime Minister had made to the people in the run up to the 2015 Assembly polls. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, who has been camping in Patna to oversee the party’s election campaign, said Mr. Modi would once again try to ‘mislead, confuse and divide’ the 12 crore people of Bihar. “Will PM Modi today show the courage to announce special status for Bihar?” he asked. Mr. Surjewala targeted the BJP and the the Prime Minister for not ‘honouring’ previous announcements. “In the last election, the announcement to construct a Central University in Bhagalpur at a cost of Rs. 500 crore won much applause but not even a single brick has not been laid,” Mr. Surjewala said. He said though Mr. Modi had announced a Skill Development University at a cost of Rs. 1,550 crore, it simply vanished after the elections. “Why was it taken to Varanasi? Why did you lie about electricity generation ? What happened to the 1300 MW thermal power plant to be built at a cost of Rs. 10,000 crore in Chausa, Buxar?” the Congress leader asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-lists-bjps-unkept-promises/article32933929.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Oli move on Nepal map hints at softer stand||After months of simmering dispute with India over the Kalapani issue, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli indicated a softer line on Friday when he used an old map of Nepal to greet everyone on the festival of Vijaya Dashami. The old map does not show the region of Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura, which is part of India’s Pithoragarh district. The triangular piece of land is, however, shown as part of Nepalese sovereign territory in the new map, which was unveiled on May 20, and made part of the insignia of the Nepalese state by an amendment on June 13. Prime Minister Oli's use of the national insignia of Nepal carrying the old map has drawn strong reactions from the political class of Kathmandu, with leaders expressing surprise about the use of the old map during Dasara, which is the biggest festival in the Himalayan country. ‘Wrong move’ “Prime Minister Oli at his individual level can use any map of Nepal that he wishes but as the Prime Minister of Nepal, he should have used the national map of Nepal that was passed by Parliament and dedicated to the Nepalese people,” said Bishwaprakash Sharma, spokesperson of the Opposition Nepali Congress, speaking to The Hindu over phone. Mr. Sharma said Mr. Oli has undermined Parliament by not using the new map. Use of the old map also drew sharp reactions on social media, with Nepalese users connecting the move with Thursday’s discussion between Mr. Oli and Samant Kumar Goel, chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the external intelligence wing of India. Nepalese publication Myrepublica reported that Mr. Goel led a nine-member delegation. The visit drew attention as it came a fortnight before the scheduled visit to Nepal of General Manoj Mukund Naravane, chief of the Indian Army. Since the unveiling of the new map and the amendment in Parliament that gave it a legal status, Nepal has not gone back on its demands on the Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura. Mr. Oli has spoken on the phone with Prime Minister Modi but no meeting of the border mechanism has so far been held to discuss the issue. Mr. Oli has, meanwhile, firmed up his hold over the government of Nepal and resisted challenges from rivals in the Standing Committee of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).  Prime Minister Oli's use of the national insignia of Nepal carrying the old map has drawn strong reactions from the political class of Kathmandu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oli-move-on-nepal-map-hints-at-softer-stand/article32933984.ece
24 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Central team visits flood-affected areas||The State government has decided to construct a storm water drain to discharge flood water coming from Nagole, Bandlaguda and Bairamalguda tanks into Musi river as a permanent measure to avoid flooding of the adjoining areas due to excess rain. The government has decided to rope in consultants experienced in the subject for preparation of a comprehensive plan in this direction. Officials of the GHMC explained about the situation in the areas affected by the recent heavy rain/flood to the inter-Ministerial team deputed by the Central government. The inter-Ministerial team headed by Union Home Ministry Joint Secretary Praveen Vashista inspected the damages caused by recent rain/flood in areas under LB Nagar and Khairatabad zones on the second of their visit to the city on Friday. The team members interacted with the families in the affected areas for getting information on the extent of losses suffered by them first hand. The team enquired about the damaged roads and nalas besides the steps taken to restore and strengthen the bunds of tanks which suffered major breaches at several places resulting in inundation of some areas. The team was particularly keen to know about the restoration works taken up in areas where nalas were still overflowing. Inundation The team members inquired about the losses suffered on account of overflow of water from Bandlaguda and Nagole tanks resulting in inundation of the adjoining colonies like Rajarajeswari Colony. Residents explained the team members that due to heavy rains, accompanied with huge discharges from the tanks upstream, their colonies were inundated with water flowing six feet high and several houses suffered major damages on account of this. GHMC officials led by zonal commissioner Upender Reddy who accompanied the team briefed them about the situation in the affected areas and informed them about the relief and restoration works. They informed the Central team that the affected area was more than a kilometre away from Musi and steps were being taken to construct a nala connecting the tanks upstream to ensure that flood water was discharged into the river. At Karmanghat, officials informed the team members that flood water from Bairamalguda and other areas had inundated close to 2,000 houses in different colonies like Uday Nagar and Tapovan Colony located in the area. The inter-Ministerial team later inspected the areas under Saroornagar lake. During their visit to Tolichowki area, the team members inspected the extent of losses in Virasatnagar, Balreddy Nagar, Nadeem Colony and other areas where residents were still struggling to get back to normalcy. Residents told the team members that with water level rising above 10 feet, even the first floors were impacted by the swirling waters. Union Water Resources Ministry superintending engineer M. Raghuram, Road Transport department superintendent engineer S.K. Kushwaha and other members were present during the visit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-team-visits-flood-affected-areas/article32933905.ece

Singhal, accused in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case in Gujarat. Besides Mr. Singhal, other petitioners are retired deputy superintendent of police Tarun Barot and sub inspector Ananu Chaudhary. A fourth accused, retired deputy SP J.G. Parmar, who had also moved a discharge plea, passed away recently. Mandatory step In an order on Friday, Special CBI court judge V.R. Raval refused to drop proceedings against the three accused and directed the prosecution agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to get prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Gujarat government. As per the laid-down procedure under the section, government sanction is necessary for the prosecution of a public servant for an act done as part of official duty. “The accused are involved in a serious case as there is an encounter by the accused police officers. Therefore, when it was established the accused acted while performing their official duties, the CBI ought to have got sanction. CBI should be directed to go for sanction for prosecution or to make declaration in this regard,” the court said. Last year, the same CBI court had dropped proceedings against former police officers D.G. Vanzara and N.K. Amin after the Gujarat government refused to grant sanction to the CBI to prosecute them in the fake encounter case in which Mumbra girl Ishrat Jahan and three others had been allegedly killed by the police dubbing them terrorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-rejects-plea-of-officers-in-ishrat-case/article32933952.ece

A release later said Mr. Rao recalled the government procuring nine lakh tonnes of maize through MARKFED at a cost of Rs. 1,668 crore in rabi last year. As the stocks did not fetch a good price in open market, it had to be auctioned off for a mere Rs. 823 crore. The MARKFED suffered a loss of Rs. 845 crore. The procurement price of MARKFED was Rs. 1,760 a quintal but incidentals and transportation escalted the price to Rs. 2,000 a quintal. The auction price, however, was only Rs. 1,150 a quintal. The government was forced to dispose of the produce at lower rate as it did not have market in the country. In this context, the government asked farmers not to cultivate maize in the just concluded kharif. It was suggested as an inter-crop over small acres of land with turmeric in Nizamabad, Nirmal, Jagtial, Mahbubabad and some other districts. However, the appeal of government and agriculture officials fell on deaf ears of some farmers, he said. This resulted in the danger of farmers losing heavily. As a farmer friendly government, it could not remain silent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maize-procurement-at-rs-1850-a-quintal-cm/article32934893.ece

Nair, a YouTuber, was stayed by the Kerala High Court on Friday till October 30. Considering an anticipatory bail application of the accused, the court asked the accused why could not the petitioners face the consequences of going to the jail as they were bold enough to barge into the lodge of the accused and bash him up. “Why are you shying away from going to jail. Why don't you cooperate with the investigation and face the consequences of going to jail,” Single Judge Ashok Menon, orally observed during the course of the argument. Referring to the trial court order which denied them bail, the court orally observed that one could not take the law into their hands though the acts of the petitioner were nasty. “You have also created materials to show that you have hit him and bashed him up,” the court noted, referring to the video shot by the accused while pouring ink on him. On the charge of theft, counsel for Ms. Bhagyalakshmi submitted that the laptop computer and mobile phone of the petitioners were taken by them to be submitted to the police. He argued that the charges of trespass would not stand, as the women were invited by Vijay P. Nair for a compromise talk. On the submission that Vijay P. Nair tried to outrage the modesty of the women, the court asked whether the women bashed him up on self-defence. The court will pronounce its decision on the petition on October 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/relief-for-bhagyalakshmi-as-high-court-stays-arrest/article32934224.ece

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Centre slaps stock limits as onion prices shoot up||Wholesale traders will not be allowed to store more than 25 tonnes of onions, while retailers will be limited to two tonnes only from October 23 till December 31. ‘Strong message’ “We want to send a strong message that the government will not allow hoarding and price manipulation to hurt the ordinary consumer,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told journalists on Friday. “Storage should meet current requirement; it should not be hoarded in expectation of a possible future price spike.” The country’s kharif onion production is estimated to decline by 14% to 37 lakh tonnes this year on likely damage to the crop due to recent heavy rain in key growing states, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Friday. “This year due to rains in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, onion production which was initially estimated at 43 lakh tonnes is likely to be 37 lakh tonnes, a shortfall of about 6 lakh tonnes,” he said at a press conference. The Centre has already slapped an export ban on the staple vegetable, taken steps for imports, and released more than 40,000 tonnes from its buffer stock to cool down the prices. Prices are always high at this time of year as stocks from the last rabi crop dwindle before the fresh kharif crop begins to arrive. Excess rainfall Excess rainfall and flooding in the key producer States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh this year has resulted in significant damage to the standing kharif crop, and the expectation of short supplies has led to soaring prices, crossing the Rs. 100 per kg mark in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. Nationally, the average retail price is more than Rs. 55 per kg as on October 21. This is only 22% higher than last year. However, the price is 115% higher than the average of the last five years for this date, which triggers the “extraordinary price rise” clause of the amended SCA allowing the government to invoke stock limits.

24 October 2020||New Delhi,||WHO alerted India to virus on Jan. 11: NCDC||The World Health Organization (WHO) informed India as early as January 11 that the reported dates of onset of the novel coronavirus circulating in Wuhan, China, ranged between December 12 and 29, 2019, according to information accessed through a Right to Information (RTI) query. The RTI reply shows that the WHO also “advised against any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event”. In the RTI reply, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia, New Delhi, sent an “alert mail” to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on January 11, regarding the novel coronavirus circulating in Wuhan. The RTI query was filed by Jammu resident Rohit Chaudhary, where he sought to know “the date when the Government of India first received information on the Covid19/Coronavirus/Wuhan Virus/China Virus.” The WHO Regional Director’s mail further stated that preliminary investigation found “no evidence” of sustained human-to-human transmission and there were no infections reported among healthcare workers and based on the still limited amount of information available, the situation may evolve rapidly. Dr. Singh wrote that “the current WHO advisory does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers.” She also added: “It is generally considered that entry screening offers little benefit, while requiring considerable resources.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/who-alerted-india-to-virus-on-jan-11-ncdc/article32933941.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,||VCK calls for protest to seek ban on Manusmriti||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan has called a State-wide protest on Saturday to urge the State and Central governments to ban the Hindu religious text, Manusmriti, on the grounds that it demeans women, the backward castes and indigenous groups, and spreads hatred against them. The Dravidar Kazhagam, the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam and the May 17 movement have pledged support to the protest. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said Manusmriti , believed to have been written almost 2,000 years ago, speaks ill of the working class as a whole, instigates violence against them and justifies their murder. “It portrays women in a bad light. It states that a particular varna or caste does not have the right to live. This is why Ambedkar burnt Manusmriti in 1927 and exposed its inhumanity in many of his books,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said Manusmriti lost its place as the law of the land after the British took over India and created a law that considered everyone equal. “The Sanatana forces that are in power today are again trying to reorganise power structures according to Manusmriti . This is why violence against women is growing in India. This is why the question on whether India is being governed according to the Constitution or Manusmriti is being raised,” he said. A controversy over Mr. Thirumavalavan’s comments erupted after the protest was announced. A video of the speech, at a web-based conference organised last month by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades’ Federation, on the topic “Periyar and Indian Politics”, went viral. In the clip, he states, “As per Hindu dharma , all women are created by God as prostitutes. They are prostitutes as per Hindu dharma ...Manu Dharma . The status of all women is less than that of a man  .” Actor Kushboo Sundar of the BJP condemned Mr. Thirumavalavan’s statement and demanded that he prove his claim that Manusmriti says “women are prostitutes”. Asked whether she had read Manusmriti , Ms. Kushboo said there was “not a single word that demeans women”. The Cyber Crime Wing of the CCB booked a case on Friday against Mr. Thirumavalavan based on an online complaint from Ashwathaman, a BJP functionary.  The Sanatana forces that are in power today are again trying to reorganise power structures according to the Manusmriti||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vck-calls-for-state-wide-protest-demands-ban-on-manusmriti/article32934688.ece

Taking potshots at the ruling party, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Gidugu Rudra Raju sought to know why the YSRCP government had decided to proceed with the project, despite demanding its execution by the Centre when it was in the opposition. The government unilaterally changed the contractors for the project without the nod of Polavaram Project Authority or the Centre, he said on Friday. “Even as the Centre had declined to release funds for the project until the State properly accounts for the Rs. 5136 crore spent prior to 2014, the YSRCP government appears to be undecided on moving ahead,” said Mr. Rudra Raju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-drifting-aimlessly-over-polavaram/article32933990.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||CPI-IW change is anti-worker, says CITU||The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) on Friday said the revision of the base year for the consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-IW) from 2001 to 2016 announced by Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar would lead to suppression of the real impact of price rise, harming the interests of workers. “The entire exercise by the Labour Bureau functioning under the Ministry of Labour has been thoroughly arbitrary, deliberately designed to suppress the real impact of the price rise of essential items for survival and also to deprive the workers of their entitlement for legitimate DA [dearness allowance],” a statement by CITU general secretary Tapan Sen said. The bureau had ignored the fact that prices of essential items, in particular food, were on the rise, while reducing the weight given to food items in the consumption basket from 46.2% to 39%, the CITU said. “The Minister’s statement justifying this arbitrary reduction as change in the consumption pattern is ridiculous,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpi-iw-change-is-anti-worker-says-citu/article32933938.ece

The BJP had earlier promised free vaccination against COVID-19 in its Bihar election manifesto. “Madhya Pradesh has previously given support to the poor on several counts, now it will ensure their protection from COVID-19 too,” Mr. Chouhan said.

Mishra, State Congress media in-charge of Gwalior-Chambal, said: “A vaccine is yet to be developed, still there is an announcement to distribute it free.

Mr. Swamy, a Jesuit priest and activist working with tribals, was arrested on October 8 from his residence at Ranchi and was brought to Mumbai the next day. He was remanded in judicial custody from October 9. Advocates Sharif Shaikh and Kritika Agarwal, representing the octogenarian, told the court that Mr. Swamy has been suffering from Parkinson’s disease and has almost lost hearing ability in both ears. He has fallen in jail multiple times. Mr. Shaikh sought his bail on humanitarian grounds and as per the recommendations of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to release prisoners in view of COVID-19 outbreak.

24 October 2020||MYSURU,||Mysuru Dasara: virtual tours gain traction||When singer Rajesh Krishnan and his team took to the stage in front of the illuminated Mysuru palace as part of Dasara cultural programmes early this week, there were hardly about 250 people in the audience. But there were nearly 1.93 lakh people watching the programme aired on different channels and being live-streamed on social media in what was a tribute to legendary singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam who passed away recently. “This is one of the highest viewership for Mysuru Dasara. Though people were physically not present, they were still a part of the programmes and savoured every bit,” said Raju, Assistant Director, Department of Information and Publicity, and the nodal officer for virtual broadcast of Dasara programmes. There were viewers from across the globe who enjoyed a slice of Mysuru Dasara virtually, he added. But virtual viewership is not restricted to Dasara cultural programmes alone. Turning the present crisis plaguing the tourism sector affected by the pandemic into an opportunity, a group of entrepreneurs are presenting a virtual tour showcasing Mysuru to the rest of the world. The concept of virtual tours is gaining traction among travel addicts across the globe. The virtual tour of Mysuru is an initiative of Gully Tours – earlier known as Royal Mysore Walks – who showcase Old Mysuru with its heritage and culture to the discerning tourists. Vinay Parameswarappa, founder and CEO, Gully Tours, said it is a unique way of experiencing Dasara in Mysuru and it will be hosted on Zoom where a city expert would take the participants on a fun and interactive journey with live narration with the help of archival photographs, videos and maps. “The Mysuru Dasara Virtual Tour is part of a series of Virtual Tours by Gully Tours. The first was a virtual tour of Mysuru palace which was well received and had participants from India, U.S., U.K. and Australia,” he said. With the virtual tour, participants get to explore the origins, symbolism and significance of the city’s grand festival right from the comfort of ones house. COVID-19 hit the tourism sector hard and the Gully Tours was no exception. But it harnessed technology to take advantage of the growing trend of online working, webinars, etc. and decided to offer virtual tours that have already caught on in other parts of the world. But this experiment will not end with Dasara as Gully Tours has planned a series of simulated trips over the next few weeks including a virtual tour that explores the story of Tipu, Srirangapatna and its global connections, one of Kochi where they will explore its spice trade history and the Jewish community, and one of the IT industry in Bengaluru among others. A portion of the proceeds will go to assist tourist guides who are without income since the ockdown began.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mysuru-dasara-virtual-audience-tours-gain-traction/article32934640.ece

24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Civic body to redress concerns on stormwater drain scheme||The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has decided to form local committees to redress the complaints of residents who are against the Integrated Storm Water Drainage (ISWD) scheme being executed in six divisions located along the East Coast Road (ECR). The decision to have local committees, comprising assistant executive engineers and assistant engineers, was taken at a meeting organised by the civic body for members of residents welfare associations at Amma Maligai in the city on Thursday to clarify doubts and highlight the positive features of the ISWD project for preventing rainwater from flowing into the sea. Residents and representatives from various associations and from the fishing community attended the two-hour-long meeting. They noted that officials had assured them of providing a detailed project report and holding further discussions on the project. Chitra Rajan, resident of Akkarai, said, “Many residents pointed out that there were other civic amenities that needed to be given priority, such as better water supply and sewer network. The areas along the ECR do not need SWD as the sandy soil allows natural percolation of water. We have asked the civic body not to carry out the project without the consent of the residents.” Residents also noted that the project would hinder groundwater recharge and was not necessary for localities along ECR, unlike other areas of the city. Ram Shankar, coordinator, Save Water and Recharge Aquifers Network, said several participants were not convinced about the project and insisted on dropping it. Even during the 2015 floods, areas along the ECR were not waterlogged. Recharge wells would help in better percolation. A senior Corporation official said the local committees would take remedial measures for any complaints by the residents. Thousands of cubic metres of rainwater would be saved by creating percolating wells in sandy areas, which would prevent it from going to waste into the sea. He said more than 20 eco-block wells, 168 sunken wells and 2,000 percolation pits were proposed for the divisions covering Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam, Sholinganallur and Uthandi. The Kovalam basin project is being funded by KfW, the German development bank, and the detailed project report is being prepared by Kocks Consultants, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-to-redress-concerns-on-stormwater-drain-scheme/article32934673.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM inaugurates seven projects, lays foundation for nine more||After nearly six years, Nokia’s defunct plant at Sriperumbudur, which was acquired by Salcomp, commenced production as Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated it on Friday. Mr. Palaniswami inaugurated seven projects worth Rs. 1,298.2 crore with the potential to generate as many as 7,879 jobs. Of the seven projects that went live, the memoranda of understanding for six were inked at the second edition of the Global Investors’ Meet that was held at the Chennai Trade Centre in January 2019. “We have commenced production, and the plant will reach full capacity by the end of 2022,” Sasikumar Gendham, managing director of Salcomp India, told The Hindu . According to him, two lines were activated for production, while another six would go live by the year-end. “The plan is to make 50 million pieces of chargers and components that go into mobiles/chargers by the end of 2021,” he said. Nokia’s Chennai plant downed shutters in 2014 following a tax dispute. When Microsoft acquired Nokia’s handset business, the Chennai plant was excluded from the deal. The tax issues were settled in 2018 and the plant was put up for sale. It was acquired by Salcomp in 2019. The other projects that went live are of Wheels India at Thervoy Kandigai, Tiruvallur, with an investment of Rs. 600 crore for making automotive wheels and mining equipment; Power Gear at Walajapet, Ranipet, (Rs. 37 crore); Nash Industries at Kancheepuram (Rs. 56.5 crore); BBL Daido (Rs. 22 crore); and Mudhra Fine Blanc at Irungattukottai (Rs. 12.7 crore). The project proposed by Kalpathi AGS Group-Dindigul Renewable Energy Private Limited (Phase 1), worth Rs. 70 crore, for solar power generation at Batlagundu, Dindigul, also got off the ground. Mr. Palaniswami also laid the foundation for nine projects, worth Rs. 10,062 crore, with an employment commitment to 8,666 persons. One of the projects is a training centre by Hyundai Motors at Irungattukottai, entailing an investment to the tune of Rs. 150 crore. This centre will come up on a 6.45 acre land parcel and develop talent and make them ready for global opportunities in world-class companies setting up shop in India. “With the new training centre, we are confident of creating a rich talent pool of trained personnel across industries. The Hyundai Academy for Technical Skill marks a new chapter in employment generation and will pave the way for sustained professional growth, sparking an all-round personal and economic development for beneficiaries. We have also envisioned an innovation centre which will provide facilities to budding innovators to translate their projects into reality,” said S.S. Kim, MD and CEO, Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Vikram Solar, which signed an MoU in July during the lockdown, also had its ground breaking ceremony. Information provided by government officials showed that the company planned to invest Rs. 5,512 crore and hire 4,738 people. When the MoU was signed, the company said it would invest Rs. 5,423 crore at Kancheepuram and provide employment to 7,542 persons. The foundation was laid for a logistics park by Integrated Chennai Business Park (DP World), involving Rs. 1,000 crore, Kalpathi AGS Group-Dindigul Renewable Energy Private Limited (Phase 2) with investment of Rs. 300 crore, Shreevari Energy Systems (Rs. 250 crore), Chennai SSSS Equipment (Rs. 50 crore), Adani Gas (Rs. 2,000 crore), Philips Carbon Black (Rs. 600 crore) and Aquasub Engineering (Rs. 200 crore).

24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin shedding crocodile tears, says Chief Minister||DMK president M.K. Stalin is shedding crocodile tears on the issue of the 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical education, and is trying to gain political mileage, but the people will see through his designs, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Friday. “The DMK and the Congress, which were responsible for the introduction of the NEET, have no right to say the AIADMK government has not mounted enough pressure on the Governor on the horizontal reservation issue. It is the AIADMK government that has created 3,050 new medical seats in the last nine years,” Mr. Palaniswami said in a statement. The AIADMK government got a Bill on the horizontal quota through the Assembly to give an opportunity to students of government schools on a par with those of private schools. “Hence, people will see through the Leader of the Opposition shedding crocodile tears...,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said that to gain political mileage, Mr. Stalin wanted to create an impression that it was because of the DMK’s efforts that the Governor was looking into the Bill. He said the government had successfully contained the spread of COVID-19 and keeping in mind the welfare of people, he had announced that a vaccine, when available, would be given free of cost to people. “Mr. Stalin is afraid that the AIADMK government is finding favour with people and following my announcement on the vaccine, he is again indulging in ‘press release politics’. People will not be fooled by this,” he said. Baseless: Stalin DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday charged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami with making baseless statements about NEET and said the exams began to be conducted in Tamil Nadu only after he took charge. “Mr. Palaniswami has no right to speak about competence in his statement. If he wants to prove his competence and worth to the people, he should get the Governor’s approval immediately for the horizontal reservation of 7.5% in medical admission,” he said. Joining issue with the Chief Minister, Mr. Stalin said he had written to the Governor on the issue only with the good intention that he would take a swifter decision if both the ruling party and the opposition jointly raised the issue.

24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Multi-level car park project at pedestrian plaza delayed||The Pondy Bazaar pedestrian plaza will celebrate its first anniversary in a few weeks. However, the promised multi-level car park is yet to become functional, though the civil work is nearly complete. The equipment for the facility arrived from China earlier this year but COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown, both in Wuhan and later in India, disrupted the deadlines. Work on the car park started in July. The swanky facility, with its glass facade, is all set to become a landmark. Officials said the equipment had been installed and were being tested. However, the technical team from Wuhan is yet to arrive to give its final approval. The launch date will be decided by the month-end, an official said. According to him, the work will be completed by the end of December. The parking lot can accommodate 222 cars and around 350 two-wheelers. Roads get a makeover Meanwhile, roads adjoining the plaza are getting a makeover. An official said civil work on G.N. Chetty Road and Venkatanarayana Road had been completed. Roads have been laid as well. However, with the festival season setting in, residential localities around the Pondy Bazaar pedestrian plaza have been under tremendous pressure, bearing the brunt of the increased vehicular traffic. Adjacent roads such as Gopalakrishna Street, Masilamani Street, Muthukrishnan Street and Raja Street are notorious for vehicles pushing pedestrians to the edge. Prakash Galada, a long-time resident of T. Nagar, suggested that the battery-operated cars display a sticker indicating that they do not charge for transport. “It has not been made clear that it is a free service. I see people waiting to tip the drivers,” he said. Though officials say the plaza work is almost complete, residents are not sure if the streets would ever be peaceful. Tangedco has dug deep trenches to lay underground cables in Thanikachalam Road and Arcot Street.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/multi-level-car-park-project-at-pedestrian-plaza-delayed/article32934668.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Government-run retail outlets in Chennai sell onions at Rs. 45 a kg||The government-run Farm Fresh outlets in the city sold nearly 10 tonnes of onions at subsidised prices in two days. The Department of Cooperation is sourcing more onions to keep the price line under control. On Friday, there were long queues since early morning in front of Farm Fresh outlets, which sold onions for Rs. 45 a kg. Initially, 2 kg of onions were sold to each consumer. Soon, the quantity was restricted to 1 kg as demand soared. Stocks from Maharashtra Officials said about 32 tonnes of onions had arrived in the city for sale. About 300 tonnes would be procured from Maharashtra through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation by Monday. The stock would be sent to 65 outlets across the State. The department is in the process of sourcing small onions from the Horticulture Department as it was also very expensive. The demand for small onions is high in other parts of the State as compared to Chennai, officials said. In the retail market, onions sold at Rs. 90 a kg and small onions at Rs. 140 a kg on Friday. Koyambedu wholesalers said the market received 80-100 tonnes of Egyptian onions on Thursday and sold them for Rs. 60 a kg. This contributes to 20% of the arrivals. Most of the stock of onions were sold out as Friday was a holiday. Traders’ plea Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Association and Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu have urged the government to reopen all semi-wholesale and retail shops in Koyambedu ahead of the festive season. At a meeting on Friday, federation president P.R. Pandian said the closure not only affected traders but also farmers as the market received produce from 22 districts across Tamil Nadu. The federation plans to hold conferences on the Centre’s farm laws in five zones of the State along with the traders’ body. It would discuss the anti-farmers policies, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-run-retail-outlets-in-city-sell-onions-at-rs-45-a-kg/article32934659.ece

24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Retired Director General of Police moves HC seeking advance bail||Retired Director General of Police W. Ramesh Kudawala, 61, has approached the Madras High Court, seeking anticipatory bail in a case booked against him and others for allegedly cheating film comedian Suri in the purchase of an immovable property, for Rs. 5.76 crore, at Siruseri. The petitioner apprehended that the police might arrest and “compel” him to admit the offence, though he had nothing to do with the transaction. He also said that the reported transaction was civil in nature. Explaining details of the case, the former police officer said that his son Vishnu Vishal was a film actor, managing his professional and financial activities on his own. However, the comedian, in a police complaint, had claimed that the petitioner had approached him for playing a comic role in a movie titled Veera Theera Suran, in which his son was to play the lead role. The complainant further said claimed that his remuneration was fixed at Rs. 40 lakh. According to the comedian, he was not paid any remuneration for 32 additional days of shooting, that took place after a change in the production house. In the meantime, the petitioner reportedly enticed the comedian to invest in real estate. Siruseri property Claiming that he had purchased a property in Siruseri for Rs. 5.76 crore through Mr. Rajan, the complainant stated that only after the purchase did he come to know that the property was landlocked. The retired DGP said he had no connection, whatsoever, with the alleged transaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retired-dgp-moves-hc-seeking-advance-bail/article32934686.ece

24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HR&CE Department gives impetus to temple land identification exercise||The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department has decided to give an impetus to a court-initiated exercise that commenced in February 2018 for identifying immovable properties owned by every temple under its control, ascertaining the extent of properties alienated illegally so far, the lands that were under encroachment and those for which paltry amounts were being paid as rent or lease. HR&CE Commissioner S. Prabhakar has expressed disappointment over the lack of any major progress in the last two years and summoned all district-level Assistant Commissioners to his office for submission of the details, along with statistics. In a communication to regional and district officials, he deplored the practice of officials providing contradictory statistics to the Department. The communication recalled that Justice R. Mahadevan of the Madras High Court had, on February 12, 2018, directed the Department to form individual committees to identify all temple land and free them of encroachment and illegal occupation within six weeks. The judge also ordered that the property details of every temple be hosted on the Department’s website, and action be initiated against officials who had failed to protect the lands. Committees formed Immediately thereafter, the Department ordered constitution of property identification committees in every temple. District-level review committees, comprising the Assistant Commissioners, were also formed. However, when their performance was reviewed recently, it was found to be unsatisfactory. T.R. Ramesh of the Indic Collective Trust, which had filed several cases in the High Court for protecting temple properties, alleged that the HR&CE Commissioner began to crack the whip only after a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha recently warned that he would have to appear in person before the court if no proper progress was shown on the issue of alienation of lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hrce-department-gives-impetus-to-temple-land-identification-exercise/article32934075.ece

This was done in consultation with the Archbishop of Madras Mylapore and Bishop in Chennai, Church of South India Diocese of Madras. According to a press release, it was decided to keep the cemeteries closed on November 2 based on the State government’s advice on precautionary measures to be taken during the pandemic. People are requested to refrain from visiting the cemeteries on that day as there will be no prayer services. However, they may pay homage to the departed souls at the cemeteries on other days in November, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kilpauk-kasimedu-cemeteries-to-remain-closed-on-all-souls-day/article32934671.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Northeast monsoon to set in around Oct. 28||The northeast monsoon is likely to set in over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry around October 28. The India Meteorological Department has announced that northeasterly winds that act as a precursor to the monsoon may come in around October 26 or 27 and set the platform for the northeast monsoon. With the setting in of northeasterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels over Bay of Bengal, the southwest monsoon is expected to withdraw from the country around October 28. This would pave the way for simultaneous onset of the northeast monsoon over the southern region, officials said. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Friday, Pallipattu in Tiruvallur district received 17 cm of rainfall, the highest amount for the day. Several other weather stations in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts recorded heavy rainfall. Many areas in and around the city such as Nungambakkam (7 cm), Sholinganallur and Red Hills (6 cm), Korattur, Alandur, Meenambakkam and Perambur (5 cm) and Chembarambakkam, Ambattur and Poonamallee (4 cm) received moderate to heavy rainfall. Flood warning has been issued in villages surrounding Kosasthalaiyar river in Tiruvallur district as about 900 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water were released from the Ammapalli reservoir, Krishnapuram village, upstream in Andhra Pradesh, around 2 p.m. on Friday. Officials of the Water Resources Department said the surplus water discharged on Thursday had reached the Arunkulam checkdam located 15 km upstream of Poondi reservoir, which is a major reservoir that feeds the city’s water supply. “We expect the water released into the Kosasthalaiyar river on Friday to reach Poondi. It already got an inflow of 250 cusecs from catchment areas following rains apart from Krishna water. It has a storage of 1,310 million cubic feet against capacity of 3,231 mcft,” said an official. Meanwhile, the Meteorological department forecast light to moderate thundershowers to continue in a few places of north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and one or two places in south Tamil Nadu for the next two days. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the east-west shear zone and the depression over west-central Bay of Bengal brought thunderstorms over the State. The transition period of wind patterns from southwesterly to northeasterly was another reason for localised convection and intense thunderstorms. He recalled IMD’s forecast where NE monsoon is expected to bring near normal rainfall over north Tamil Nadu and rainfall would be below normal in southern parts. Chennai may experience light rains in some areas during the weekend and the maximum temperature will be around 33 degree Celsius, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/northeast-monsoon-to-set-in-around-oct-28/article32934049.ece

In a statement, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member G. Ramakrishnan referred to the Governor’s response to DMK president M.K. Stalin that it will take at least three to four weeks for him to decide on the Bill. “His response raises doubts. What other important work he has got during that period? Did the Governor point that out to the Ministers who met him? Why did the Ministers not disclose it?” he asked. Mr. Ramakrishnan also said the delay in decision raises suspicion that the Governor is helping in adopting policies of the BJP government and it cannot be allowed. Alagiri’s warning Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Friday warned of severe consequences if the Governor kept delaying the decision on giving assent to the Bill. In a statement, he pointed out the Governor could not act against the recommendation of the State Cabinet, and strongly condemned the delay in decision-making. Mr. Alagiri also slammed the ruling AIADMK government and alleged they had not put adequate pressure on the Governor over the issue. He further alleged that Governors in States like West Bengal and Maharashtra, among others, were acting like agents of the BJP government at the Centre, and the Tamil Nadu Governor was also adopting the same approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-assent-to-the-bill-or-leave-cpim-tells-governor/article32934682.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Counselling only after Bill gets nod: Jayakumar||The government will persist in its attempts at getting the Governor’s assent for the Bill providing 7.5% horizontal reservation to NEET-qualified State government students in medical admissions, Fisheries Minister D.Jayakumar said on Friday. He added that the government was confident that Governor Banwarilal Purohit will give his assent to the Bill. Speaking to reporters in Chennai, Mr. Jayakumar said counselling for MBBS/BDS will be held only when the Governor gives his assent. “We have 100% confidence in the Governor. He will definitely give his approval to the Bill. Only when the horizontal quota of 7.5% is fulfilled will counselling be held. We are clear on that,” he said. Mr. Jayakumar said there was nothing wrong with the Governor replying to DMK president M.K. Stalin on the issue. “The Governor told us how long it will take [to decide]. That is what he has told Mr. Stalin, who is the Leader of the Opposition. The Governor has told him what the status is,” he said. The Minister also asked why the DMK did not bring in a similar quota when it was in power and charged that the Opposition party was trying to gain credit by protesting on the issue. On PMK’s demand for 20% Vanniyar quota, the Minister said the PMK had given a representation and it was for the government to give a reply. When asked about the release of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala from prison, Mr. Jayakumar said no political motives should be attributed to it. “If she comes out, it is her family that is going to be happy. If she is not released, it is her family that will feel sad,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/counselling-only-after-bill-gets-nod-jayakumar/article32934088.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Teen swindles Rs. 9.5 lakh from senior citizen’s bank account||The Cyber Crime Cell of Anna Nagar traced an online fraud involving a 17-year-old following a complaint lodged by a 75-year-old doctor alleging that Rs. 7.5 lakh was debited from his bank account without his authorisation. The 75-year-old retired government doctor was staying alone at Anna Nagar while his two sons lived abroad and a daughter, who is also a doctor, lives in Kancheepuram. A domestic aide and her son staying on the terrace were taking care of him for more than five years. While the doctor was staying with his daughter in Kancheepuram, he realised that Rs. 7.5 lakh from his account had been debited between March and August. He lodged a complaint with the Anna Nagar police, who forwarded the complaint to the Cyber Crime Cell. The doctor had an ordinary mobile phone. His family did not allow the police to interrogate the domestic aide and her son since they trusted them. During investigation, the police found that the money was transferred from the bank account to two mobile wallets and an e-commerce portal and also was used to buy popular online games. The police team managed to trace a mobile phone number linked to a electronic wallet, which was used by the boy who lived in the doctor’s house. The teenager had allegedly collected details of the bank account and debit card while helping the doctor with online transactions in March, the investigation revealed. The doctor was unaware of the transactions although he received alerts on his mobile phone. The boy spent Rs. 9.5 lakh from the doctor’s account for buying premium packages of online games, besides electronic gadgets. The boy was let off with a warning as the doctor’s family withdrew the complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teen-swindles-rs-95-lakh-from-bank-account/article32934660.ece
24 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court refuses to quash 35-year-old case||The Madras High Court has paved the way for the commencement of trial in a 35-year-old case, booked for an alleged attempt to murder Anton Balasingam, a close confidante of LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, at his residence in Besant Nagar, Chennai, in 1985. Justice P.N. Prakash refused to quash the case just because Balasingham was no more, just one accused was available for trial and most records were not available with the court due to the passage of time and the transfer of the case from one court to another. The judge agreed with Government Advocate (criminal side) P. Kritika Kamal that though Balasingham was no more, other witnesses were available to testify. Further, case records had been reconstructed and trial could proceed, he said. Though some accused were absconding and one person had died, the judge ordered that the trial could commence against the available accused, Veerasangili Kanniah Thanabalan alias V.K.T. Balan, who had moved the High Court to quash the case on the ground of long delay. Relying on a couple of Supreme Court verdicts, wherein it had been held that delay could not be a sole ground to quash a case, the judge said in the present case, the allegations against the accused were indeed very serious as a bomb had exploded in Balasingham's residence but luckily, no one was injured. Further, the accused had also been charged with passing on official secrets regarding the country. Therefore, a delay or loss of records could not be cited as reasons for quashing the case, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-refuses-to-quash-35-year-old-case/article32934685.ece

24 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19: safety guidelines go for a toss at Flower Market||On Friday, the scene at the Flower Market gave little indication that a battle was on in the city to control the COVID-19 spread. Very few people wore masks and there was hardly any adherence to the physical distancing norm. The violation of the guideline that the State Government, district administration and the Coimbatore Corporation had been insisting upon came even as the civic body held a meeting a few streets away on T.V. Samy Street to caution people against such violations while shopping for the festive season. Only a day ago, the district administration warned commercial establishments of stringent action for failure to ensure adherence to norms on their premises. But the caution from the authorities appears to have had no effect on flower vendors, who have occupied parts of Mecricar Road, Siva Subramaniam Street, Ramachandra Road and Devangapet to make the most of the Navaratri festive season. The traders have not only occupied large tracts of motorable space but also placed their wares so close to one another that it is difficult to follow physical distancing norm among themselves and also among buyers, complains a trader. The failure to monitor the crowd and enforce safety protocol has resulted in flower vendors and buyers moving around without masks or not wearing these properly, rues another trader on Mecricar Road. Recalling that Flower Market and Devangapet were among the worst affected COVID-19 pockets in the city, the traders point out that if the Corporation does not monitor the situation and enforce safety guidelines, the infection can spread. Meanwhile, at Friday’s meeting, Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian asked commercial establishments, particularly textile and jewellery showrooms, to ensure that customers followed physical distancing norm and wore masks, and their employees too followed the norms. He has also asked the shop owners to place hand sanitiser at entry points of outlets, disinfect shops and broadcast awareness messages. On Thursday, Collector K. Rajamani had cautioned that it was important to strictly adhere to the COVID-19 safety guidelines because the district, particularly the city, would see movement of people from within and outside the district during the festive season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-safety-guidelines-go-for-a-toss-at-flower-market/article32934691.ece
24 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Man held for murder of transgender||The Coimbatore City Police on Friday arrested a man on charges of murdering M. Sangeetha (59), a transgender entrepreneur and head of one of the transgenders’ associations in Coimbatore district. The police said R. Rajesh (23) from Nagapattinam district was working under Sangeetha at ‘Covai Trans Kitchen’, a biriyani joint inaugurated under her leadership on East Venkataswamy Road at R.S. Puram in September. He joined early in October and was staying with Sangeetha. As the accused allegedly began torturing her sexually, she threatened to file a complaint with the police against him. This led to her murder on Sunday night at her residence on N.S.R. Road in Saibaba Colony, following which he stuffed the body in a plastic barrel and sprinkled crystal salt on it and absconded, the police said. The police registered a case and City Commissioner of Police Sumit Sharan had ordered the formation of two special teams to nab the accused. On Thursday, Rajesh surrendered at the Sanganoor Village Administrative Office and was later handed over to the police. He confessed to have stolen Rs. 20,000 from Sangeetha’s residence and ran away to his hometown, the police said. A senior police officer said there were no previous murder cases against Rajesh. He confessed to have stuffed the body in the barrel and sprinkled salt to delay the detection of murder, the officer said. The accused was remanded in judicial custody on Friday. ‘Disheartening’ Transgender artist and writer Kalki Subramaniam termed the murder as “disheartening and condemnable.” “Such crimes against transgenders must be taken seriously by the police and the legal system,” she told The Hindu , adding that Sangeetha was a “very respected person in the [transgender] community.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-held-for-murder-of-transgender/article32934121.ece

24 October 2020||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Fall in orders hits puffed rice production in Krishnagiri||Senthil was compelled to scale down the production of puffed rice this Ayudha Puja season, something that he has not seen or heard about in the oral accounts of the family-run business passed on through four generations. Krishnagiri is one of the largest producers of puffed rice that gets distributed across the State. Senthil’s family-run ‘Amudha Pori Mandi’ supplies puffed rice to wholesalers in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruvannamalai. His famous puffed rice mandi, near the market in Krishnagiri town, has seen demand and fall through generations, but never like this one before. “We had to cut down production by half this year,” says Senthil. The puffed rice business took a hit this year, largely from the fall in orders that is usually sealed by the first fortnight of August. Now, the retail demand has increased, but the puffed rice producers have limited their production unwilling to take the chance fearing lukewarm response.  “Orders start to come by the first and the second weeks of August. This year, we got orders only by September end, which was practically nothing.” Every year, Puja season witnesses production and dispatch of over 30,000 sacks from his mandi. This year, his orders ranged between 15,000 to 17,000 sacks. “A sack contains 100 lts of puffed rice” With just two days to go for the festival, there is a sudden spike in retail demand, but the production has already closed to meet the demand. “We need a minimum of four days to process puffed rice. There is no time now. But, irrespective of the demand, the price is the same Rs. 350 per sack,” says Senthil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-in-orders-hits-puffed-rice-production-in-krishnagiri/article32934112.ece

Arch admission conducted for JEE (Main) examination, April 2020. The petitioner, T. Kavinraj, said Drawing Part III paper examination was conducted in ‘pen and paper’ offline mode to be attempted on a drawing sheet to test the drawing aptitude of candidates, for which there was no answer key. He sought display of the answer key so that if candidates were not satisfied with it, they could challenge it. The NTA submitted that for the subjective paper no answer key was provided and there could not be allotment of partial marks for every stage of drawing. The answer sheets were assessed by two independent subject experts and if their assessment differed by more than 25 % it was placed for scrutiny before a head expert. If the difference between the marks given by the two experts was less than 25%, then the average was taken. The process of dual verification was followed in order to curb the possibility of incorrect assessment and prepare the result in a fair and transparent manner. The petitioner was aware of this system of conduct of the examination, it was submitted. Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed that the common test was conducted throughout India and for Drawing Part III, which was a subjective paper, there was no need to award marks in stages and to upload the key answers in the website. Except wishing the candidate ‘All the Best’ to come out with flying colours in the forthcoming examinations, the court said, it could not grant relief to him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-dismisses-architecture-course-aspirants-petition/article32934108.ece

24 October 2020||P.A. NarayaniMadurai,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 leads to change in evaluation process in schools||With the closure of schools owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, online classes are being conducted by private schools for the past five months and now classes are being conducted for the second term as well. The current set-up has not only changed the teaching methodology, but has changed the evaluation process as well. Most of the private schools did not conduct three-hour-long quarterly examinations before commencement of the second term, but opted for unit tests for a shorter duration to assess students. D. Ravikumar, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Nursery Primary Matriculation Higher Secondary CBSE Schools Association, said most private schools conducted online examinations to assess students. “It was optional for students to take up the exams as the government had directed that they should not be compelled to take tests or attend online classes,” he said. Students were asked to complete multiple choice questions in the online sheets sent by the schools. “Students of Classes 10, 11 and 12 were asked to have their cameras switched on while writing long answers. These students had to scan their answer sheets and had to either mail it or WhatsApp the answer sheets to their schools,” he added. Guidelines released by the State government for online classes said that while assessments could be carried out during the period, they should not be made mandatory or counted for final scores. Sangeetha, a parent of a Class 5 student, said closely watching the computer screen while writing the exam had resulted in eye strain for her daughter. Indira Pandiarajan, a member of Global Nursery and Primary Schools Association, said many private schools allowed students to take up the online exams only if they had paid the tuition fee. Mr. Ravikumar said schools were constantly keeping tests for students of Classes 10 and 12, as they fear that these students will have to take up board examinations next year. Several teachers reiterated the need to make an early announcement on the reduced syllabus, said K.Saravanan, Principal of Dr. T. Thirugnanam Primary School.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-leads-to-change-in-evaluation-process-in-schools/article32934096.ece
24 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Local body polls to bring about shift in governance: Bedi||The conduct of local body elections will cause a “dramatic” shift in governance of the Union Territory as it will ensure the participation of women in decision-making, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi said on Friday. “The elected men and women will be able to plan and ensure due implementation of their own programmes. Women will form one-third of this grassroots leadership, which is a dramatic shift in governance of the U.T. Right now, there is no woman in the Cabinet,” Ms. Bedi said in a message to reporters. After the elections, many women would be involved in planning and decision-making, she said and urged the Local Administration Department and the District Rural Development Agency to educate people on the likely changes. The Education Department could be involved in the awareness programme as the services of teachers could be used, she said. “There is no going back now. We have a legal direction (Supreme Court order on conducting polls) to process the elections without any delay,” she said. The team led by the Chief Secretary had ensured that an experienced person was appointed as the State Election Commissioner. The office of the Lt. Governor had fulfilled its responsibility so as to ensure everything went legally, Ms. Bedi said. “We now have to grasp this change quickly and get ready in identifying and choosing right candidates in the coming months so that we can ensure a prosperous Puducherry.” Process set in motion Refusing to get drawn into the controversy surrounding his appointment, State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas on Friday said he had initiated the process to hold local body elections in Puducherry. “I cannot predict whether it will be held before or after the Assembly elections. All I can assure is that civic body polls will be held at an appropriate time,” he said at his first press conference after assuming charge. All the stakeholders would be consulted in due course on holding the elections. Mr. Thomas said he had called on Ms. Bedi and Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy after assuming charge on Wednesday as per protocol. Key appointments to conducting the polls, including that of district and regional election officers, would be made shortly. The next task would be to prepare the draft electoral roll. The delimitation process had been completed, the SEC added. Stating that it was “unfortunate” that civic body elections were not held for a long time, he said local bodies were the backbone of the administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/local-body-polls-to-bring-about-shift-in-governance-bedi/article32934106.ece

24 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Private buses get low patronage in Puducherry||Although private buses have resumed skeletal services in the city under a set of precautionary norms stipulated by the government and with strict limits on permissible seating and standing capacity, it could take at least a few weeks for the operations to stabilise, the operators said. Of the approximately 220 buses operating, only a fraction of the vehicles are back on the road after nearly seven months. Bus owners said that because of the long break, many buses would have to be serviced to make them roadworthy. Inter-State services are yet to resume in the Villupuram, Cuddalore, Tindivanam and Chidambaram sectors. The resumption of services on routes follows a meeting convened with operators by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy recently. According to the operators, the concession offered was a waiver of road tax for two quarters of the fiscal — the per quarter rates were about Rs. 28,000 for inter-State, Rs. 18,000 for intra-State and Rs. 14,000 for town service categories. “It could take some time for people to patronise bus services. Most buses are running well below permitted capacity during off-peak hours,” said Bharathi Kannan, president of the Puducherry Private Bus Owners’ Association. Following the norms Adopting social distancing norms means that only one passenger would sit on the two-seat block and two on the three-seat block while 25 passengers were allowed to travel standing. More than the restrictions on passengers though, poor patronage was adding to the operational cost. “We hope the situation will improve once inter-State services begin,” Mr. Kannan said. The association appealed to the government for an increase in ticket prices to cover the losses as they were operating with reduced passenger capacity. While the Transport Commissioner had written to his counterpart in Tamil Nadu, the Chief Minister had assured them of taking up the matter of resumption of inter-State services with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-buses-get-low-patronage/article32934878.ece

24 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Plea for minor bridge across canal||Residents of newly-added wards of the Tiruchi City Corporation have sought construction of a minor bridge across the Kuvalai drain which separates Balaji Nagar and SAS Nagar, New Town near Kattur. They have resorted to taking a detour, along the accident-prone Thanjavur Road where there is no service lane, they say. Balaji Nagar and SAS Nagar, New Town in ward number 63 of the Tiruchi City Corporation are divided by the Kuvalai drain, which branches off from the Uyyakondan canal. With the busy Thanjavur highway running on one side, residents are unable to commute between the two localities, they say. Four years ago, women in the locality took the initiative to mobilise funds to construct a pedestrian bridge across the canal. About Rs. 50,000 was collected and with it, large pipes, to ensure that the flow of water is unrestricted, were laid after which a concrete pedestrian pathway was constructed. The minor bridge, if constructed would help two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws avoid the congested Thanjavur road. “This is mainly for people on SAS Nagar, Muthu Nagar side who travel up to the Kuvalai drain, walk across the pedestrian bridge to drop their children off to school in Balaji Nagar. At least 100 children from the nearly 1000 houses in the area go to school in Balaji Nagar,” A. Gunashekar, a resident of SAS Nagar said. Others ride on the wrong side of the road along the Tiruchi- Thanjavur road since there is no service lane. "Many accidents involving senior citizens and children have occurred and even then, the authorities have paid no heed," he said. Representations have been submitted to the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Tiruverumbur MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi by the New Town, Muthu Nagar, Vaithiyalingam Nagar, Roshan Nagar Integrated Residents Welfare Association. A senior PWD official said that they were willing to give a no-objection certificate and have drawn up an estimate for construction of the bridge. ‘The residents said that they would make arrangements for the funds and we are awaiting its approval to begin work,’ he said. A proposal at an estimate of Rs. 49 lakhs has been prepared, while the residents have approached the Tiruverumbur MLA and the Tiruchi Collector for assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-minor-bridge-across-canal/article32934090.ece

24 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||NEET: government school students need more support||Against the backdrop of the State Government’s move to provide for 7.5% quota in medical admissions for students of government schools by passing a Bill in the Assembly, parents say a little more has to be done to bring about a level playing field between their wards and their peers in private schools. No doubt, the quota, when it becomes a law, will help government schools to push up enrolment and expect to retain bright students at higher secondary level henceforth. But then, unlike in the case of government school students who appear only once for the examination without any extra preparation, their peers belonging to affluent economic backgrounds exercise the leverage to make second and third attempts by enrolling themselves for the NEET Repeaters training imparted by private entities. ‘We perceive that the School Education Department’s apparent sense of achievement over the encouraging performance of the students from government schools in rural parts in NEET and JEE is based on the premise of equal opportunities. It is surprising that the high success rate of those undergoing NEET repeaters programme over the years has gone unnoticed. A level-playing field still remains a distant dream,’ a senior teacher of a government higher secondary school in Tiruchi district said. ‘In the past, when the marks scored in Plus Two was considered for medical admissions, the government stepped in with a stipulation that the score of students in the first attempt alone will be taken into consideration. A similar step is necessary. But, the difficulty now is that the onus of taking the decision on this issue vests with the Central Government,’ a government school headmaster said. As years pass by, the number of students who clear the NEET in the first attempt keeps getting lesser, he said. There is an apparent consensus among government school heads that this discrepancy could be addressed to a reasonable extent by assigning weightage for scores in Plus One and Plus Two, along with the NEET score. Now that NEET is bound to stay due to the evident dilution in the demand for its abolition from political parties and other quarters, the State government must lobby hard with the Centre to bring in measures for a level-playing field in the interests of government school students, they emphasise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/neet-government-school-students-need-more-support/article32934078.ece
24 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Online woes: many seats vacant in government polytechnic colleges||In variation of the usual trend of fixing stiff cut-off for admission, Government Polytechnic colleges are evidently welcoming even below average students with open arms this year, apparently due to severe dent in the intake caused by introduction of online system of admission in view of COVID-19 pandemic As much as 50 % seats are yet to be filled in at least half of the 54 government polytechnic colleges in the State, even after the extension of date of admission till October 31, according to sources. A week ago, government polytechnic colleges came out with an announcement stating that students with SSLC qualification will be admitted till October 31 in the offline mode. For instance, nearly 100 seats remained vacant till last week in the Government Polytechnic College at Keezhapazhur in Ariyalur district. Though the yearly fee is just Rs. 2,500 a year and students are entitled to free laptops, free bus pass, scholarships and other freebies from the government, students could not be found since the online admission process turned out to be a deterrent. Private polytechnic colleges were at a considerable advantage this time around, as they could reach out to the students at their doorsteps. The plight of government-aided polytechnics was slightly better. A front-ranking polytechnic in Tiruchi district, managed to fill the seats, the number of applicants was much lower this year due to the introduction of online system for admission during the months of stringent lockdown, sources said. The number of applicants in the Government Polytechnic Tiruchi was reportedly quite dismal this year, as rural students who usually seek admission in the institution found the going tough to comply with the requirements of online system of admission. Completion of the admission process for Plus One in advance was another reason for the fall in number of applicants in government polytechnics, a Principal of a polytechnic college in a rural district in the region, said. The momentum of academic rigour in polytechnics is bound to slow down this year, another principal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-seats-remain-vacant-in-govt-polytechnic-colleges/article32934083.ece

They secured seven absconding accused, six property offenders and a few others against whom non-bailable warrants had been pending,” he said on Friday. Rajesh Das, Special Director General of Police (Law and Order), who was in Tiruchi in connection with the visit of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to Pudukottai district on Thursday, oversaw the operation. Mr. Loganathan said formation of special teams to secure those against whom non-bailable warrants have been pending, tracing property offenders and rowdy elements and checking smuggling of contraband or other any unauthorised and banned substances formed part of the operation. They had identified 30 locations including bus stands to check vehicles. Additional components including foot patrolling in crime-prone areas within the city limits and watching houses where senior citizens reside have been incorporated in the standard operating protocol. Police personnel of the respective beats would watch places like Automated Teller Machines too. A few days ago, the city police conducted a drive against ganja peddlers. A list of offenders in the last four years was taken and their antecedents were checked. Property crimes, theft of two-wheelers and house break-ins have persisted. The recent seizure of 77 stolen motorcycles points to its persistence. Of the 77 recovered vehicles, 19 were reported stolen in the Tiruchi city police limits and the rest from nearby districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-intensify-efforts-to-nab-criminals/article32934059.ece

24 October 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Corporation urged to maintain crematorium||Citizens’ groups in Tiruchi have raised concerns over transfer of the Oyamari crematorium to a private contractor. The maintenance of the crematorium, which is managed by the civic body, is to be transferred to a private society after they improve the infrastructure of the facility, senior officials said. “The private organisation has agreed to redevelop the grounds, at a cost of Rs. 3 crore, after which they will charge Rs. 3,000 to cremate a body,” S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner, said. However, a section of citizens claims that the shift was unnecessary. “The civic body could use the funds to improve infrastructure in the city, improve roads or even construct some parks in the area. We do not need to spend Rs. 3,000 for a cremation,” said M. Sekaran, Chairman, Citizens’ Forum. He said that many residents would not be able to afford the cost of cremation. “Charge of Rs. 1,500, which is being charged by the civic body, is too high,” he said. “There were several problems earlier when a private contractor had been maintaining the grounds. We do not want the issues to surface again,” he added. Meanwhile, the road leading to the crematorium and the surrounding area is in a sorry state, he said. One of the two furnaces at the cremation grounds too is not functional. “If the civic body wishes to improve the infrastructure, they may do so on their own. It is the duty of a civic body to ensure provision for burial and cremation grounds,” he said. He has written to the Chief Minister’s Cell seeking his intervention on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-urged-to-maintain-crematorium/article32934086.ece

Many Adivasi activists as well as school teachers had voiced their concerns that many school-going children from Adivasi communities in remote areas of the Nilgiris would be unable to access television sets and laptops to study their lessons. A. Nasarudeen, Chief Education Officer, Nilgiris district, said that following the closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the District Collector had identified the issues that Adivasi students would face due to the closure of the schools. “Many children live in communities far away from towns and human habitations, with some villages being without mobile network connectivity,” he said. To ensure that these communities have access to community television sets, they have been made available in the nearest government school closest to the remote Adivasi villages in Udhagamandalam, Gudalur, Coonoor, Kotagiri and Pandalur. Meanwhile, the Nilgiri Adivasi Welfare Association (NAWA), said that the six teachers employed by them were being sent to remote tribal hamlets around Kotagiri to assist students with their lessons. “We have also set up an internet link to Banagudi villagei,,” said M. Alwas, secretary of NAWA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-in-remote-tribal-hamlets-get-television-sets/article32934696.ece

Veeramani on Friday inaugurated the new Pernambut bus stand premises with temporary facilities. Officials said while buses will begin plying immediately, a modern bus terminus would be built on the premises in the coming months. The Pernambut bus terminus is usually abuzz as buses bound for Chennai, Tiruvannamalai, Salem, Kancheepuram and other districts through Vellore stop here. Once inter-State services resume, buses going towards Bengaluru also will stop here. However, at present, only four buses can be accommodated in the bus stand at a time. “The land belongs to the Police Department. They want it back and we thought it would be better to have the bus stand on municipality land,” said C. Vijayakumar, Regional Director, Municipal Administration. The new bus stand will come up on a one-acre plot of land and will have 10 bays. “We inaugurated the premises on Friday. We have sent a detailed project report (DPR) to the government. Once it is sanctioned, we will begin the work,” he added. An official from the Pernambut Municipal Corporation said the bus stand would built at a cost of Rs. 4.15 crore under the public private partnership mode.  Residents protest Meanwhile, some residents of the locality protested against the shifting of the bus stand. “The present bus stand is located in the heart of the town, but the new one is coming up 3 km away from the town. Passengers will find it hard to travel to the villages once they alight at the new stand,” said G. Suresh Kumar, a member of the Pernambut Bus Stand Redemption Team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pernambut-will-get-a-new-bus-stand-soon/article32934935.ece

Meanwhile, the Meteorological department forecast light to moderate thundershowers to continue in a few places in north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and one or two places in south Tamil Nadu for the next two days. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the east-west shear zone and the depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal had brought thunderstorms over the State. The transition period of wind patterns from southwesterly to northeasterly was another reason for localised convection and intense thunderstorms. He recalled IMD’s forecast, which said the NE monsoon is expected to bring near normal rainfall over north Tamil Nadu and below normal in the southern parts. Chennai may experience light rain in some areas during the weekend and the maximum temperature will be around 33 degree Celsius, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/northeast-monsoon-to-set-in-around-oct-28/article32934065.ece

24 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Kittur Utsav toned down this year||Celebrations of the Kittur Utsav, the annual feast on the birth anniversary of Rani Channamma, the dowager queen of the British era kingdom of Kittur, was toned down in Kittur on Friday in view of the COVID-19 situation. However, precautions, including social distancing and wearing masks, were not followed during the celebrations. The three-day festival was reduced to a one-day event this year. The number of artistes to perform along with the rally was reduced to a few and cultural programmes such as songs and dances were not performed on stage. MLA Mahantesh Dodagoudar, Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath, seers of local mutts and others garlanded the statue of Rani Channamma on the intersection of the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway. The district administration had invited some descendants of the Kittur Desai family that Rani Channamma belonged to. The officers and guests welcomed the Veer Jyoti lamp that is taken around the district before every Kittur Utsav. A procession was taken through the main streets of the town. A huge crowd gathered to watch the procession. A large section of the people who gathered did not wear masks nor did they follow social distancing. At Kakati, the birthplace of Rani Channamma, Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan joined Mr. Hiremath in the celebrations. The officers, along with some descendants of Rani Channamma’s maternal family, garlanded the statue of the queen in front of the gram panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kittur-utsav-toned-down-this-year/article32934143.ece
24 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Re-start meal scheme in schools’||Child rights activists and students unions have urged the State government to resume mid-day meals for schoolchildren to ensure that they don’t suffer from starvation. In a letter to the Chief Minister, All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has sought re-starting the mid-day meal programme in all government schools of the State, that was stopped during the COVID-19 lockdown. Mid-day meal is a long-term programme that should never be discontinued. It is the only way in which children from poor families get nutritious food. The programme should be resumed immediately, even if schools are reopened later, the letter said. As a result of the lockdown, the State government has not distributed either foodgrains or milk powder to schoolchildren, that were given to them as part of the mid-day meal or Ksheera Bhagya scheme, since June. “It is a contradiction that while millions of children are starving, foodgrains procured by the government are rotting in public godowns. In Belagavi district, there are over six lakh children who have not got mid-day meal. On the other hand, there are 48 tonnes of rice, 9.1 tonnes of wheat and 5.9 tonnes of other grain in government and public warehouses that have not been distributed. This clearly demonstrates that the government does not care for its people,” said Mahantesh Bilur, district convenor of AIDSO. Women and Child Welfare Society founder Anjali G. feels that the lockdown was completely unnecessary and had only added to the problems of the poor. India has slipped many places down the global hunger index, lower than several Asian countries. One of the reasons is the unscientific manner in which the lockdown and other COVID-19-related issues were handled. She said that the lockdown had taken away jobs and livelihoods of many families who were now finding it hard to feed their children. If the government starts the mid-day meal programme, at least such families will get help to a large extent, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/re-start-meal-scheme-in-schools/article32934144.ece

24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||College reopening: Online class option leads to confusion||College principals, teachers and students are waiting for more clarity from the government after it announced on Friday that classes will resume on November 17. What has got everyone puzzled is the decision to not make physical attendance mandatory. Barring practicals where attendance is compulsory, students will have the option of continuing with online classes. “Does this mean that we have to conduct online classes as well,” asked a teacher. Teachers are worried that it will increase their workload. A professor from a government college in Bengaluru said there would be confusion and lack of uniformity. “Should we record the class for online students and upload it separately or will the recording be done as and when the offline classes are going on?” the professor said. K.R. Venugopal, vice-chancellor, Bangalore University, said they were waiting for the detailed guidelines from the government. “Based on that, we will issue guidelines to colleges affiliated to our university and make arrangements for reopening colleges,” he said. Students, too, are worried about missing out on some key part of the portion if the online and offline classes are not the same. “I do not know how colleges will ensure that one set of students won’t have an advantage over another. This system will not create a level playing field and lead to inequality in terms access,” said a law student from private college. However, the government’s decision to resume practicals has come as a relief to students,who have suggested that this rule should be expanded to chapters dealing with difficult concepts. “There are some subjects that have concepts which cannot be taught and learnt online. Such topics can be completed with students in class, and the rest can be online,” said another student. Welcoming the move, T.M. Manjunatha, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers’ Association, said colleges should take all the necessary precautions to make campuses safe. “The government should ensure that SOPs are strictly adhered to by colleges keeping in mind the health and safety of students and teachers,” he said. Some student organisations have opposed the decision of the Government to reopen colleges after Deepavali. H.M. Sithara, Bengaluru district president, All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO), said that the government was in a hurry to re-open education institutions just to normalise the situation. “It is the duty and responsibility of the Government to first issue astute guidelines on reopening colleges and then announce the decision. Here, they have announced the decision but there are no guidelines or SOPs. This has created confusion and panic among students and teachers,” she said. She also urged the government to resume offline classes only after the pandemic had subsided. Autonomous institutions like Christ (Deemed to be University), St. Joseph’s College of Arts and Science, will hold their semester exams in November-December where students will be given the choice to either write the exam online or offline. Abraham V.M., V-C of Christ (Deemed to be University), said, “We have resumed offline classes partially, but only for practicals sessions for PG and PhD students.”    Based on that (government instructions) we will issue guidelines to colleges affiliated to our university and make arrangements for reopening colleges K.R.

Instead of the usual October heat, people found themselves struggling with overflowing drains, roads turning into streams and flood water entering homes in Rajarajeshwarinagar, Bommanahalli and South zones. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) control rooms were flooded with distress calls from citizens. With extensive damage reported in Hosakerehalli, Dattatreya Layout and Gurudatta Layout, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad said the BBMP had requisitioned help from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). A team of 22 personnel, along with requisite boats, was roped in. He stated that there were no casualties and that water levels had receded in most areas by 8.30 p.m. The compound of Gavigangadhareshwara temple, attached to Hariharagudda park, collapsed. Many houses were flooded with rainwater and water logging was reported in Syndicate Layout, Banashankari 2nd Stage, C.T. Bed, ITI Layout, LIC Colony, 4th Block Koramangala, J.P. Nagar 6th Phase, Arekempanahalli and Kathriguppe. The Manganahalli lake in Ullal overflowed and flooded 6th Block, Visvesvaraya Layout. Residents in several areas blamed civic apathy and encroachment of drains for compounding the flooding. “The civic body is yet to take any action on clearing encroachments,” said one angry resident. Mr. Prasad said the High Court of Karnataka had stayed clearing of encroachments till the end of November. “If the stay is not extended, we will start clearing encroachments on drains from December 1,” he said. Blockage in drains A resident of Garuthman Park in Basavanagudi said blockage in the grate that takes rainwater into Lalbagh led to inundation of their locality. “The BBMP spent crores in ‘repairing’ the stormwater drain, which is meant to prevent flooding. However, each spell of rain gives us nightmares and sleepless nights,” the resident said. “I have lived in south Bengaluru for the last 30 years, but rarely seen rain pouring this hard for hours on end, that too for days in a row in the end of October,” said Meenakshi S., a resident of Banashankari III Stage. Many parts of the Central Business District (CBD) were flooded. Sajjan Raj Mehta, a trade activist, said knee-deep water was stagnating on several roads in Chikpete, Sultanpet, Mamulpet and Old Tharagupet. He said though the traders had, on several occasions, brought this to the attention of BBMP and BWSSB, there was no respite.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heavy-rains-lead-to-flooding-in-several-parts-of-the-city/article32934637.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State sees huge surge in RT-PCR testing||The State’s dependence on Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) has reduced with over 64% of the total 71,68,545 tests conducted till date being molecular (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, or RT-PCR). RT-PCR testing is the gold standard that has negligible chances of false negativity. While over 30% of these have been conducted in Bengaluru Urban and Kalaburagi alone, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru have contributed to nearly 4%. Kodagu has done the least number of RT-PCR tests, with its share being not more than 0.5 %. With testing ramped up aggressively in Bengaluru Urban, the spread of the virus is slowing down here. However, the other districts are seeing a surge and the days taken to double COVID-19 cases in at least 13 districts is lower than the State average of 46 days. Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, told The Hindu that the State had set a target of conducting 80% of the total tests through the RT-PCR method, and on a day-on-day basis the target had been met in the past few days. “Although we have ramped up RT-PCR, we will continue testing using RAT as it is the most useful point-of-care test, especially in the identification and treatment of SARI and ILI cases. Our strategy of increasing tests even as the cases were surging has helped in containing the spread,” he said. “Till a few days ago, we were conducting about 80% RAT and 20% RT-PCR tests. We have reversed this now and have overtaken Tamil Nadu in the number of RT-PCR tests,” he said. Testing strategy Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said, “The overall testing strategy is more important than the numbers.” He added that districts should be reviewed on two criteria. “Finding people by syndromic approach and testing people with symptoms is the first thing. Next, it is important to assess what is the proportion of symptomatic people who tested negative on RAT and who were then tested using RT-PCR. Many districts are going through a surge in cases. Therefore, testing levels have to be increased, depending on the stage of outbreak in the districts,” he said. V. Ravi, senior professor and head of the Department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said Karnataka has been able to bring down the number of new cases and daily test positivity rate only after ramping up RT-PCR tests. “An increase in RT-PCR tests has helped in tracking, testing and identifying positive people and isolating them, reducing false negativity,” he said.  Till a few days ago, we were conducting about 80% RAT and 20% RT-PCR tests. We have reversed this now and have overtaken Tamil Nadu in the number of RT-PCR tests Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-sees-huge-surge-in-rt-pcr-testing/article32934169.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Some local Congress leaders have exploited my secular credentials’||Despite fears of COVID-19, octogenarian former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has decided to stay and campaign for the byelection in Sira, a constituency with a strong Vokkaliga presence that the Janata Dal (Secular) earlier held. In a telephonic interview from Sira in Tumakuru district, the JD(S) patriarch spoke about his campaign and shared his anger against the Congress, once his party’s ally.  What are the chances of the JD(S) retaining the Sira seat? This will be a litmus test for us. The party has a base here and we have to give it strength. We will not win with money power. I am personally approaching voters and it is up to them to take a decision based on the party’s work and that of the deceased legislator B. Satyanarayana. The byelection is different and the ruling party is going to exploit power. What brought you to the electoral arena, considering your age and the COVID-19 pandemic? People who grew in the JD(S) and migrated are now talking of the party “disappearing” after this election. That is why I have taken this election seriously. I am fighting despite my old age to protect the party. The party is certainly going to survive. I am not bothered what Congress leaders say. I will stay here and campaign till November 1. Do you think it was a mistake for the JD(S) to have allied with the Congress in 2018 to form the coalition government? Yes. I did not want H.D. Kumaraswamy to head the government and had instead suggested senior Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge’s name. We were forced by the Congress high command to head the secular government. Local leaders were not consulted. The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and the former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar were responsible for bringing down the government. That is the blunder I have committed. I have learnt a lesson. Your son and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in a recent interview said that your ‘secular weakness’ has been exploited by the Congress. Do you agree? Certainly. Some Congress local leaders have exploited my secular credentials throughout my political career. I have stood by secular politics and I did not compromise even when the NDA parties, including the BJP, offered to support me when I was stepping down as the Prime Minister. Even now, Congress leaders publicly state that there will be no JD(S) after this election. I am striving to revive the party that has been damaged for agreeing to form a secular coalition in Karnataka. But you were elected to the Rajya Sabha recently with the help of the Congress. Some local leaders have other plans. It was because of Mr. Kharge and K.C. Venugopal that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi decided to not field another candidate, paving the way for my entry to the Rajya Sabha. Problem is with local leaders. Why is the Congress aggressively attacking the JD(S) now? KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar attempted to destabilise the JD(S) in the past by persuading Mr. Siddaramaiah to go out of the party. The former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna and Mr. Shivakumar have attempted to destabilise the late N. Dharam Singh-led coalition government. Today, Congress leaders are doing the same thing to destabilise the party. How do you intend to bring secular forces together from now on? First, my age and health have to permit.I do not know what role I will play in the remaining time. This country should not suffer on account of fundamentalist forces. There should be protection to minorities, Dalits, and all other sections. This country belongs to all. Democracy is deep rooted and one-party rule cannot happen. I will make known by future plans after November 10. Will the JD(S) have any role in the current political speculation over change of guard in the BJP government? I have nothing to do with it. When B.S. Yeddyurappa took oath, we openly declared we are not going to destabilise his government. I do not want to offer any comment on the speculation.  People who grew in the JD(S) and migrated are now talking of the party ‘disappearing’ after this election. That is why I have taken this election seriously.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/some-local-congress-leaders-have-exploited-my-secular-credentials/article32934162.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bhagyalakshmi scheme changed attitude towards girl child: Report||The BJP government’s flagship Bhagyalakshmi scheme, a welfare measure linked to the conditional cash transfer in the name of the girl child, has changed the attitude towards the girl child among the poor sections of society and reduced gender disparity in school attendance, according to an evaluation report. Evaluation of the implementation of the scheme during 2010–11 and 2015–16 by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority with the support of Hyderabad–Karnataka Centre for Advanced Learning, Kalaburagi, found that “85.5% respondents believe there is a changed attitude towards the girl child in society” and that “they are no more considered as burden”. The scheme was launched in 2006–07 to improve the status of girl children by promoting education among below the poverty line (BPL) families. Registration of the birth of a girl child was 100% among the scheme beneficiaries with the intervention from anganwadi, ANM, and ASHA workers.  The report said 88% of children aged between six and 17 were attending school; there was “almost no gender disparity” in school attendance in the six to 14 age group. But there is a marginal difference in the 15 to 17 age group (73% of girls attending school as against 75% of boys). “Some portion of this success can be attributed to the scheme,” it said. Evaluation of the implementation of scheme in eight districts — Bengaluru Urban, Chitradurga, Dharwad, Vijayapura, Bidar, Raichur, Dakshina Kannada, and Chamarajanagar — found reduction in the visibility of child labour in commercial activities to a significant extent. District child rights cells, Labour Department, and child rights activists also contributed to this factor, it said. On the flip side Interestingly, the report noted, “With 18 years of age and minimum eighth standard education, the scheme looks somewhat marriage oriented.” Although the scheme has increased the value of the girl child marginally within the poor family, it has failed to curb female foeticide as it is prevalent across the class and caste categories, the report stated. “Among the minorities and certain tribal communities, there is reservation on religious lines on the issue of sterilisation,” it stated. The report recommended that scheme beneficiaries should be given priority under various skill development as well as self-employment schemes. “The very process of allocation of BPL status needs to be relooked as the presence of bogus beneficiaries are blocking the potential of genuine beneficiaries,” the report stated.   With 18 years of age and minimum eighth standard education, the scheme looks somewhat marriage oriented.

24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SEC can take decision on issue of holding polls to 5,800 GPs: HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday gave the liberty to the State Election Commission (SEC) to take a decision as per law on holding elections to around 5,800 gram panchayats (GPs) even though the court has reserved orders on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition which sought directions for holding the elections without further delay. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi made these observations in the order while reserving the verdict on the petition, filed by K.C. Kondaiah, a Congress MLC, and four others. Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told the Bench that there is a need to postpone elections to gram panchayats considering the increase in the number of COVID-19 positive cases and the SEC should take the government into confidence in view of the pandemic as the health of citizens is the priority at present. However, the SEC said it had a series of discussions with all the district administrations and the police on holding the elections, after the conclusion of the byelections to the State Assembly, in a phased manner by ensuring health safety of citizens and the public servants on election duty. During the hearing, the Bench said the elections can be held in districts where the number of COVID-19 cases is less while reminding the conduct of SSLC exams, when the A-G said it was difficult to enforce COVID-19 norms during election campaign at village levels. “We can control students but not politicians,” the A-G replied while showing a photograph of how COVID-19 norms were violated during election campaign in Bihar. The High Court, in June itself, prima facie had held that no power is vested with the SEC under the Constitution or the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act to postpone elections while asking the SEC to reconsider its May 28 decision to temporarily put off the polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sec-can-take-decision-on-issue-of-holding-polls-to-5800-gps-hc/article32934157.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State’s daily TPR falls below 5%||Karnataka on Friday reported 5,356 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of cases to 7,93,907. With this, the State’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) reduced to 4.94%, which is a good indication. However, the cumulative TPR stood at 11.07%. TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people found to be infected by the virus from among those being tested. While the cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is for those tested on a particular day. According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. The World Health Organisation recommends that the daily positivity rate should be below 5% for at least two weeks before public health measures are relaxed. Meanwhile, the State reported 51 new deaths, taking the toll to 10,821. This is apart from 19 deaths of COVID-19 patients due to other reasons. The State’s case fatality rate (CFR) touched 0.95% on Friday. As many as 8,749 persons were discharged on Friday, taking the total number of recoveries to 69,35,584. Of the 89,483 active cases, 936 patients were being monitored in the ICU. Bengaluru Urban reported 2,688 cases, taking its tally to 3,21,054, and 21deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/states-daily-tpr-falls-below-5/article32934170.ece

They will generate employment for 3,000 persons, he had said. Udupi Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu told The Hindu that the district administration wrote to the government about two weeks ago seeking allotment of land identified for setting up the park. If needed, the government will be requested to allot more land later once the park on 20 acres became operational. Assistant Director of the Department of Handlooms and Textiles, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, H. Shivashankar, said that once the government allots the land, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a legal entity created to fulfil a specific task, will have to be constituted to take the proposal forward. The SPV will create infrastructure such as road, water and power supply, dormitory, hostel, restaurant and related facilities in the park and allot the sites for investors. The department has the provision to provide incentives up to 40 % to investors while they set up their units in the park, he said. Referring to Udupi sari, which enjoys Geographical Indication (GI) tag, he said that not many youngsters are coming forward to weave this sari. Mamatha Rai, trustee of Karkala-based Kadike Trust, which has been working to revive and popularise the Udupi sari for long, said that the twin districts now have 65 persons who weave Udupi sari with 25 weavers being in The Talipady Primary Weavers Service Cooperative Society Ltd., Kinnigoli, in Dakshina Kannada. Ms. Rai said that the trust with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) provided four-month training, which got over on October 17, in weaving Udupi sari to 10 new weavers in the Talipady society. Following this training, the number of weavers in the Talipady society rose to 25. The trust which launched “Save Udupi sari” campaign two-and-half years ago, including on social media, has been helping weavers by providing training in weaving and natural dying, in product diversification, designing aspects and for marketing the sari. It has also helped in getting GI tag for the sari. “Two years ago there were no Udupi sari weavers below 55 years in the twin districts. The 10 new weavers who have joined the Talipady society are aged between 34 and 56,” she said and added that youngsters are joining the weaving profession in the two districts after about 25 years now. “This is a significant achievement that we have made in our revival journey,” Ms. Rai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/land-identified-for-textile-park-in-karkala/article32934818.ece
24 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||PU teachers not content with 30% cut in syllabus||While the Department of Pre-University Education has reduced syllabi for I and II PU courses by 30%, a section of teachers have demanded further reduction to 50%. In a circular issued on Wednesday, Snehal R., Director, Pre-University Education, said that the decision to reduce the syllabi was in continuation of the measure to provide recorded video lectures to students affected by the absence of physical classes. The circular stated that the reduction of syllabi of physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology is as per what the CBSE has done. The CBSE has reduced the syllabi by 30% for classes 1 to 12. The reduction of 30% for 33 subjects is as per the recommendation by members of Text Book Revision Committees. Carnatic music subject has been dropped as no student has taken it for the last two years, the circular said. Talking to The Hindu , Ms. Snehal said: “We are working on reducing practicals, which will be decided once the physical classes start.” Recorded video lectures and notes are being uploaded on YouTube regularly since July. Ruling out any further reduction, Ms. Snehal said the revised syllabi can be covered in the remaining part of 2020-21 academic year. Questioning the decision, Madhava Poojary, Principal of R.N. Shetty Pre-University College, Murudeshwar, said the department has revised the syllabi three months after CBSE’s decision. “It is difficult to complete the revised syllabi by January 2021. Either it should be further reduced to 50% or the academic year be extended till April, in order to give justice to students, more to those who have problem in accessing video lessons,” he said. He referred to Uttakoppa village in Bhatkal that has problem with network and 40 students of this village were disconnected from their lectures. “Physical classes are the only recourse for such students. This circular has created undue pressure on students, who have failed to get access to video lectures,” he added. M. Nagaraj, Secretary of the Bengaluru North Pre-University College Principals’ Association, said as the calendar of events for examination has not yet announced, he hoped the department would extend the academic year and have PU examinations in April.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pu-teachers-not-content-with-30-cut-in-syllabus/article32934653.ece
24 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Executive Committee set up to manage Panambur Beach||The Dakshina Kannada district administration has constituted an executive committee to manage the maintenance of Panambur Beach till new bids are finalised for managing the beach as the contract with Jyoti Advertisers has ended, after a protracted legal battle. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra in his order issued on Wednesdy has said that the Panambur Beach Maintenance Executive Committee would be headed by the Joint Commissioner of Mangaluru City Corporation with Tourism Department’s Assistant Director as its member-secretary. There would be nine members, including representatives from environment, forests, police, NMPT, revenue and the corporation, on the Committee. The committee, after taking over Panambur Beach as it was from Jyoti Advertisers, would post required number of life guards (at least eight) to ensure the safety of tourists on a temporary basis. Honorarium to the life guards have to be paid from funds generated through parking and shop licence fee, while the existing parking and shop licence fee may be continued till new bids are finalised. Financial dealings should be carried out in the name of the Deputy Commissioner and Chairman, District Tourism Development Committee, the order said. The committee was formed to continue tourism activities on Panambur Beach where thousands of tourists visit every day, Dr. Rajendra said. He said that the administration had entered into an agreement with Jyoti Advertisers on July 22, 2008, for managing the beach on public-private partnership and it came to an end on March 23, 2018. Legal proceedings initiated by the private partner came to be dismissed by respective courts. Issac Vas from Jyoti Advertisers had informed the Tourism Department on October 16 this year that the private partner would hand over the beach to the department and hence, the ad hoc arrangement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/executive-committee-set-up-to-manage-panambur-beach/article32934814.ece

24 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Soon, RT-PCR test results within 24 hours||A new testing facility is coming up in Mysuru city after Dasara wherein the results of swab test using the RT-PCR method would be available within 24 hours from the time of sample collection. This is expected to reduce complaints from patients over results taking a long time - sometimes even a week. A lab each at the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) and the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) were carrying out the PCR tests in Mysuru, both handling nearly 1,500 swabs a day. However, since Mysuru had ramped up tests to over 4,000-5,000 a day, the remaining swabs are sent to labs in Bengaluru for the tests and this was said to be the reason for time taken in getting results. The dispatch time from the two Bengaluru labs on the swabs was around 6 to 9 days, resulting in complaints from the patients. The issue was taken up with Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar recently. The MMCRI will soon be equipped with the new testing system wherein the results are available within 24 hours. And the system can handle as many as 4,000 swabs a day. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri in Mysuru on Friday said the government has told the districts to carry out mostly PCR tests and go for Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) only if the results were needed urgently. As the RATs does not discover infection in case of less viral load, 90% of the tests had been shifted to PCR method though the RATs’ results are available within 20 minutes. As of now, only 10% of RATs are being done in the district and maximum tests are being done using the PCR method, she said. Ms. Sindhuri, in a Facebook live session on Friday, said more beds are now available in government hospitals treating COVID-19 and there was no scarcity of beds with more beds equipped with oxygen supply being added. As many as 50 beds equipped with centralised oxygen supply were getting ready at the trauma care centre and 50 beds each with oxygen supply in all taluk headquarters were being readied. Patients from taluks can avail treatment from taluk hospitals, she said, and added that the private hospitals had been told to set aside 50% of beds. This was being enforced by teams constituted for this purpose, inspecting the hospitals on a daily basis. Nearly 24 private hospitals in Mysuru are treating COVID-19 patients and each of them is supposed to display the availability of beds at the reception counter, the DC said, and added that testing, availability of beds, oxygen supply-equipped beds and ventilators had been streamlined. All parameters are showing improvement in Mysuru with the case fatality rate (CFR) down from 2.1% to 1.5% since over 20 days and the number of tests too have gone up from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 a day. With regard to the death audit, Ms. Sindhuri said early tests and early treatment are the only remedy to control the toll and advised that the patients should not be under the impression that the infection was more serious in elderly persons and patients with co-morbidities and not among the youth. She also spoke about patients shifted to private hospitals from government hospitals and advised against such decisions since oxygen levels may drop while shifting, causing complications. Ms. Sindhuri said the new infections in Mysuru have come down but it is not yet COVID-19-free. There’s only a slight improvement in the situation. People should continue taking all precautions until Mysuru is rid of the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/soon-rt-pcr-test-results-within-24-hours/article32934833.ece

This year, the celebrations were scaled down owing to the pandemic. Flowers were showered on the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari seated on a chariot adorned with flowers to kickstart the festivities. Minister in-charge of Mandya district Narayana Gowda, Srirangapatna MLA Ravindra Srikantaiah, Deputy Commissioner M. Venkatesh and others were present during the inauguration. The procession with the idol was taken out from Kirangur Bannimantap to Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in the town. Usually, the idol placed in a replica of ‘ambari’ is carried on an elephant in the main streets of the town as part of the Dasara procession. The procession was a simple affair this time in view of precautions taken over the pandemic. Only a few cultural troupes were allowed to participate. After the procession, a cultural programme was organised at Sultan Battery in the town. Singers Raghu Dixit and Kannada music composer Guru Kiran performed. As the event was organised at the Battery, people from nearby areas watched from their balconies as the entire area was illuminated.

24 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vishwanath: Not right to include vaccine issue in manifesto||A.H. Vishwanath, BJP MLC, has taken exception to the BJP manifesto for the Bihar Assembly election promising free vaccination for COVID-19. Joining the chorus questioning the election promise, Mr. Vishwanath wondered whether the logical extension of the poll promise means people would be allowed to die if the party does not win. “If you don’t win, will you let the people die?” he wondered aloud while speaking to reporters here on Friday. He criticised the inclusion of the promise to give free vaccination in the BJP’s poll agenda. “No, this (issue of providing vaccination) should not enter the manifesto of any political party or become part of the party’s agenda in the elections,” said Mr. Vishwanath, who was among the 17 MLAs who quit the erstwhile JD(S)–Congress coalition and helped the BJP form the government in the State. Mr. Vishwanath was also critical of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami for making a similar promise of providing free vaccination to all the people of the State, which is expected to go to polls next year. Mr. Vishwanath also decried the language used by the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah against BJP leader Nalin Kumar Kateel. He sought to remind Mr. Siddaramaiah that he had enjoyed power by becoming the Chief Minister and was presently the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly. “Don’t behave like a court jester. Conduct yourself as a political statesman,” he advised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishwanath-not-right-to-include-vaccine-issue-in-manifesto/article32934163.ece

If overcharging was seen, steps would be taken so that the excess amount was returned to the patients, she added. Ms. Sindhuri, who has already directed all hospitals to set aside 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients, said the private hospitals cannot overprice treatment as the rates had been recommended by the government based on the category and severity of the infection. The rates range from Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 25,000 per day and this should not be exceeded at any cost, she said. “This (rate) is the maximum they can charge. If they charge more than these rates, they (hospitals) have to return the amount charged in excess,” she said, during her FB live session on COVID-19 situation in Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-hospitals-warned-against-overcharging-patients/article32934827.ece

State honorary president of the sangha Chamaras Malipatil, who led the farmers in a march, begged for alms and collected money from the public from the Teen Kandil area to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Raichur. He said that the Union government has become bankrupt and hence unable to attend to the grievances of the general public and farmers of the State, particularly those in the Kalyan Karnataka Region which had faced huge losses due to recent rain and floods. Several hundreds of property and standing crops in several thousands of agriculture land have been destroyed in a natural disaster. However, the Union government has not released sufficient relief funds to be distributed among the victims. “We have lost faith in the government in terms of compensation that has to be distributed to farmers and the public who have lost crops and property. Therefore, we decided to donate some money to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and collected Rs. 5,019 by begging for alms. This amount has been sent to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund through the Raichur Deputy Commissioner,” Mr. Malipatil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-collect-rs-5019-for-pms-national-relief-fund/article32934149.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Huge drop in demand for KSRTC buses this festive season||Last year, during the Dasara season, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operated more than 3,000 additional services that helped generate over Rs. 10 crore extra revenue. This year, with most people either staying at home or using personal vehicles to travel to their home-towns to minimise the risk of contracting COVID-19, there has been no demand. “Every year, during the Dasara season, on the last four days, people usually go to their native place in large numbers. However, this time, there is no such rush. Till Friday evening, there was no demand for additional buses. Online ticket booking for regular services is not very promising,” said a KSRTC official. As on Friday, there were 10,000 online bookings. Last year, online bookings alone touched 60,000. Even inter-State travel has failed to pick up. “Prior to the lockdown, we re operating more than 400 services to Tamil Nadu alone. These services are yet to resume. There used to be higher demand for Vijayawada, Hyderabad and other destinations during the festive season, especially for the premier segment of services. That is not the case now,” the official added. To improve occupancy, KSRTC decided not to levy an additional 10% charge for weekend bookings, but the incentive has done little to increase ticket sales. Traditional destinations like Mysuru, too, are not attracting people. Officials attribute this to the fact that Dasara in Mysuru is a low-key affair this year. During the festive season, KSRTC would operate an additional 200 services to Mysuru alone. Meanwhile, South Western Railways (SWR) recently announced that it will be operating 58 special trains to various destinations, and majority of them are from Bengaluru. An official of the SWR said, “The special train services will operate till November-end. Booking has started, but the travel demand and patterns can be analysed only after a few days.” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/huge-drop-in-demand-for-ksrtc-buses-this-festive-season/article32934646.ece

After launching operations of a transfer station on New BEL Road on Friday along with BBMP Administrator Gaurav Gupta, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad said five stations were ready. The formal inauguration will be scheduled after the bypolls. He said the stations would help maintain visual cleanliness, reduce black spots, avoid dripping of leachate, reduce manual handling of waste, and reduce trips to processing plants. “Auto-tippers can directly dump waste into the compactor, which compresses it (waste) to 50% of its capacity. Leachate is drained into a tank and later transported to the processing plant for safe disposal,” he said. Land is a major hurdle in setting up the remaining stations. The BBMP had sought land from the BDA. “The BDA has submitted a list of CA sites, which we are examining for suitability to set up similar facilities,” he said. Mr. Gupta and Mr. Prasad inspected the MSGP processing facility that receives 500 tonnes of mixed waste. Officials were told to ensure that segregated waste is sent to the facility, along with mixed waste, while ensuring that the facility is maintained properly as per SOP, and communities around are not inconvenienced. Compost generated here is bagged and sent to the Agriculture Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/50-transfer-stations-for-waste-management/article32934642.ece

Over 14 cases were booked. As per the new rule, first-time offenders will be made to submit an undertaking before the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioners of Police, along with a bond under Section 107 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). If they are caught again for the same offence, the police can slap a fine of Rs. 50,000 for using defective silencers and Rs. 2 lakh for performing bike stunts. “Performing stunts on bikes endangers life and is a criminal offence under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Indian Penal Code. We will intensify the drive in the coming days so that it will act as a deterrent,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, adding that if offenders do not pay the penalty, they are liable to undergo imprisonment between six months and one year. Residents and activists have welcomed the move, but many pointed out that the high fines would only promote corruption among police personnel. “There is a danger of this increasing corrupt practices and also clashes between the police and motorists,” said advocate and social activist Narasimhamurthy. Traffic expert M.N. Sreehari said that the enforcement agency should focus on a holistic approach rather than special drives. “Enforcement agencies should issue notices to the vehicle manufacturing companies to stop advertising bike stunts to promote their products,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-intensify-drive-against-bike-stunts/article32934638.ece

Inconclusive A meeting convened by the District Collector was inconclusive as only a meagre compensation was offered by the contractor, he said adding that the Collector, who visited the spot, had assured them that the works would not be allowed unless they were given proper compensation. Vinod Chandrasekharan, who lost 3.5 acres of cardamom, said the compensation offered by the contractor was Rs. 2 lakh per acre. “Not only the crop but also the land had been lost and how can one agree to such a package. If the price of beans and the cost of maintaining plants alone are taken into consideration, farmers could have suffered a loss of at least Rs. 15 lakh a year in terms of cardamom production,” he said adding that as the land itself was lost, they either needed proper compensation or alternative land for cultivation. Nearly 300 metres of road was washed away in the first landslip. There were reports that unscientific road widening works and blasting of rocks over a wide area could have triggered the landslips. It is estimated that nearly 20 landslips had occurred on the Gap Road stretch since the road widening works began in 2018. A report by the Devikulam Subcollector had cited unscientific roadworks for landslips on the stretch. Recommended An expert team which visited the landslip area had recommended that the works should be restarted only after ensuring safety measures, including construction of retaining walls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gap-road-works-hang-in-balance/article32934200.ece

24 October 2020||KANNUR,KERALA||Govt. striving to create jobs in khadi sector: Minister||E.P. Jayarajan, Industries Minister, on Friday said that the government aimed at creating more jobs in the khadi sector. He was speaking at the inauguration of the silk weaving unit at Pappinisseri and the laying of the foundation stone for the marketing complex. Wedding saris would be woven at the silk weaving unit. Sarees would also be made according to the customers’ orders utilising the 10 looms in the centre. The foundation stone for a marketing complex being set up at a cost of Rs. 50 crore was also laid on the occasion. Mr. Jayarajan said that the Kerala Khadi Village Industries Board was working hard to ensure job security for khadi workers in Kerala, make more productive the khadi movement, which was begun by Mahatma Gandhi as part of the national movement, and to play an important role in the overall growth of the country. For the past four and a half years, the khadi sector had been on a path of recovery. During the period, 26 khadi production centres were started and 3,384 jobs created. Steps were being taken to create 5,000 more jobs, the Minister said. He said that khadi products needed to be diversified. People were of the opinion that only the elderly and politicians wore khadi clothes. Hence, the need to diversify and increase production and marketing, he said. Measures were being taken to produce muslin in Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Thrissur and to reduce the workload of the workers by using sophisticated power looms. This would also lead to increased production. The government had sanctioned Rs. 125 crore for paying the minimum wage in the khadi sector and Rs. 23.3 crore for production incentive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-striving-to-create-jobs-in-khadi-sector-minister/article32934189.ece
24 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||PCB finds grave violation of SWM rules at Brahmapuram||The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has found violations of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, at the Brahmapuram dumping yard of the Kochi Corporation. The board’s findings have found place in the notice on environment compensation issued to the civic body on October 15 for unscientific handling of waste at the site. An inspection held by the board on July 23 found that the facilities for treatment and disposal of solid waste at the site were not maintained properly. The windrow composting shed is in a dilapidated condition, and mixed solid waste, including plastic, was found dumped in the open. The manure produced seems to be marginal compared to the quantity of waste collected daily at the plant. It did not meet the fertilizer standards as per the SWM Rules, 2016 and contained heavy metals, according to the report.  Legacy waste Huge quantities of rejects have been dumped at various places, resulting in the formation of legacy waste. Fire mishaps were reported in the legacy waste dumping yard three or four times in 2019 and this year, causing air pollution in and around the site. Leachate from the windrow composting shed and biodegradable solid waste were not collected and treated properly owing to improper drains, and there were chances of leachate reaching the nearby Kadambrayar river. Incidentally, the waterbody figured among the polluted river stretches identified by the Central Pollution Control Board. The leachate treatment plant set up prior to the visit by the Regional Monitoring Committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal in January last was found defunct. The inspection revealed lack of expected progress in the installation of the leachate treatment plant, except for the construction of a new collection tank having a capacity of 100m3. No effective steps were taken for the installation of the waste-to-energy plant and the removal of legacy waste. The corporation authorities have not been able to assess the quantum of legacy waste lying at the dumping site, said the inspection report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-finds-rampant-violation-of-rules-at-brahmapuram/article32934786.ece
24 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Testing strategy in district cuts both ways||The district administration’s decision to test symptomatic people alone will help diagnose COVID-19 infection in vulnerable people early on, but could leave several cases undetected. “With the surge now, the strategy is to identify and test symptomatic people as early as possible to contain the spread of infection and reduce mortality. When people with sore throat, cough, fever, diarrhoea, or breathing troubles report these symptoms, they are tested immediately. Peripheral health-care facilities are now focusing their resources on identifying and testing symptomatic people in their vicinity, rather than contacts of patients who might already be in quarantine,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Vulnerable primary contacts with co-morbidities will continue to be tested, he added. An official at the district surveillance unit, however, said a policy of not testing contacts of patients could mean that the source of infection goes undetected in a lot more cases. “We will miss asymptomatic positives who might venture out even if they are asked to remain in quarantine for 14 days. After a while, we might even start missing mildly symptomatic patients. Widespread testing among vulnerable populations, among contacts, and in areas where clusters might form, needs to continue, rather than just testing symptomatic people,” he said. But the disease is now headed towards an endemic stage, which means it is everywhere, said Dr. A. Sukumaran, former State epidemiologist. “For immediate containment early on, testing both asymptomatic and symptomatic people was important. Now, we can no longer prevent the spread, so minimising it is the practical approach. For that, testing only symptomatic people and preventing death is justified,” he said. People without symptoms dying suddenly is very rare, he pointed out. The flip side to focusing on symptomatic people who might develop severe complications is that the spread can still happen through asymptomatic individuals, said Dr. Rakhal Gaitonde, Professor, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. “Any strategy that does not test adequately among primary and secondary contacts or at least among primary contacts is likely to miss the way the virus spreads. If people who could potentially spread the disease are not identified, it could lead to new outbreaks. Testing among primary and secondary contacts is a minimum requirement to ensure we don’t have cases that are undiagnosed,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/testing-strategy-in-district-cuts-both-ways/article32934791.ece
24 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Tourism stakeholders upbeat about reopening||The famed heritage streets of Fort Kochi and the beach front, which used to teem with foreign and domestic tourists in the October-February tourist season, present a striking contrast now, with street dogs literally outnumbering the few local residents who venture out once in a while. Similar is the case with most other tourist locales in West Kochi, be it heritage areas in neighbouring Mattancherry or even Kumbalanghi, hailed as India’s first model tourism village. But stakeholders are hopeful that the situation will improve when the State government permits regulated entry into beach destinations from November 1. One among the founders of Clean Fort Kochi Foundation, David Lawrence, who also owns a homestay in the heritage zone, said residents and tourism stakeholders were dismayed at streets remaining deserted despite the onset of the tourist season. “Of course, entry to the beach has been temporarily curbed, with Section 144 in vogue to prevent crowding. This has been the situation in the high-in-demand locale since mid-March when the lockdown was announced. The government must urgently repair the beach walkway which is in ruins due to sea erosion,” he added. The silver lining is that Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) is relaying roads and building drains in an effective manner, despite opposition from a few quarters, including encroachers. Subsequently, streets do not get flooded, and rain water does not enter low-lying buildings. Tourists can be assured of good roads and pavements this time, Mr. Lawrence said. Kumbalanghi, located on the other end of West Kochi, has its own share of problems, including a spike in COVID-19 cases. “This could be because physical distancing is seldom maintained, especially in tea shops and public transport. However, life is going on as usual in the area, but for almost nil inflow of tourists,” said M.P. Sivadattan, director of Kerala Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society. Sometimes, guests visit homestays and other properties in the village to unwind and enjoy ethnic dishes. Most operators of homestays, which have elderly people or kids, are not entertaining guests. On their part, the Kerala Tourism and the Responsible Tourism Mission are proactively doing their part, hosting webinars and numerous other activities to woo tourists interested in experiential tourism that Kumbalanghi is famous for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-stakeholders-upbeat-about-reopening/article32934782.ece
24 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||NIA failed to prove terror link: court||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), after 100 days of investigation, could not bring up evidences in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case to show that the accused had any links with any terrorist forces, observed the NIA Special Court, Kochi, on Friday. Releasing two accused Hamzath Abdussalam and T.M. Samju on bail, NIA Special Judge P. Krishnakumar said there was nothing in the case diary to prove that the money spent by the accused in the case came from any terror outfits or they received the gold for transmitting it to any such dark forces. The court had earlier granted bail for 10 other accused in the case. Perusing the case diary, the judge noted that the NIA could only establish that the petitioners funded the front-line accused for smuggling gold using the diplomatic channel and they conspired with the others for the purpose. However, there were sufficient materials to show that the duo had conspired with some of the accused persons to smuggle gold to India, the judge noted. The court said that though the petitioners acted with an intention to damage the economic security of the country, there was no material in the case diary to prima facie satisfy that they did it with such an intention. The offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)stand only if they directly or indirectly raise funds from or provide it to any person knowingly that such funds were likely to be used by a terrorist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nia-failed-to-prove-terror-link-court/article32934240.ece

While the Act was passed in 2018, the registration of health-care facilities began in 2019. Sub committees established under the Act had submitted reports on the draft regulations that would govern the functioning of the establishments. “Apart from what was initially laid down by the Act, several other regulations have now been suggested by the sub committees. The minimum space requirement for the smallest lab under the regulations is 500 square feet. But expansion is not feasible for most labs. Besides, some labs are staffed just by one person. Now, according to these regulations at least one person who has studied under the Directorate of Medical Education would have to be employed at the lab. New instruments, including hematology analyzers and binocular microscopes are to be set up even in the smaller basic labs. Despite these instruments, only basic tests for sugar, creatinine, cholesterol, and urea can be done at the basic labs as per the regulations,” said Bejoy V.

24 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Automated monitoring||The Haritha Keralam Mission (HKM) is considering setting up automated waste management system in select local bodies in Ernakulam to step up efficiency of waste collection and management. The move forms part of the government’s efforts to streamline and improve waste management services. Two proposals on intelligent and automated waste management systems are on the anvil. The first digital system is being developed with technical support from the Integrated Rural Technology Centre in Palakkad. Senior officials of the Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) said the software would help in tracking waste collection by Haritha Karma Sena volunteers from each home. Waste generators can pay their user fee through the digital mode. “We will have to carry out an audit of homes in select civic bodies ahead of launching the initiative. Relevant data for running the system will be integrated with the digital platform. Each house will be provided with a QR code. Members of each household can attach the QR code at the entrance to the house,” they said. Green volunteers engaged in waste collection will scan the QR code using mobile phones. Data on the quantity of waste collected and the user fee remitted by users will be uploaded to the centralised system. The project will be introduced in a few local bodies in the first phase to gauge the technical hurdles. The authorities also plan to seek the support of establishments in select local bodies for the execution of the venture. They will be encouraged to spare a share of their corporate social responsibility funds for the project. For the second project, the software for the smart garbage monitoring system has been developed by Keltron. Besides keeping track of the collection process, the mobile app will help users raise complaints, if any, about shortcomings in waste collection from households.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/soon-smart-checks-on-waste-handling-in-ernakulam/article32934184.ece

An Assembly committee that studied the environmental issues of Munroe Thuruthu had recommended a specific master plan for the area. The draft was completed with the approval of the District Planning Committee while the Department of Town and Country Planning provided the technical support. Survey conducted The plan was prepared after conducting a land utilisation survey and socio-economic survey that covered all families residing in the panchayat. The panchayat plans to take a big leap forward with the completion of various bridges connecting the island to the mainland. The Perumon-Pezhumthuruth bridge, Kannangattu bridge, Munroe Thuruthu-Thevalakkara bridge, Arinallur bridge, Pattamthuruthu East- Kidapram South bridge and a number of roads are expected to give a major boost to tourism in the island. Along with ensuring all amenities for tourists, steps will be taken not to disturb the fragile ecology of the island. While the master plan focusses on rural tourism, chances of lightweight construction will be explored to protect vulnerable areas. Due to the specific topography of the island, people residing in 50% of land area will have to be shifted to 28% of land in near future as per Coastal Regulation Zone rules. Some areas in the island are facing the threat of submergence, making it impossible to construct anything in a huge portion of the island. “So the master plan recommends some changes in the norms so that the residents can go for some eco-friendly methods of construction. Another recommendation is constructing houses and more infrastructure facilities to accommodate more families and tourists. Suggestions to opt for land pooling and joint townships are also there,” says Binu Karunakaran, panchayat president. The panchayat also plans to promote agriculture, fish farming, livestock farming, and traditional industries to expedite overall development of the island.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/master-plan-for-munroe-thuruthu/article32934208.ece

Most of the farmers now depend on the service of private doctors to administer the vaccine, which costs Rs. 400 a shot. Farmers from Velam panchayat, which reported the highest number of cases, said the veterinary doctors in their area were working as sectoral magistrates as part of the additional COVID-19 duty. The government should at least consider the deployment of additional veterinary doctors or should relieve the veterinary doctors from COVID-19 duty to meet the crisis, they said. Following the farmers’ complaints, the Velam grama panchayat authorities visited some of the affected areas and discussed possible solutions with higher authorities. They said a veterinary doctor from Kunnummal block panchayat was brought to the spot to administer the first shot of the vaccine in 40 affected goats. Additional vaccines would be required to administer the second and third shots to those animals, they said. “The viral infection has been reported from different locations in Kerala. What we want now is the required quantity of vaccines for saving the affected animals. There should be enough doctors to handle this vaccination process,” said Velam grama panchayat president V.K. Abdulla. He said farmers would not be able to afford the services of private doctors and private medicine suppliers. He said the skin disease was found causing serious disfigurement in goats with scabs around the lips, muzzle and mouth. Officials from the Animal Husbandry Department said the spread of the disease had been confirmed from different parts of Kerala and effective treatment was available for saving the animals. “It reportedly spread through the infected livestock brought here from other States.

The portable devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities will work with the support of 14 special control rooms. The Kerala Road Safety Authority will fund the project. It is also a part of the ongoing Safe Kerala campaign of the State government to mitigate road accident deaths. The plan of the MVD is to gradually end manual enforcement activities and explore the use of AI-based tools. The MVD had previously introduced e-challans through point-of-sale (POS) machines to collect fines from traffic rule violators. It has been a convenient option for many to use debit or credit cards for spot fine payment. For the MVD, it has come as an effective tool to ensure transparency in transactions and faster enforcement. The device also has options to take photographs of violators or vehicles and prepare online check reports. Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath said the proposed addition to digital platforms would streamline enforcement activities with cent percent accuracy and help reduce manpower to a large extent. The ANPR cameras could be placed anywhere to ensure flawless action against erring drivers, he added. “The Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) will be handling the project implementation and its supervision.

The development comes a day after the Town Planning Department team, during an inspection of the house, found that the total space of construction was 5,500 sq.ft although permission had been granted to construct a house of 3,200 sq. ft. The house in Vengeri revenue village is under the possession of Asha, Mr. Shaji’s wife, and permission for its construction was granted in 2013. Taxes not paid The officials found that the owner had not secured occupancy certificate from the civic authorities. No taxes had been paid as the house had not been allotted a number. However, a temporary electricity connection had been acquired at the time of construction of the house. The Town Planning Department carried out the inspection based on a directive from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing a bribery case related to the sanctioning of Plus Two courses for an aided school at Azhikode in Kannur district in 2014. The case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was that Plus Two courses were sanctioned to the school after collecting a bribe of Rs. 25 lakh from the management. A notice has been served on Mr. Shaji to be present for questioning next month. A report on the inspection would be submitted to the ED on Tuesday. Officials said that in cases of unauthorised construction without serious violations, the owner would usually be asked to pay a penalty, remit pending taxes and the house regularised. Only in rare cases, prosecution is initiated and demolition carried out. ‘To look into lapses’ Meanwhile, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said the Corporation would look into lapses if any on the part of Revenue inspectors and tax collectors. Mr. Shaji, however, has dismissed the matter as frivolous and termed the episode politically motivated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-construction-kozhikode-corpn-serves-notice-on-mla/article32934197.ece
24 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M) to press for JD(S), LJD merger||To prevent the possible wrangling over seat allocation among its allies in the Assembly polls next year , the CPI(M) has pushed for a speedy merger of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Janata Dal (Secular). As a follow-up to the earlier talks which remained deadlocked, it is learnt that a nine-member committee of senior leaders of the two parties will meet in Kochi on Sunday. Incidentally, the meeting comes ahead of the three-tier local bodies polls in December. A senior party functionary says the merger of these two parties, which are part of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), is necessary for the smooth allocation of seats after the inclusion of the faction led by Jose K. Mani of the Kerala Congress (M) in the CPI(M)-led coalition. Single entity As such, it was easy to allocate seats to a single entity rather than sharing seats to two parties. In the 2016 Assembly polls, the LJD, which was then JD(U), had contested seven seats on the Congress-led United Democratic Front platform and drawn a blank, while the JD(S), which was in the LDF, contested five and won three segments. Both parties secured 1.5% each of the total votes. However, in the 2011 Assembly polls, the LJD, then Socialist Janata (Democratic), had contested six seats and won two, while the JD(S) won four seats out of the five the party contested. The SJD and JD(S) had secured 1.65% and 1.5% respectively of the popular votes then. Within LJD Sources say a section of the LJD led by its State president M. V. Shreyams Kumar, favours a merger with the JD(S), while another group is fiercely opposing the proposal, which, it feels, will disturb the party in the long run as the JD(S) in Karnataka may have a possibility of aligning with the BJP. The merger of the LJD and the JD(S) gained traction after the entry of the former into the ruling LDF before the Lok Sabha polls. Result of discussions Three rounds of discussions within a span of one-and-a-half years had yielded no positive results though.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-to-press-for-jds-ljd-merger/article32934222.ece

The parents will stage a week-long dharna in front of their house at Attappallam, Walayar, from October 25 demanding a re-investigation into the deaths of their children. It was on October 25 last year that POCSO judge S. Muraleekrishna set free all the accused in the alleged rape-and-murder case of the girls. The failure of the prosecution in getting conviction for the accused had evoked outrage across the country. It was on October 31 last year that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan met the girls’ parents in his office and assured them that the accused would be brought to book. The parents said here on Friday that the Chief Minister did nothing to mete out justice to their daughter. The dharna demanding a reinvestigation by the High Court will be from October 25 to October 31, and will be termed as a protest from the “day of verdict to the day of betrayal”. ‘Govt. betrayal’ Rights activists led by C.R. Neelakandan and Vilayodi Venugopal will join the parents in the week-long dharna. Mr. Neelakandan said here that the betrayal of the government had become evident from the recent promotions given to the two police officers who reportedly scuttled the investigation.  ‘Invoke charges’ Mr. Neelakandan demanded that charges under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act be slapped against the police officers and the government prosecutor who helped the accused walk out scot-free. Activists Vilayodi Venugopal, Arumughan Pathichira, Anita Shinu, and V.M.

24 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Council fails to clear IDO amendments||A meeting of the city Corporation council on Friday failed to clear the long delayed amendments to the Interim Development Order (IDO), which governs the awarding of building permits and all kinds of land use in the city in the absence of a sanctioned master plan, as the Opposition councillors demanded more clarity on the same. Mayor K. Sreekumar set aside the agenda after a lengthy discussion. Now it is expected to be taken up in the last remaining council meeting before the local body elections. The proposed amendments are beneficial to those who had trouble getting building permits as their land was wrongly marked as paddy field or meant for public use. Councillors of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) initially questioned the ruling front for the delay in issuing a draft master plan. On master plan Town Planning Committee Chairman Palayam Rajan said that the civic body had organised consultations in all wards and with people from various sectors, to consider their concerns and to avoid the protests the previous draft master plan had to face. The COVID-19 pandemic had affected some of these processes. The draft master plan can now be tabled only in the next council’s tenure as further consultations are needed, he said. An agenda regarding the expenses incurred for the Aksharasree project of the Kerala State Literacy Mission also led to a heated debate in the council, with BJP councillors raising doubts about spendings under the mission. The LDF councillors hit back accusing the BJP of not valuing the important work done by the mission at the grassroot level in improving literacy levels. Education Standing Committee Chairman C. Sudharshanan read out the detailed expenses under each head, including the expenses on the co-ordinators and instructors for each ward. The agenda was later passed. Contract workers The city Corporation also recommended to the State government to give contingent worker status to contract workers who have been working on daily wages for the local body for years. Those who have been working with the civic body for more than one or two decades are being considered for the status. The BJP had raised objections, but the UDF supported the agenda due to humanitarian considerations. Mayor’s compliment At the end of an uncharacteristically peaceful council meeting, when all the agenda items were taken up ahead of the cut-off time, the Mayor complimented the Opposition for their co-operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/council-fails-to-clear-ido-amendments/article32934911.ece

After prices surged to as much as Rs. 120 per kg, the State government had placed orders for 75 tonnes to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India via Horticorp. But given the situation in the market, this had been enhanced to 200 tonnes, Horticorp Managing Director J. Sajeev said. The sudden spike in prices was triggered by shortage caused by rain-induced crop damage in north Indian States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-govt-places-orders-for-200-tonnes-of-onion/article32934233.ece

The State-run facility has been nurturing elephants of various age groups, ranging from the one-year-old Sreekutty, rescued from the Ambanad estate in Kollam last year, to the 78-year old ‘retired’ elephant Soman, the oldest captive elephant in the State. The centre has remained closed since March when the COVID-19-induced lockdown had come into effect. The authorities stepped up surveillance after news emerged of several animals testing positive for the infection in the Bronx Zoo in New York. Only 5-member groups According to Agasthyavanam Biological Park deputy warden N.V. Satheesan, entry will be permitted from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for all people except children aged below 10 years. Groups should not exceed five persons. Trek allowed Visitors would not be permitted to touch the elephants.

While bamboo rafting would remain suspended, visitors could go on the 3-km trek to Kizhakkumalappara, the official said. The reopening will bring much succour to the members of the eco-development committee (EDC) who guide visitors through the premises and man the canteen. The 24 employees will work in shifts as batches of 12 for 15 days a month. They were being paid wages for 10 days during the lockdown period when they could not report for work.

The State’s experience is that the infection can turn severe in children and the aged if they contract the disease. This being the situation, the public should heed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s request that Vidyarambham rites should be performed at home, the Minister said here on Friday. Persons who initiate children into the world of letters at Vidyarambham should wash their hands before and after every child performs the ritual. If gold is used to write on the child’s tongue, it should be disinfected first. Persons who display disease symptoms should not attend the ceremony. Ceremonies connected to Navaratri and Vidyarambham should be confined to small clusters consisting of two or three families. No such ceremonies should be carried out outside houses in containment zones. People above 65, pregnant women, and children below 10 should remain indoors. COVID-19 protocols such as use of masks and sanitisers and maintaining physical distance should be observed during the ceremonies, the Minister said. All parts of the State are under COVID-19 threat, she added.

A 60-year-old commuter died and hundreds were left stranded for over five hours in the capital when they went on a flash strike demanding release of three employees taken into custody by the police. The SHRC chairperson has ordered the Transport Principal Secretary to conduct an inquiry and take necessary action. The commission observed that had the top officials intervened at the right time the traffic snarls and the resultant loss of life could have been avoided. The District Labour Officer also should take action against those responsible for calling a strike without any notice, in violation of the Industries Disputes Act. The SHRC order says that it is a failure on the part of the Transport Department and the police that they were not able to solve a long-standing dispute between the KSRTC and the private buses, which do not stick to a proper time schedule. The KSRTC CMD informed the commission that action would be taken against 30 employees who were involved in the flash strike. The KSRTC also maintained that had the Assistant Transport Commissioner intervened with some restraint the corporation would not have suffered such a loss of face.

The floods had severely impacted riparian vegetation across Kerala, leading to large-scale destruction of many local flora found along the river banks. Now, with the help of local panchayats, the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB) is attempting to set a model for the State by restoring the biodiversity on the banks of the Pampa in Pathanamthitta district. Inauguration on Oct. 27 Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the green initiative, a component of the Rebuild Kerala Initiative, on October 27. Ninety-four riverine species, including threatened ones, will be restored along the banks of the river as part of the programme. An attempt to identify the species that were lost was made in consultation with the local panchayats. The species are also ones which offer natural protection to river banks, KSBB officials said. The project will cover 92.95 km of river banks in all and ten grama panchayats under three blocks in Pathanamthitta district. The following panchayats under Elanthoor, Koippuram, and Ranni blocks — which appeared to be the worst-hit in terms of biodiversity degradation — will be covered: Cherukole, Kozhancherry, Ayiroor, Ranni, Ranni-Pazhavangadi, Ranni-Angadi, Ranni-Perunad, Vadasserikkara, Vechoochira and Narannamoozhi. The plants and trees will be grown in nurseries and planted on the banks of the Pampa, which was one of the rivers which faced severe biodiversity destruction in the floods. “'The project is being undertaken in collaboration with the panchayats. The idea is to create a model which can be followed elsewhere in the State,” a KSBB official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bid-to-restore-biodiversity-along-the-pampa-river/article32934241.ece

Lokesh. Addressing the media at Gooty in the district on Friday, after visiting the fields where farmers had lost standing crops due to heavy rains, Mr. Lokesh said the plan to fix smart meters to the farm connections would sound the death knell for the YSRC government, and warned the State against going ahead with its plan. Flaying the government for releasing a paltry Rs. 39 crore towards providing relief to the farmers, he said the amount was insufficient even for one mandal. “Groundnut farmers, who cultivated the crop in 10 lakh acres, alone will require Rs. 2,000 crore,” Mr. Lokesh observed. Accusing the government of reacting only after the Opposition pointed to the loopholes in the system, or shoddy implementation of projects, Mr Lokesh said, “In the last 15 months, not a single farmer received input subsidy, drip irrigation tools, interest-free loan, or crop insurance. No Minister or MLA is available for review of the situation.” “Andhra Pradesh is in an absolute state of paralysis,” Mr. Lokesh said. Referring to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s claim of being a ‘Rayalaseema bidda’, Mr. Lokesh wondered where he had gone when the Rayalaseema farmers were in distress. Over 750 farmers had taken the extreme step in the last 15 months, he said, and advised the Chief Minister to undertake a ‘padayatra’ again to take stock of the situation under his rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farm-meters-will-sound-the-death-knell-for-ysrcp-govt/article32934853.ece
24 October 2020||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Onion price brings tears to people||Yet again the price of onions hit the roof bringing tears to consumers in city. Consumers thronged special counters at rythu bazaars to buy the ‘bulb’ being sold on subsidy. The onion price, which was barely Rs. 30 a kg in the open market not long ago, has now hit a century. The yawning gap in the demand and supply is said to be the reason for the steep rise. The solace for consumers, to some extent, is the opening of special counters at rythu bazaars in the city to provide 1 kg of onions to each customer at a subsidised price of Rs. 40 from Friday. The price at the regular counters at rythu bazaars, which was Rs. 77 a kg a few days ago, was also reduced to Rs. 74 a kg. Short supply “The wholesale market at Gnanapuram in the city is getting only around 100 tonnes of onions a day as against the demand of 250 to 300 tonnes a day,” says A. Kurma Rao, vice president of the Wholesale Vegetable Dealers Association. “We have placed an indent to procure 40 tonnes of onions from Maharashtra through National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (NAFED). Buffer stocks are available in Maharashtra, and there is no cause for worry,” Joint Director (Marketing) K. Srinivasa Rao said. “We have received 20 tonnes of onions. Each consumer is being given one kg of onion at a subsidised price of Rs. 40. At present we have not received any instructions from the government regarding supply on Aadhaar or ration card but when we receive them, we will implement it,” Assistant Director (Marketing) M.

24 October 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco auctions end on a low||FCV tobacco auctions in 2020 have ended on a dull note with only 128.65 million kg out of the fixed crop size of 136 million kg marketed at an average price of Rs. 123.95 per kg, which is higher than the previous year’s price by just Rs. 2.42. The year began on a bleak note for the farmers with untimely rains. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in March resulted in a prolonged lockdown and suspension of auctions. Double whammy With major players shying away from the auctions citing low quality in the SLS and SBS platforms, the State government was forced to press the AP Markfed as a buyer and started purchasing the FCV tobacco from July. The Markfed’s role was limited as it purchased just 12.93 million kg at an average price of Rs. 81 per kg. It was a double whammy for the farmers this year as the Tobacco Board decided to further trim the crop size. The board’s role too appeared to be waning as the average prices hit an all-time low, forcing the State government to intervene. The board said it had taken 175 days to complete the auctions. In the latter half of the year, auctions were held in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol. Tobacco Board Executive Director R. Muthuraj congratulated the stakeholders who cooperated in the successful completion of auctions. “Untimely rains during the harvesting stage caused damage to the standing crop, which resulted in poor grade out-turn and higher proportion of low-grade varieties. The impact was higher in the Southern Black Soil and Southern Light Soil regions. In the SLS and SBS regions, the production of low-grade tobacco was high,” he said. Auctions for sale of 2019-20 FCV tobacco had commenced from February in a phased manner. After sale of 4.47 million kg, auctions were temporarily suspended from March 22, 2020. Auctions, however, resumed on April 27 at five platforms followed by all the other 18 platforms by May. After resumption of auctions in Andhra Pradesh in the last week of April, though the bright grade fetched better prices, there was a price drop for medium grade in the SBS and SLS regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dull-end-to-tobacco-auctions/article32934774.ece

They should also withdraw cases against 18 farmers who were booked for staging a peaceful protest on October 16,” a protester said. Though the police imposed Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in the town, the farmers from Korutla, Ibrahimpatnam, Raikal, and Metpally managed to reach the Collectorate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/maize-farmers-stage-protest/article32934899.ece

According to officials in the Chief Minister’s Office, directions have been issued to ensure that at least one-lakh families get the assistance every day so that they could get some relief before the Dasara festival. “If the poor get the assistance before the festival, it will be good for them,” the Chief Minister said and asked the officials to carry out the exercise actively.

24 October 2020||hyderabad,TELANGANA||KCR wants change made in dearness allowance structure||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao favoured changes in the manner in which dearness allowance to employees was being calculated and paid and directed the officials concerned to prepare proposals in this regard. He directed the Finance department to take steps to release one instalment of dearness allowance due from July 1, 2019. The Chief Minister said that as of now, the Central government had been taking a decision on the quantum of DA and the States were following the Centre’s guidelines. There was, however, lot of delay in the preparation of the estimates by the Centre and in taking a final decision. He cited that three instalments of DA were pending releases and the Centre was yet to take a final decision in respect of two instalments. The States were left with no option but to delay announcement of DA because of the delay in announcement by the Centre and this was in turn leading to accumulation of dues. “The situation should change,” Mr. Rao asserted, adding percentage of DA to be paid in the States should be finalized. Changes could be made if need be after getting the Centre’s estimates. For instance, the State decided to pay 3% of DA, but the Centre would later fix it at 3.5%, the balance 0.5% should be paid to the employees. The same process could be adopted in the event of Centre deciding on smaller amount of DA and the additional amount paid over and above that decided by the Centre could be deducted. Interacting with the representatives of employees’ unions who called on him on Friday the Chief Minister directed the officials concerned to declare October 26, the day after Dasara, a holiday. Steps should be taken to declare the day after Dasara as a holiday forthwith. The employees’ representatives called on the Chief Minister to convey their decision to donate one-day salary to support the relief measures taken up by the government for the victims of rain/flood. Accordingly, they handed over consent letter to donate Rs. 33 crore to the government. The Chief Minister assured them that he would hold discussions with the employees’ unions shortly on the issues they were facing and resolve them once and for all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-wants-change-made-in-dearness-allowance-structure/article32934771.ece
24 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||GHMC reduces Hakimpet Kunta into dumping yard||As city was battling rains and floods in other parts of the city over the fortnight, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation turned the Hakimpet Kunta between Filmnagar and Shaikpet into a dumping site for waste. “We are dumping only temporarily. We will move it to the processing site later,” said an assistant engineer of GHMC when asked about the dumping activity. While the dumping activity was ongoing, water was flowing out from the other side of the lake forcing residents of Sabza Colony and other areas to build their own temporary embankments to keep the water out. It was the continuous water mixed with sewage from this lake that added to the flood agony of residents of Toli Chowki. Waste, flood debris, sand and waste that had accumulated in Toli Chowki area was brought in vehicles with unmarked/masked numbers and dumped at the site. “We are just following orders. We cannot do anything,” said a vehicle driver who brought the debris from Galaxy Cinema in Toli Chowki, when asked about the dumping into the lake. The walled railing on the south-eastern side of the lake has been torn down to facilitate dumping. The area is still known as Shaikpet Nala and was part of the lake and channel network to prevent flooding in the area. “The reduction in carrying capacity of these lakes by dumping is one of the main reasons for frequent flooding in that area,” says Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes. The shrinkage of the lake is also being blamed for the flooding in Nadeem Colony. “The waters are not receding in our area as the water from all the upstream lakes are still flowing here. If the Hakimpet Kunta was not shrunk, the flood would not have lasted so long,” said Dastgir, a resident of Nadeem Colony. Hakimpet Kunta (id number 3903) is among the lakes identified for conservation by Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority in 2014. But despite the official action, which included notification of Full Tank Level boundaries and revenue survey numbers, nothing seems to have changed on the ground for protection of the lake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-reduces-hakimpet-kunta-into-dumping-yard/article32934748.ece
24 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Durga puja loses sheen this year||Friday marked the Saptami of the nine-day Durga Puja. But the sound of dhaak (drum), the smell of bhog (food), the fragrance of dhuno (frankincense) were just a memory for countless families during the festival this year in Hyderabad. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced festival organisers to tone down the celebrations and adopt online streaming option to keep the faithful in good humour.  At the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity puja tent near Indira Park, the sign on the road is direct: Entrance for members only. “This is a break in tradition after 55 years for us,” says Subrata Ganguly of Bangiye Sanskritik Sangha at the low-key celebration at Mahbub College in Secunderabad area. “We used to get 8,000 people per day, and for cultural events the numbers topped 15,000, but now we are allowing only 50 members with social distancing as per police guidelines. But hundreds of people are logging in to see the live-streamed programmes of pujo,” said Mr. Ganguly. Going online Organisers have tried to shift the drama online, with an important caveat: Dear Devotees, keeping in mind the COVID-19 guidelines this year, there shall be no distribution of prasad or bhog. Entry restricted and limited puja organisers only. “Online puja makes no sense to me at all. It has taken away the fun of meeting and catching up with old friends, outing with family, all the gastronomic indulgence, all day long, closed kitchen at home, community lunch, partying with friends till late, the whole celebratory ambience with the sound of dhaak , conch, not to mention the smell of incense, ghee, dhup , etc. All that has gone,” says Chandana Chakrabarti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/durga-puja-loses-sheen-this-year/article32934750.ece

Taraka Rama Rao has said that six years after self-certification policy (TS-iPASS) for industry was launched, Telangana has successfully attracted investments worth 28 billion US dollars and 23% of this has come from the existing investors. “In Telangana, we don't just help companies invest in the State, but also hand-hold the industries coming here as they set up their operations,” Mr. Taraka Rama Rao said while he was participating in a session on 'States-Invested in India' hosted by the Public Affairs Forum of India's 7th National Forum 2020. ‘Advocates for investors’ “We act as advocates for our investors and take their policy inputs.

24 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Purchase all crops at MSP, Uttam tells Chief Minister||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has demanded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensure that the government buys all the crops at Minimum Support Price since farmers cultivated them as advised and forced by the government. He said apart from maize, farmers were advised to grow superfine varieties of paddy. They made extra investments but got less than half of yield compared to the regular variety of rice. While the thicker varieties of paddy were yielding 30 quintals per acre the finer varieties were yielding 20 quintals, he argued. “Farmers are suffering losses of Rs. 10,000 per acre due to finer varieties and government should purchase the finer varieties at Rs. 2,500 per quintal,” he demanded. The TPCC chief also claimed that KCR was trying to under-report the losses suffered by the farmers during the recent rains and floods. Though the government has pegged the crop loss in about 13 lakh acres the farmers’ organisations have estimated at over 20 lakh acres costing Rs. 5,000 crore. So far the no process has been put in motion to enumerate the losses. During Congress regime government used to provide some immediate interim relief from its own funds and remaining compensation used to come from the Central government after enumeration. However, he said that the farmers never got any relief in cases of natural calamities from the State government since 2014. He said cotton farmers were the worst hit as nearly 20 lakh acres of cotton crop was damdaed due to floods. Since farmers followed the government's advice in sowing cotton and paddy under the Regulated Cropping system it was the responsibility of the government to compensate for the losses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/purchase-all-crops-at-msp-uttam-tells-kcr/article32934768.ece

24 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Put GHMC financial aid details on website: Cong.||Congress has asked the Telangana government to be transparent in distributing financial aid to people affected by the flood and put the details of beneficiaries on the website. In a statement, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy asked the government to give figures of beneficiaries who have received Rs. 10,000 and put them in public domain. Though the government announced a relief package of Rs. 550 crore, he was doubtful about the proper distribution of it. While the number of affected people was in lakhs, the number of beneficiaries was just in hundreds so far. About 1,500 colonies were affected by the city floods but the TRS leaders are visiting only a few places for relief disbursal. He alleged that even relief is being used for photo opportunities. He wanted to know why the government was distributing cash instead of cheques, which would ensure that money would go to the right people. He criticised that many times in the past, whenever people faced natural calamities, funds given were used for publicity of the ruling party. The TPCC treasurer demanded that the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation should open a website, “October Floods and Relief Works”, and should put all the details of financial aid in it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/put-ghmc-financial-aid-details-on-website-cong/article32934758.ece

24 October 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||COVID acts as spoiler to Bathukamma festivities||The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the recent spell of unseasonal rains played a spoilsport for flower growers mainly the marigold farmers with sharp slump in demand for flowers in the prime floral festival Bathukamma season. Marigold farmers in Rahgunadhapalem, Konijerla, Bonakal and a few other mandals bore the brunt of the recent bout of untimely rainfall. The unseasonal rains hit the farmers in the crucial harvesting season, dashing their hopes of good returns in the Bathukamma and Sarannavaratri festival season. The low yield of flower produce due to reasons like rain devastation and the decline in the overall area under marigold cultivation in the district this year has led to a sharp rise in the price of marigold in the market. But there are a very few takers for the flowers, the cost of which almost tripled from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg last year to anywhere between Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 per kg this year. In the absence of a flower market, a long-felt demand of flower growers in the district, some greedy middlemen are minting money by exploiting the upsurge in prices of marigold, depriving the farmers of remunerative price, sources said. We have cultivated marigold against all odds by incurring high production cost during the coronavirus lockdown a few months ago, recalled Premalatha, a marigold grower of Raghunadhapalem. "The recent bout of untimely rains caused extensive damage to the flower plants," she rued, deploring that they were left in dire straits in the midst of the floral festival season. The sowing and transplanting operations were impacted by the coronavirus induced crisis in July and August that resulted in marked decline in the area of marigold cultivation in the district this year, says Horticulture Officer, Khammam, G Sandeep Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-acts-as-spoiler-to-bathukamma-festivities/article32934895.ece
24 October 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||4 farmers ‘demand’ rytu bazar from cell tower||Four farmers climbed a cell phone tower at Rotary Nagar on Friday demanding reopening of the rytu bazar near Bhakta Ramadasu Kalakshetram here for the benefit of farmers of Khammam division. Tense moments were witnessed at the cell phone tower when the aggrieved farmers scaled the tall structure in protest against the alleged closure of the rytu bazar located in the middle of the town, sources said. They shouted slogans condemning the ‘ closure" of the rytu bazar terming the decision as "anti-farmer." They came down the cell phone tower following the intervention of the local police, sources added. Earlier in the day, dozens of BJP cadres led by the party Kisan Morcha State president K Sridhar Reddy took out a rally in protest against the "closure" of rytu bazar. Mr Reddy alleged that the move would deprive farmers of a centrally located platform to sell their produce directly to the consumers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/4-farmers-demand-rytu-bazar-from-cell-tower/article32934897.ece

24 October 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Storage bags that reduce post-harvest seed losses||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) have developed a neem oil encapsulated electrospun polyurethane nanofibrous bags for seed storage. The real time storage experiment carried out for 75 days showed that 90 % seeds stored in these bags were uninfected while 70 % seeds in commercial bags were found to be infected with storage fungi. The research, partially funded by DST-INSPIRE faculty grant, was led by Chandra Shekhar Sharma, Associate Professor in Department of Chemical Engineering at the IIT Hyderabad. This is a first ever attempt to fabricate nanofibrous bags with the aim to reduce the post-harvest seed storage losses. The researchers encapsulated neem oil (NO) into the polyurethane (PU) nanofibers and carried out real time testing of the PUNO bags by storing three different kinds of seeds for total 75 days at normal room temperature conditions. The stored seeds were then tested for any microbial invasion. The research was published in the international peer-reviewed scientific journal The Journal of Applied Polymer Science . The research paper was co-authored with his PhD student Mrunalini K. Gaydhane, and Sampada P. Pudkea from Creative & Advanced Research Based on Nanomaterials (CARBON) Laboratory of the Department of Chemical Engineering. “The fabricated PUNO-10% mat possesses excellent load capacity superior than the commercial polypropylene patterned sample. The real time applicability of PUNO-10% pouches infers that any type of seeds can be stored for longer duration at normal room temperature conditions,” said Mr. Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/storage-bags-that-reduce-post-harvest-seed-losses/article32934905.ece
24 October 2020||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Why corona vaccine free only in Bihar?||Finance Minister T. Harish Rao questioned why corona vaccine would be distributed free only in Bihar and why it was not free in Telangana? He wondered whether the BJP government at Centre was limited to Bihar only and asked how the vaccine would be supplied in Telangana. He flayed the BJP for stooping low with such a poll promise. He made these comments while admitting some BJP workers into Telangana Rashtra Samithi at Mirddodi on Friday. He was referring to the release of BJP’s election manifesto for Bihar by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Thursday. Mr. Harish Rao urged the people to vote for Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the Dubbak assembly bye-election stating that development was possible only with the TRS. “BJP has been carrying on a false campaign against the TRS. BJP is a ‘Bharatiya Jhoota Party’. We have developed the State in a way which was not seen for the last seven decades. There is a transformation in villages with Vaikuntha Dhamam, dump yards and Palle Prakruthi Vanams. With Kaleshwaram, we will provide drinking water to every household and irrigation for every acre,” said Mr. Harish Rao while addressing election campaign at Balvantapur in Dubbak mandal on Friday. He has promised to develop the Dubbak assembly constituency along with Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy. Some youth from Etigaddakishtapur joined the party in the presence of the Minister. He said that even the voters in the villages that were getting submerged under the Kaleshwaram project are joining hands with the TRS and they are promising to vote for the party in the bye-election with a confidence that Chief Minister would do justice to them. He alleged that during the tenure of late minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy farmers were forced to pay Rs. 30,000 for fixing new transformer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-corona-vaccine-free-only-in-bihar/article32934776.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘People have been fed up with TRS’||"Every election is a challenge, but this time I am confident the tide is going to turn against the ruling Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS)," insists Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Bandi Sanjay Kumar about the upcoming Dubbaka byelection next month in this exclusive interview about the prospects of the party candidate and the issues being debated during the campaign.  Question: Why is this by-election important and why do you think people are looking beyond TRS?    Every election is important and this time more so because the TRS government has totally neglected this constituency denying the benefit of even basic amenities like roads. It is bordered by three VIP constituencies of Gajwel, Sircilla and Siddipet, belonging to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, would-be CM K.T. Rama Rao and T. Harish Rao, respectively. People are comparing the development in these three places and their own plight. In fact, it is a common knowledge that the previous MLA died heartbroken because of the official neglect. People are not going to be fooled with false promises any longer.  Your party candidate came third at the hustings last time. How can say your candidate M. Raghunandan Rao will win this time?  TRS leaders are misusing official machinery and spending lots of money to win the election by hook or by crook, but people have seen through their arrogance that came with power. We are telling people to take whatever money is being offered because it is their money after all, but vote intelligently. People realise that despite winning every poll, the TRS government did not release a single pie to the local bodies. They have given opportunities to Congress and now TRS. So, we are appealing for a chance. We will at least fight for their rights and our chances of winning are high. We have also listed out how Centre's funds have been diverted too.  Can you give examples of funds diversion?  We have calculated that Rs. 285 crore given by the Centre for spending on various welfare schemes in the Dubbaka constituency, including rural employment scheme and sanitation, have been diverted. Why have sufficient toilets not been built here? Where are rural employment schemes? Public amenities like community halls, graveyards and others have not been taken up as also housing programme. Mallannasagar oustees got less compensation here. The youth are with us, we are asking them to convince other family members to support us. Even farmers are angry because of the tardy paddy procurement and no bonus is being given. I have challenged the government to a public debate on the funds diversion, but there is no response.  Will COVID-19 pandemic have an impact on the election?  Yes! People have been left to fend for themselves and the government is supporting corporate hospitals despite many complaints. Not a single package has been announced by the KCR government to provide succour to people. Private sector employees like teachers and lecturers have suffered the most yet there is no one to help them. The TRS government is aware of people's anger and is scared, so it is resorting to foisting false cases against our party workers and putting obstacles in our campaign.  I am confident the tide is going to turn against the TRS.

24 October 2020||Mumbai,||CM announces Rs. 10,000 cr. financial aid||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday announced financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 crore for rain-affected people and areas in the State. After chairing a meeting of Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Thackeray said the aid will reach the affected people, including farmers, by Deepavali. He said, “We reviewed the situation in totality and as per our promise not to forsake farmers, we have decided to allocate Rs. 10,000 crore as aid. These funds will be used to recoup losses caused to crops and fields, and repair damaged roads and electric poles.” Mr. Thackeray said the Centre’s Rs. 6,800 compensation per hectare of arable land is insufficient and the State would give Rs. 10,000 per hectare, with a limit of up to two hectares. “Financial aid of Rs. 25,000 per hectare will be given for horticulture instead of Rs. 18,000 per hectare, with a limit of up to two hectares,” he said, adding that this is the highest amount given as aid by any State government. Of the total package, Rs. 5,500 crore is reserved for the agriculture sector, Rs. 2,635 crore for repairing roads and bridges, Rs. 300 crore for urban development, Rs. 239 crore for restoring power utilities, Rs. 102 crore for water resources and Rs. 1,000 crore for repairing rural roads and restoring water supply. Mr. Thackeray said, “The Centre has to pay the State Rs. 38,000 crore. Had they paid this amount, we would not have faced difficulties in announcing the relief package. I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the dues at the earliest.” He said if needed he will meet the PM to secure the dues. Referring to the demands made by Mr. Thackeray during the crop loss last year, when the Shiv Sena was a BJP ally, Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “Mr. Thackeray himself had demanded financial aid of Rs. 25,000 per hectare for rain-affected farmers. Today’s announcement has betrayed the trust of farmers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-announces-rs-10000-cr-financial-aid/article32934039.ece
24 October 2020||Mumbai,||Eknath Khadse joins NCP||Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse on Friday joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of party chief Sharad Pawar. Ruling out the possibility of a reshuffle of the State Cabinet to accommodate Mr. Khadse, Mr. Pawar said the latter had not joined the NCP for any post. He also rubbished reports that Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was unhappy with Mr. Khadse’s entry. “I had offers from other parties as well; I would not lie. But not only my followers but even some BJP leaders advised me that if I had to join another party, then it should be the NCP,” Mr. Khadse said. Mr. Khadse said no one should show him the fear of inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “If you are bringing the ED, then I have a CD to show to all,” he said. He added that there were attempts to destroy his political career. “I did not blame anyone in the BJP but former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,” Mr. Khadse said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/eknath-khadse-joins-ncp/article32934038.ece

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Work on new Parliament to start in Dec.||Construction on the new Parliament building, estimated to cost Rs. 970 crore, will start in December and likely to be completed by October 2022, officials of the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry and the Central Public Works Department informed Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla during a review meeting on Friday.

Facilities to be shifted The existing Parliament House reception, security offices, power infrastructure and other facilities have to be shifted to make way for the new building. “The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building, the officers mentioned... Reviewing the various aspects and progress of the project, Mr. Birla stressed on the smooth coordination and resolving issues between various agencies involved on a regular basis. He emphasised that there should be no compromise in ensuring quality-control and timely completion of the work,” it said. The new building would have offices for MPs, chambers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, a Constitution Hall that will house an original copy of the Constitution, MPs lounge, library, six committee rooms, dining areas and parking space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/work-on-new-parliament-to-start-in-dec/article32934730.ece

24 October 2020||Pune,||Pune businessman goes missing, leaves note||Businessman Gautam Pashankar, chairman of Pashankar Auto, a city-based two-wheeler dealership firm, has been missing since October 21, authorities said. On Friday, the Shivajinagar police revealed that a note had reportedly been left behind by 64-year-old Mr. Pashankar, which said that nobody should be held responsible for his action. It is believed that the businessman went missing while returning home in the city’s upmarket Modibaug area in Shivajinagar on Wednesday between 4.30 p.m. and 5 p.m. “We have recovered a note in which he has spoken of mounting financial losses in the last few years…he also said because of his decisions, his children were facing problems. The note also said that nobody should be held responsible for his disappearance or suicide,” said a police official. According to authorities, Mr. Pashankar had stepped out for work as usual on Wednesday morning. After going to a gas agency owned by the Pashankar family at Loni Kalbhor, he came to his office in Shivajinagar and handed a sealed envelope to his driver and asked him to deliver it to his family. Following this, Mr. Pashankar was said to be seen walking in the direction of the Savitribai Phule Pune University. When he did not turn up for a while, his family members lodged a complaint.

24 October 2020||Washington,||Trump, Biden offer contrasting plans||U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden came face to face for their final debate before Election Day. The candidates, who debated at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, sparred on topics that included the pandemic, climate change, China and corruption. The debate was markedly less chaotic than the first one — Mr Trump did not interrupt Mr. Biden as he did in the first debate allowing for a clearer presentation of both sides’ positions. The response to the pandemic and how each candidate would lead the country out of it was discussed at length, with Mr. Biden warning that the country was heading into a “dark winter.” “Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President,” Mr. Biden said. As president, he would encourage everyone to wear masks, introduce rapid testing, institute national standards for schools and businesses to open up and give them financial assistance to spend on safety measures, he said. “All he does is talk about shutdowns,” Mr. Trump said.” No, we’re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools.” Mr. Trump said that the shutdown had caused depression, job loss, suicide, alcohol and drug use as well as abuse. He said 2.2 million were expected to die — a misleading statement based on a White House disease model scenario if no person took any action to curtail infections. Mr. Trump insisted again that the country was “rounding the turn” [turning the corner] on the pandemic. To Mr. Trump’s “We’re learning to live with” the pandemic, Mr. Biden said: “We are learning to die with it.” When moderator Kristen Welker of NBC asked Mr. Trump if he could guarantee that a vaccine would be out in weeks, he said no, but said there was a “good chance” it would be available that soon. “No, it’s not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year,” he said. “But I think it has a good chance, there are two companies… I think within a matter of weeks.” Mr. Trump repeatedly tried directing the conversation to unsubstantiated claims of Mr. Biden’s family getting money from abroad. Through the last few days, the Trump campaign and his allies have sought to bring attention to the foreign dealings of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Tax returns Mr. Biden questioned Mr. Trump on why he hadn’t still released his tax returns as he had said he would, and brought up his “secret” bank account in China. [Mr. Trump had declared the account in his tax documents but not in his public disclosure of assets as the account was held by one of his companies]. “It’s not about his family and my family, it’s about your family. And your family’s hurting badly,” Mr. Biden said at one point in the debate. Mr. Biden said he did not understand why Mr. Trump was “unwilling to take on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” on reports that Russia had offered bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan and Mr. Putin’s actions to destabilise NATO . “Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they’re affecting our sovereignty,” Mr. Biden said. On North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr. Trump pointed out that there was no war with North Korea and that he had a “good relationship”. “Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Biden, who said he would (as President) talk to Mr. Kim if the latter agreed to “drawing down” his nuclear capacity, likened Mr. Trump’s position to having a good relationship with Adolf Hitler prior to the Nazi invasion of other European countries. On race, Mr. Trump defended his position on Black Lives Matter (the moderator had asked him about his equating it to a symbol of hate), but said he was the “least racist person in the room”. Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump was “one of the most racist Presidents we’ve had in modern history”.  Healthcare policy On healthcare policy, Mr. Biden said he was going to modify Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) to include a public option. “Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare,” Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trump insisted that Mr. Biden supported “socialised medicine” [a government-run healthcare system]. “He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden,” Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Mr. Biden is controlled by the “radical left” and progressive flank of the Democratic party. “I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them,” Mr. Biden said. At one point, Mr. Trump was asked about a report this week that the parents of 545 migrant children separated from their families at the southern border could not be located. “They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean,” Mr. Trump said. He also said the Obama-Biden administration had built the cage like structures in which migrants were being held. Fossil fuels Towards the end, the debate focused a substantial amount of time on the two candidates’ climate policies. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Biden if he would “close down the oil industry”. Mr. Biden said “over time, over time” he would “transition” and would stop giving oil federal subsidies. “Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Biden clarified after the debate that he wanted to end federal subsidies to oil companies and not get rid of fossil fuels, the Washington Post reported. At the end of the debate, when asked what they would say at their hypothetical inaugural address to those who did not vote for them, Mr Trump used his time to say Mr. Biden would cause an economic depression if elected and about his own economic record. Mr. Biden said he would tell people he was there to represent all of them and was going to give them hope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-biden-offer-contrasting-plans/article32933897.ece
24 October 2020||Geneva,||Libya’s warring factions agree to ‘permanent’ truce||Libya’s warring factions signed a permanent ceasefire agreement on Friday, but any lasting end to years of chaos and bloodshed will require wider agreement among myriad armed groups and the outside powers that support them. Acting United Nations envoy Stephanie Williams said the ceasefire would start immediately and all foreign fighters must leave Libya within three months. Forces would withdraw from front lines and a new joint police force would secure those areas. Friday’s agreement was reached after the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in June beat back Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) from its 14-month assault on the capital. Since then, frontlines have stabilised near the central coastal city of Sirte and the LNA ended its eight-month blockade of Libyan oil output that was strangling state finances on both sides. However, Turkey, the main backer of the GNA, voiced scepticism that the ceasefire would hold. There was caution inside Libya too. “If there is no force or mechanism to apply this on the ground... this deal will only be ink on paper,” said Ahmed Ali, 47, in Benghazi. Meanwhile, political talks scheduled in Tunisia early next month with an eventual view towards holding national elections, would need to reach agreement on historically elusive issues and overcome mistrust.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/libyas-warring-factions-agree-to-permanent-truce/article32933893.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||On Korean War anniversary, Xi sends warning to ‘invaders’||China’s President Xi Jinping on Friday invoked the memory of the Korean War on its 70th anniversary to send a warning to any “invaders” that “force must be met with force”. Mr. Xi, speaking at a meeting to mark the anniversary of what China officially calls “the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea”, said the 1950-53 conflict that saw China intervene on behalf of North Korea served a reminder that China “will never sit back and watch any damage to our national sovereignty” and “will never allow any force to invade or divide the sacred territory of the motherland.” While the Chinese President did not specifically refer to any of China’s current disputes, Chinese State media have framed the high-profile marking of the anniversary through a number of events in recent days, against the backdrop of deteriorating China-U.S. relations and as sending a message to Washington, even if Mr. Xi’s comments would likely also draw attention in both India and Taiwan amid recent tensions. “It is necessary to speak to invaders in the language they know, that is, a war must be fought to deter invasion, and force must be met by force,” he was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. “A victory is needed to win peace and respect.” He said “the Chinese nation will never cower before threats, or be subdued by suppression” and called for “fostering the valour of the nation that fears no death” and “the need to promote the national wisdom of keeping to the right path, making innovations, and striving to march forward”. Taking aim at the Quad On Friday, the official news agency released a commentary criticising the U.S. in the wake of Australia joining the India-U.S.-Japan Malabar naval exercise set for next month, describing the four-member “Quad” grouping as “a clique flexing muscles in the Asian-Pacific region” and saying the “regional situation should be taken into account when a drill is schemed and the motivation behind it explored”. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday issued a somewhat muted response to the announcement of the exercise, saying China “always believe[s] that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability.” The Xinhua commentary issued a sharper response. “After a long-time hiatus, the Quad reconvened in 2017 when the United States proposed the so-called Indo-Pacific strategy on the East Asia cooperation, which, based on an obsolete Cold War mentality, is aimed at stoking geopolitical competition and confrontation so as to contain the region’s development,” it said. ‘Cold War mentality’ The drill, the commentary said, was “a sign that the bloc is mulling military and security cooperation for self-serving political interests”. “The Cold War mentality is as poisonous as history has proven,” it added. “Asia-Pacific countries should jointly resist such a detrimental mentality and team up to promote peace and development for their own good. Some countries’ attempts to advocate a Cold War mentality and create chaos in the region will only shoot themselves in the foot.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/on-korean-war-anniversary-xi-sends-warning-to-invaders/article32933886.ece
24 October 2020||Paris,||French teacher’s killer had ‘contact’ with jihadist in Syria||The investigation into the murder of a French teacher for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in class turned to Syria on Thursday, where the killer had a jihadist contact, a source close to the case said. Seven people have been charged with being complicit in a “terrorist murder” after 18-year-old Chechen Abdullakh Anzorov beheaded Samuel Paty on the outskirts of Paris on Friday, including two teenagers who helped him identify the teacher. France paid homage to Paty on Wednesday, with President Emmanuel Macron saying that the history and geography teacher had been slain by “cowards” for representing the secular, democratic values of the French Republic. “Islamists want to take our future,” Mr. Macron said. “They will never have it.” In their search for accomplices, anti-terror investigators have now established that Anzorov had contact with a Russian-speaking jihadist in Syria whose identity is not yet known, the source told AFP. Traced to Idlib  Le Parisien newspaper reported on Thursday that Anzorov’s suspected contact had been located through an IP address traced back to Idlib, a jihadist holdout in northwestern Syria. In an audio message in Russian immediately after the killing, translated by AFP, Anzorov said that he had “avenged the Prophet” whom the teacher had shown “in an insulting way”. In the recording, which contains several references to the Koran as well as to the Islamic State group, he also said: “Brothers, pray that Allah accepts me as a martyr.” The message was published on social media in a video, accompanied by two tweets, one showing the victim’s severed head and another in which Anzorov confessed to the murder. Moments later, he was shot dead by the police. Many of Paty’s students saw the images online before they could be taken down. The teenagers who pointed out Paty to his killer in return for €300-350 ($356-$414) were charged late on Wednesday. The parent of one of Paty’s students, who started the social media campaign against the teacher, was also charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/french-teachers-killer-had-contact-with-jihadist-in-syria/article32933890.ece

24 October 2020||BEIJING,||China may not recognise U.K.-issued HK passports||China’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday it may decide not to recognise British-issued passports for Hong Kong residents in retaliation for London’s moves to open a path to citizenship for those holding the documents. Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Britain had “violated its promises” and “played up” the issue of the British National (Overseas) passports. Britain said in May that it would allow holders of such passports extended stays and the possibility of citizenship, prompting thousands of Hong Kongers to rush to renew or apply for them as Beijing steps up restriction on political expression. Differences have sharpened since China in June imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in response to months of anti-government protests last year. London suspended its extradition treaty with the territory and has offered political asylum to persons targeted under the new legislation. “As the British side violated its commitment first, China will consider not recognizing the BNO Passport as a valid travel document,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-may-not-recognise-uk-issued-hk-passports/article32933888.ece
24 October 2020||Tokyo,||U.K., Japan ink post-Brexit trade deal||Britain and Japan formally signed a trade agreement on Friday, marking Britain’s first big post-Brexit deal on trade, as it continues to struggle to agree on a deal with its closest trading partners in the European Union. Britain formally left the EU in January and it has focused on negotiating new trade pacts with countries around the world as its status-quo transition period ends on Dec. 31. “This is the first new free trade deal to be agreed since the U.K. once again became an independent trading nation,” British Trade Secretary Liz Truss told reporters. Britain has said the deal meant 99% of its exports to Japan would be tariff-free, and that it could increase trade by 15.2 billion pounds ($19.9 billion) in the long run, compared with 2018. The deal removes U.K.’s tariffs on Japanese cars in stages to zero in 2026.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-japan-ink-post-brexit-trade-deal/article32933887.ece
24 October 2020||Paris,||France to crack down on social media||France said on Friday it would crack down on social media posts that put people in danger by divulging their personal details, a week after the murder of a teacher targeted in an online campaign over Prophet Mohammed cartoons. In the run-up to the murder, the parent of one of Samuel Paty’s students and a known Islamist radical had run a social media campaign against the teacher. French Prime Minister Jean Castex said a pending draft law defending secular values against radical Islam — known as an anti-separatism law — would now be amended to allow the prosecution of anybody who posts personal details online if this “threatens the life of another”. Once voted into law, the provision will allow “the punishment of those who post personal information, thus threatening the life of a person, for example a teacher”, Prime Minister Castex said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-to-crack-down-on-social-media/article32933891.ece

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||The revenge of the lakes in Hyderabad||Mohammed Abdul Quddus Qureshi’s body was found at the Nagole sewage treatment plant along the Musi river, 13 km from his home in Alinagar, even as the steady downpour in Hyderabad continued. His decaying body had floated across three police commissionerate jurisdictions before being fished out. He was laid to rest in a cemetery in Chanchalguda, a neighbourhood in the Old City, near the fresh graves of four of his family members. They were also swept away by the waters of the overflowing Palle Cheruvu lake, part of the Umda Sagar lake basin. Of the nine members of the family who were swept away in the deluge of October 13, only one, Mohammed Abdul Taher Qureshi, survived; three remain missing. The family’s loss accounts for a chunk of the 33 deaths recorded in Hyderabad. Taher Qureshi was trying to move the eight members of the single-storey house across the rising waters to safety in his brother’s three-storey building. But the torrent was so strong that it was as if the chabutra , on which they were standing, dissolved in it like salt. “I heard a wall collapse and in no time, water came in with full force onto the road and consumed the ground floor of the building. I buried two grandchildren and two daughters-in-law. My brother’s body, which was found in Nagole, had decomposed. The bodies of three others have still not been found,” says Abdul, his voice quivering. A short distance from Alinagar, along National Highway 44, the floodwater from the Appa Cheruvu lake close by, devoured siblings Tanima and Amer, and a cousin, Taher. Their bodies were found a day later. The body of Ayaan, an eight-year-old boy, was also retrieved. The family of four along with their cousin were at home when the water swirled over the wall, sweeping away the house and its inhabitants. In a separate incident, also on NH 44, Moaawia Youssef, a Sudanese student, who was on his way to the airport along with his cab driver, was last seen on October 14. While the cab driver was eventually traced, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Police confirmed that the National Disaster Response Force teams have thus far been unsuccessful in tracing the student. Unprecedented flooding The downpour had more devastation in store, and the restive Gurram Cheruvu lake, also part of the Umda Sagar lake basin, served as its vassal. On October 18, its bund that serves as a road connecting Barkas (a corruption of the word ‘barracks’) to Balapur succumbed to water pressure. What followed was an unprecedented flooding of neighbourhoods south of the bund. Ravi, a caretaker of a dairy farm, recalls the roar with which the water broke the bund. “Around 1 a.m., it rose up to 12 feet, broke our walls and took away cash and furniture. I rushed to save my mother. It is a miracle that we — our four buffaloes, 15 sheep and four horses — are safe. The water then went towards Hafiz Baba Nagar,” he says. The scenes from Hafiz Baba Nagar are telling of the loss and devastation. Dozens here are left with nothing but the damp clothes on their backs. “The water smashed the wall of my house, and portions of the roof collapsed. The washing machine, fridge, and our clothes were all swept away. I will have to rebuild my life from scratch,” says Mohammed Salman, an optical fibre cable trencher, and the owner of a home in B Block. On October 14, after night-long rain, the daily rainfall recorded at the weather monitoring station of the India Meteorological Department at Begumpet was 19.2 cm. It was the second highest in the recorded history of rainfall in a single day at this station since 1891. The water drowned the roads and inundated homes worth crores of rupees in upmarket localities such as Manikonda, Gachibowli, Rajendranagar and Madhapur on the western part of the city, the hub of the IT industry. On the other hand, data from the automatic weather stations, installed by the Telangana State Development Planning Society, showed the highest for the day at 33 cm, recorded at the Singapore Township in Pocharam, in the eastern part of the city. A week later, the Irrigation Department Principal Secretary, Rajat Kumar, noted that 185 lakes overflowed on account of the rains. Of these, Appa Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu were described as those that breached. The sisterhood of lakes In Telangana’s natural terrain, lakes exist in sororities. The State’s undulating topography allowed the existence of a reported one lakh chain-linked lakes/ponds, locally known as Kuntas and Cheruvus, in Hyderabad and its peripheries in the pre-independence era. Surplus water from each lake flowed down to the next water body in the basin, completing a chain link. The system worked well for the region in the Deccan Plateau where canal irrigation was not an option. Owing to the linkages, flooding could be avoided during monsoons, and there would be enough water impounded for summer crops. The rulers recognised this fact, and through their diktats, maintained the lakes’ health. They also added new lakes, constructed strong bunds and drains to control the flows, and maintained and developed them. After independence, the lakes came under the centralised command of the Irrigation Department, alienating the users from their water bodies. Since the 1970s, the pace of urbanisation has picked up, substituting the traditional value of subsistence placed on the land with that of real estate. As the city spread, traditional vocations such as agriculture and fishing vanished. Concrete jungles took over within no time. A unique aspect of the Asafjahi rule was its grant of titles to farmers in the lake beds so that when water receded in summer, the alluvial soil offered them bounty crop. No activity apart from farming was allowed on the lake bed. With urbanisation fast catching up, and infrastructure creation not apace with it, lakes became the handy receptacles of the city’s sewage. Builders laid sewage lines up to the nearest lake, or connected them to the storm water drain network wherever it existed. The capital region is so replete with such interconnections between sewage lines and storm water drains that ‘dry flows’ is a standardised term for sewage flow into drains during the dry season. As a fallout, eutrophication soon set into the lakes, making the lakes rich with weed and poor in water-holding capacity and biodiversity. The fish died. The water became unfit for any kind of consumption. Slowly, but surely, the lake shrunk in area, quantity and quality. Farmers and their descendants who had titles inside the lake beds sold the exposed land. Wherever the lakes became veritable sewage repositories, the urban poor settled in those areas. And where the waters were still pristine enough to proffer a ‘lake view’, the plots were sold at premium rates. Gigantic infrastructure development projects taken up by the successive governments, including the Outer Ring Road, Hyderabad Metro Rail, and the Strategic Road Development Plan, to name a few, tampered with the topography of the capital region and altered the hydrology of the lake basins. The role of land sharks, who many a time are the political leaders themselves, cannot be understated, in filling the foreshore areas of the lake bed with debris and raising structures within the full tank level. It would not be an exaggeration to state that there is not one lake in the limits of Greater Hyderabad which has been exempted from this fate, including the famed Hussain Sagar lake. The status of the lakes in the municipalities/corporations surrounding the State capital is worse. Shrinking water bodies From one lakh, the water bodies have drastically come down to 185 within the Greater Hyderabad capital region, and to 3,132 within the limits of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) as enumerated by its Lake Protection Committee till date. Of the 185 lakes in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), for 75, the surplus weirs and courses are completely closed. According to a report on the disappearing water bodies of Hyderabad, by the Society for Participatory Development, submitted to the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, in 2017, the city had lost 3,245 hectares of water bodies in the previous 12 years. The Lake Protection Committee was constituted in 2010 upon the High Court’s directions responding to a PIL. It is headed by the HMDA Commissioner, and has members from departments such as GHMC, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Irrigation, Panchayat Raj, Environment and Forests, and five district administrations under the HMDA’s purview. The Committee had been inept in terms of enforcement. It has limited itself to counting lakes alone. It has failed to fulfil its mandate of identifying lakes, demarcating boundaries and buffer zones for them, fencing them with FTL (Full Tank Level) stones, and preserving them by preventing and removing encroachments. Of the 3,132 water bodies, all formalities have been completed with respect to only 224. This number has remained unchanged for the past one year. Even where the FTL boundaries are notified, encroachments within have remained untouched, owing to several sociopolitical dynamics. The decay of Gurram Cheruvu Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu are part of the Umda Sagar lake’s watershed area as per the Survey of India’s topology sheets. Gurram Cheruvu receives its inflows from Pedda Cheruvu of the same basin, which in turn is downstream of the Burhan Khan lake. There is one more unnotified water body, the Shukur lake, in the same line, emptying into Gurram Cheruvu. The Burhan Khan lake, which is uppermost in the hydrological chain, is a huge water body with an FTL of 132 acres, of which 130 acres were intact till 2013 when it was surveyed. The government, however, had given plots for a housing colony for the poor in the lake bed, while on the other side came up a gated community, partially encroaching on the lake. A temple is now seen under construction in the foreshore area near the weir, dumped heavily with debris. During the recent floods, the lake began to submerge the colony of the poor. While the Pedda Cheruvu and Shukur Sagar lake are relatively unhindered, rampant construction on the surplus course of both have choked the inlet of the Gurram Cheruvu. This has inundated colonies at the lake’s mouth when a deluge of inflows arrived from upstream due to copious rains. On the northern edge, the Gurram Cheruvu’s main sluice was buried under heavy encroachment encouraged by local leaders and their henchmen. Truckloads of debris were allegedly dumped into the lake and levelled using heavy machinery, about which a police complaint had already been lodged by the Tehsildar in the Chandrayangutta Police Station, but to no avail. When the lake brimmed after two decades, officials were caught in a cleft stick, as Hafiz Baba Nagar residents settled downstream demanded diversion of the water. Meanwhile, the lake’s backwater had drowned the Barkas locality neck deep. Instead of clearing the encroachment, and opening the sluice, officials tried to widen the weir portion, weakening the bund. It breached at midnight, and all hell broke loose. The decay of this lake began not more than two decades ago. “Our uncle had agriculture under the lake. We grew paddy and vegetables, and he would distribute the crop after storing some for our needs. When the bullocks got sick, we the cousins would carry the plough along in the field,” recalls Aslam Bin Haji Al Baghdadi, 25, a resident of the area. Now, there is no farming or fishing here. The water is filled with water hyacinth weed. A sewage receptacle Water hyacinth defines the other lake of doom, the Palle Cheruvu, too. This lake is privately owned, just like its source lake, the Umda Sagar. Umda Sagar receives its inflows from Jalapalli Lake of the same basin. Reports about encroachments into the Jalapalli Lake appeared in the media, while the HMDA is yet to notify the centuries-old tank. Palle Cheruvu tells the story of how a water body surrounded by burgeoning residential colonies has become a sewage receptacle. When Umda Sagar upstream started overflowing, the surplus water entered Palle Cheruvu, which had only one small drain, two feet wide. While the Irrigation Department maintains that the lake had breached, local people say that the lake topped over the bund and gushed on to the road and the surrounding areas on the night when Qureshi lost eight members of his family. Post the tragedy, irrigation officials were seen dumping tonnes of earth on the bund in order to raise its height. “The outflow channel of Palle Cheruvu meets the surplus channels of two more lakes, the Salkam Cheruvu and the Surram Cheruvu, from the same basin. Together with the Gurram Cheruvu outflow, it becomes a massive stream roaring towards the Musi River during floods. But the channel is now occupied by structures, severely restricting the flow,” says Lubna Sarwat from Save Our Urban Lakes. Gurram Cheruvu and Palle Cheruvu are both in the HMDA’s list of notified lakes. In the Umda Sagar basin, 14 of the 28 lakes had totally disappeared between 1978 and 2017, while three were in the process of disappearing, as per the study report submitted to IISc, Bengaluru. The area under water spread had reduced from 236 hectares to 134 acres. A 2017 research paper on remote sensing study by ICRISAT and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala records the shrinkage of water bodies in the city and its surrounding areas over 16 years. In 2005, lakes recorded a total acreage of 12,535 ha. In 2016, this reduced to 2,283 ha. This means that all the floodwater that would otherwise have been impounded in these lakes, enriching the ground water, quenching thirst and feeding biodiversity of the basin is now let berserk either into the surrounding lakes, or into low-lying areas, inundating homes and killing the residents. A long-term action plan needed But the authorities are still to learn their lessons. There is no single authority dealing with the lakes in the city. GHMC has a separate wing for lakes, and takes its own decisions about their development. One measure receiving criticism is the laying of walking tracks around the water bodies, by filling the boundary paths. The corporation has tried engineering solutions for inundation, such as constructing box-type RCC storm water drains from areas of flooding up to the nearest lake, but this has given rise to another problem by impounding more water than the lake can hold. Two studies — one by Kirloskar Consultancy in 2002 for the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and the other by the Voyants Consultancy in 2008 for GHMC — recommended widening and improving storm water drains, and diverting sewage. The Voyants’ Master Plan divided the entire GHMC area into 16 hydraulic zones and identified 173 major drains, 391-km long, which needed decongestion and widening immediately. Its implementation necessitates the acquisition of 28,800 properties encroaching on the drains, an insurmountable task. Only about 35 km of the drains could be cleared till 2016 when the city experienced inundation yet again in several areas, forcing the government to consider the proposals seriously. Ananth Maringanti, an environmentalist from Hyderabad Urban Labs, says, “It is time to seriously consider long-term definitive action, rather than resorting to drastic measures. The city has pushed its most deprived to the edges of the water bodies, and the socioeconomic dimensions involved in displacing them cannot be ignored.” The devastation of the past few weeks forced the government to announce a Rs. 550 crore relief package. On October 19, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao said that Rs. 1 lakh would be given to those whose houses were fully damaged. Owners of partially damaged houses would be given Rs. 50,000. Another Rs. 10,000 would be given to households in low-lying areas who were hit hard by the flood. Upstream of the Gurram Cheruvu bund, where Sayeed Colony, Ali Gulshan Colony and Hamshan Colony remained flooded for several days, Ali Bin Abdallah claims that calls made to political leaders remained unanswered. Till October 20, he alleged, neither senior officers of the GHMC nor of the revenue department arrived to assess losses. It was voluntary organisations that began to plug the perceived yawning gap in relief work. NGOs rescued victims and provided them with immediate relief in the form of food and clothing. WhatsApp groups and places of worship turned into relief war rooms. GPS coordinates of where essential supplies were needed the most were posted, with students and professionals working at the grassroots delivering them to those in need.“Providing relief began soon after rains hit the city and was crucial in plugging some gaps. To avoid duplication of work, a few organisations have come together to chalk out a strategy,” says activist S.Q. Masood. Caught in a difficult situation, the State government is blaming the problems on the unprecedented rainfall in a single day. As per a study by the department of Civil Engineering, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, extreme daily rainfall in the city will be a recurring phenomenon in future too. The study has postulated that in 2040, 2045, 2068, 2088 and 2098, the city may experience intense rainfall in a day ranging between 27 cm and 69 cm. How the city prepares to mitigate the potential damage that it will bring is to be seen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-revenge-of-the-lakes-in-hyderabad/article32933884.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||India’s UN journey, from outlier to the high table||The 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations (UN) is an opportunity to look at the major trends, patterns and future challenges as far as India is concerned in terms of safeguarding its interests and promoting common good. That the UN is indispensable is uncontested despite the clamour for reforms to strengthen its role. As Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once observed in his address to the UN General Assembly on December 20, 1956, “Of course, even if the United Nations did not do anything wonderful, the mere fact of the United Nations itself has been of great significance to the world....” Membership and phases Seven and a half decades of India at the UN may be viewed with reference to roughly three distinct phases. In the first phase until the end of the Cold War in 1989, India had learnt the ropes of exploring and enhancing its diplomatic influence as a moderating force in easing armed conflicts in Asia and Africa by disentangling them from the superpower rivalry. In parallel, the Indian leadership learned the hard way that the UN could not be relied upon to impartially resolve vital security disputes such as Jammu and Kashmir. As such, it strove to utilise the UN only to focus on common causes such as anti-colonialism, anti-racism, nuclear disarmament, environment conservation and equitable economic development. India, in a clever way, seemed to claim the moral high ground by proposing, in 1988, a bold, but obviously impractical, three-phase plan to eliminate nuclear weapons from the surface of earth. But it resisted attempts by neighbouring countries to raise bilateral problems. This was reflected during the Bangladesh liberation war and after. In essence, a loss of face for India in the 1962 border war against China meant a definitive redesign of the country’s diplomatic style to privilege bilateral contacts over the third party role by the UN. A demanding decade The 1990s spelled the most difficult decade for India in the world body, as the years were marked by the sudden end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the resultant emergence of the United States as the unrivalled power in world politics. Besides, the uncertain political climate caused by unstable coalition governments along with the balance of payments crisis constrained the country’s capability to be active in various bodies, especially in the Security Council (UNSC) and the General Assembly. There was a change in India’s foreign policy which was reflected in voting patterns at the UN. To cite a few examples, India showed pragmatism in enabling the toughest terms on Iraq even after eviction from occupied Kuwait, or in reversing the hitherto stated position on Zionism as racism. At the same time, growing militancy in Kashmir in the early 1990s emboldened Pakistan to internationalise the dispute with accusations about gross human rights violations by India. Clearly, India had to work hard to seek favours from Iran and China in the Human Rights Commission to checkmate Pakistan. The threat posed to respect for sovereignty principle by NATO intervention against Yugoslavia in 1999 without the authorisation of the UNSC deeply disturbed India, but its efforts, in partnership with Russia and China, to call for an end to aerial attacks did not garner much support in the UNSC. Further, the extent of India’s diplomatic difficulties was exposed when it suffered a humiliating defeat in the hands of Japan in the 1996 contest for a non-permanent seat in the UNSC. This, however, did not mean that India could not draw red lines on questions of serious consequences to its security. India resolutely stood against indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995, and it stoutly rejected the backdoor introduction for adoption of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996. It is notable that these two developments at the UN perhaps pushed India to surprise the world in 1998 with its Pokhran nuclear weapon tests, ignoring the likely adverse reaction from the nuclear club. Winds of change Remarkably, the 21st century opened new avenues for India to shine at the UN. The impressive economic performance in the first decade, thanks to economic liberalisation and globalisation policies, helped a great deal in strengthening its profile. This is only aided by its reliable and substantial troop contributions to several peacekeeping operations in African conflict theatres. Alongside, India has emerged as a responsible stakeholder in non-traditional security issue areas such as the spread of small and light weapons, the threat of non-state actors acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and the impact of climate change. In a related dimension, India has scaled up its contributions to development and humanitarian agencies, while India’s share to the UN assessed budget has registered a hike from 0.34% to 0.83%. Finally, India’s growing popularity is evident in the successful electoral contests for various prestigious slots in the UNSC, the Human Rights Council, the World Court, and functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council, at times defeating the nominees of China and the United Kingdom. However, two major initiatives India has heavily invested in are stuck without much hope of a timely outcome. The first relates to the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism it drafted and revised with the hope of helping consensus. But it encountered reservations from among Islamic and other countries on provisions regarding definition of terrorist and the convention’s application to state armed forces. Security Council expansion Equally important is the question of equitable expansion of the UNSC to enable India to attain permanent membership along with other claimants from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The move has been stuck for more than 25 years because of a lack of unity among the regional formations. It also includes stout opposition from some 30 middle powers such as Italy and Pakistan which fear losing out to regional rivals in the event of an addition of permanent seats, and the intrigues masterminded by one or two permanent members. Although India enjoys by far the greatest support,the only realistic possibility seems to settle for a compromise, i.e. a new category of members elected for a longer duration than the present non-permanent members without veto power. India’s future role will probably depend on its ability to weather the impact of the multiple crises it now faces on account of an unabated economic slowdown and a troubled relationship with China. This is pertinent as India will soon begin its two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member (January 1, 2021). Its areas of priority will continue to be the upholding of Charter principles, mounting effective punitive measures against those who support, finance and sponsor terrorists, besides striving for securing due say to the troop contributing countries in the management of peace operations. It is reasonable to assume (based on earlier patterns) that India will work for and join in consensus on key questions wherever possible. But it may opt to abstain along with other members including one or two permanent members. Once in the seat In the midst of the currently volatile situation as characterised by the Trump administration’s disdain towards multilateral institutions, the changing U.S.-China equation, China’s growing political isolation on account of the spread of the novel coronavirus, and China’s aggressive territorial forays in eastern Ladakh and the South China Sea, India may face challenges and opportunities in the UNSC. In an unlikely scenario of China succeeding in convening a formal meeting on Kashmir to please Pakistan, India may have to choose either to abstain in the vote since it is a party to the dispute or vote against any unfavourable proposal that might be tabled. Exercising the latter option would be the first of its kind in India’s voting record at the UNSC. On the other hand, the growing proximity with the U.S. may prompt India not to stay neutral in order to counter balance China. C.S.R.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Metrics of world happiness and the Muslims of India||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has again reiterated his oft-repeated statement that the happiest Muslims in the world are in India. But for the Muslims of India, a comparison to Islamic countries is of no relevance at all. In any case, India should compare itself with the Scandinavian countries rather than some of the regressive Muslim regimes. Indian Muslims will be more concerned about the health of Indian democracy and how far the country is upholding or violating the high values enshrined in the Constitution. Importantly, Mr. Bhagwat. in a clear departure from the Hindutva stand, has asserted that the Constitution nowhere says only Hindus can live in India, or that to live in India one has to accept the supremacy of Hindus. He has also tried to demolish the Hindutva theory of Muslim rule being exclusively Muslim rule by citing the battle of Haldighati (1576) between the Mughals and Rajputs when, he said, many Muslims were on the side of Maharana Pratap Singh and fought against the Mughal army led by another Rajput, Raja Man Singh. Mr. Bhagwat has repeatedly said that Muslims are equal citizens of this country while Hindutva has been historically making a distinction between indigenous religions and Abrahamic religions. His statement of Hindus not having any superior status in the Constitution is not only consistent with the vision of the Constitution but also signifies abandoning the idea of declaring India as a Hindu Rashtra. Though a welcome departure from the stated position, one should not overnight expect a break from the past on every issue. Any change in the long-held position of the organisation can only be gradual. How do we assess happiness? In the eighth World Happiness Report of 2020 released in March (https://bit.ly/2HjQuYt), India is ranked 144 out of 153 countries. The first five ranks go to Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway, respectively. Even India’s neighbours are ahead — Bangladesh (107), Sri Lanka (130), Nepal (92) and Pakistan (66). The unhappiest people are in Afghanistan (153), South Sudan (152), Zimbabwe (151), Rwanda (150) and the Central African Republic (149). Key concerns in the country The variables taken into account include general well-being; positive emotions; supplemental life; circumstances and social environment; inequalities; unemployment; low incomes; discrimination; GDP per capita; life expectancy; freedom; generosity and absence of corruption. In India, with 45-year high unemployment rates (prior to COVID-19) and over 12.2 crore people losing jobs during the lockdown phase, more Indians (not just Muslims) are today worried and unhappy than ever before. Dalits face rising atrocities against them, farmers are unhappy about the enactment of new farm laws, labour unions are disappointed with the new Labour Code and civil society activists are frustrated over the denial of civil liberties, latest FCRA Amendment and the judiciary’s reluctance to even promptly hear habeas corpus petitions. Coming back to the Report , most Muslims elsewhere seem happier than Indian Muslims — the United Arab Emirates (21); Saudi Arabia (27); Bahrain (40); Kuwait (48); Libya (80) and Malaysia (82). True, Indian Muslims are certainly better off than Muslims in several Muslim countries due to India’s liberal, egalitarian and secular Constitution and Hinduism’s tolerance. Most Muslim countries are not really democratic and therefore should not be compared with India.  In the recently released World Hunger Index- 2020 (https://bit.ly/3omQHuz), India ranks 94 out of 107 countries; Pakistan (88) and Bangladesh (75) are ahead. Both Kuwait and Turkey are in the top 17. Other rankings are Tunisia (23); Saudi Arabia (35); Iran (39) and Jordan (43). On civil liberties Civil liberties are an important component too in ensuring contentment. India’s rankings should worry the RSS chief. In the World Freedom of Press Index-2020 (https://bit.ly/31BDtQF and https://bit.ly/3dRqvDj), India was ranked 142 out of 180 countrie. Several Muslim countries are ahead — Bosnia-Herzegovina (58); Kosovo (70); Tunisia (72) and Malaysia (101). In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index (https://bit.ly/2Hr9JiG andhttps://bit.ly/2IQvoB4), it is a grim situation for India (a global rank of 69 out of 128 countries). Factors such as constraints on governmental power; open government; fundamental rights; order and security, absence of corruption; regulatory enforcement; civil justice system and criminal justice system matter. With verdicts such as the acquittal of all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, India’s rank is unlikely to improve in 2021. Once again, several Muslim countries are ahead even in the rule of law — the UAE (30); Malaysia (47); Jordon (50); Tunisia (56); Indonesia (59) and Kazakhstan (62). Happiness is also closely related to the state of rule of law. Increasingly, faith in the rule of law is diminishing with some courts becoming more executive minded than the executive itself. Religious freedom Finally, on freedom of religion, the Indian Constitution grants this freedom to everyone including Muslims, yet its definition of the term Hindu is problematic and is criticised by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. A denial of Scheduled Caste status to Muslims and Dalit Christians by Presidential order is seen to be discriminatory. Anti-conversion laws of many States require the prior permission of district officials for conversion. Religion being a purely private matter, the state should have no concern with it. Charging protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens with offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and alleging so-called ‘UPSC jihad’ do have a deleterious effect on the emotional health of Muslims, with a predominant feeling of being unwanted and alienation. Even on religious freedom, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has downgraded India’s ranking in its 2020 report (https://bit.ly/3dPcK86 and https://bit.ly/34psrjv). It is scathing when it says, “India took a sharp downward turn in 2019. The national government used its strengthened parliamentary majority to institute national-level policies violating religious freedom across India, especially for Muslims.” Strangely, Afghanistan, Sudan, Indonesia and Egypt have better rankings, while India has been clubbed with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, North Korea, Syria, Burma and China (‘Countries of Particular Concern’). The International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) defines CPCs as “countries where the government engages in or tolerates ‘particularly severe’ violations of religious freedom.” Under U.S. law, these include violations such as ‘torture, degrading treatment, prolonged detention without charges and other fragrant denial of right to life, liberty or the security of persons’. The RSS chief is also not right in saying that in no other society does an alien religion still survive. Europe, the Americas, Australia and Africa have Christianity that originated in Jerusalem. Buddhism, from India, is present in a number of countries. Islam, from Saudi Arabia, is strong in several European, African and Asian states, and Australia. The RSS chief’s statement that Indian Muslims are the happiest lot of Muslims may not be completely true but it would certainly have the much-needed calming effect in assuring Muslims of their rightful and equal claim to India as their country. In an age of majoritarianism, Mr. Bhagwat can certainly help restore sanity, tolerance and accommodation which were essential attributes of classical Hinduism. He should rein in aggressive Hindutva forces and convince them about the values of diversity and the remarkable contribution that Muslims have made to Indian civilisation.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Taking on the Centre||Punjab’s efforts to enact State amendments to override the effects of the Centre’s new agriculture laws epitomise the difficulties in managing the conflict between liberalising the farm sector and protecting the small and marginal farmer from the agonies of the transition. The issue also flags the consequences of not having a wide and informed debate before introducing far-reaching changes. Punjab has been the hub of the opposition to the Centre’s legislative exercise to change the basics of trade and commerce in agriculture. The Akali Dal, the main opposition in the State, eventually withdrew its Cabinet minister and later walked out of the NDA government at the Centre. Punjab argues that the central Acts would cause “grave detriment and prejudice” to agricultural communities. The Bills cite an agriculture census of 2015-16 to argue that 86.2% of farmers own less than five acres — a majority of them less than two acres — and that with limited or no access to multiple markets, they would be handicapped while negotiating fair price contracts with private players. Making efforts to buy farm produce at less than the MSP or harassing farmers in a bid to persuade them to enter into such contracts have been sought to be made punishable offences, with a jail term of at least three years. The Bills also seek to overturn the Centre’s move to remove the fee on trade and transactions that take place outside markets functioning under APMCs. A key issue raised by Punjab’s proposed amendments is whether they are legally valid and where they stand in the teeth of the Centre’s legislation. States can indeed amend central laws enacted under the Concurrent List, subject to the condition that provisions repugnant to the parliamentary Acts will have to get the President’s assent, without which they do not come into force. The Punjab Bills note that agriculture is under the legislative domain on the States, as the subject falls under the State List in the Seventh Schedule. The Centre has enacted its farm sector Bills by invoking Entry 33(b) in the Concurrent List, which concerns trade and commerce in, and production, supply and distribution of, “foodstuffs”. By stretching the entry’s meaning to include agriculture, Parliament has managed to pass laws in the domain of the States. In these circumstances, States aggrieved by the farm sector laws will either have to go the Punjab way to adopt Bills that would require presidential assent, as Rajasthan has decided to do, or challenge the validity of the central laws in the Supreme Court, as Chhattisgarh is said to be considering. Whatever the outcome, clear from the groundswell of opposition across the country is that a cavalier and centralised approach to issues that affect millions of farmers ill-serves a diverse country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taking-on-the-centre/article32933873.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Hitting where it hurts||The Trump administration has once again tightened the screws on the country’s immigration system in a manner that is likely to directly impact Indian companies contracting with American firms for on-site work. This week the State Department proposed to stop issuing temporary or B-1 business visas relating to occupations normally classified as falling under the H-1B speciality or skilled visa category. The argument is that under the guise of the business-related entry of personnel, companies were sending their technology professionals for short-term stays to work on U.S. jobs, potentially undercutting the wages and employment prospects of U.S. workers. The proposed policy action, just ahead of the November 3 presidential election, is significant for following closely on the heels of other, similar moves to tighten restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals, including raising the minimum salaries payable to those applying for H-1B visas and to stop the issuance of such visas entirely until December 31, 2020. Taken together, it would be reasonable to expect a painful economic fallout on legal skilled migration from India. For example, the analysts predict that Mr. Trump’s June 22, 2020 ban on new H-1B visa issuance could impact up to 219,000 workers, who would be unable to take up potential jobs in the U.S. To date, there has been no retaliatory policy from India, at most perhaps diplomatic parleys where South Block has sought to emphasise that technology and innovation via the trade in services remain a key pillar of the bilateral strategic partnership and highly-skilled Indian professionals working in the U.S. help bridge the skill gap there, imparting a technological and competitive edge. In the backdrop of the steady clampdown on visa issuance is Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on protecting U.S. jobs from foreigners, especially in cases where lower wages drive substitution effects. The pressure on the White House to increase the cadence of the drumbeat for this form of “protectionism” has risen owing to the pandemic’s job-killing effects. U.S. joblessness spiked to an unprecedented 14.7% in April 2020. While it has dropped off since then, the country has entered the final phases of electoral campaigning, which has seen sharp attacks by Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Mr. Trump’s alleged failure to mitigate the economic crisis. When considered alongside the fact that Mr. Trump is steadily losing ground in federal and regional opinion polls, it is hardly surprising that areas of legal migration, including skilled workers entering the U.S. via the H-1B programme, have become policy targets for the White House. It would be wise for Indian IT firms and others seeking to send their employees to the U.S. for short-term work to assume that regardless of who wins the election, it will be a long time, if ever, before they can hope to return to business as usual.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/hitting-where-it-hurts/article32933874.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||No September green shoots for oil and gas production||The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent lower demand, continued to dampen India’s oil and gas production in September, with output shrinking sharply compared with a year earlier, as per official data released on Friday. The sharpest year-on-year contraction was recorded in natural gas production (-10.7%), followed by petroleum products (-9.49%) and processed crude oil (-8.8%). Crude oil output slid 6.05%. Between April and September, processed crude oil and petroleum products saw the sharpest decline from a year earlier — 20.3% and 16.3%, respectively.  Shy of targets All four product categories are significantly short of their production targets for the year. ONGC cited the shutdown of its Hazira plant following a fire in late September and the related closure of its western offshore gas wells apart from ‘COVID-19 implications’ delaying work on new sub-sea wells as reasons for a 6.84% drop in natural gas output. OIL, which posted a 13.4% fall in September, partly blamed low demand for gas from major customers. Private players such as Reliance Industries as well as joint ventures operating under the production-sharing contract regime, also cited COVID-19 as a reason for the 26.7% drop in September’s natural gas output.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/no-september-green-shoots-for-oil-and-gas-production/article32933865.ece
24 October 2020||MUMBAI,||‘Pandemic to delay EV expansion’||The COVID-19 pandemic would delay the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Indian auto industry, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra). Low affordability and the government’s priorities in reviving the otherwise suffering auto industry could shift the focus away from EVs in the interim, it said. “Passenger vehicles (PVs) would face a double whammy as consumers would be wary of buying a costlier EV than an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle while original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would refrain from incurring high capex,” the ratings agency said in a report. Stating that the growth in buses may take a back seat as orders for city buses are largely from State transport undertakings, and as State governments were already grappling with falling GDPs, it said two wheelers, especially scooters, could see an upside due to the lower pricing gap between an EV and ICE and several models available to consumers. “Though the EV penetration is likely to be faster in scooters, buses and three wheelers in the medium term (defined as three to five years), PVs may take longer.” Ind-Ra said the underlying challenges in the adoption of EVs such as higher battery cost and reliance on imports would prevail in the medium term, and robust government policies would remain key for the development of EVs in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pandemic-to-delay-ev-expansion/article32933858.ece

Supply boost Mr. Narayanan added that the quarter witnessed growth driven by an improved supply situation as Nestle’s factories returned to normal output. He pointed out that boosted by an increase in in-home consumption, key brands such as Maggi Noodles, Maggi Sauces, Kitkat, Nestle Munch, Nescafe Classic and Nescafe Sunrise witnessed double-digit growth. “We continued our strong performance in the e-commerce channels, which grew by 97% and now contribute about 4% of domestic sales,” he added.

24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre borrows Rs. 6,000 cr. for GST compensation||Kicking off its borrowing plan to meet the GST compensation shortfalls faced by States, the Centre on Friday borrowed and transferred Rs. 6,000 crore to 16 States as well as the Union Territories of Delhi and J&K. The government indicated that it planned to release Rs. 6,000 crore every week to the States till the approved borrowings to meet the shortfall are met. At this rate, it could take about 13 weeks or about three months to complete the envisaged borrowing. As of now, 21 States had selected the Centre’s option to borrow Rs. 1.1 lakh crore out of the total Rs. 2.35 lakh crore GST compensation shortfall estimated for 2020-21. With seven States — including Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab — yet to convey their acceptance to the Centre’s proposed solution to meet the GST shortfalls, the Finance Ministry has so far granted permission to raise about Rs. 78,500 crore to meet the shortfall pertaining to 21 States. ‘No shortfall for 5 States’ The Ministry on Friday said that five of these 21 States did not actually face any shortfalls in compensation receipts at this point. The approved borrowing limits for GST compensation shortfalls for five States —Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland — amount to just Rs. 739 crore. “Twenty one States and two UTs opted for this special window involving back-to-back borrowing coordinated by the Ministry of Finance. Out of these, five States did not have any shortfall on account of GST compensation,” the Ministry said, adding that the first tranche of borrowings was done on Friday and transferred to the remaining States and UTs. “The borrowing is at an interest rate of 5.19%. It is intended to make weekly releases of Rs. 6,000 crore to the States. Tenor of borrowing is expected to be broadly in the range of 3 to 5 years,” the Ministry said. Repayment from cess The interest on these borrowings, as well as the principal, is to be repaid from future GST cess collections, with the GST Council extending the applicability of the cess levied on sin or luxury goods over and above the highest GST rate of 28%, beyond the original deadline of June 2022. Earlier this month, the Centre had released Rs. 20,000 crore to States from GST compensation cess collections garnered so far this year. The States that received the first tranche of borrowed funds on Friday include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-borrows-rs-6000-cr-for-gst-compensation/article32933867.ece

In the previous week ended October 9, reserves had increased by $5.867 billion to reach $551.505 billion. During the latest reporting week, the rise in total reserves was due to a sharp rise in Foreign Currency Assets (FCAs), a major component of the overall reserves.

24 October 2020||Madrid,||Barca will look to hurt Real||Ronald Koeman will know Barcelona can plunge Real Madrid into crisis on Saturday but for him a first Clasico as coach is more about vindication. Inflicting a third consecutive defeat in a week on Madrid at Camp Nou would create the sort of turbulence for its opponents that Barca has grown only too used to in recent months. But as much as cranking up the pressure on Zinedine Zidane and gaining an early boost in La Liga’s title race would be welcome, Koeman might claim the biggest rewards from a victory. Middling start Barcelona’s new coach, appointed in August, has overseen a middling start to the season, with three wins, a draw and a defeat meaning the trajectory of his project is not yet clear. Most encouraging has been Koeman’s faith in youth, which has been repaid handsomely as Ansu Fati, Francisco Trincao and Pedri have all delivered more than expected in attack. So impressive has Ansu been that it would be a surprise if he is not in the starting line-up this weekend. But Trincao and Pedri would be braver calls, especially considering those they would replace. Pressing issue The most pressing issue of Koeman’s tenure is currently Antoine Griezmann, who is now on his third coach at Barcelona but still yet to find anything close to top form. “Antoine knows his situation. The only thing he can do is work hard to change it,” Koeman said. The merits of the decision will be defined by the result and in that regard, there will be scrutiny on Lionel Messi too, whose contribution is so often decisive. A positive performance against Madrid will give Barcelona momentum ahead of its trip to Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday. And for Koeman, the benefits would last even longer. Zidane, meanwhile, confirmed that capain Sergio Ramos is set to return from injury on Saturday. “He’s our captain, our leader. He’s over his injury, but obviously we won’t take any risks. He’ll be with us, you need players who are 100% fit and Sergio is,” Zidane told a news conference. Real will still be without a number of first team regulars, including Eden Hazard, Dani Carvajal, Alvaro Odriozola and Martin Odegaard. Intense scrutiny Zidane has come under intense scrutiny over the last week, with some reports suggesting his job might be at risk should it taste defeat in Catalonia. “I’ve won a lot with these players, they’ve won a lot for me and I’ll always be with them until the end, it’s they who battle, run and fight and I can feel their support,” he said. “But right now the most important thing is changing the dynamic, and we’ve got good games coming up to be able to do that in, and that’s what makes football so great. When things go wrong, you need to show your character and quality. “... I can’t deny people are saying my future is at stake, but it was the same last year and it was like that in my first spell here, too. I just need to do my job and forget about everything else.”  Antoine knows his situation.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||MI embarrasses CSK, leaves its campaign in ruins||After losing its last game in a humdinger that required two Super Overs, Mumbai Indians recovered well to produce a clinical display and thrash a hapless Chennai Super Kings by 10 wickets at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday. The victory was set up by its pacers, Trent Boult (4/18) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/25), who ran through the CSK batting line-up and restricted the side to 114 for nine. Ishan Kishan (68 n.o., 37b, 6x4, 5x6) and Quinton de Kock (46 n.o., 37b, 5x4, 2x6) then feasted on the CSK bowlers as the chase ended in just 12.2 overs. Ishan, in particular, was brutal against Deepak Chahar and Josh Hazlewood, clubbing the duo through the off-side at will. The win takes MI top of the table with 14 points, while CSK is all but out of the competition following its eighth defeat. Early jolts Kieron Pollard, who was leading Mumbai in the absence of an injured Rohit Sharma, asked CSK to bat first, and the decision proved correct from the first over. The two speed-merchants wreaked havoc in the first three overs by picking up four wickets. CSK could never really recover from there. In the first over, Boult removed opener Ruturaj Gaikwad leg-before with a delivery that swung in, after having set him up with a few that went across the right-hander. In the next over, Bumrah picked up two wickets off consecutive deliveries. First, Ambati Rayudu couldn’t control his pull against a well-directed bouncer and the ball lobbed up off his glove and into wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock’s safe hands. Then, Bumrah had N. Jagadeesan caught at slip, the latter playing away from the body. Prized scalp Boult then had Faf du Plessis caught behind as he went for an expansive drive. CSK had lost four wickets with just three runs on board and finished the PowerPlay with the score reading 24 for five. Sam Curran was the only batsman to show grit and fighting spirit, making a valiant 52 off 47 balls as CSK scored 114. The result was humiliating nonetheless.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/csks-cup-of-woes-overflows-suffers-eighth-loss/article32933974.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Pandey’s masterclass helps Sunrisers flatten Royals||On his day, Manish Pandey can be devastating with a bat in his hands. Rajasthan Royals was at the receiving end of his beautiful onslaught at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. Chasing what looked like an under-par target of 155, his unbeaten 83 (47b, 4x4, 8x6) helped Sunrisers Hyderabad post an eight-wicket win after three straight defeats. His 140-run stand for the unbroken third wicket with Vijay Shankar (52 n.o., 51b, 6x4) ensured RR had little chance after Jofra Archer had made early inroads. The chase had begun disastrously as Archer extended his stranglehold over Warner, removing him with the fourth ball of the innings. The delivery moved away to take the outside edge and Ben Stokes justified Steve Smith’s decision to have a second slip with a diving catch. It was the sixth time in the last seven innings that Archer had dismissed the Australian. Archer dealt another severe blow in his next over, this time with a ball that came back in sharply, at 149kmph. It was too good for Jonny Bairstow, who was bowled through the gate. Pandey stroked the ball well from the beginning, hitting two boundaries off Kartik Tyagi. In the following over, he smashed two sixes off Ben Stokes. Pandey timed his shots well and paced his innings wonderfully.   Sunrisers 118 for two  Sunrisers were 118 for two in 15 overs, with Pandey (69) and Vijay Shankar (31) at the crease.

24 October 2020||Chennai,||It’s difficult when three or four batsmen are not doing well: Dhoni||CSK’s fate is all but sealed and the team is likely to miss the playoffs for the first time following the crushing 10-wicket submission to MI. The ageing squad has hurt the team, and in the aftermath of the defeat, skipper M.S. Dhoni and coach Stephen Fleming both indicated that the team would use the remaining three matches to try out youngsters and build for the future. Speaking after the match, Dhoni laid the blame on the batting unit for the team’s disastrous performance this year. “Our batting wasn't turning up. [Ambati] Rayudu got injured and the rest of the batsmen weren't there. “Cumulatively when three or four batsmen are not doing well, it becomes difficult. Whenever we did not get off to a good start, it kept getting difficult for the middle-order.” Fleming conceded that losing big players like Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh before the start of the tournament affected the team as well. “There is a lot of hurt and frustration that goes along with a disappointing season,” the Kiwi said. “We have not been able to put a [proper] game together. “We lost players before the tournament started and whatever we have tried has not worked. Today, the game was over after PowerPlay. We now just want to finish strongly.” Dhoni revealed that other members of the team would get chances in the remaining three games as a way of preparing for IPL 2021. “We need to have a clear picture for the next year...the kind of auction, where the venues will be. The upcoming three games will be ideal to give a platform for the youngsters to perform,” said Dhoni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-difficult-when-three-or-four-batsmen-are-not-doing-well-dhoni/article32934623.ece
24 October 2020||London,||Frank Lampard looking for big personalities||Frank Lampard on Friday urged his Chelsea players to step up and show leadership as he seeks to fast-track his Stamford Bridge revolution. Chelsea, which travels to face Manchester United on Saturday, welcomed six major signings during the summer transfer window following a £220 million ($287 million) spending spree. Bold approach Winger Hakim Ziyech this week pledged to be true to his outspoken nature, and Blues boss Lampard said he welcomed such a bold approach. New No. 1 goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has explained how a spell without a club and claiming unemployment benefit shaped his career. Asked if strong personalities off the pitch can help players thrive on it, Lampard replied: “Yes, I certainly think it can help. I certainly want to help grow the ideas of leaders within the group, personalities within the group. “Within the course of long, difficult seasons where we play so many games there will be moments when you rely on them to help you in tough times, and also to push the good times along, and to try and improve every day. “I don't think you can get on in elite sport, in any elite team sport, with people without any personality and character in your team.” Lampard said Ziyech and Mendy had impressed him since walking through the door. “Hakim has confidence about him and his fitness is coming on individually and he still needs time to get up his match fitness now his knee injury has cleared up,” he said. Great additions “Both of those will be great additions on that front and I encourage personality and communication between players. We need more of that.” Senegal stopper Mendy has already forced his way to number-one status at Stamford Bridge, following his £20 million transfer from Rennes last month. The 28-year-old was likely to start Saturday's match at Old Trafford but is now a certainty after Kepa Arrizabalaga was ruled out with a shoulder problem. Former Ajax winger Ziyech has made two substitute appearances and Lampard admitted coronavirus protocols made it more difficult for players to regain full fitness. “It is very difficult because we have a bubble here at Cobham so we can't play against the under-23s or bring across the kids to replicate 11 versus 11 games on big-side pitches,” he said. “You generally want people to be working when you are not playing for five or six months off the back of an injury. So we missed that, he's missed that. “We have to try and find the right way to give Hakim minutes in the right way and others in the squad.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/frank-lampard-looking-for-big-personalities/article32934823.ece
24 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Morris effusive in praising Padikkal||Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) all-rounder Chris Morris hailed teammate Devdutt Padikkal as the ‘future of Indian cricket’. Opener Padikkal, RCB’s second highest run-scorer in the tournament after Virat Kohli, bears resemblance to former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden, Morris added. “Devdutt has been incredible. He has an imposing way of batting, similar to Matthew Hayden. Devdutt does not have Hayden’s physical size, but he has a similar technique with the way he hits the ball. He is a great athlete, which is important. He is the future of Indian cricket,” Morris said, in a media interaction on Friday. Washington hailed The South African had high praise for other Indian players in RCB as well. “Washington Sundar is coming into his own now. It feels like he has been playing IPL since he was 13 (laughs). Washington has the ball on a string,” Morris said. “I was with (Navdeep) Saini during my time with Delhi Daredevils. Saini was a net bowler then. I couldn’t believe that he wasn’t playing because he was bowling at rocket speed. It’s great to see him become an India international now.” On Siraj, the hero in Wednesday’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders, Morris said, “Siraj worked hard with Dale Steyn to get his seam position right. To see Siraj execute that in the match was incredible. Work rate “The impressive thing about the Indian fast bowlers is their work rate. They just bowl, bowl and bowl.” With nine wickets in five matches, at a terrific economy rate of 5, Morris is another vital part of the RCB bowling unit. The 33-year-old is returning from an injury which forced him to miss the early stage of the tournament. Hard graft “I got the injury while batting. I played a shot and tweaked a stomach muscle. It was the first time I got an injury like that. The medical staff and I worked very hard to set it right. “I had to wake up every two hours at night to get on the rehab machine. It was four weeks of hard graft,” Morris said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/morris-effusive-in-praising-padikkal/article32933849.ece
24 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||Knight Riders meet Capitals, aim to stay afloat||Delhi Capitals will expect more from its batsmen when it takes on Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday after an underwhelming performance against Kings XI Punjab in its previous game. Capitals opener Shikhar Dhawan has been in brilliant form, but even his record-setting hundred was not enough to save the side from defeat against KXIP. Skipper Shreyas Iyer has not been hitting the ball as fluently as he used to. Rishabh Pant, who made a comeback from injury against Punjab, has not yet set the stage on fire. Pacer Anrich Nortje, who has been instrumental in Capitals’ superb run thus far along with South African compatriot Kagiso Rabada, had a niggle and missed the last match against KXIP. KKR is heading into the contest after a poor batting performance against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Pacer Lockie Ferguson’s performance has been the only bright spot for the side which is still coping with the disappointment of Andre Russell’s poor run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kkr-meets-capitals/article32933965.ece
24 October 2020||Dubai,||A battle for survival in the race for the playoffs||Its campaign back on track with a hat-trick of wins, Kings XI Punjab will take on another resurgent team — Sunrisers Hyderabad — here on Saturday in a must-win game for the two well-matched sides. KXIP and SRH have eight points each after 10 games, but the Hyderabad outfit is a rung ahead by virtue of a better net run rate. And, both teams need to win their remaining four games to boost their playoff chances. Strong line-up After initial hiccups, KXIP got its campaign on track with wins over Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore. While KXIP’s batting is in the safe hands of skipper K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle and Nicholas Pooran, the shaky form of Glenn Maxwell remains a concern. Jimmy Neesham’s inclusion has given some depth to KXIP’s batting as well bowling. SRH managed to keep itself in the play-off hunt with a confidence-boosting eight-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals on Thursday after three consecutive defeats. Good news The positive for SRH is that despite David Warner and Jonny Bairstow departing early in the 155-run chase against RR in its last match, Manish Pandey (83) and Vijay Shankar (52) rose to the occasion with an unbeaten, match-winning stand. Jason Holder’s inclusion has added firepower to SRH’s bowling attack as the West Indian picked up three wickets for 33 against RR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-battle-for-survival-in-playoff-race/article32933968.ece
24 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||It was do-or-die for me, says Vijay Shankar||Sunrisers Hyderabad all-rounder Vijay Shankar, who put up an impressive performance in the win against Rajasthan Royals on Thursday, says it was a do-or-die game for him. “I have not had the best of times with the bat, had to perform. ‘Luckily or unfortunately’, we lost early wickets. The team decided to send me up the order and I am happy to have helped the team win,” Vijay said at the post-match media interaction. Lots of overs On his bowling, Vijay said the most important thing was to bowl a lot of overs. “I had not done that in previous games. And, it is good to see the captain have the belief in you and give the sixth over in the Power-Play and take up the responsibility,” he said. On the match-winning partnership, Vijay said Manish Pandey was hitting the ball really well. “Initially, it was important for me to have a feel of batting out there in the middle as I had batted just 18 balls before this innings. So, the objective was to stay at the wicket and then I opened up with a few boundaries,” he said. “It was all about good communication and staying till the end. This win should give a lot of confidence for the coming games,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-was-do-or-die-for-me-says-vijay-shankar/article32933853.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||A precious gem||Thirumoolar in his Thirumandiram talks of Lord Siva’s Supremacy, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. The Agamas elaborate on His qualities. None of the celestials is equal to Him. No human being is equal to Him either, thus making Him head of the celestials and humans. He is Lord of all the worlds. Without Him, none of the celestials can carry out their duties. No penance will be fruitful if one does not realise Him. Golden hued Siva is a father and a mother to those who see Him as such. He is the One who creates everyone and everything. Manickavachagar in his Thiruvachagam, Anda paguthi, says Siva is the ancient One (pazhaiyon) who created everything. In the Piditha pathu section, Manickavachagar addresses Siva as his mother and father. He describes Siva as a precious gem, and as nectar that results from love. He says he inhabits a body that will perish. He therefore holds on to Siva, who has granted him jnana. Just as Thirumoolar refers to Siva as the golden hued One, so does Sundarar, in his Ponnaar meniyane verse. Thirumoolar says that the long-haired Siva is hotter than fire, and yet when He gives, He is cooler than water. He keeps away from those who have not understood His qualities. His grace is only for those who love Him. If one sees the idol of Siva as God, then one earns His mercy. He is always present beside His devotees. Saiva Siddhanta says that one can follow four paths to reach Siva, namely sariyai, kiriyai, yogam and jnanam. Sariyai is caring for all living things, serving in temples, serving His devotees. Getting spiritual instruction through a guru and worshipping Him is kiriyai. Doing yoga, meditation and reaching God is yogam. Passing through the first three stages and then realising that Siva is the ultimate One is jnanam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-precious-gem/article32933954.ece

24 October 2020||Portimao (Portugal),||Bottas ends both practice sessions on top||Max Verstappen and Lance Stroll collided in an eventful second practice for the first Portuguese Grand Prix in 24 years on Friday while Valtteri Bottas set the pace for Formula One champion Mercedes. The afternoon saw two red flag interruptions, first when AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly pulled over with his car in flames and then when Red Bull’s Verstappen and Racing Point’s Stroll smashed into each other. “I was so surprised that he just turned in while I was coming up to him. I don’t know where I had to go,” said the Dutchman, who refused to apologise for his language. “It was just very unnecessary.” Racing Point boss Otmar Szafnauer saw it differently: “I can assure you 100% that Max knew Lance was there... but Lance doesn’t know Max was there. It’s pretty simple for me.” Both drivers were summoned to stewards. Verstappen still ended the day second fastest, half a second slower than Bottas, with Mercedes’ six-times World champion Lewis Hamilton second in the morning and then eighth after lunch. McLaren’s Lando Norris was third in the afternoon, ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. Bottas was quickest in both morning and afternoon, continuing a habit of leading the way on Fridays, with an overall best time of one minute 17.940 seconds around the undulating Algarve circuit near Portimao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bottas-ends-both-practice-sessions-on-top/article32933841.ece
24 October 2020||Paris,||Perfect start for Spurs||Tottenham posted an opening 3-0 victory over LASK of Austria in its Europa League campaign on Thursday but Celtic suffered another setback with a home 3-1 loss at the hands of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s AC Milan. There were also wins for Spurs’ Premier League rivals Arsenal and Leicester. Carlos Vinicius started in place of the resting Harry Kane and he made goals in either half for Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min. Leicester made the perfect start in Group G with a comfortable 3-0 win over Zorya Luhansk of Ukraine. In Glasgow, Celtic struggled against Serie A leader AC Milan, which was 2-0 up at half-time thanks to goals from Rade Krunic and Brahim Diaz. Earlier, Arsenal came from behind to down Rapid Vienna 2-1. After a goalless first half it went behind when keeper Bernd Leno fluffed a clearance on a night he will want to forget. But the Gunners then turned the game around in four second half minutes.  Important results:   Group B: Rapid Vienna 1 (Fountas 51) lost to Arsenal 2 (Luiz 70, Aubameyang 74).   Group C: Bayer Leverkusen 6 (Amiri 11, Alario 16, Diaby 61, Bellarabi 79, 83, Wirtz 87) bt Nice 2 (Gouiri 31, Claude-Maurice 90).   Group G: Leicester City 3 (Maddison 29, Barnes 45, Iheanacho 67) bt Zorya Luhansk 0.   Group H: Celtic 1 (Elyounoussi 76) lost to AC Milan 3 (Krunic 14, Diaz 42, Hauge 90+2).

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Our past was real, truthful and prickly’||The world of Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy is a familiar one for Mira Nair. The auteur’s latest project has been the beautiful BBC show based on the 1,349-page tome. “It was 1951,” Mira says over a video call from the US. The filmmaker, who turned 63 on October 15, continues, “It was the year my parents got married. My father was a civil servant; he moved from Punjab to Orissa. I have lived in that time in a very real way. It is an era I have known, smelt, enjoyed and loved.” From Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996) and Vanity Fair (2004) to Amelia (2009), Mira has worked on period dramas. “I do not set out to make a period drama. For me, it is quite the reverse. It is how to make a period drama, not feel period at all. How to make it breathe with life and with the unpredictability of life and yet be true in every single detail, to the time it was. Making A Suitable Boy was about how to sift through the modern mayhem of current Indian life, away from the frame.” Making A Suitable Boy was a huge, monumental and joyful task, says Mira. “I always saw it as cinema, so the horizons were vast and there was great depth of field. In the scenes with the Ganga, with the boats and the ghats, we are seeing three or four levels into the horizon. We had to change everything — from the house, ships and the sails to what fishermen and pilgrims wore. I hope people feel the pulsation of life of the era. In Maheshwar, this lovely village by the Narmada where we shot Barsaat Mahal, there were these beautiful old streets. The people who lived there looked like they belonged to the landscape. In the homes that we filmed in Lucknow, I cast the retainers, who had worked in those homes for 20, 30, 40 years because they looked like a part and parcel of that place. All this adds to the authenticity and to the sense of it brimming with life.” Tanya Maniktala plays Lata, whose mother wants to find her a suitable boy and Ishaan Khatter plays Maan, who is in love with the completely unsuitable Saeeda (Tabu). Both are practically newcomers. “I am unafraid of casting first timers. I have to see the spirit of the character in the person, that they have what feels to me like the essence of the character.” A dewdrop in action “For instance, I could see the mercurial and charming Maan in Ishaan. It was not fake it was coming from within. It was the same with casting Tanya. A Suitable Boy rests on her shoulders. I call Lata a dewdrop in action. She is on the brink of life, she hasn’t seen everything yet. But she is also intelligent and very self-possessed. Lata has a certain innocence, of observing without fully knowing what life has to offer.” Mira is grateful to her casting directors, Dilip Shankar, Nandini Shrikent and Karan Mally . “They cast all my films. This was a one-year casting process. This is the first international show that is entirely cast and made in India, because I insisted on it.” The script, however, was written by Britisher Andrew Davies. Would not a South Asian script writer have been a more apt choice? “To be honest, yes, but I came to the party a little later when Andrew had already been picked and eight hours of script written. I loved his distillation. Andrew gave it the television pace that we needed. I wanted to shift the emphasis to being a marriage of the politics of the time and the personal journey of Lata and Maan and not have just a Pride and Prejudice kind of vibe of who will she marry. Lata and Maan were the embodiment of modern India — of that India of 1951.” Does that mean upper caste, middle class, educated families were representative of the larger Indian experience of the time? “Oh, no,” Mira clarifies. “India is based in the hinterland. But Vikram Seth’s story is resolutely set in the anglicised, privileged class. Even though several classes are depicted, the major characters are ‘English-soaked’. I wanted to bring out the truth of these characters. The characters are who they are as Vikram wrote them.” Interwoven cultures While Mira has joked about A Suitable Boy being Crown in brown, one wonders what part nostalgia plays in the appeal of the show. “It was important for me to hold a mirror to what India used to be at that time—politically and emotionally. Despite the wounds of Partition, there was still a deeply syncretic and interwoven culture between Hindu and Muslim, from the poetry and music, to the friendships and the great loves. That absolutely inextricable tapestry is being threatened today. The young of today will not have any idea of how it could have been. My mother used to say ‘ savere hum Id manate the or shaam mein Diwali …’ [we would celebrate Id in the morning and Diwali in the evening]. That is not going to be remembered if we are not careful. Our past in A Suitable Boy was real, truthful and prickly. It was not nostalgia for its own sake, but about holding a mirror so that the young of today can remember a time from whence we came.”  A Suitable Boyis currently streaming on Netflix.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/our-past-was-real-truthful-and-prickly/article32934531.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||A remake that is original||They are cut from the same cloth, driven by their own ideologies. One comes from a position of privilege and is with the State, while the other is a messiah to the oppressed. But what sets them apart is, one is bound by the conventions of law and order, the other is not. Kamal Haasan’s DCP Adhi Narayanan and Nassar’s Badri, leader of a militant outfit, gave an edge to the PC Sreeram-directed Kuruthipunal , making its proceedings contemplative rather than it being a regular case of a cat-and-mouse game. There is a general anger against the system at fault that creeps into the narrative. Sreeram agrees that the anger and resultant feeling of being dwarfed by the system were what attracted him towards remaking Kuruthipunal . “In that sense, it is a very personal film to me. If you look at the photographs we had used in the first scene, we were angry with what had happened in the country then,” says Sreeram over phone, “The anger in me was a reflection in my shots; the camera was always in close proximity with the subject. I don’t have a theory behind it, but this was the way I wanted to tell the story.” Tight budget, tighter schedule Kamal and Sreeram were in Bombay when veteran filmmaker Govind Nihalani invited them for the screening of Drohkaal , starring Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah.The film evoked a feeling inside of Sreeram, which he could not express then and even now. Kamal’s immediate response was to remake Drohkaal in Tamil and asked Sreeram what he thought. “That’s the best thing to do,” he said on a whim.  When the film released a year after its Hindi counterpart in 1995, the response it got was overwhelming. It was ultimately chosen as India’s entry for the Oscars that year, but was not nominated. “We all know the process one must go through to make it into the final list. For me, it [Oscars] was not a big deal. Although you could say that Kuruthipunal had the intensity of a Hollywood film,” he adds. The bigger deal, for Sreeram, was when Govind Nihalani came for the première and called it “a remake that is original”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-remake-that-is-original/article32934533.ece

There is a black board and we sit on the floors and learn together.” Anamika teaches English, Malayalam, German and Hindi. “I have put together a time table. While the young ones learn alphabets, I teach lessons from textbooks to older students.” All her students are aged between six and 13. “I follow a few basic rules. The students have to be punctual. They should wear masks and maintain social distancing,” she explains. After classes, there are sessions on storytelling, folk songs and art and craft. “We observe butterflies and flowers and learn about biodiversity. Then, we play till evening,” she says. Anamika says that when she has online classes, her father Sudheer M who is a folk singer takes over. She also receives help from Shymala D, a local teacher who volunteers there. Ente Naatile Smart Class also provides mid-day meals for students. “My mother cooks our meals every day,” she says.

A virtual walk through the kolu, set up at the residence of S Mohanraj in Pappanaickenpalayam, narrates stories such as those about the woodcutter and the axe and the monkey and the crocodile. “This year, I set up a kolu based on as many as 30 fables for children to ensure a joyful learning experience for them as they have been away from school because of COVID-19. They are always eager to learn more,” says Mohanraj. Every year, during Navaratri, he dresses up his collection of over 4,000 dolls and displays them on over 57 wooden steps for the public. And there are new additions every time as he sources a variety of dolls from places like Cuddalore, Panruti, Madurai and Kumbakonam. Mohanraj wants to reach out to children and give them a peek into our glorious past, culture and traditions. “Last year, 5,000 students from various schools accompanied by their teachers visited the kolu. This time, we have restricted the numbers to ensure social distancing. Children now turn up with their parents.” There are displays on farming, village scenes with elders seated on thinnai and dolls themed on traditional art forms like Karagaatam , Oyilaatam and Mayilaatam , and games like pallankuzhi and thaayam . There is an entire section about vegetable sellers, goldsmiths at work, and people at a brick kiln and those engaged in pottery. “There are dolls on personalities, on the Indian Army and Navy, women who excel in various fields, Adivasi tribes, fishermen at sea, to name a few,” says Mohanraj.

One of them, that shows the bird and snake with their eyes interlocked, moments before striking, stands out: It was commended under the Birds Behaviour category in Wildlife Photographer of the Year award from London’s Natural History Museum, announced last week. “This is a prestigious award and I’m thrilled,” says the 36-year-old who is an IT manager. It had started out as a regular day of birding for Sambath that day; he recalls heading to the outskirts of Chennai with his daughter and a friend. The sun was about to set and the light was falling when he saw them. “The five-foot long rat snake had coiled around the eagle’s tail and feet,” he recalls. It had seemed like the eagle was losing the battle. “It struggled,” says Sambath. By then, Sambath had begun clicking away his camera. “These are the kind of moments you dream of capturing as a photographer,” he says. “But it was challenging; it was almost 6.15 pm and the lighting was poor.” Minutes in, the eagle and the snake were about to strike each other at the same time. “The eagle won, of course,” says Sambath. After all, its main diet consists of snakes. Sambath hopes that his award creates awareness on the importance of the grassland ecosystem. “As our cities expand at a drastic pace, we must remember to preserve our waterbodies,” he says. Grasslands around waterbodies, Sambath explains, are crucial for snakes to survive. “And snakes keep rats, that are pests for farmers, in check,” he says, adding, “If this chain is broken, the entire cycle will go for a toss.” Sambath adds that all these seemingly “small things, are interlinked” and contribute to climate change. Another aspect that Sambath wants to highlight is that, while people travel thousands of kilometres to see and photograph wildlife, they often miss out on what is in their backyard. “There’s so much to explore locally,” he feels. The photo won him the award, sums up Sambath, due to a combination of factors. The most important of them was simply “being at the right place at the right time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/eye-of-the-eagle/article32934549.ece

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Yesterday once more||For a spell of instant magic in the good old days, I often used to visit a corner of Chawri Bazar, near the Metro Station. This was a place called Ashok Chat Corner, and it sold the most delicious papri-chaat that you could ever imagine. There was a time, years ago, when women of the neighbourhood would sit on their little murhas by the chaat counter once they had a free hour or so. They would have a nice chatty session while they dug into their bhalla papri and popped golgappas . That was, of course, a long time ago, when there was hardly any traffic. Now you can’t think of sitting anywhere on the road in Chawri. Worse, you can’t think of going there either, in these COVID-19 times. I had really been missing my Old Delhi sojourns. And then I heard about a great service that had started in the city. A platform called Old Delhi Foods delivers food from Old Delhi to you. I went to the website and found that they bring food from eateries such as Chaina Ram, Shyam Sweets, Kuremal, Lotan Kulchey Chholey Wallah, Shiv Misthan Bhandar, and Natraj. They will get you fried parathas from Parathey Wali Gali, chicken kali mirch from Al Jawahar and butter chicken from Aslam. And they even deliver food from old favourites that are not in Old Delhi, such as Ashok and Ashok Meat Wallah in Sadar and Sitaram Chholey Bhaturey in Paharganj. We had some friends coming over one day, so I asked for four plates of papri chaat (Rs. 135 a plate) from Ashok, and dal urad fry (Rs. 210), paneer butter masala (Rs. 230) and baigan bharta (Rs. 205) from Shakahari in Chandni Chowk. With shipping and handling charges of Rs. 150, I paid a total of Rs. 1,335. The rates, I think, are a little higher than what the eateries charge. Orders and payments have to be done online (via olddelhifoods.com; 7289938122 and 9311734330). The service is now only available in Delhi, and for a minimum order of Rs. 900. The chaat was as good as it used to be. I love Ashok’s chaat for its balanced flavours — nothing is too sweet or too tangy or too hot. They use yellow chilli powder, which is pungent but not red hot. Freshly roasted and ground cumin adds to the taste, as does a pinch of rock salt. The chaat was well packed. Each ingredient — papri, bhalla , curd, saunth (sweet red chutney), boiled chholey , potatoes, kachalu and masala had been packed separately. I mixed them together, and the chaat disappeared before I could say, ‘Have some more.’ I was, however, a bit disappointed with the Shakahari fare. I have had some great meals there, and there is nothing quite like having their dal and sabzi with delicious besan rotis. Shakahari, also in Chawri Bazar, is known for its urad dal . But this time I found it a bit too runny. The paneer , again, was in a buttery sauce that didn’t quite work for me. The bharta tasted good; the brinjal had been roasted well. Of course, the food was all cooked in desi ghee, so the flavours were nice. Old Delhi Foods, I must say, is doing a great service. Can’t go to Old Delhi any more? Fret not — it will bring Old Delhi to you! The writer is a seasoned food critic||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/yesterday-once-more/article32934709.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s a mootu point||Eindhoven in the Netherlands is seeing a surge in visitors, albeit virtually. The 19th Dutch Design Week has kicked off and people are logging on to check out over 500 exhibits in 3D viewing rooms. Think light installations with discarded lenses, living coffins (with mycelium) and textiles woven by drones. But it is an exhibit at the Dutch Invertuals Gallery’s True Matter show that we are interested in. Equal parts eye-catching and confusing, the Mootu Lounger by Chennai-based design firm, The Architecture Story, is shaped like a ‘U’ and strung with moulded leather pieces. Is it furniture or art? Can one sit on it? Turns out, designers and partners Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar welcome such questions. “We wanted to take design as an opportunity for divergent thinking,” says Jawahar, 35. “The point was to think of different ways that a body can interact with an object, and the Mottu Lounger plays with perception and interaction.” Also, though you may not see it immediately, the conceptual design has its origin story in the mridangam , the main percussion instrument in the Carnatic music ensemble.  Giving sound form  A few months ago, Invertuals had challenged 22 young designers from 17 countries to work with raw materials from their local context, and to play with techniques, craftsmanship and traditions. “We thought it would be interesting to explore music and design — not in a direct way, but through tectonics [the method of bringing things together] of music creation,” says De Penning, 33, while her husband Jawahar adds, “During our research, we found that [Indian physicist and Nobel Prize winner] CV Raman’s light scattering experiments were inspired by Indian percussion instruments. So we wondered, could it lend itself to design as well?” While debating how to break away from regular modes of understanding form, the duo decided to look at the mridangam . Something that was representative of ‘place’, of Tamil Nadu. “We visited mridangam makers in Mylapore [an area synonymous with Carnatic music] and different parts of Chennai, and learned that the mootu [the moulded leather that covers the two mouths of the instrument] is used for three to four years and then discarded. So it is a generational craft that doesn’t have an afterlife,” explains Jawahar. They took home a number of mootus to experiment with — deconstructing it, immersing it in water, shaping it with another object. “For the final piece, we used the techniques and tectonics of the mridangam to create the story we wanted,” he says.  Walking parallel worlds  This meant working with mridangam makers, hand-cutting 14x4 circular leather pieces, puncturing 48 holes around the circumference (the size of the circles and the number and position of the holes are derived from the mridangam mootu ) and knotting them with ropes. “When designing the framework, we did look at bringing in sound. The shape of the ‘U’, if filled with sound, allows for a certain movement,” De Penning tells me. But the desire to create a minimal translation had them deciding not to confuse the architectural framework with a sonic element. The third piece of furniture from the three-year-old firm — the earlier two include a table made from marble, granite and metal, and a metal origami chair — the piece will not be mass produced, but they are open to commissions. As for the artisans, early suspicions about whether the duo was working on a new musical instrument have since turned into enthusiasm for more such experiments. “It was exhilarating,” Jawahar says. “Through August and September, in the mornings we would have these intellectual discussions on design with the gallerists and designers, and [later in the day] go to Mylapore to collect the mootu and talk with the artisans. As designers, we were at the intersection of these two worlds. It pushed us to relook at TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and the parallel worlds we are living in.”  The Dutch Design Week is on till October 25.Details: ddw.nl||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/its-a-mootu-point/article32934526.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Movie night at FDCI’s India Fashion Week||Just like artists, fashion designers are bad liars. They can drape you in luxurious silks and velvets, make flowers grow from mere fabric, and sculpt statues with corsets and capes, but they cannot hide their hearts. Their work is, and must always be, seen in context of the time and place in which it is created. So how did the first digital RTW fashion week in India — the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (LMIFW) organised by the FDCI — fare on this scale? Creatively, it passed with flying colours, even while painting a bleak vision. The collections, reader, are the first ones designed and produced within the timeline of the global Covid-19 pandemic. This is a sobering first. And they came together to tell a story, which I will do my best to tell you. The opening show In the beginning, there was the Pandemic. And discarded oxygen cylinders as tall as people were seen everywhere. Models in Rajesh Pratap Singh (61.9K views) walked among them in hospital-white smocks and shirt-dresses, raised necklines covering half their faces. Multicoloured patchworks became block-printed and foiled tunics, as if some enterprising, post-apocalyptic tailor had taken beautiful scraps from the artisans of Jaipur to preserve the art. The young label Bloni (30.6K views) proposed an Industrial style for going out in small groups. Slick, easy separates with reflective finishes and the glamour of oversized sequins showed the way the new generation of influencers would dress to impress. The mood in Delhi though, according to Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra’s collection for S&N (58.7K views) , had changed entirely. In the past, India had been a Democracy. But in 2034, the ‘High Chancellor’, ‘Cabinet Leaders’, and the ‘Head of the Imperial Secret Service’ ruled with an iron fist — dressed in martial uniforms, a design discipline that our former colonisers, the British, once prided themselves over. Asymmetric drapes, fluid capes, camp sunglasses, and military caps, all festooned with make-believe badges, braids, and epaulettes: these became the modern military regalia for those who never did enlist. And an AI took over the running of the country. Dangerous times Meanwhile, out on the streets, turf wars looked like a crossover between Namrata Joshipura’s modern Matrix (48.7K views) and Siddhartha Tytler’s Mad Max: Fury Road (38.6K views) . The standoff: Joshipura’s slick, sequined, tiger-striped jackets and feather-embellished capes, chain-mail like shifts and pearl-encrusted noise-cancelling headphones, against Tytler’s hood rats in reflective jacquard suits and neon-quilted bombers, designed to warn off others in the dark of night. At Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna (86.9K views), the overlords and ladies gathered in underground clubs to toast their success and survival in high Black Tie: embellished tuxedos and metal-sequined gowns à la Underworld . The rich, though, seemed unaffected. Draping themselves in digital prints of Renaissance masterpieces from Shivan & Narresh (35K views), and dressed in tiered gowns from Nidhi Yasha (23.7K views), they escaped — mentally, physically, and because they could — to seaside locations. This follows a very real phenomenon seen in recent months, of people from the twin capitals escaping to Goa. Delhi may be the political power center and Mumbai the business core, but this quaint southwestern Union Territory has become the Pandemic Capital of India. Those who live here dress in bright colours, riotous prints, and opulent fabrics, reminding themselves that there is something good in the world. Still, the days continue to dawn, and everyone needs a light touch. So a few remained to provide hope. Like Varun Bahl (44K views) , with his delicate dedication to flowers. Made with fabric and sprinkled judiciously onto silken slip dresses and kimono-inspired wraps, these miniature artistic blossoms evoked nostalgia for a generation that actually remembered better times. At Gauri & Nainika (41K views), flowers became prints, and grew into oversized blooms covering the entire body in petals of silk and organza and taffeta. Solidarity train Like the end of any post-apocalyptic movie, the global south, represented by Africa, also had its moment this season. Ashish Soni, who spent his growing-up years in Zambia’s Kitwe province, took on this task. Zambia may be one of Africa’s safest nations today, but when Soni was there, he remembers living behind steel reinforced doors, with guard dogs on duty. Six of them. As his digital show began (32.8K views), a note clarified that it was not a human rights campaign, but a personal pledge towards the inclusion Black people deserve in the fashion community. Did what followed reflect Soni’s intentions? With a cast of exclusively Black models walking to voice recordings of speeches by Black leaders and victims, it seemed to, at least at that level. But the clothes — slick tonal jacquard jackets, deconstructed textures on bombers, layered skirts worn over sneakers and leggings — seemed somewhat accidental to the narrative. And the question still lingered, as it does at the end of such movies, if this was really the beginning of a New World Order.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Varana and the travelling trench coat||Varana, the sustainable luxury Indian fashion brand that’s garnering a cult following internationally, recently introduced e-commerce and debuted its collection to the wholesale trade in Italy. It is the next step — after the Bengaluru-based company opened a four-storey flagship store in London’s Mayfair in 2017 — in their goal to make a big impact abroad. Its pared down silhouettes, quality fabrics and handwork detailing have won favour with buyers, including the likes of celebrated boutiques Blu (Capri), Sam Tessabit (Como), and Popp & Kretschmer (Vienna). Antonio Arcucci, the owner of Blu, says he likes the brand “both for the quality of the garments and its clean, refined look”. Varana also had plans to show in New York, London, and Paris (now cancelled because of the pandemic). Still, “it was a good start because in Italy people know and understand fashion and high quality, and we were well received,” says Sujata Keshavan, Varana’s co-founder and creative director, via telephone. Saskia Terzani, who consults on business strategy (she was instrumental in taking the Victoria Beckham brand global) and oversaw the brand’s Milan debut at the chic fashion venue Hotel Diana, tells me that buyers flipped dresses from underneath to look at the stitch inside. “Their hands touched the fabric; it is old school, but in Italy there is a real appreciation for fabric,” she says. The brand is also set to meet with Harrods and Selfridges in London.  A quiet joy  Much as pioneering Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake did in the 1980s — bringing their clothes, and their culture, to the attention of the West — Varana’s bold ambition is to showcase the finest Indian craft techniques in contemporary styles. “We don’t have many fashion brands in international markets because a lot of luxury Indian wear is traditional and focussed on the local market,” says Keshavan. “India is not a famous destination for luxury although we do a lot of beautiful work for other western brands [think Versace, Gucci, Prada].” She and fellow co-founder Ravi Prasad set out to rectify that, marrying indigenous handwork with functional, refined designs. Keshavan describes this design philosophy as a ‘quiet joy’, confident in its simplicity yet imbued with fine details. Citing the example of Hermès and The Row for their prized tailoring and fabrics, the founding duo hope to propel Varana into that league. With silk shirts retailing for Rs. 40,000, cashmere trousers for Rs. 69,000, and a silk organza trench for Rs. 1,64,339, its price points reflect its high-end positioning. Prasad, who headed The Himalaya Drug Company for years, says, via Zoom, that Varana is “intentionally positioned at a price level that the quality commands. When we sold in Milan, I asked Saskia if the buyers asked about it and she said that, uniformly, they thought the prices were appropriate.” But recognising that entry-level price points could help build business, Varana recently launched a line of organic, craft-infused cotton T-shirts, priced at Rs. 11,908. For those not in London, the company absorbs shipping and duty costs from website sales to ensure pricing parity worldwide.  Global inputs  Today Varana has 75 employees, with two manufacturing units in Bengaluru, and works with eight to 10 craft clusters around India — including West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Ladakh. But five years ago, it was a different scenario. Keshavan and Prasad both come from a non-fashion background. “We had no clue as to how this business works,” says Prasad, with a laugh. But they knew they had to find people with international expertise. They hired Stefano Arienti, an Italian with years of experience at Prada and Louis Vuitton, to set up the back-end operations. Arienti’s attention to detail included adjusting the tension in each hand operated tailoring machine so that running stitches turned out accurately. It paid off. Prasad says that while Varana’s units take longer to produce a garment, their rejection rate is only 0.1%. As far as plans for India go, the company would love to retail here but says the current offering needs to be tweaked for local customers. For a start, the weather conditions are different to those of the West. Plus, Indian consumers want visible value for money, and it remains to be seen if Varana’s lack of embellishments on simple silhouettes at a high price point find enough followers here. The company, meanwhile, may do a few trunk shows to test the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/varana-and-the-travelling-trench-coat/article32934530.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Drawing a new start line||Given its overwhelmingly white and masculine makeup — “pale, stale, male” — when the Oscars announced new diversity rules last month, they were largely welcomed. The Academy said it hoped to not just reshape how movies are awarded, but also who makes movies and what stories are told. Amidst the bouquets, there were also a predictable number of brickbats from critics who trotted out the usual arguments against affirmative action — arguments extremely familiar to us here and brought up against reservations of all kinds.  The Academy’s website had comments that said: “It’s no longer about cinema. Now it’s about politics.” Another said: “Forced diversity lowers quality.” Actor Kirstie Alley raged: “It’s impossible to ‘police’ quotas as a prerequisite for a ‘best’ picture.”  For me, sitting here in Chennai, there was a moment of déjà vu. Not so long ago, I was listening to an acquaintance, a senior manager in a multinational banking company, fume about the fact that they had recently been mandated to promote a certain number of women to the executive cadre to meet the company’s diversity rules. The manager’s objections were that first, she thought these women were not good enough to be promoted. Second, she resented having struggled to reach the top while these women would get a free pass.  On the face of it, these sound like rational objections, but actually they contribute to the entrenched inequality. Both women assume that the absence of ‘quotas’ means a preservation of the highest quality standards. But one look at the Oscar’s long history of awarding mediocrity shows the fallacy of this assumption. If Gary Oldman can win the Oscar for hamming it as Churchill or Around the World in 80 Days can win in a year when Seven Samurai was released, then quality is not exactly being upheld.  Rank bad performances regularly make the red carpet, so let’s not pretend that diversity rules alone will open the floodgates to less than stellar stuff. At any rate, so what? Let an imperfect film made by a Romani director win the statuette — it’s not going to ruin cinema any more than awarding it to Rocky did.  In offices too, incompetent men, duds and dullards can be seen at all levels, including in leadership positions — positions where nothing but brilliance will be accepted from women. The office is men’s grazing ground — their actions and rewards, their foibles and follies all part of an ancient, well-oiled, and mutually beneficial ritual. Women have a lot of catching up to do to own this space, and that can happen only when there are enough of them for long enough. If diversity rules push a few women up the ladder even when they aren’t fully qualified, it’s a beneficial exercise. It goes on to create a large pool of female experience, confidence, mentorship and lineage that men have enjoyed for centuries.  I recently saw a brief experiment conducted by a teacher in an American school. He lined up a bunch of students for a race but before blowing the whistle, he asked those from a certain income group to step 50 metres forward; then those who were second-generation educated; then those who had libraries at home; and so on. Soon, many of the white students had advanced halfway down even before the race had begun. The entry barriers to the race are so high for some that they must be allowed to jump a few steps and meet the others at a fresh start line. It’s not a guarantee of success but it gives them a fighting chance in a game that the established contestants have been playing for eons. Forced diversity is invariably the first step to real diversity — whether in cinema or in workplaces. And we need to embrace it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/drawing-a-new-start-line/article32934478.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||ikaiasai.com||When Ikai Asai launched at Maison Et Objet, Paris, in January this year, there was no indication of what was to come. Their plans to retail small-batch products that “help consumers rediscover local craftsmanship and the artisanal industry”, as CEO Kanupriya Verma describes it, was put on hold during the lockdown, and revived at London Craft Week last month. The site went live in early October, featuring four collections of tableware, serving utensils and cutlery, made using traditional methods and material. Verma was part of the team that brought out Ananya Birla’s CuroCarte, a site that curates decor from around the world. With Ikai Asai (which translates to ‘one’ in Punjabi and ‘desire’ in Tamil), the focus was on creating an artisanal lifestyle brand that would help revive crafts that are fast declining. The Deva line, for instance, was drawn from architect Dharmesh Jadeja in collaboration with Longpi pottery artisan Matthew Sasa from Meghalaya. It also featureskansawork (bronze), resulting in a gold and black collection of vases, napkin rings, dinner plates and bowls (above). Designer Rina Singh, founder of Eka, brings her minimalist aesthetic to block-printed table linen and ceramic hand-dyed platters in a range called Lila (seen below). For barware, furniture designer Ayush Kasliwal created Kama , a line made entirely of amethyst. Architect and interior designer Ashiesh Shah worked with Channapatna artist Noor Salma to put together six-foot-tall totem poles that work as art pieces, as well as Junoon tableware with wooden beads. The site features beautiful product images and a much-appreciated quick view that kicks in when a cursor is scrolled over it (and a single tap if you’re on the mobile site). But overall navigation still remains a bit confusing. If you are looking to browse by collection, head to the ‘Mood’ tab. However, only select items are listed when you try to shop from this page.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||maalgaadistore.com||The eclectic design store tucked away in the bylanes of Besant Nagar might be downing its shutters soon, but its founders are continuing their journey online. With the soft launch last week, the e-store currently lets visitors wishlist their products and will allow orders next week. Regulars might recall the brand’s earlier site, shop.maalgaadistore.com. Well, co-founder Shahin Ansari explains that it was discontinued a few years ago as they “wanted to focus on the physical space”. Plans to revive the website were always on the cards, but the Covid-19 crisis pushed them to finally get it up. Unlike the former site, which focussed more on home decor than garments, the new fashion-centric digital store will have everything from trench coats and leather sandals to drop pendant chains and Jodhpuri drum bags. Over the years, Ansari has curated shows with an unusual mix of emerging brands from across the country. So we are hopeful. For now, large images greet you on the home page, but we expect photos from multiple angles for a better experience, and a few tweaks to the navigation. “Our focus is on sustainable labels and brands that source ethically. Of the 15 designers featured, eight are ethical labels that focus on handwoven, handspun fabrics,” she says, adding that their curation included picking brands from the existing roster — Mati, Anushe Pirani, Fahd Khatri — and adding new ones. Since the soft launch, they are seeing jewellery, primarily earrings, and Indo-western festive wear being added to buyer wishlists. The site is set to launch on October 28. Rs. 1,500 onwards for jewellery and Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 80,000 for apparel.  Up next: A capsule collection, Earth Pants, that is inspired by the elements of nature. Crafted using Karunganni cotton, a new line of trousers will be launched every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/maalgaadistorecom/article32934486.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||rooshadshroff.com||Architect-designer Rooshad Shroff has been toying with the idea of a website for years now. It wasn’t until lockdown gave him the “luxury of time” that he and his team buckled down to the task. Clean is what comes to mind when you log on. A stunning photograph of one of his projects (a revolving format ensures a new one every time you visit) gives way to a minimal page with just three options — Spaces, Installations, Objects — in crisp black lettering. “I wanted an absolutely fuss-free website, as sterile as possible, so that navigation is easy. There is already a lot of pattern and colour in my work, so, instead of a big graphic design exercise, I wanted the attention to be on the individual piece or project,” he says. With its grid and list view options, the site is designed like a catalogue. (It is price on request at the moment; for price tags, wait for the Shop feature to go live.) Each entry comes with a detailed write-up, a scroll-through gallery, and an option to download the spec sheet. “The website, launched on October 2, is an introduction to the versatility of our design studio,” he says. “Many people know us only for our furniture or our Hermès windows, and not so much for our architecture projects and events.” More interactive elements like videos would have helped, but Shroff believes “if you repeat the same things from platform to platform, it won’t work”. So making videos and the like will be reserved for his Instagram.     Up next: The Shop will go live soon (right after his physical gallery opens in Mumbai next month). Expect carved marble lights, candle holders, inlay plates and more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/rooshadshroffcom/article32934488.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Gin’s young blood||The pandemic aside, 2020 has to be the year of the ginprenuer in India. With barriers to gin-making (at least in small batches) incredibly low, many young ginto sippers — who grew to love the globally-trendy spirit while studying or working abroad — are settling in sunny Goa, where ‘spirited’ laws are at their friendliest and distilleries are for hire. This year, India stands at the cusp of a boom thanks to six craft gins launched in the last few months alone. And there are at least a dozen more in the pipeline (with a few expected to release next month). It would seem that if you have about Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore, a recipe and a taste for juniper, there is no stopping you. Gin is shining. Incredibly, three years ago, Indian gin did not exist. Then Greater Than, Hapusa and Stranger & Sons found a gap in the market, between the well-made, big international brands priced upwards of Rs. 2,000 and the cheaper cold-compound gins (made by infusing artificial or natural flavours without distilling) priced at Rs. 300-Rs. 400. Their success in bars, as well as the social media-fuelled rise of gin-drinking culture, gave a fillip to a market which, though miniscule in absolute numbers (gin accounts for only 1% of spirits consumed in India), is bursting with potential. Is this then a coming-of-age for gin in India? The kind that London witnessed in 2016-2018, when the category grew by a whopping 44% (year on year) and numbers shot up to almost 100 home grown brands? The hashtagged excitement around the new brands and their experiments with botanicals as diverse as Goan cashews and hemp (legal and non-psychoactive) would suggest this. It comes with a caveat though. “This creativity is great but I hope all new spirits are quality because this is still a nascent category. Customers should experience well-made gin from India instead of getting used to inferior quality, which can ruin the market,” cautions Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Nao Spirits that had launched Greater Than in 2017, the first made-in-India gin in the London dry style.  Spirited dialogues  Many of the new ginprenuers are in their early or mid 20s, full of passion and plans. Their liquor comes in fun bottles — topped by Channapatna ‘corks’ or reminiscent of our school water bottles. Samsara (that hashtags itself #contemporaryindiangin), one of the new spirits produced in a spanking new Margao distillery, is a project by 26-year-old UCLA alumnus Aditya Aggarwal, who had a stint with Price WaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles. “As we entertained clients at trendy restaurants and bars, I was exposed to a creative dining culture and to gin,” he says. So taken in was he with the global gin renaissance that he moved to London, its epicentre, to study distillation. Samsara is infused with quintessential Indian scents such rose, cardamom and vetiver. But his interest goes beyond merely retail. He hopes his distillery and its adjoining lab, Spaceman Spirit Lab (named after his company), will become a collaborative space for fellow gin enthusiasts and professionals — enabling custom-made gins, experiments with botanicals, and even fun experiences for birthdays and weddings. Priced at Rs. 1,450 for 750 ml in Goa, Samsara is set to go to Mumbai this year, and then to the US, says Aggarwal, who invested Rs. 25 lakh from his personal funds, received seed funding of Rs. 60 lakh, and is now looking to raise $1 million to further the venture. Then, there are the likes of Gin Gin, by 24-year-old Shubham Khanna. He experimented with 40 recipes over the last two years, before settling on “India’s first hemp craft gin”. Meanwhile, Jin Jiji, another new made-in-Goa gin, has cashew as a botanical for a smoother mouth feel, says its maker, Ansh Khanna, 27. Launched last year and primarily made for export, it is present in 21 states in the US, a market Khanna knows well having studied viticulture at UCLA and worked with a wines and spirits distributor in Chicago. This year, he has experimented with a series focussed on single-estate Darjeeling tea as a botanical. “Both wine and tea depend on terroir. I wanted to extend this idea to gin,” he says, adding that there are plans to do an entire series on various tea regions, from Assam to Coonoor.  Botanicals as storytelling  With the explosive growth in gin around the world attributed to experimentation by young, creative distillers, it is but natural that there should be a tension between what gin really is — the traditional English spirit led by piney notes of juniper, and governed by stringent laws — and the more ‘free spirit’, where individual makers choose diverse flavours to tell stories that appeal to local palates. This is a big debate internationally. Dr Anne Brock, master distiller at Bombay Sapphire, who gave up medicine to work in bars, was appointed The Gin Guild’s grand rectifier last year (the first woman to hold the job). Brock admits to this being a tightrope. “I believe it is important that juniper remains the core, but we may need to relax and encourage difference. Gin is a global spirit with different botanicals and styles, and consumers are interested in the people who make their gin, its provenance and story.”  How viable is it?  While the current burst of creativity is welcome, industry watchers such as Vikram Achanta of Tulleeho, providers of beverage education and training, question the depth of the market as well as the potential of many players to go all-India. “The barriers to entry are quite low in Goa so anyone with a recipe can make a gin. But what does it mean to make 1,000 bottles or cases? The real test will come only when they exhibit deeper pockets to go national, into challenging markets such as Delhi or Andhra Pradesh,” says Achanta. Anand Virmani, co-founder of Greater Than and Hapusa, however, is bullish about these new experiments. He argues that gin at the higher end of the spectrum has been registering 40-50% year-on-year growth in India in the last two-three years. “The UK went from a £750 million market to £3 billion between 2014 and 2018. What is to stop India from following the same curve?” he asks. This year, despite lockdowns, has seen phenomenal growth in retail sales for gins, stores across metros report. So the glass is only half full.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/gins-young-blood/article32934522.ece

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Movie night at FDCI’s India Fashion Week||Just like artists, fashion designers are bad liars. They can drape you in luxurious silks and velvets, make flowers grow from mere fabric, and sculpt statues with corsets and capes, but they cannot hide their hearts. Their work is, and must always be, seen in context of the time and place in which it is created. So how did the first digital RTW fashion week in India — the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (LMIFW) organised by the FDCI — fare on this scale? Creatively, it passed with flying colours, even while painting a bleak vision. The collections, reader, are the first ones designed and produced within the timeline of the global Covid-19 pandemic. This is a sobering first. And they came together to tell a story, which I will do my best to tell you.  In the beginning, there was the Pandemic. And discarded oxygen cylinders as tall as people were seen everywhere. Models in Rajesh Pratap Singh (61.9K views) walked among them in hospital-white smocks and shirt-dresses, raised necklines covering half their faces. Multicoloured patchworks became block-printed and foiled tunics, as if some enterprising, post-apocalyptic tailor had taken beautiful scraps from the artisans of Jaipur to preserve the art. The young label Bloni (30.6K views) proposed an Industrial style for going out in small groups. Slick, easy separates with reflective finishes and the glamour of oversized sequins showed the way the new generation of influencers would dress to impress. The mood in Delhi though, according to Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra’s collection for S&N (58.7K views) , had changed entirely. In the past, India had been a Democracy. But in 2034, the ‘High Chancellor’, ‘Cabinet Leaders’, and the ‘Head of the Imperial Secret Service’ ruled with an iron fist — dressed in martial uniforms, a design discipline that our former colonisers, the British, once prided themselves over. Asymmetric drapes, fluid capes, camp sunglasses, and military caps, all festooned with make-believe badges, braids, and epaulettes: these became the modern military regalia for those who never did enlist. And an AI took over the running of the country. Meanwhile, out on the streets, turf wars looked like a crossover between Namrata Joshipura’s modern Matrix (48.7K views) and Siddhartha Tytler’s Mad Max: Fury Road (38.6K views) . The standoff: Joshipura’s slick, sequined, tiger-striped jackets and feather-embellished capes, chain-mail like shifts and pearl-encrusted noise-cancelling headphones, against Tytler’s hood rats in reflective jacquard suits and neon-quilted bombers, designed to warn off others in the dark of night. At Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna (86.9K views), the overlords and ladies gathered in underground clubs to toast their success and survival in high Black Tie: embellished tuxedos and metal-sequined gowns à la Underworld . The rich, though, seemed unaffected. Draping themselves in digital prints of Renaissance masterpieces from Shivan & Narresh (35K views), and dressed in tiered gowns from Nidhi Yasha (23.7K views), they escaped — mentally, physically, and because they could — to seaside locations. This follows a very real phenomenon seen in recent months, of people from the twin capitals escaping to Goa. Delhi may be the political power center and Mumbai the business core, but this quaint southwestern Union Territory has become the Pandemic Capital of India. Those who live here dress in bright colours, riotous prints, and opulent fabrics, reminding themselves that there is something good in the world. And the question still lingered, if this was really the beginning of a New World Order.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Varana and the travelling trench coat||Varana, the sustainable luxury Indian fashion brand that’s garnering a cult following internationally, recently introduced e-commerce and debuted its collection to the wholesale trade in Italy. It is the next step — after the Bengaluru-based company opened a four-storey flagship store in London’s Mayfair in 2017 — in their goal to make a big impact abroad. Its pared down silhouettes, quality fabrics and handwork detailing have won favour with buyers, including the likes of celebrated boutiques Blu (Capri), Sam Tessabit (Como), and Popp & Kretschmer (Vienna). Varana also had plans to show in New York, London, and Paris (now cancelled because of the pandemic). Still, “it was a good start because in Italy people know and understand fashion and high quality, and we were well received,” says Sujata Keshavan, Varana’s co-founder and creative director, via telephone. Saskia Terzani, who consults on business strategy (she was instrumental in taking the Victoria Beckham brand global) and oversaw the brand’s Milan debut at the chic fashion venue Hotel Diana, tells me that buyers flipped dresses from underneath to look at the stitch inside. “Their hands touched the fabric; it is old school, but in Italy there is a real appreciation for fabric,” she says. The brand is also set to meet with Harrods and Selfridges in London.  A quiet joy  Much as pioneering Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake did in the 1980s — bringing their clothes, and their culture, to the attention of the West — Varana’s bold ambition is to showcase the finest Indian craft techniques in contemporary styles. “India is not a famous destination for luxury although we do a lot of beautiful work for other western brands [think Versace, Gucci, Prada],” says Keshavan. She and fellow co-founder Ravi Prasad set out to rectify that, marrying indigenous handwork with functional, refined designs. Keshavan describes this design philosophy as a ‘quiet joy’, confident in its simplicity yet imbued with fine details. Citing the example of Hermès and The Row for their prized tailoring and fabrics, the founding duo hope to propel Varana into that league. With silk shirts retailing for Rs. 40,000, cashmere trousers for Rs. 69,000, and a silk organza trench for Rs. 1,64,339, its price points reflect its high-end positioning. Prasad, who headed The Himalaya Drug Company for years, says, via Zoom, that Varana is “intentionally positioned at a price level that the quality commands. When we sold in Milan, I asked Saskia if the buyers asked about it and she said that, uniformly, they thought the prices were appropriate.” But recognising that entry-level price points could help build business, Varana recently launched a line of organic, craft-infused cotton T-shirts, priced at Rs. 11,908. For those not in London, the company absorbs shipping and duty costs from website sales to ensure pricing parity worldwide.  Global inputs  Today Varana has 75 employees, with two manufacturing units in Bengaluru, and works with eight to 10 craft clusters around India — including West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Ladakh. But five years ago, it was a different scenario. Keshavan and Prasad both come from a non-fashion background. “We had no clue as to how this business works,” says Prasad, with a laugh. But they knew they had to find people with international expertise. They hired Stefano Arienti, an Italian with years of experience at Prada and Louis Vuitton, to set up the back-end operations. Arienti’s attention to detail included adjusting the tension in each hand operated tailoring machine so that running stitches turned out accurately. It paid off. Prasad says that while Varana’s units take longer to produce a garment, their rejection rate is only 0.1%. As far as plans for India go, the company would love to retail here but says the current offering needs to be tweaked for local customers. For a start, the weather conditions are different to those of the West. Plus, Indian consumers want visible value for money, and it remains to be seen if Varana’s lack of embellishments on simple silhouettes at a high price point find enough followers here. The company, meanwhile, may do a few trunk shows to test the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/varana-and-the-travelling-trench-coat/article32934567.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Networked like a ‘jalebi’||Kusum Lata Sharma is an art practitioner and researcher in Bhopal, which is often referred to as a city of lakes. A few years ago, she began a contemporary art series ‘Water Hyacinth’. Having worked on a 100 paintings in the series, she asserts that art has to reflect reality — in this case, disruption of ecological balance. A few paintings from the ‘Water Hyacinth’ series are on view at Kalakriti Art Gallery till November 8, and the gallery’s website (kalakritiartgallery.com). The ongoing exhibition ‘Through the Looking Glass: New Voices in Contemporary Art’ dips into the diverse viewpoints and techniques of emerging contemporary artists. “At first, the water hyacinth appears beautiful, glistening in the sun rays. Soon, it takes over the water body and the aquatic life is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. I’ve tried to convey this dichotomy, using symbolism and abstraction,” says Kusum. She compares this takeover of the water hyacinth to the rampant urbanisation in cities where the quality of life takes a hit. Protyusha Mitra, Balagopalan Bala, Nishant Dange, Sumit Banerjee, Uday Goswami, Ekta Sharma and Divya Patwa are among the many featured artists. The mixed media sculptural installations by Aishwarya Sultania deserve a mention. She has been working extensively with wood, carving or etching them, and at times using them as part of a larger work. In ‘Network’, she rethinks the ‘six degrees of separation’ in a contemporary, shrinking world where people are interconnected more than ever before. The ‘jalebi’ symbolises the network. Artist Ekta Singha looks back at the past — her family lineage that can be traced to a royal Rajput family — and on the other hand, reflects her journey of sharing a hostel room while studying art. An image of mattresses piled up in the hostel room is from her series on everyday life. The paintings of French artist Claire Lono who lives in Auroville, Puducherry, are meditative as she depicts her own transformative, spiritual journey in calming hues of sky blues and sea greens. Smita Gupta’s flowy textures are a result of she allowing the fluidity of the colours (alcohol ink on paper) guide her as she paints: “My work is never pre-planned,” she says.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||One for the road||Masks and sanitisers. Check. Food and water. Check. A good playlist for the road. Check. Bike, car or cycle in good condition. Check. If you’re planning to head out of Hyderabad during a weekend, once the aftermath of the recent deluge paves way for better times, factor in extra time at the toll gates. The rush at the toll plazas has got to do with bikers and families heading out of town for a quick getaway from their WFH (work from home) routines. Air and train travel aren’t as safe as they were during the pre-COVID era, and being home-bound for months hasn’t been too enticing. The last few weeks have witnessed more Hyderabad folks heading out of town to visit nearby destinations. The months of lockdown and COVID-19 safety concerns have made us appreciate the little joys more than ever. International adventure trips or the luxury of infinity pools can wait, there are many destinations to explore within 200 kilometres from the city. You are likely to find bikers along the Vikarabad highway, or families in cars heading towards the scenic Kondapochamma Sagar Reservoir in Siddipet district. These road trips also hark back to simpler times of carrying food and water from home for picnics. Some of the highway dhabas are open for business, but packing food is a good idea if you want to be cautious and avoid the crowds. Before the pandemic, fashion designer Vyshnavi Reddy wouldn’t have thought of Rajeswara Rao Pet as a much-needed getaway from the bustling Hyderabad. “I thought I might get bored with village life but I enjoyed it during a recent trip. The facilities are basic for someone who is used to urban life, but this time I didn’t mind it at all,” she says, referring to a short stay at a family-owned house replete with old-world archways and deewankhana . “There’s a lot of open space where my son could play and we could observe the rural lifestyle at a leisurely pace,” she adds. Rajeswara Rao Pet is in the Karimnagar zone, and the family also visited nearby spots like the Manair Dam. With shorter distances, there’s scope to break free from the desk-bound routine and step up physical activity. Ask the cyclists of Hyderabad. Some of them head out on solo rides or in groups of two to four. Sanjay Yadav got tired of being homebound and cycling only in the neighbourhood, and decided to cycle to Ananthagiri Hills, the round trip coming up to 191 kilometres. “The countryside was clean and green thanks to monsoon showers. We took lesser-explored routes and travelled through villages,” he shares. Armed with masks, sanitisers, food and water, the journey began around 4.30 a.m. and he reached Ananthagiri Hills by noon. “If you begin early and there’s less traffic, you can return home by 5 p.m.,” he adds. An avid cyclist, he had always led an active lifestyle. During the pandemic, he decided to prioritise health all the more and took up this trip. Fellow cyclist Rajeev Kalwa is eagerly looking forward to the brevet season (rides of 200 kilometres upwards) organised by cycling associations in the country. Meanwhile, Rajeev has been exploring scenic routes in and around Hyderabad. The ORR service road loop, Medchal highway and Shankarpally are among his favourites. He also recommends the route leading to Narsapur forest area, the path near Ramappa Lake in Warangal, and the 18-kilometre loop around the Kondapochamma Sagar reservoir. “There aren’t many tourist buses on the highways and the rides have been safe so far. For 100 to 200 kilometre rides, we pack sandwiches or parathas from home,” he says. Fancy a longer drive by car? The Konaseema belt has always been a tourist hotspot. Bhargavi Bijjam, an IT professional and an advocate of eco-conscious living, chose a staycation at Dindi, Konaseema, when she wanted a break from WFH schedule. She wanted to unwind but also not cross paths with too many people. The family drove down to Dindi, packing food and water to ensure they didn’t halt by roadside eateries too often. “The Sarovar Portico resorts hadn’t yet opened their online booking but we took a chance. They were happy to welcome us and we spent time Nature-watching. My friends who saw my Instagram stories asked if I was in Kerala. I told them these are backwaters of Andhra Pradesh,” she recalls with a laugh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/one-for-the-road/article32934590.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Heritage, alone no more||Before the deluge of rains hit Hyderabad, one could drive along Salar Jung Road and take in the eerie quiet of the stately eponymous museum. Salar Jung Museum is one of the many historical hubs in the city that has had to endure a lonely time — no curious visitors or resident researchers ambling through the high-ceilinged hallways — through the lockdown. Unlock 5 saw the opening of tourist sites including museums but the footfall numbers are controlled. Still, any footsteps through these halls are a happy sound. Plus, museums are more on the pulse than many realise; they’ve shifted many of their archives online in a multimedia format. It is only right that come UN World Day for Audiovisual Heritage (October 27), we take stock of the past that is being preserved for posterity. Offering a nod to this transition Nagender Reddy, the museum’s director says, their priority is to keep people informed of what is at the museum, and that must not forget that museums and these points in time are very relevant, especially during a pandemic which is also a historic event. One of the proponents for this shift is Google Arts & Culture (GAC), which showcases various ‘Cosmology to Cartography’ exhibits from Kalakriti Archives, as well as a few of Salar Jung Museum’s exhibits, such as ‘1601 - 1900: Textile Treasures: Shawls and Sarees’ and ‘501 AD - 2019: A Game of Thrones - How Chess Conquered the World.’ According to analytics, from June through to August, there was an average of 500 visits per day, whereas before the lockdowns, each day would observe single-digit views. Nagender is pleased with this, calling the long-time collaboration with GAC “a success in its own special way.” However, Simon Rein, GAC’s Program Manager, maintains their intention is not to take profit opportunities away from these institutes but rather be a temptation of sorts to sustain relevance during a time of shorter attention spans. “We want visitors, be they local or global, get a feel of how each institute is unique and bookmark these places for offline visits.” Big investments Of course, through GAC and website-led virtual tours, one cannot enjoy the multi-sensory feel of a physical walkthrough but there are perks to the tech boosts. Before the pandemic, many museums had some forms of distancing between object and visitor. For example, miniature paintings have always held allure and GAC leverages Machine Learning to help virtual visitors zoom in on these paintings in ways they could not do in a museum itself. In fact, on October 22, GAC announced a partnership with the National Museum, New Delhi. Simon Rein explains how Art Camera, GAC’s ultra-high-resolution robotic camera, was deployed to produce the most vivid images of historical masterpieces, adding, “Using these images, we’ve created over 75 in-painting tours to help you stop and appreciate details like wisps of smoke from firecrackers, or see the finesse and variety of every person’s attire in this royal procession — flourishes that you wouldn’t be able to see well with the naked eye.” Did museums have to change their business model during the lockdown? Nagender states they always offered virtual tours but no virtual walkthroughs. However, online ticketing in the form of a paywall requires further investment. But he is optimistic for the spotlight ahead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/heritage-alone-no-more/article32934597.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Back in the game||In September, when some of the staff of Haiku returned to the city from their home towns, after six months, they found that the open-air Asian-themed restaurant at Jubilee Hills hijacked by pigeons. Though cleaning seemed like an impossible task, there was a smile on the faces of the staff and Suma Chereddi, Haiku’s owner. Come October, Suma is thrilled to see a family of 21 celebrate a birthday on four different tables (due to social distancing). As per Unlock 4.0, hotels, restaurants and bars are thinking of inventive ways to welcome back customers, despite the ongoing pandemic. As rooms at ITC Kohenur booked up again — this time for staycations — the hotel revived its lavish Sunday brunch spreads with whatever resources were available. Having used the lockdown to calzones, pizzas and cheesy garlic bread to its menu, the team at Feranoz is loving the response. “On most weekends, we are sold out on our food menu. The comeback is good and hopefully we will all stay safe and continue to support each other’s businesses,” says co-founder Ameen Barazandeh. Path to recovery Dineout, a reservation and restaurant tech platform, has recovered 60% of its pre-COVID business. Delhi, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad are moving rapidly towards normalcy, with a 70% recovery rate projected to be achieved in this festive quarter, followed by Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur and Hyderabad with a 55% recovery rate. The growth curve can be credited to restaurants leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the safety of their customers and staff. They are promoting QR Code-driven digital menus, and digital payments, to minimise contact and optimise business. In fact, at Marigold, for the hilsa food fest, customers are pre-booking tables. Abhishek Dhar, General Manager of Marigold Hotel, says, “This is absolutely thrilling for the staff after not having served guests for over five months.” Caterer Rahul Sharma reflects, “Business may not be at 100%, instead it is at 50-60% but that is a positive feeling for the economy. Customers don’t mind the mask and are probably enjoying the less crowd, we just want our lives back.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/back-in-the-game/article32934600.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Gin’s young blood||The pandemic aside, 2020 has to be the year of the ginprenuer in India. With barriers to gin-making (at least in small batches) incredibly low, many young ginto sippers — who grew to love the globally-trendy spirit while studying or working abroad — are settling in sunny Goa, where ‘spirited’ laws are at their friendliest and distilleries are for hire. This year, India stands at the cusp of a boom thanks to six craft gins launched in the last few months alone. And there are at least a dozen more in the pipeline (with a few expected to release next month). It would seem that if you have about Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore, a recipe and a taste for juniper, there is no stopping you. Gin is shining. Incredibly, three years ago, Indian gin did not exist. Then Greater Than, Hapusa and Stranger & Sons found a gap in the market, between the well-made, big international brands priced upwards of Rs. 2,000 and the cheaper cold-compound gins (made by infusing artificial or natural flavours without distilling) priced at Rs. 300-Rs. 400. Their success in bars, as well as the social media-fuelled rise of gin-drinking culture, gave a fillip to a market which, though miniscule in absolute numbers (gin accounts for only 1% of spirits consumed in India), is bursting with potential. Is this then a coming-of-age for gin in India? The kind that London witnessed in 2016-2018, when the category grew by a whopping 44% (year on year) and numbers shot up to almost 100 home grown brands? The hashtagged excitement around the new brands and their experiments with botanicals as diverse as Goan cashews and hemp (legal and non-psychoactive) would suggest this. It comes with a caveat though. “This creativity is great but I hope all new spirits are quality because this is still a nascent category. Customers should experience well-made gin from India instead of getting used to inferior quality, which can ruin the market,” cautions Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Nao Spirits that had launched Greater Than in 2017, the first made-in-India gin in the London dry style.  Spirited dialogues  Many of the new ginprenuers are in their early or mid 20s, full of passion and plans. Their liquor comes in fun bottles — topped by Channapatna ‘corks’ or reminiscent of our school water bottles. Samsara (that hashtags itself #contemporaryindiangin), one of the new spirits produced in a spanking new Margao distillery, is a project by 26-year-old UCLA alumnus Aditya Aggarwal, who had a stint with Price WaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles. “As we entertained clients at trendy restaurants and bars, I was exposed to a creative dining culture and to gin,” he says. So taken in was he with the global gin renaissance that he moved to London, its epicentre, to study distillation. Samsara is infused with quintessential Indian scents such rose, cardamom and vetiver. But his interest goes beyond merely retail. He hopes his distillery and its adjoining lab, Spaceman Spirit Lab (named after his company), will become a collaborative space for fellow gin enthusiasts and professionals — enabling custom-made gins, experiments with botanicals, and even fun experiences for birthdays and weddings. Priced at Rs. 1,450 for 750 ml in Goa, Samsara is set to go to Mumbai this year, and then to the US, says Aggarwal, who invested Rs. 25 lakh from his personal funds, received seed funding of Rs. 60 lakh, and is now looking to raise $1 million to further the venture. Then, there are the likes of Gin Gin, by 24-year-old Shubham Khanna. He experimented with 40 recipes over the last two years, before settling on “India’s first hemp craft gin”. Meanwhile, Jin Jiji, another new made-in-Goa gin, has cashew as a botanical for a smoother mouth feel, says its maker, Ansh Khanna, 27. Launched last year and primarily made for export, it is present in 21 states in the US, a market Khanna knows well having studied viticulture at UCLA and worked with a wines and spirits distributor in Chicago. This year, he has experimented with a series focussed on single-estate Darjeeling tea as a botanical. “Both wine and tea depend on terroir. I wanted to extend this idea to gin,” he says, adding that there are plans to do an entire series on various tea regions, from Assam to Coonoor.  Botanicals as storytelling  With the explosive growth in gin around the world attributed to experimentation by young, creative distillers, it is but natural that there should be a tension between what gin really is — the traditional English spirit led by piney notes of juniper, and governed by stringent laws — and the more ‘free spirit’, where individual makers choose diverse flavours to tell stories that appeal to local palates. This is a big debate internationally. Dr Anne Brock, master distiller at Bombay Sapphire, who gave up medicine to work in bars, was appointed The Gin Guild’s grand rectifier last year (the first woman to hold the job). Brock admits to this being a tightrope. “I believe it is important that juniper remains the core, but we may need to relax and encourage difference. Gin is a global spirit with different botanicals and styles, and consumers are interested in the people who make their gin, its provenance and story.”  How viable is it?  While the current burst of creativity is welcome, industry watchers such as Vikram Achanta of Tulleeho, providers of beverage education and training, question the depth of the market as well as the potential of many players to go all-India. “The barriers to entry are quite low in Goa so anyone with a recipe can make a gin. But what does it mean to make 1,000 bottles or cases? The real test will come only when they exhibit deeper pockets to go national, into challenging markets such as Delhi or Andhra Pradesh,” says Achanta. Anand Virmani, co-founder of Greater Than and Hapusa, however, is bullish about these new experiments. He argues that gin at the higher end of the spectrum has been registering 40-50% year-on-year growth in India in the last two-three years. “The UK went from a £750 million market to £3 billion between 2014 and 2018. What is to stop India from following the same curve?” he asks. This year, despite lockdowns, has seen phenomenal growth in retail sales for gins, stores across metros report. So the glass is only half full.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/gins-young-blood/article32934580.ece

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Style up your sofas||In these days when everyone’s under house arrest, the sofa seems to be the mainstay of every living room. Whatever type it may be — Chesterfield, modular, Lawson-style, sectional, mid-century modern or camelback — this piece of furniture is where you sit, perch, check your phone, chat with friends and family or get your telly fix. If you love your sofa but a bit bored of the way it looks, may we suggest a few quick ways to jazz it up? Toss a throw Throws add casual chic and look perfect when tossed carelessly over the back of a sofa. Opt for a mohair one if you’re seeking warmth or a fur piece to add a touch of Hollywood glam. Dump the pillows Almost every other sofa is topped by an assortment of pillows. Stand out from the crowd by placing just one simple cushion — a longish one — on the sofa. Stylish! Bring in a blanket What could be better than a warm plaid blanket draped over the side of the sofa? It adds a punch of colour and is just what you need to wrap around yourself on a cold, rainy night. Try a shawl If the blanket seems a tad too much for Indian winters, why not get out your soft cashmere or pashmina shawl? It adds a stylish touch without focussing too much on the wintry feel. Change the covers This one’s a no-brainer but we suggest you keep your throw pillows as they are and spend a couple of hours in the afternoon working on the covers — a satin bow here, some sequins there, a lick of fabric paint somewhere. Voila! Replace the seat covers If the sofa seems a bit off colour, why not add a quirky touch by getting the roadside tailor to stitch some slip covers for the seat cushions? You could opt for patterns if the sofa is plain, look for solids if the sofa has patterned upholstery. Explore interesting accessories Placing planters, a lamp, a stack of books, etc. by the side of the sofa ensures that there’s plenty of visual interest around your living room seating arrangement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/style-up-your-sofas/article32934610.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||How classrooms will change post-Covid||The past few months have made us realise the importance of personal interactions for our children. It is clear that however efficient or effective online education might be, they need to spend a certain amount of time in the company of others. The physical classroom environment promotes and stimulates collaborative learning and brings about the much-needed social interaction with staff and other students. As we wait for schools and colleges to reopen, what are some of the changes needed in their physical infrastructure to ensure the safety of students and staff? It is now evident that any new school being constructed should consider the pandemic and ensure that the planning of built spaces will address these conditions going forward. Existing schools will have to look into their current infrastructure and make appropriate adjustments. A key lesson learnt from COVID-19 is that mechanical conditioning of indoor spaces is not ideal for occupants. Naturally ventilated and sun-lit spaces are healthier — they not only help prevent the spread of any infection, but also aid in faster healing. Spaces such as classrooms — where students and staff spend a lot of time — need to ensure adequate access to breeze and light. Personal space is another important factor to be considered to ensure the maintenance of social distancing without too many changes. Existing schools could look into opening out closed classrooms to cater to the above two requirements. Windows could be made larger, additional doorways could be opened out to ensure easy access to the outdoors. Creating ‘verandah’ like spaces — that expand the classroom and allow for distancing and spillover of students so they do not feel trapped inside — is another option. Kindergarten and/or primary classrooms could be opened out to connect two classrooms via an open archway that can be closed if needed by blinds. Installation of insulation on the rooftops could be planned to ensure indoor spaces remain cool and comfortable without the need for mechanical air conditioning. Spaces could also be created for outdoor learning in smaller groups. Built-in brick and stone seating around or near trees and stepped seating can be created to add more interest. Such spaces can alternatively be used for events and meetings. Sanitisation stations should be installed at entry points and must be equipped with adequate handwash facilities with separators to prevent crowding. A variety of innovative roof-covered structures and unique signages could be incorporated to make these zones interesting for children. Opening out indoor spaces and creating flexible transitions will not only ensure schools are better prepared to deal with such pandemics in the future, but will also create a healthy environment for children to spend time in.  The author is the founder of Green Evolution, a sustainable architecture firm   Sanitisation stations should be installed at entry points and must be equipped with handwash facilities||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/how-classrooms-will-change-post-covid/article32934611.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Signs of recovery, but challenges remain||There is a hint in the air that the realty market is showing signs of recovery. As per Knight Frank’s ‘India Realty Report’ for Q3 (July – September 2020), sales and supplies that plummeted during Q2, a period coinciding with complete lockdown of the economy, have shown upswing during Q3. The report, that focuses on top eight cities across the country, points out that launches grew by four-and-a-half times and sales by two-and-a-half times compared to Q2 of 2020. The residential market has displayed a better-than-expected recovery in Q3, given the macro-economic challenges and resumption of lockdown in July that impacted every sector of the economy. Shishir Baijal, GM, Knight Frank, while releasing the report on Zoom, said that the bounce back in the quarter is promising, though the sector is still not out of the woods. While the sale of home units showed a 247% rise on a quarter-to-quarter (QoQ) basis, launches were up by 45%. Mumbai witnessed the largest rise during September, largely attributed to the 300 bps cut in stamp duty by the Maharashtra government. Baijal added that the recent successes by REITs and entry of new players in the field serve as an index of long-term confidence of investors for office space. Though the decline of demand due to general reluctance to buy homes has been the hallmark of the year, the residential sector was also impacted by liquidity crunch, supply chain disruptions, rise in the cost of construction material and large-scale exodus of labourers from urban areas. However, demand picked up in Q3 mainly due to fall in residential prices, aggressive marketing of ready inventory and offer of freebies and discounts. Fall in home loan rates, lowest in several decades, extension of moratorium on loan instalments and partial return of construction workers also helped. The report notes that weighted average prices went down in the range of 3-7% in six of the eight cities in the reckoning during the period. Bengaluru and Hyderabad were the only markets that saw prices grow on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as these were predominantly end-user markets. Decline in inventory Homebuyers preferred ready or near-ready inventory to minimise completion risk which reflected in the average age of inventory staying at 16.9 quarters in Q3 2020 compared to 16.2 quarters a year ago. Developers were also noticeably keen to liquidate older inventory before new launches. The sector eyes the festival season in the next quarter as developers expect some fillip to sales. The near-term outlook on sales continues to remain challenging and depends completely on how the pandemic impacts the economy in the months ahead. Office market The Indian office market was adversely affected due to the fallout of the COVID-induced lockdown during the last six months. Most of the eight principal markets were under severe lockdown during the period, leading to sharp decline in transactions as well as new completions. Businesses deferred expansions and the focus shifted to controlling costs. Social distancing norms and remote working ensured that corporate offices were working at 30% to 50% capacity in most cities. However, with the unlocking of the economy since July 2020, the market traction has started to improve in tandem as total transactions and office completion have recovered by 80% and 126% respectively, in Q3 in comparison to the preceding quarter, the report notes. Transactions exceeded new completions during this period and helped keep rental levels flat or positive in four of the eight markets under coverage, while rentals fell in the range of 1-6% in rest of the markets. Rajani Sinha, National Director (Research), said while work-from-home as a concept has proved to be an effective business continuity measure, the occupiers are expected to look at office space usage more strategically by bringing further innovation to include aspects such as social distancing, health benefits and sustainability. Chief Economist Gulam Zia pointed out that bottlenecks are easing during the lockdown and the RERA authorities have shown flexibility by extending the deadline for completion.  Fall in prices, aggressive marketing of ready inventory, and offer of freebies and discounts helped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/signs-of-recovery-but-challenges-remain/article32934601.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||The lowdown on luxury homes||The past few months have seen the luxury home buyer making a comeback. Since COVID-19, buyers across segments have deferred their buying decisions. In the case of those eyeing luxe homes, however, the lockdown has given them time to look for one that suits their needs best. A recent FICCI-ANAROCK report states that this particular buyer group has not been impacted much by the pandemic. In addition, lowered interest rates, reduced stamp duty and registration charges in many States, the six-month moratorium etc. have given relief to home buyers. “With all these measures being implemented and an ease in restrictions, the market has slowly improved. Sales have phenomenally increased in the last two months,” says Rajesh Gurumurthy, Senior Director, Head, Strategic Consulting, Tamil Nadu & Sri Lanka, at Jones Lang LaSalle. Many States are already claiming to have registered more properties compared to the March-June period. With buyers looking for good offers during the festive season, developers are also seeing the change in lifestyles and accommodating their requests, says Gurumurthy. This gradual improvement in demand for luxury residences is also noted by Shveta Jain, Managing Director, Residential Services, Savills India. “It comes on the back of corrected valuations of properties both in the primary and secondary residential segments. Post-lockdown, demand is also returning slowly due to flexible payment plans, reduced interest rates, and some discounting.”  Buyer sentiments How do developers view buyer sentiment? Ram Raheja, Director, S. Raheja Realty, says that the pandemic has made people want a home of their own. “Families usually shift between cities due to work patterns, which is why they rent homes. Today, this pattern is disrupted. Buyers are looking for inbuilt amenities like a club house, yoga centre, swimming pool, gym, playground, jogging track, etc.” In Chennai, the conversion rates have certainly improved in the last few months. “Earlier site visit to sales conversion was 10% but now the conversion is going up to 20-25%, which means we are getting serious buyers at every project,” says T. Chitty Babu, Chairman and CEO, Akshaya. Having said that, people are more particular about choosing projects that have adapted to the post-Covid design brief. The emphasis is on property management, indoor and outdoor sanitisation systems, and air filtration systems, among others. Home automation systems with sensor-based elevators, hands-free faucets, automatic shoe-cover dispensers, and touch-free soap dispensers are now essentials, says JLL’s Gurumurthy, adding that indoor specifications such as anti-viral surface coatings and self-doctoring surface treatments are also trending. In most projects, people have started looking for larger spaces, adds Babu. “Those who were earlier looking at 2BHK apartments have started looking for 2.5 BHK and people who were looking at 3BHK units want larger spaces. The WFH concept has aided this trend.” Second homes What Jain is also witnessing is that buyers are not only opting for city-centric locations, but are also open to buying high-end residences in the suburbs. “We are also seeing an increase in the demand for second homes in locations that were not considered earlier. With work-from-home (WFH) fast becoming an accepted norm in the corporate world, both buyers and renters are out in the market looking for second properties,” she says, adding that the trend is expected to pick up in the coming months. Second-home buyers are no longer considering rental income or future appreciation — the demand is mainly from end-users who want to leverage on lower property prices in such locations and stay close to the city, says Gurumurthy. “Major second home hotspots in Chennai include the city centre, and the ECR with beach-front properties. Some also purchase residences in hill stations or other tourist locations.” Price point Gurumurthy says the demand is fairly good for ready-to-move flats in the Rs. 2 crore to Rs. 5 crore range. Does he expect a price reduction in coming months? “Mumbai has the most active luxury market and the price corrections are expected to be higher. However, buyers are insisting on discounts up to 40%, which becomes unrealistic for developers. Understanding the other markets, the price corrections are expected between 5-10% or below,” he says. In Chennai, 50% of 944 units (priced above Rs. 5 crore) have been absorbed and of the 3,867 units priced between Rs. 2 crore and Rs. 5 crore, 59% are sold. Developers are recasting payment plans and other incentives to accelerate the buying decisions of consumers, says Jain. “Some builders have even initiated time-bound 10:90 and 20:80 schemes to expedite demand. This trend is visible in at least the top five cities in India.

I have bought a four-year-old apartment and my owner has already paid the corpus fund to the builder. Now, the apartment association is requesting me to pay a sum towards the corpus fund as I am a new member. Is it mandatory to pay this every time a member changes? Is there any time limit, etc.? Rajesh Kanna Coimbatore Normally, the corpus fund relates to the apartment and not the owner. On resale, the deposit should be deemed as transferred to the new purchaser and there will be no need for any further payment. Please look into the bye-laws for any specific provision relating to this aspect. I request you to kindly clarify the details regarding the 1% TDS to be deducted from the payment to be made to the builder when purchasing a flat. What are the heads to be included in calculating the 1% TDS? The builder has broadly classified the total cost under these heads: cost of UDS, construction cost, car park charges, GST, registration of both agreements, corpus fund, sales tax, CMDA charges, EB charges, deposit, etc. How is a 1% TDS calculated on the total cost of the flat (including all costs)? Please advise on whether any of the heads have been included in calculating the 1% TDS in the budget 2019-20. Have there been any changes or modifications in the 2020-21 budget? What is the GST rate payable by the builder on the sale of a flat? Hariharan M.S.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Taking stock of housing sales||Severely impacted by the pandemic, the top seven cities saw homes worth approx. Rs. 88,730 crore sold in the first three quarters of 2020 as against Rs. 1,54,320 crore in the corresponding period of 2019. This is a 43% decline, with total value reduction amounting to approx. Rs. 65,590 crore during the period. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, says, “As expected, the second quarter was lacklustre given the lockdowns and overall pressures on the economy. What is remarkable is how the third quarter stacked up, clearly indicating that buyer sentiment was in place and merely held at bay by uncertainty. Based on these results, there is now every reason to look at the coming festive season with confidence.” This return of sentiment, coupled with various festive offers and with attractive financial schemes, will produce a marked uptick, adds Puri. Between January and September 2020, as many as 87,460 units were sold across the top seven cities as against approx. 2.02 lakh units sold a year ago. However, the quarterly numbers indicate that the worst is over for the residential sector. Q3 2020 saw home sales values increase by more than 2.3 times to approx. Rs. 29,731 crore — up from Rs. 12,694 crore in the preceding quarter. Q1 2020 saw home sales worth approx. Rs. 46,306 crore. Despite the ongoing pandemic, end-users are making the most of bottomed-out property prices and historic low home loan rates and financial schemes offered by developers. The upcoming festive quarter (Oct.-Dec.) will probably see home sales values go up on the back of increased demand fed by financial schemes and offers. City-specific MMR was on top and clocked sales worth Rs. 49,313 crore in the first three quarters of 2020. On a yearly basis, MMR saw total sales value reduce by 22% — from Rs. 62,964 crore in 2019 to Rs. 49,313 crore this year. But, interestingly, as against 2018-period — when MMR recorded sales worth Rs. 47,242 crore — it became the only city to witness an increase (of 4%). Bengaluru sale values in the first nine of months of 2020 stood at Rs. 12,569 crore as against Rs. 28,159 crore in the 2019-period. The city saw sales of nearly 17,020 units between January to September 2020. Sales in NCR were approx. Rs. 9,430 crore in the first nine of months of 2020 as against Rs. 24,860 crore in 2019, registering a 62% annual drop. Pune saw housing sales worth Rs. 8,692 crore in the first nine of months of 2020 as against Rs. 17,524 crore back in 2019. The overall units sold in the three quarters this year is 14,200 units. Hyderabad witnessed housing sales worth Rs. 3,116 crore in this period as against Rs. 9,391 crore back in 2019. The overall units sold in the three quarters here is approx. 4,980 units. Kolkata saw sales of 4,800 units in 2020 till September whose total value is estimated to be Rs. 2,833 crore as against Rs. 5,848 crore in 2019-period. Chennai saw housing sales worth Rs. 2,777 crore in the three quarters of 2020 as against Rs. 5,575 crore last year. The city also recorded home sales of nearly 4,280 residential units in 2020 (till September).

Since COVID-19, buyers across segments have deferred their buying decisions. In the case of those eyeing luxe homes, however, the lockdown has given them time to look for one that suits their needs best.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s a mootu point||Eindhoven in the Netherlands is seeing a surge in visitors, albeit virtually. The 19th Dutch Design Week has kicked off and people are logging on to check out over 500 exhibits in 3D viewing rooms. Think light installations with discarded lenses, living coffins (with mycelium) and textiles woven by drones. But it is an exhibit at the Dutch Invertuals Gallery’s True Matter show that we are interested in. Equal parts eye-catching and confusing, the Mootu Lounger by Chennai-based design firm, The Architecture Story, is shaped like a ‘U’ and strung with moulded leather pieces. Is it furniture or art? Can one sit on it? Turns out, designers and partners Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar welcome such questions. “We wanted to take design as an opportunity for divergent thinking,” says Jawahar, 35. “The point was to think of different ways that a body can interact with an object, and the Mottu Lounger plays with perception and interaction.” Also, though you may not see it immediately, the conceptual design has its origin story in the mridangam , the main percussion instrument in the Carnatic music ensemble.  Giving sound form  A few months ago, Invertuals had challenged 22 young designers from 17 countries to work with raw materials from their local context, and to play with techniques, craftsmanship and traditions. “We thought it would be interesting to explore music and design — not in a direct way, but through tectonics [the method of bringing things together] of music creation,” says De Penning, 33, while her husband Jawahar adds, “During our research, we found that [Indian physicist and Nobel Prize winner] CV Raman’s light scattering experiments were inspired by Indian percussion instruments. So we wondered, could it lend itself to design as well?” While debating how to break away from regular modes of understanding form, the duo decided to look at the mridangam . Something that was representative of ‘place’, of Tamil Nadu. “We visited mridangam makers in Mylapore [an area synonymous with Carnatic music] and different parts of Chennai, and learned that the mootu [the moulded leather that covers the two mouths of the instrument] is used for three to four years and then discarded. So it is a generational craft that doesn’t have an afterlife,” explains Jawahar. They took home a number of mootus to experiment with — deconstructing it, immersing it in water, shaping it with another object. “For the final piece, we used the techniques and tectonics of the mridangam to create the story we wanted,” he says.  Walking parallel worlds  This meant working with mridangam makers, hand-cutting 14x4 circular leather pieces, puncturing 48 holes around the circumference (the size of the circles and the number and position of the holes are derived from the mridangam mootu ) and knotting them with ropes. “When designing the framework, we did look at bringing in sound. The shape of the ‘U’, if filled with sound, allows for a certain movement,” De Penning tells me. But the desire to create a minimal translation had them deciding not to confuse the architectural framework with a sonic element. The third piece of furniture from the three-year-old firm — the earlier two include a table made from marble, granite and metal, and a metal origami chair — the piece will not be mass produced, but they are open to commissions. As for the artisans, early suspicions about whether the duo was working on a new musical instrument have since turned into enthusiasm for more such experiments. “It was exhilarating,” Jawahar says. “Through August and September, in the mornings we would have these intellectual discussions on design with the gallerists and designers, and [later in the day] go to Mylapore to collect the mootu and talk with the artisans. As designers, we were at the intersection of these two worlds. It pushed us to relook at TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and the parallel worlds we are living in.”  The Dutch Design Week is on till October 25.Details: ddw.nl||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/its-a-mootu-point/article32934701.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Movie night at FDCI’s India Fashion Week||Just like artists, fashion designers are bad liars. They can drape you in luxurious silks and velvets, make flowers grow from mere fabric, and sculpt statues with corsets and capes, but they cannot hide their hearts. Their work is, and must always be, seen in context of the time and place in which it is created. So how did the first digital RTW fashion week in India — the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (LMIFW) organised by the FDCI — fare on this scale? Creatively, it passed with flying colours, even while painting a bleak vision. The collections, reader, are the first ones designed and produced within the timeline of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This is a sobering first. And they came together to tell a story, which I will do my best to tell you. The opening show In the beginning, there was the Pandemic. And discarded oxygen cylinders as tall as people were seen everywhere. Models in Rajesh Pratap Singh (61.9K views) walked among them in hospital-white smocks and shirt-dresses, raised necklines covering half their faces. The young label Bloni (30.6K views) proposed an Industrial style for going out in small groups. Slick, easy separates with reflective finishes and the glamour of oversized sequins showed the way the new generation of influencers would dress to impress. The mood in Delhi though, according to Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra’s collection for S&N (58.7K views) , had changed entirely. In the past, India had been a Democracy. But in 2034, the ‘High Chancellor’, ‘Cabinet Leaders’, and the ‘Head of the Imperial Secret Service’ ruled with an iron fist — dressed in martial uniforms, a design discipline that our former colonisers, the British, once prided themselves over. Asymmetric drapes, fluid capes, camp sunglasses, and military caps, all festooned with make-believe badges, braids, and epaulettes: these became the modern military regalia for those who never did enlist. And an AI took over the running of the country. Dangerous times Meanwhile, out on the streets, turf wars looked like a crossover between Namrata Joshipura’s modern Matrix (48.7K views) and Siddhartha Tytler’s Mad Max: Fury Road (38.6K views) . The standoff: Joshipura’s slick, sequined, tiger-striped jackets and feather-embellished capes, chain-mail like shifts and pearl-encrusted noise-cancelling headphones, against Tytler’s hood rats in reflective jacquard suits and neon-quilted bombers, designed to warn off others in the dark of night. At Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna (86.9K views), the overlords and ladies gathered in underground clubs to toast their success and survival in high Black Tie: embellished tuxedos and metal-sequined gowns à la Underworld . The rich, though, seemed unaffected. Draping themselves in digital prints of Renaissance masterpieces from Shivan & Narresh (35K views), and dressed in tiered gowns from Nidhi Yasha (23.7K views), they escaped to seaside locations. This follows a very real phenomenon seen in recent months, of people from the twin capitals escaping to Goa. Delhi may be the political power centre and Mumbai the business core, but this quaint southwestern Union Territory has become the Pandemic Capital of India. Still, the days continue to dawn, and everyone needs a light touch. So a few remained to provide hope. Like Varun Bahl (44K views) , with his delicate dedication to flowers. Made with fabric and sprinkled judiciously onto silken slip dresses and kimono-inspired wraps, these miniature artistic blossoms evoked nostalgia for a generation that actually remembered better times. At Gauri & Nainika (41K views), flowers became prints, and grew into oversized blooms covering the entire body in petals of silk and organza and taffeta. Solidarity train Like the end of any post-apocalyptic movie, the global south, represented by Africa, also had its moment this season. Ashish Soni, who spent his growing-up years in Zambia’s Kitwe province, took on this task. Zambia may be one of Africa’s safest nations today, but when Soni was there, he remembers living behind steel reinforced doors, with guard dogs on duty. Six of them. As his digital show began (32.8K views), a note clarified that it was not a human rights campaign, but a personal pledge towards the inclusion Black people deserve in the fashion community. Did what followed reflect Soni’s intentions? With a cast of exclusively Black models walking to voice recordings of speeches by Black leaders and victims, it seemed to, at least at that level. But the clothes — slick tonal jacquard jackets, deconstructed textures on bombers, layered skirts worn over sneakers and leggings — seemed somewhat accidental to the narrative. And the question still lingered, as it does at the end of such movies, if this was really the beginning of a New World Order.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Varana and the travelling trench coat||Varana, the sustainable luxury Indian fashion brand that’s garnering a cult following internationally, recently introduced e-commerce and debuted its collection to the wholesale trade in Italy. It is the next step — after the Bengaluru-based company opened a four-storey flagship store in London’s Mayfair in 2017 — in their goal to make a big impact abroad. Its pared down silhouettes, quality fabrics and handwork detailing have won favour with buyers, including the likes of celebrated boutiques Blu (Capri), Sam Tessabit (Como), and Popp & Kretschmer (Vienna). Antonio Arcucci, the owner of Blu, says he likes the brand “both for the quality of the garments and its clean, refined look”. Varana also had plans to show in New York, London, and Paris (now cancelled because of the pandemic). Still, “it was a good start because in Italy people know and understand fashion and high quality, and we were well received,” says Sujata Keshavan, Varana’s co-founder and creative director, via telephone. Saskia Terzani, who consults on business strategy (she was instrumental in taking the Victoria Beckham brand global) and oversaw the brand’s Milan debut at the chic fashion venue Hotel Diana, tells me that buyers flipped dresses from underneath to look at the stitch inside. “Their hands touched the fabric; it is old school, but in Italy there is a real appreciation for fabric,” she says. The brand is also set to meet with Harrods and Selfridges in London.  A quiet joy  Much as pioneering Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake did in the 1980s — bringing their clothes, and their culture, to the attention of the West — Varana’s bold ambition is to showcase the finest Indian craft techniques in contemporary styles. “We don’t have many fashion brands in international markets because a lot of luxury Indian wear is traditional and focussed on the local market,” says Keshavan. “India is not a famous destination for luxury although we do a lot of beautiful work for other western brands [think Versace, Gucci, Prada].” She and fellow co-founder Ravi Prasad set out to rectify that, marrying indigenous handwork with functional, refined designs. Keshavan describes this design philosophy as a ‘quiet joy’, confident in its simplicity yet imbued with fine details. Citing the example of Hermès and The Row for their prized tailoring and fabrics, the founding duo hope to propel Varana into that league. With silk shirts retailing for Rs. 40,000, cashmere trousers for Rs. 69,000, and a silk organza trench for Rs. 1,64,339, its price points reflect its high-end positioning. Prasad, who headed The Himalaya Drug Company for years, says, via Zoom, that Varana is “intentionally positioned at a price level that the quality commands. When we sold in Milan, I asked Saskia if the buyers asked about it and she said that, uniformly, they thought the prices were appropriate.” But recognising that entry-level price points could help build business, Varana recently launched a line of organic, craft-infused cotton T-shirts, priced at Rs. 11,908. For those not in London, the company absorbs shipping and duty costs from website sales to ensure pricing parity worldwide.   Global inputs  Today Varana has 75 employees, with two manufacturing units in Bengaluru, and works with eight to 10 craft clusters around India — including West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Ladakh. But five years ago, it was a different scenario. Keshavan and Prasad both come from a non-fashion background. “We had no clue as to how this business works,” says Prasad, with a laugh. But they knew they had to find people with international expertise. They hired Stefano Arienti, an Italian with years of experience at Prada and Louis Vuitton, to set up the back-end operations. Arienti’s attention to detail included adjusting the tension in each hand operated tailoring machine so that running stitches turned out accurately. It paid off. Prasad says that while Varana’s units take longer to produce a garment, their rejection rate is only 0.1%. As far as plans for India go, the company would love to retail here but says the current offering needs to be tweaked for local customers. For a start, the weather conditions are different to those of the West. Plus, Indian consumers want visible value for money, and it remains to be seen if Varana’s lack of embellishments on simple silhouettes at a high price point find enough followers here. The company, meanwhile, may do a few trunk shows to test the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/varana-and-the-travelling-trench-coat/article32934710.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Drawing a new start line||Given its overwhelmingly white and masculine makeup — “pale, stale, male” — when the Oscars announced its new diversity rules last month, they were largely welcomed. The Academy said it hoped to not just reshape how movies are awarded, but also who makes movies and what stories are told. Amidst the bouquets the Academy got, there were also a predictable number of brickbats. These critics trotted out the usual arguments against affirmative action — arguments that are extremely familiar to us here and brought up frequently against reservations of all kinds. The Academy’s website had comments that said: “It’s no longer about cinema as a genre of art. Now it’s about politics.” Another said: “Forced diversity lowers quality.” Actor Kirstie Alley raged: “I’m opposed to mandated arbitrary percentages... It’s impossible to ‘police’ quotas as a prerequisite for a ‘best’ picture.” For me, sitting here in Chennai, there was a moment of déjà vu. Not so long ago, I was listening to an acquaintance, a senior manager in a multinational banking company, fume about the fact that they had recently been mandated to promote a certain number of women to the executive cadre to meet the company’s diversity rules. The manager’s objections were that first, she thought these women were not good enough to be promoted. Second, she resented having struggled to reach the top while these women would get a free pass. Third, she thought the move would backfire — the unqualified women would give their whole sex a bad name and reinforce prejudices against women. On the face of it, these sound like rational objections, but scratch the surface and you see why her response, like Kirstie Alley’s, contributes even more to entrenched positions of deep inequality. Both women assume that the absence of ‘quotas’ means an objective preservation of the highest quality standards. But one look at the Oscar’s long history of awarding mediocrity shows you how fallacious this assumption is. If Gary Oldman can win the Oscar for hamming it as Churchill the same year that Daniel Day-Lewis was nominated for Phantom Thread , or if Around the World in 80 Days can win in a year when Seven Samurai was released, then quality is not exactly being upheld. Rank bad performances regularly make the red carpet, so let’s not pretend that diversity rules alone will open the floodgates to less than stellar stuff. At any rate, so what? Let an imperfect film made by a Romani director win the statuette — it’s not going to ruin cinema any more than awarding it to Rocky did. In offices too, incompetent men, duds and dullards can be seen at all levels, including in leadership positions — positions where nothing but brilliance will be accepted from women. The office is men’s grazing ground — their actions and rewards, their foibles and follies all part of an ancient, well-oiled, and mutually beneficial ritual. Women have a lot of catching up to do to own this space, and that can happen only when there are enough of them for long enough. If diversity rules push a few women up the ladder even when they aren’t fully qualified, it’s a beneficial exercise. It goes on to create a large pool of female experience, confidence, mentorship and lineage that men have enjoyed for centuries. I recently saw a brief experiment conducted by a teacher in an American school. He lined up a bunch of students for a race but before blowing the whistle, he asked those from a certain income group to step 50 metres forward; then those who were second-generation educated; then those who had libraries at home; and so on. Soon, many of the white students had advanced halfway down even before the race had begun. This is structural inequality. The entry barriers to the race are so high for some that it’s a miracle they made it the field at all. They must be allowed to jump a few steps ahead and meet the other racers at a fresh start line. It’s not a fail-proof guarantee of success but it gives them a fighting chance in a game that the established contestants have been playing for eons. Forced diversity is invariably the first step to real diversity — whether in cinema or in workplaces. And we need to embrace it.

24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||Old order disrupted||The just-concluded 64th edition of the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival was a triumph, given the circumstances it was held in. Long before the lay of the land was known, the organisers had bravely decided to pivot to a hybrid online/physical model. Screenings were held across U.K. partner venues, not just London, with the majority being online. When the festival began, the country found itself in the grip of a second wave of the novel coronavirus, but the sheer enthusiasm of a film-starved public and the joie de vivre of the organisers pulled it through and made it a success. In a programme packed with terrific films, three stood out for me. Enough has been written about the excellent The Disciple , so moving on swiftly from there to the other film that is in the process of conquering the festival circuit, débutant Rezwan Shahriar Sumit’s Bangladesh/France production, The Salt in Our Waters ( Nonajoler Kabbo ). It had its world première in London and has its Asian première at the ongoing Busan Film Festival. I’ve been following the project since it was a glimmer in Sumit’s eye at the NFDC Film Bazaar in Goa a few years ago. Since then, he received a few grants, and a Spike Lee Fellowship no less. But, proof of the pudding, right? The movie is a tremendous début, so much so that it is difficult to believe that it is a début film, so assured is the filmmaking. It is a spiritual successor to Bangladeshi doyen Mostofa Sarwar Farooki’s ground-breaking Television (2012), where new ideas arrive at an island in Bangladesh, thus disrupting the old order. However, Sumit also packs in ideas of climate change and different interpretations of theology, including a fascinating sideline in idolatry, not just physical, but philosophical as well. The film is also of a piece with two seminal man vs. nature works, Ritwik Ghatak’s A River Called Titas (the 1973 Titas Ekti Nodir Naam ) and Ramu Kariat’s Chemmeen (1965). Sumit is a talent to be watched and nurtured. Also disrupting the old order is Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco’s New Order ( Nuevo Orden ). The film came to London after winning awards at Venice and much festival play elsewhere. Franco has always liked to challenge audiences, beginning with his first feature Daniel and Ana (2009), where kidnapped siblings are forced to have sex on camera. In New Order, he challenges us so much that the result is so believable that it is terrifying. The film is about a revolution in Mexico where the majority (all people of colour) brutally rise against the one-percenters i.e. the wealthy and powerful (all white). Franco does not take sides and that is the scary part — the takeaway is that there is evil everywhere and in everyone. What an apt film for this annus horribilis . To end on a cheerier note, Tomas Vinterberg’s classically shot Another Round ( Druk ), a far cry from his Dogme 95 days, follows four high school teachers, led by the redoubtable Mads Mikkelsen, who decide to improve matters by keeping a constant level of alcohol in their blood. Does it go pear shaped? I’m not telling. Another Round won best film at the London Film Festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/old-order-disrupted/article32933993.ece
24 October 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi’s air deteriorates to ‘very poor’ category||The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Nodia, which are part of the National Capital Region (NCR), deteriorated to the “very poor” category on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The air quality of Delhi is expected to deteriorate further in the next two days, as per government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The SC-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday said they are watching the situation closely as Delhi’s air quality could be in “severe” category on Saturday for some period of time. The Air Quality Index of Delhi was 366 on Friday and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 334 and 369 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 pm bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. All three values were in the “red” category and it can cause “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”, according to the CPCB. The AQI of Delhi and Gurugram was in the “poor” category and Noida’s was in the lower end of “very poor” on Thursday. Calm surface wind conditions are expected to continue over the Delhi region for the next two days, which will lead to less dispersion of pollutants. The stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab, and neighboring border regions of Delhi was 1,213 on Thursday, said SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi was estimated to be around 17% on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhis-air-deteriorates-to-very-poor-category/article32934726.ece
24 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Sharp rise in Punjab farm fires as kharif harvesting gains pace||Punjab has witnessed a sharp rise in stubble-burning incidents this kharif season with paddy harvesting gaining pace. Government data based on satellite imagery show that between September 21 and October 21, as many as 9,434 cases of farm fires have been reported in the State. Overall, Punjab so far has seen 5,282 more such cases this season than last year. Tarn Taran tops District Tarn Taran has seen highest number of farm fires at 2,086, followed by Amritsar and Ferozpur district with 1,657 and 1,033 such cases respectively, according to the Punjab Pollution Control Board. Advanced planting amid the novel coronavirus outbreak resulted in the harvesting process beginning earlier this year than the usual early October. Amid concerns of labour shortage during the nationwide lockdown, the Punjab government had advanced paddy nursery sowing and transplantation dates by 10 days. The operations commenced on May 10 and June 10 respectively instead of May 20 and June 20 fixed earlier for nursery sowing and transplantation by the agriculture department. Consequently, arrival of the produce in markets across the State has also begun a tad early this season, in mid-September itself. Paddy has been sown on 27 lakh hectares of land in Punjab this year, including basmati on 7 lakh hectares. This is expected to cumulatively yield paddy residue of 16.50 million tonnes. Krunesh Garg, PPCB member-secretary, said early harvesting is a key reason for the higher number of farm fires. “Also, this year the weather conditions have been comparatively dry than last year. I am confident the final figure of the fire cases and burnt area would be lower than in previous years at the end of the season,” he said. As part of the State’s stubble management strategy, over 23,500 more agri-machines are being provided this year to farmers, either individually or in groups or through cooperative societies at a subsidy ranging from 50% to 80% by the agriculture department. This is in addition to 51,000 paddy straw in situ management machines provided over the past two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sharp-rise-in-punjab-farm-fires-as-kharif-harvesting-gains-pace/article32934022.ece
24 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Reply to plea on quashing of notice for UPSC exam’||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a petition seeking quashing of the notice for this year’s civil service examination on the ground that not enough seats have been reserved for those with visual and multiple disabilities. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on the allegation made by a disability rights organisation that seats have not been reserved in accordance with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act of 2016. Evara Foundation, in its plea filed through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Misra, also sought to stay the declaration of the results for the preliminary examination. The High Court declined the plea, saying the UPSC will be asked to recompute its result if the final order goes in their favour. The High Court is also seized of a similar petition by another organisation, Sambhavana, a registered society of the disabled for the disabled, claiming that UPSC has reserved only 24 vacancies for persons with disabilities out of a total of 796 “expected approximate vacancies”. Sambhavana said this was below the 4% mandatory reservation under Section 34 of the RPWD Act. On Friday, the High Court declined Sambhavana’s plea seeking early hearing of its petition noting that the civil services main examination was scheduled to commence from January and the next date of hearing in their case was in November. Evara Foundation, in its plea, has contended that due to inadequate number of advertised vacancies for visually impaired and those with multiple disabilities, fewer candidates belonging to these two categories will qualify for the main examination. It also contended that the number of seats reserved for visually impaired, deaf and hard of hearing and locomotor disabilities is not in accordance with the RPWD Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reply-to-plea-on-quashing-of-notice-for-upsc-exam/article32934026.ece
24 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Ensure Khalid is given same treatment as other inmates’||A Delhi court on Friday asked Tihar jail authorities to ensure that former JNU student Umar Khalid, who was arrested in connection with north-east Delhi riots, is given the same treatment as other inmates and allowed to move outside his cell. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat also asked Tihar jail authorities to allow Mr. Khalid to get books and warm clothes in view of the onset of winter. Mr. Khalid, on Thursday, during a video-conferencing hearing on an application moved by the Special Public Prosecutor for a 30-day extension of his judicial custody, claimed that he was not allowed to step out of his cell akin to “solitary confinement”. Tihar jail Superintendent, who appeared before the court through video conferencing, said Mr. Khalid has been provided all the facilities as other inmates and he is taken out of his cell on a regular basis. The Superintendent said the decision to restrict his movement was taken in view of security risk. “I understand that there is a safety and security issue, but that cannot become the norm. The norm is to keep him out,” Judge Rawat said. The Jail Superintendent, in his reply, also stated that “the cell where the inmate [Khalid] is kept is located at such a place from where more than half of the ward movement is visible”. Reacting to this, Judge Rawat said, “What do you want to say from this? This a a very strange and bizarre thing to say.” During the hearing, Mr. Khalid said that after the issue was brought to the attention of the court on Thursday, the Jail Superintendent came to meet him and took him out of his cell. “When an order was passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma that I will not be allowed to go out at all, the condition became very acute for me over the last few days,” Mr. Khalid said. Judge Rawat also asked Mr. Khalid to cooperate with the jail authorities in view of the security risk being posed to him. ‘Safety aspect’ The Jail Superintendent said that they have around 50-60 inmates coming in on a daily basis whose credentials are unknown to them. In view of this, Mr. Khalid’s security aspect is to be considered, he said. The court also extended till November 20 the judicial custody of Mr. Khalid and JNU student Sharjeel Imam in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ensure-khalid-is-given-same-treatment-as-other-inmates/article32934024.ece
24 October 2020||New Delhi,||Arvind Kejriwal lays foundation stone for new wing at Lok Nayak Hospital||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday laid the foundation stone for a new wing at Lok Nayak Hospital. The building, with a capacity of 1,500 beds, he said, is a step towards providing high-quality healthcare amenities in the city. Mr. Kejriwal said that with an additional 1,500 beds, the building will increase the overall capacity of Lok Nayak Hospital to 3,800 beds. The Chief Minister also said that in 2.5 years, the hospital will be one of the biggest ones in the country with a modular design and modern medical infrastructure. According to the government, the building will have three main departments, a new medical block, new maternity and an advance paediatric department. “Today is a remarkable day for Delhi. A state-of-the-art building with cutting-edge medical technology block being added at the hospital. With an additional 1,500 beds, this building will increase the overall capacity of Lok Nayak Hospital to 3,800 beds. In 2.5 years, it will be one of the biggest hospitals in the country with a modular design and modern medical infrastructure,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The Delhi government, he said, has completed projects on time and that has saved money, which is then utilised for the betterment of the city. Cost Delhi, being the national capital, is a microcosm of the nation and should have access to everything world-class. The new wing at Lok Nayak Hospital is valued at Rs. 462 crores and each bed worth around Rs. 30 lakh. “Other governments spend Rs. 1crore to Rs. 1.5 crore per bed, but we believe in smart spending and effective utilisation of budget. In the last five years, it has been of utmost importance that we improve the living standards of the people of Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal also said.  Today is a remarkable day for Delhi.

24 October 2020||Ghaziabad,||Valmiki families in Ghaziabad village ‘convert’ to Buddhism||Members of the Valmiki community in Karhera village of Ghaziabad claim that they have “converted” to Buddhism as a mark of protest against atrocities being committed against the Dalits, particularly the Hathras case where a Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper caste men. The local authorities, however, deny any such conversion ceremony was held. An FIR has been registered in Sahibabad police station against unknown persons under Sections 153A and 505 of IPC for promoting enmity between communities. ‘Finding faults’ In a ceremony conducted under the banner of the Buddhist Society of India, 236 members of the community converted to Buddhism on October 14, said Rajratna Ambedkar, the great-grandnephew of B.R. Ambedkar. “Local administration is finding faults with the certificates issued and one MLA is even attributing ulterior motives to the conversion,” said Mr. Ambedkar. He was referring to the Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar’s letter to the Home Minister alleging that the Mumbai-based Society had links with Pakistan’s ISI and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. “We would take legal action against him. Buddhism is an Indian religion and we don’t believe in forcefully converting anybody,” said Mr. Ambedkar. On the Ghaziabad administration’s charge that the certificates didn’t have serial numbers and blank certificates were distributed, Mr. Ambedkar said they would soon file affidavits in court. “Because of the COVID 19 protocol, around 50 members were given certificates during the ceremony while those of the rest were given to the family members.” In an inquiry ordered by District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, ADM (City) Shailendra Kumar Singh found that no evidence was provided for the ‘conversion’. In most of the certificates, correct names and addresses were not indicated. The date and registration numbers were also missing. Some certificates were blank on which names and addresses could be written. The report further said that in the memorandum submitted by the local people, only local problems had been mentioned and that there was no reference of conversion. “The issues raised in the memorandum are being addressed,” said Mr. Singh in the report. Karhera is an urban village in Ghaziabad. Inderdas Maharaj, whose grandson Pawan Valmiki allegedly invited the Buddhist Society of India, said there were about 70-80 Valmiki families in the village dominated by the upper caste families. “We are living here for generations and never faced any social tension. I conduct ‘satsang’ in the Valmiki temple in the locality and get respect from all. After the Hathras episode, my grandson Pawan made me realise that we are feeling suffocated in this ‘house’, it’s time to shift to another ‘house,” said the 73-year-old. “The administration has raised some questions. We will answer them but I feel it is a matter of faith. When we were in this faith, we were never asked to show any papers,” he said. After the incident, he said, the administration had “come into action.” “Earlier, even the ward member would not show up but now officials of all the departments are coming,” he laughed. Showing his certificate, Aman said they were asked to write down problems. “Now the administration is saying that our concern was not the atrocity faced by our sister in Hathras and that we were protesting against the civic issues,” he said. Keshav Kumar, Circle Officer, Sahibabad, said the FIR was registered on the complaint of a local named Montu Chandel Valmiki.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/valmiki-families-in-ghaziabad-village-convert-to-buddhism/article32934019.ece
24 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||‘BJP trying to divide society on caste lines’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday accused the BJP of trying to divide society on caste lines to promote its political interests. Referring to the BJP’s attempt to take out a so-called ‘Dalit Insaf Yatra’ on October 22 without taking due permissions, Capt. Amarinder said, “These divisive tactics will never succeed in Punjab, whose people are happily living together for their collective progress.” Capt. Amarinder said the BJP has no moral right to talk about Dalit rights, which they had been brazenly trampling wherever they were in power. He said statistics showed that Uttar Pradesh, under the BJP rule, accounts for over 25% of the total cases of atrocities against the Scheduled Caste people in the country, and had recorded the highest number of such incidents in 2018. “Is this your definition of justice for Dalits? Is this what you are offering the SC people of Punjab,” he asked the BJP. ‘Failed the farmers’ The Chief Minister said the BJP, finding itself totally cornered over the farm laws, was indulging in theatrics and mispropaganda with the sole motive of diverting public attention. “The fact is that the party has completely failed the farmers and also the SC students, whom its national leadership had deprived of access to higher education by abruptly withdrawing from the Central post-matric scholarship scheme,” he said in a statement. Capt. Amarinder attributed the BJP’s attempted rally to the fact that it was rattled over the State government’s successful launch of its scholarship scheme for the SC students. “Despite suffering Rs. 800 crore losses due to the anti-Dalit decision of the BJP-led Union government, the cash-strapped Punjab government had not only introduced a new scheme – B.R. Ambedkar SC Post-Matric Scholarship - for SC students, but even expanded its ambit to benefit more youngsters,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-trying-to-divide-society-on-caste-lines/article32934017.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre considering ‘action’ in DU power struggle, but VC not removed yet||The Centre is considering “strict action” against the Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, but has not yet moved to seek his permanent removal, according to senior Education Ministry officials. DU has been grappling with a power tussle between the senior most functionaries appointing different officials as Registrars of the varsity. On Thursday, the Ministry had written to the University, intervening in the spat over P.C. Jha’s appointment as Registrar by Prof. Tyagi, who is currently on medical leave. The Ministry’s letter had backed Pro Vice Chancellor P.C. Joshi, who has been the acting VC, and his appointee as Registrar, Vikas Gupta, instead. The Ministry stated that Prof Tyagi’s orders issued during his absence were not valid, and added that, “In future, if the Vice Chancellor wants to join the office, proper medical fitness certificate issued by the competent authority who treated him may be obtained.” A meeting was held in the Ministry on Friday, to discuss the ongoing power struggle and other administrative issues at DU. Following the meeting, when asked what further action the Ministry was taking, officials said that “strict action is being contemplated”. However, when asked whether Prof. Tyagi was being removed, officials said this was “not yet” being done. Earlier on Friday, Prof. Jha wrote to the Education Ministry stating that appointments made by Prof. Tyagi were in compliance with relevant ordinances of the varsity. In his letter to the Ministry, Prof. Jha wrote, “It is informed that Professor P.C. Jha, in addition to his responsibilities as Director of South Campus, is acting as Registrar of University of Delhi, as an interim arrangement. It is also informed that Dr. Geeta Bhatt has been appointed as Pro-Vice Chancellor in place of Professor P.C. Joshi.” “VC Yogesh K. Tyagi has taken decisions in due compliance with the Act, Statutes and Ordinances of Delhi University,” the letter read. The VC’s office also complained that Prof. Tyagi’s appointee Dr. Bhatt was unable to access the official email address of the Pro Vice Chancellor as the password had been changed on Thursday night. A Friday email from an official in the VC’s office to the director of the University Computer Centre demanded that the password be conveyed to Dr. Bhatt and that the “fake press release” put on the DU website in the name of the Registrar be removed. That release was issued late on Thursday night by Registrar Gupta, whose appointment Prof. Joshi had notified earlier in the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-considering-action-in-du-power-struggle-but-vc-not-removed-yet/article32934729.ece
24 October 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||Family claims man beaten to death in Similipal tiger reserve||A man was beaten to death by Forest Department personnel inside the Similipal Forest, a tiger reserve, in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district, his family members alleged on Friday. The Forest Department, however, disputed the claim saying the deceased was spotted lying unconscious by its personnel while they were patrolling inside the forest. Gajendra Naik (40), a resident of Nachhipur village under the Kaptipada police station limits, died on Thursday morning, 10 days after he was hospitalised. Family members and villagers staged a demonstration with the body in front of the Podadiha beat on Friday. They demanded compensation for the family and punishment to the Forest Department personnel. “We eke our livelihood by collecting non-timber forest produce. My husband had gone into the forest on October 9, but did not return. Family members and some villagers went looking for him, but could not find him. Two days later, the Forest Department informed us that my husband was admitted to a hospital in a serious condition,” said Binodini Naik, wife of the deceased. “The forest personnel told us that my husband may have injured himself falling from a height. I had doubts about this as he did not have any injuries apart from blood stains in the ear and mouth. As his condition deteriorated, my husband was referred to the SCB Medical College Hospital, Cuttack,” Ms. Naik said. The family members claimed that they had filed an online complaint with the police. Madan Mohan Mohanta, Ranger of Podadiha beat, said, “While patrolling on October 11, forest personnel had found the man lying unconscious. They admitted him to a hospital and also informed the local police station. The man had perhaps slipped from a height and suffered injuries.” “The allegation of the family is baseless,” Mr. Mohanta said, adding it was prohibited for outsiders to go inside Similipal during the rainy season. The family members said residents of fringe villages collect produce from forest in all seasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/family-claims-man-beaten-to-death-in-similipal-tiger-reserve/article32934020.ece

The development came following a decision of the Delhi High Court on Tuesday to end its blanket order extending all interim stays and bails granted during the lockdown as the situation has improved. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel, Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Talwant Singh noted that till now the blanket order to extend the interim stay and bail was necessitated because functioning of the courts was curtailed due to complete lockdown declared on March 25. “But now the situation has changed and all courts at High Court and district level are functioning through physical/ videoconferencing mode,” the Bench said. It also said there is no spread of COVID-19 in the jails as out of about 16,000 prisoners only three are infected currently, who too have been segregated and are admitted in hospital. Of the total inmates out on interim bail, the first category consist of of 2,318 undertrials involved in heinous crimes. The High Court ordered that there will not be any further extension of interim bails for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-5-500-inmates-on-interim-bail-to-return-to-jail/article32934028.ece
24 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Constable abducted by bus driver, released in U.P.||In a shocking incident, a Delhi Police Constable was allegedly abducted by a bus driver and his staff after he intercepted them and boarded the vehicle for checking. Two persons have been arrested, police said. A senior police officer said that the incident took place on Wednesday night when Constable Sachin, posted at Kashmere Gate police station, was patrolling in the area and heard some women passengers shouting for help from inside the bus. He then asked the bus driver to stop. When the bus stopped, two staff members of the bus came outside and started arguing with the Constable. Sensing something suspicious, he boarded the bus but the bus attendants and the co-drivers overpowered him. “They locked him inside, made him sit on the floor and sped away. They also snatched his service pistol and mobile phones. When he resisted, they manhandled him. When a few passengers on board objected to this, they were also threatened,” the officer said, adding that the accused left him at Makkhanpur area near Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh. The Constable then reached Makkhanpur police station and informed his senior officers. During investigation, police found that the offending bus was being operated by one Munna alias Rajeev Chaurasia and his son Ankit. The bus was then traced to Machhand village in Madhya Pradesh after which a raid was conducted at the accused’s residence and both were arrested. Police said that during further probe, it was revealed that Ankit was present in the bus when the incident took place and was taking directions from his father Munna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/constable-abducted-by-bus-driver-released-in-up/article32934037.ece

Its high time to focus on training of Doctors and re-initiate Non-COVID services at LNH [sic],” the Resident Doctors Association (RDA) of the hospital tweeted. The RDA, in a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Friday, said that people are suffering as Lok Nayak Hospital is an exclusive COVID-19 facility now. The RDA said that as the hospital is treating only COVID-19 patients now, many senior resident doctors left their posts as they were not gaining knowledge and clinical skillsand new residents are hesitant to join.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lok-nayak-rda-writes-to-delhi-cm/article32934036.ece
24 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||Varanasi weavers’ strike continues||Weavers in Varanasi and adjoining districts are continuing their strike demanding restoration of the flat rate electricity bill and withdrawal of the meter system introduced earlier this year. The powerloom weavers, on strike since October 15, alleged that since the implementation of the new meter system, the electricity department had been harassing them to pay higher rates or face connection cuts. The weavers earlier went on a strike on September 1 but two days later, their delegation met a senior government official in Lucknow and the two sides reportedly reached an understanding. As part of the compromise, the government would charge them on the basis of the previous flat rate till July and from August, a new system would be devised within 15 days of the meeting after consultation with the weavers. ‘Feeling betrayed’ However, no official order has been passed yet, said Iftekhar Ahmed Ansari, president of the U.P. Bunkar Sabha, which has been leading the strike. He added power connections continued to be cut and the government again implemented the new system with enforcement from August. “We feel betrayed,” said Mr. Ansari. On Thursday, a group of weavers under the banner of Bunkar Sanjha Manch in Raja Talab Tehsil of Varanasi submitted a memorandum to the local administration addressed to the Prime Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/varanasi-weavers-strike-continues/article32934023.ece

24 October 2020||New Delhi,||Special event for Heart, Head and Healing campaign||The Asian Heritage Foundation (AHF) has designed a special happening to further its ‘Heart, Head and Healing’ campaign based on supporting and reclaiming traditional livelihoods in times of distress for self-employed artists and artisans, at an event ‘Rites of Renewal’. The AHF began workshops two weeks ago with khapacchi craftspeople on the making of a collapsible Ravana effigy made of bamboo, paper and cloth that will be brought down and not burnt, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/special-event-for-heart-head-and-healing-campaign/article32934033.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||ikaiasai.com||When Ikai Asai launched at Maison Et Objet, Paris, in January this year, there was no indication of what was to come. Their plans to retail small-batch products that “help consumers rediscover local craftsmanship and the artisanal industry”, as CEO Kanupriya Verma describes it, was put on hold during the lockdown, and revived at London Craft Week last month. The site went live in early October, featuring four collections of tableware, serving utensils and cutlery, made using traditional methods and material. Verma was part of the team that brought out Ananya Birla’s CuroCarte, a site that curates decor from around the world. With Ikai Asai (which translates to ‘one’ in Punjabi and ‘desire’ in Tamil), the focus was on creating an artisanal lifestyle brand that would help revive crafts that are fast declining. The Deva line, for instance, was drawn from architect Dharmesh Jadeja in collaboration with Longpi pottery artisan Matthew Sasa from Meghalaya. It also featureskansawork (bronze), resulting in a gold and black collection of vases, napkin rings, dinner plates and bowls (above). Designer Rina Singh, founder of Eka, brings her minimalist aesthetic to block-printed table linen and ceramic hand-dyed platters in a range called Lila (seen below). For barware, furniture designer Ayush Kasliwal created Kama , a line made entirely of amethyst. Architect and interior designer Ashiesh Shah worked with Channapatna artist Noor Salma to put together six-foot-tall totem poles that work as art pieces, as well as Junoon tableware with wooden beads. The site features beautiful product images and a much-appreciated quick view that kicks in when a cursor is scrolled over it (and a single tap if you’re on the mobile site). But overall navigation still remains a bit confusing. If you are looking to browse by collection, head to the ‘Mood’ tab. However, only select items are listed when you try to shop from this page. There are also no options to see all products in a category: customers will have to choose a sub-category — ‘Pitchers’ under ‘Drinkware’ for example — which lessens the chances of us coming across something else we might end up liking and buying. From Rs. 350 to Rs. 2.5 lakh     Up next: Verma promises new collaborations at least twice a year, but is tight-lipped on what crafts we might see on the site next.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ikaiasaicom/article32934702.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||maalgaadistore.com||The eclectic design store tucked away in the bylanes of Besant Nagar, Chennai, might be downing its shutters soon, but its founders are continuing their journey online. With the soft launch last week, the e-store currently lets visitors wishlist their products and will allow orders next week. Regulars might recall the brand’s earlier site, shop.maalgaadistore.com. Well, co-founder Shahin Ansari explains that it was discontinued a few years ago as they “wanted to focus on the physical space”. Plans to revive the website were always on the cards, but the Covid-19 crisis pushed them to finally get it up. Unlike the former site, which focussed more on home decor than garments, the new fashion-centric digital store will have everything from trench coats and leather sandals to drop pendant chains and Jodhpuri drum bags. Over the years, Ansari has curated shows with an unusual mix of emerging brands from across the country. So we are hopeful. For now, large images greet you on the home page, but we expect photos from multiple angles for a better experience, and a few tweaks to the navigation. “Our focus is on sustainable labels and brands that source ethically. Of the 15 designers featured, eight are ethical labels that focus on handwoven, handspun fabrics,” she says, adding that their curation included picking brands from the existing roster — Mati, Anushe Pirani, Fahd Khatri — and adding new ones. Since the soft launch, they are seeing jewellery, primarily earrings, and Indo-western festive wear being added to buyer wishlists. The site is set to launch on October 28. Rs. 1,500 onwards for jewellery and Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 80,000 for apparel.  Up next: A capsule collection, Earth Pants, that is inspired by the elements of nature. Crafted using Karunganni cotton, a new line of trousers will be launched every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maalgaadistorecom/article32934703.ece
24 October 2020||October 24 2020 00:00 IST,||rooshadshroff.com||Architect-designer Rooshad Shroff has been toying with the idea of a website for years now. It wasn’t until lockdown gave him the “luxury of time” that he and his team buckled down to the task. Clean is what comes to mind when you log on. A stunning photograph of one of his projects (a revolving format ensures a new one every time you visit) gives way to a minimal page with just three options — Spaces, Installations, Objects — in crisp black lettering. “I wanted an absolutely fuss-free website, as sterile as possible, so that navigation is easy. There is already a lot of pattern and colour in my work, so, instead of a big graphic design exercise, I wanted the attention to be on the individual piece or project,” he says. With its grid and list view options, the site is designed like a catalogue. (It is price on request at the moment; for price tags, wait for the Shop feature to go live.) Each entry comes with a detailed write-up, a scroll-through gallery, and an option to download the spec sheet. “The website, launched on October 2, is an introduction to the versatility of our design studio,” he says. “Many people know us only for our furniture or our Hermès windows, and not so much for our architecture projects and events.” More interactive elements like videos would have helped, but Shroff believes “if you repeat the same things from platform to platform, it won’t work”. So making videos and the like will be reserved for his Instagram.     Up next: The Shop will go live soon (right after his physical gallery opens in Mumbai next month). Expect carved marble lights, candle holders, inlay plates and more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rooshadshroffcom/article32934704.ece
