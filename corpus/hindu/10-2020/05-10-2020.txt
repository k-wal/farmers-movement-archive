05 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||One in five Indians may be vaccinated by July 2021: govt.||The government on Sunday indicated that about 25 crore individuals are likely to be inoculated with a double dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by next July. The States have been asked to prepare a list by month-end of “priority population groups” for vaccination. These would include frontline health workers — both government as well as private sector doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers and others involved in the tracing, testing and treatment of patients. “The Centre is working on plans for building capacities in human resources, training, supervision, etc., on a massive scale and roughly estimates to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses, covering approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021,” said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, adding, “All this is under various stages of finalisation.” Dr. Vardhan was speaking at his weekly social media interaction, Sunday Samvad. The States had also been asked to submit details of cold chain facilities and related infrastructure required down to the block level, the Minister said. There are three prominent vaccine candidates being tested in India, only one of which, Covishield, has reached phase-3 trials. Covishield, developed by Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca, is being tested in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune. The SII has committed to producing 200 million doses for India and other low- and middle-income countries were the vaccine to be proven successful and cleared by regulators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-in-five-indians-may-be-vaccinated-by-july-2021-govt/article32768718.ece
05 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Bar on Pili Vesha during Dasara||While imposing a bar on the popular Pili Vesha (tiger dance) during the Dasara celebrations, the District Dharmika Parishat has asked all temples in Dakshina Kannada to restrict cultural programmes to their premises by ensuring social distancing. These were among the decisions taken during the meeting of the District Dharmika Parishat chaired by Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, who is the chairman of the parishat, here on Saturday. The meeting was held to discuss precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the festival season. Apart from officials from the Muzrai Department, representatives of the Mahatobara Mangaladevi Temple, the Bolar Marigudi temple, the Kudroli Gokarnanatheshwara Temple and the Venkataramana Temple participated in the meeting. Asking temple authorities to ensure compulsory use of sanitisers and thermal scanning, the parishat said that there should be enough volunteers to see devotees use face masks and follow social distancing when in temples. Imposing a ban on organising roadside public and cultural programmes and at places where Sharada idols are installed in different localities, the parishat asked such organisations to hold programmes in a simple way. Temples can arrange for webcast of cultural programmes. No permission will be given for installation of big shamiyana and there will be no Sante or Jatra during the festivals, said Dr. Rajendra said in a release. The meeting also decided to ban the sale, use and storing of fire crackers during the coming Deepavali. Hence, no fire crackers should be burst during Deepavali, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bar-on-pili-vesha-during-dasara/article32769382.ece

05 October 2020||LUCKNOW,||Upper caste group holds meet in support of Hathras accused||Sunday saw a large gathering of upper caste men in Hathras in support of persons accused in the gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman despite prohibitory orders under Section 144. Police lathi-charged Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and his associates, who were on their way to meet the family of the victim. “The arrogant Yogi government wants to suppress the Opposition voice through police lathis,” the RLD said in a tweet, sharing visuals of the sudden police lathi charge on Mr. Chaudhary and his team even as he was talking to the media. Police personnel could be seen severely beating RLD workers as they tried to shield Mr. Chaudhary. The Hathras police said RLD workers had broken police barriers and manhandled personnel on duty, adding that “light force” was used against the crowd to bring the situation under control. Show of strength In a massive show of strength, men from the dominant caste gathered at the home of a former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan amid heavy police deployment, some 6 km from the victim’s village Bulagarhi. The meeting was described as a thanksgiving meeting after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recommended a CBI probe into the case. Mr. Pehalwan said since the gathering was being held in his private space, it did not amount to violation of Section 144. Mr. Pehalvan’s son, Manveer Singh, one of the organiser’s of the meeting, said the men had gathered in support of the accused. He said two of the accused were innocent, citing the fact that they were picked up from their homes. “If they were guilty would they not try to run,” Mr. Singh said in their defence, speaking to a news channel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/upper-caste-group-holds-meet-in-support-of-hathras-accused/article32768716.ece
05 October 2020||New Delhi,||LJP confirms its decision to contest outside NDA in Bihar||The Lok Janshakti Party, at a meeting of its Parliamentary Board on Sunday, decided to contest on its own in the upcoming Bihar Assembly poll. The decision, however, does not mar its ties with the BJP, with the party saying it will not contest against any BJP candidate and will support the latter in a post-poll scenario. In an official statement released after the Parliamentary Board meeting, chaired by president Chirag Paswan, the party said at the national level it had strong ties with the BJP but at the State level, because of ideological differences with the JD(U), it had decided to go it alone.  The Hindu had reported on October 2 that the LJP would contest outside the alliance to mop up pro-BJP and anti-Nitish Kumar votes. It plans to take on the JD(U) with the slogan BJP se bair nahi, Nitish teri Khair nahi ( No enmity with BJP but won’t spare Nitish Kumar). ‘BJP-LJP govt. in State’ The LJP also said it will work towards a BJP-LJP government. “The LJP believes that on the lines of the BJP government at the Centre, the Bihar government should also be led by the BJP,” the statement said. In the seat sharing formula under discussion among NDA allies, the LJP was being offered only 25 odd seats. An announcement on seats and candidates is expected once the BJP sorts out its seat arrangements with the JD(U) and Jiten Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha. The LJP’s decision is a culmination of many months of a belligerent campaign by Mr. Paswan against Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) head Nitish Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ljp-confirms-decision-to-contest-outside-nda-in-bihar/article32768720.ece
05 October 2020||Nagercoil,||Housing projects pose threat to bird sanctuary||Lush, green paddy fields interspersed with banana and coconut groves stretch endlessly from one side of Parakkai Kulam, Kooni Kulam and Suchindram Kulam in Kanniyakumari district. They offer a habitat for native and migratory birds around the protected zone of the Suchindram Theroor Bird Sanctuary. However, with real estate sharks in the process of converting some wetlands into housing plots, the bird habitat has come under threat. If the development goes unchecked, not only the sanctuary but also the people in nearby habitations will suffer as on the bed of Parakkai Kulam and Kooni Kulam lie innumerable borewells dug by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) for supplying drinking water to the neighbouring villages. C. Kosalai, president of Parakkai Panchayat, has woken up to the threat posed by real estate sharks. “I recently set out to prevent the owner of a wetland from creating a pathway to an area he had proposed to convert into housing plots,” she said. “He denied having any such plans. But he had already divided the land into plots and sold them to a few individuals,” said Ms. Kosalai, who has put up boards on wetlands stating that land use conversion would not be permitted by the panchayat. “I have been resisting the real estate lobby,” she added. She pointed out that as early as in 2010, then Kanniyakumar Collector Rajendra Ratnoo had, following the depletion of the groundwater table due to indiscriminate conversion of wetlands for housing projects, issued an order directing the village administrative officers (VAOs) not to grant permission for construction activities on wetlands. But the order has seldom been followed. Already, the paddy fields irrigated by Putheri Kulam have become concrete patches. “I have refused to sell my fields to the real estate lobby. They have surrounded my paddy fields with constructions, and have even been preventing water from flowing into my fields,” said Satha Sakthi, a native of Putheri. His efforts had previously led to the removal of the local panchayat president and vice-president for granting permission for housing plots. In Parakkai, a 20-foot road divides the waterbody and the paddy fields, and behind the area marked for real estate development runs a canal carrying water to the fields for irrigation. “The first casualty will be the canal. It will be polluted by the residents if housing permission is granted,” Ms. Kosalai said. The real estate lobby circumvents the Collector’s order using a time-tested method. First, they will cultivate plantain and coconut in the paddy field. In two years, they will remove the banana crop and nurture the coconut. Later, the area will be levelled for a housing layout. “But you have to get permission even to change the crop in Kanniyakumari district, as the purpose of changing the crop is to create housing plots,” said Lal Mohan, convener, Nagercoil chapter of the Indian National Trust for Culture and Heritage, who has been fighting similar issues in the district legally. Ornithologist Rober Grubh said the conversion of wetlands into housing plots would have a heavy bearing on birds’ habitat. “All the wading birds in the waterbodies go outside to feed and come back. Not just the sanctuary, but the areas around it should also be protected,” Mr. Grubh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/housing-projects-pose-threat-to-bird-sanctuary/article32768742.ece
05 October 2020||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,||Police top brass meet on Maoist movement||To chart out a coordinated action plan to foil attempts by Maoists to gain ground in vast tribal belt stretching along the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, a high-level meeting involving the top officials of the Telangana and Chhattisgarh State police forces and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was held in Venkatapuram of the tribal dominated Mulugu district on Sunday. The meeting was attended by CRPF Director-General A.P. Maheshwari, Senior Security Advisor in the Home Ministry K. Vijay Kumar, Telangana DGP M. Mahender Reddy, Chhattisgarh’s Bastar Range Inspector General of Police P. Sundarraj, Superintendents of Police (SPs) of the bordering districts of both Telangana and Chhattisgarh, among others, sources said. The meeting reportedly lasted for more than two hours late on Sunday afternoon.  Operational strategies It discussed threadbare operational strategies such as strengthening intelligence network, better coordination between the CRPF and the State police forces for effectively tackling Maoists and thwarting attempts by the rebels to revive their activities in the forested border region between Telangana and Chhattisgarh, sources added. The high-level meeting in the border mandal comes close on the heels of reported movement of Maoists in the Agency areas of Mulugu and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts, which share a border with areas of Maoist influence in Chhattisgarh, in the last few days. The Telangana’s tribal heartland of Bhadrachalam Agency witnessed several instances of skirmishes between the rebels and the police in the recent past.   As many as eight Maoists were killed in separate incidents of “exchange of fire” with the police in Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Asifabad Kumram Bheem districts last month. The Maoists observed a State bandh on September 28 in protest against what the rebels termed “fake encounter killing” of its eight cadres. The meeting is understood to have discussed strategies to bolster coordination for effective vigil and deployment of forces along all the possible entry points in the porous forested border region to curb Maoist activities on Telangana-Chhattisgarh border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-top-brass-meet-on-maoist-movement/article32769294.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||No signs of intercourse, says forensic report||In its final opinion on the condition of the Hathras victim, the Department of Forensic Medicine of Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JNMCH) has said there were no signs suggestive of vaginal or anal intercourse. It further said there was evidence of physical assault (injuries on the neck and the back). The report prepared on Saturday and signed by Dr. Sadiya Saeed, chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine, said it was in reference to the FSL report number 4807-Bio-2020, conducted at the government lab in Agra. The FSL report said the investigation did not find any sperm in the samples. This has come after the medico-legal case (MLC) report prepared at the JNMCH on September 22 noted “complete penetration” and “loss of consciousness at the time of the incident”. The opinion of the doctor in the MLC said, “on the basis of the local examination, I am of the opinion that there are signs of use of force, however, opinion regarding penetrative intercourse is reserved pending availability of FSL reports.” Hamza Malik, president of the AMU’s Resident Doctors’ Association, said the final opinion was based on the FSL report. “The forensic examination was conducted on September 22, eight days after the incident. In cases of rape, according to government guidelines, the forensic samples should be collected within 72 hours of the incident. Sperms can’t survive after more than 90 hours,” he said. He said if the observations in the MLC report are read with certain findings in the autopsy report, the picture would be different. “Besides, how could you discount the dying declaration of the victim which is crucial in such cases.” The referral slip of Hathras hospital prepared on September 14 said as the girl was in a serious condition, no MLC was done before referring her to the JNMCH. Sources in the Aligarh hospital said as the girl was unconscious because of a fracture in C6 vertebrae, nobody thought of physical examination of the victim’s private parts. “Usually, we do it when the police or the family complain of sexual assault. In this case, maybe because of social pressures, the family didn’t say anything to this effect where she was admitted,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-signs-of-intercourse-says-forensic-report/article32768679.ece

05 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Crucial GST Council meet today||Kerala has decided to stick to its stance to reject the two options presented by the Union government for paying out this year’s compensation to the States on account of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will chair the Council’s 42nd meeting on Monday, where possible solutions are expected to be discussed to resolve the impasse over compensation. The Centre has claimed the support of 21 States on its proposal that the States should borrow from the market to meet the compensation shortfalls from GST revenue. The Centre has estimated a Rs. 2.35-lakh crore shortfall in cess collections used to recompense the States, while compensation payments of Rs. 3 lakh crore are due this year. It has argued that only Rs. 97,000 crore of this shortfall can be attributed to GST implementation, while the rest is due to the unprecedented economic stress arising from the pandemic. Ten Opposition-ruled States, including Kerala, are yet to agree to the proposals which envision States raising Rs. 97,000 crore via a special borrowing window to be created by the central bank, or borrowing the entire Rs. 2.35-lakh crore shortfall in compensation cess collections from the market. Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said there can be no bifurcation of revenue shortfall for compensation purposes as due to pandemic and due to implementation of GST. “The entire shortfall needs to be compensated and it is the the constitutional right of the States. The compensation cannot be linked to normal borrowing or additional borrowing limits allowed to them,” he said. Kerala, the first State to speak out against the Centre’s proposals, will stick to the stance that both the options infringe upon the above two cardinal principles and are not acceptable. “We would outright reject all notions that States refusing to make the choice will lose their GST compensation till 2022,” Dr. Isaac said. Once the Centre accepts these two basic principles, the State is willing to discuss and arrive at a consensus regarding who borrows and in what proportion, what amount to be borrowed and what amounts need to be deferred to 2022. Extending the compensation cess levy from five years to facilitate repayments on borrowings can also be discussed. There is a need to implement interim measures while the larger issues are discussed, as it is important that at least a part of the compensation to the States be paid immediately, given the shortfall in the revenues of the States and financial crunch, he said. If there is no consensus in the GST Council on the negotiable issues, Dr. Isaac said the legal provisions for a Dispute Resolution Mechanism within the Council should be activated without delay. The long-standing demand of the States to appoint a Vice-Chairperson to the GST Council should be considered and implemented at the earliest, he urged. The CAG audit report findings about the Centre incorrectly parking compensation cess collections in the Consolidated Fund of India, over the first two years of GST implementation, are also likely to be raised by some Opposition-ruled States. Dr. Isaac said the Central government’s approach had pushed the economy to the brink of disaster. “The actions cannot be viewed in isolation. There is significant erosion of trust. Circumstances point to a situation where the Centre’s actions are constricting the States’ resources and their financial autonomy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crucial-gst-council-meet-today/article32768683.ece
05 October 2020||Ghaziabad,||No signs of intercourse, says hospital report||In its final report on the Hathras victim, the Department of Forensic Medicine of the Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JNMCH) has said there were no signs suggestive of vaginal or anal intercourse. It, however, said there was evidence of physical assault (injuries over the neck and the back). The forensic report prepared on Saturday and signed by Dr. Sadiya Saeed, chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine, and assistant professor Faiz Ahmad, said it was in reference to the FSL report number 4807-Bio-2020, conducted at the government lab in Agra. The FSL report had stated that the investigation didn’t find any sperm in the samples. It was on the basis of the FSL report that Additional Director General of Police Prashant Kumar made a statement denying rape in the case on October 1. Hamza Malik, president of the AMU’s Resident Doctors’ Association, said the final opinion was based on the FSL report and denies intercourse, not rape. “The forensic examination was conducted on September 22, eight days after the incident. In cases of rape, according to government guidelines, the forensic samples should be collected within 72 hours of the incident. Sperm can’t survive after more than 90 hours,” he said. He said if the observations in the medico-legal case (MLC) report are read with certain findings in the autopsy report in the light of the new anti-rape law passed after Nirbhaya’s case, the picture would be different. “Besides, how could you discount her statement before the magistrate, which would be treated as the dying declaration of the victim and is crucial in such cases?”  The victim was allegedly brutally assaulted on September 14 by four upper caste men when she went to collect fodder. After a long struggle in JNMCH, she was moved to the Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on September 29. The report counters the MLC report prepared at the JNMCH on September 22, which noted “complete penetration” and “loss of consciousness at the time of the incident” . In the MLC’s opinion column, the doctor noted, “There are signs of use of force... opinion regarding penetrative intercourse is reserved pending availability of FSL reports.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-signs-of-intercourse-says-hospital-report/article32769225.ece

05 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC against involuntary narco tests||Involuntary administration of narco or lie detector tests is an “intrusion” into a person’s “mental privacy”, a Supreme Court judgment of 2010 has held. The judgment is significant amid reports that the Uttar Pradesh government wants to subject the Hathras rape and murder victim’s family members to these tests. The consequences of such tests on “individuals from weaker sections of society who are unaware of their fundamental rights and unable to afford legal advice” can be devastating, the court said. It may involve future abuse, harassment and surveillance, even leakage of the video material to the Press for a “trial by media.” Such tests are an affront to human dignity and liberty, and have long-lasting effects. “An individual’s decision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and there should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with such autonomy,” the apex court had held. The judgment inSmt. Selvi vs State of Karnatakaobserved that involuntary administration of these scientific tests was “sufficient to constitute a custodial environment”. It amounted to a “restraint on personal liberty”. “Law disapproves of involuntary testimony ... It violates the prescribed boundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with a person’s mental processes is not provided for under any statute. It most certainly comes into conflict with the ‘right against self-incrimination’,” the judgment authored by then Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-against-involuntary-narco-tests/article32768670.ece
05 October 2020||BADHNI KALAN (MOGA),||Corporates favoured over farmers: Rahul||Former Congress president and MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday hit out at the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, accusing it of playing into the hands of “big corporates” to compromise the interests of the farming community. Mr. Gandhi, who started the Congress’s three-day ‘tractor rally’ — Kheti Bachao Yatra — against the three recent farm sector laws, said the Congress would repeal them as soon as it returned power. “The Congress is firmly standing with farmers, and I guarantee you that the day when Congress comes to power, we will scrap these three black laws and consign them to the dustbin,” said Mr. Gandhi, before taking off on the tractor rally through Moga and Ludhiana districts. “The Central government is a puppet government, whose strings were in the hands of the Adanis and the Ambanis. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been misleading the nation for the past six years to serve the interests of two or three large corporate houses,” said Mr. Gandhi, citing examples of demonetisation, GST and the debt and tax waiver of big industrialists amid the pandemic, while not giving any monetary aid to the poor and the farmers. “We are with you (farmers) in this fight for their survival and livelihood, which the Modi government was trying to destroy with these draconian laws. Together we will change these laws,” he said. Mr. Gandhi questioned the need to push agriculture sector laws urgently without any discussion in Parliament even as the country was fighting COVID-19. “If the farmers are happy with these legislations, as the Centre government is claiming, then why are they agitating in Punjab and the rest of the country, ” he asked. Dismantling MSP The Congress leader said the new laws were aimed at eventually dismantling the Minimum Support Price (MSP) structure and government procurement system, which he said, would break the backbone of the farmers, just as the British had done to seize control of India. In Jattpura, Mr. Gandhi said the roads which the farmers take their produce to ‘mandis’ have been constructed with the money collected through ‘mandi fee etc., and with the new laws, these ‘mandis’ will be wiped out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/corporates-favoured-over-farmers-rahul/article32768673.ece
05 October 2020||Kozhikode,||Resentment brews in BJP State unit||A section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kerala unit appears to be miffed with exclusion of senior leaders in the recent rejig of the party at the national level. What has rattled this prominent section is not only the exclusion of these leaders but also the elevation of A.P. Abdullakutty as vice president. All along the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) State leadership has been rooting for former State presidents Kummanam Rajasekharan and P.K. Krishnadas to be part of the Central team. Already some leaders have overtly and covertly raised the issue and apprised BJP president J.P. Nadda of a group owing allegiance to one of the factions getting prominence at the helm at the State and national levels. The ongoing rumblings had also come up for discussion at party forums, a BJP functionary said. Another issue is the non-inclusion of Keralite R. Balashankar, co-convener of training and publication of the party in Delhi.  Editor of Organiser   He was earlier the editor of RSS ideological journal Organiser for 11 years and was also head of the BJP national Intellectual Cell till 2015. He has been credited with the idea of projecting Narendra Modi as the face of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. RSS leaders feel that the Central leadership had systematically ignored some of the respected and popular leaders from the State. And the relegation of leaders might have a bearing on the Assembly polls next year. All these years, the BJP Central leadership has not appointed a leader who has good relationship with the Nair Service Society, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and the Church in the State. Neither it has not been able to nurture a leader who has a core support base among the Nair or the Thiyya/Ezhava communities, sources said.  Wooing tactics The resentment comes when the Central leadership has started wooing leaders from other parties with the elevation of Mr. Abdullakutty at the national level. Perhaps it may want the State unit to have a multi-polar image ahead of the coming Assembly polls. But the national leadership has to set the State unit in order before trying to appease aspiring turncoats, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/resentment-brews-in-bjp-state-unit/article32768966.ece
05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Post-pandemic stress mistaken for cardiac issues||A pounding heart giving sense of imminent heart attack or other cardiac problem — is making people suffering from these symptoms are consulting specialist doctor through video calls. Cautioning that only detailed examinations and diagnostic reports helps them to come to a conclusion on the actual cause of the the problem, a cardiologist said that stress and anxiety, triggered by various reasons, could give a sense of abnormal heart rhythm. A senior consultant cardiologist at KIMS Hospitals, B. Hygriv Rao, cited the case study of a 25-year-old man from Chhattisgarh who complained of palpitations. He had no cardiac issues before and was otherwise healthy. New normal “This young man’s lifestyle represents the new normal. He works from home, rarely goes out, off socialisation and reads COVID statistics on the internet. It didn’t take me long to realise this gentleman had no cardiac problem and needed reassurance and few days of medication for his anxiety,” the cardiologist said. When a patient with the complaint consults them, the specialist doctors checks background, lifestyle, information on vitals, ECG report, to know if the patient is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia, heart problem, or if it was just a false alarm induced by stress, anxiety. Consulting a doctor helps to know reason behind abnormality. Job insecurity, uncertainty about future, financial distress, fear of contracting COVID-19 and other problems associated with it are some of the problems building up stress in people. Dr. Rao suggested that counselling by trained psychologists will help those who suffer from such anxiety induced false alarms. Two types of patients He pointed out that there are two categories of COVID-19 patients who might genuinely suffer from cardiac problems. The first set of people are those with pre-existing cardiac issues which worsen after contracting COVID-19. The second are those who develop cardiac issues after getting the infectious disease. However, there have been many cases of cardiac patients who contracted COVID-19 and have recovered at Telangana government hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-inducing-symptoms-of-cardiac-problems/article32768651.ece

The Guild said the victim was cremated without the presence of her family members. “Equally reprehensible is the way the government has tapped the telephones of journalists covering the Hathras incidents. Worse, the tapped conversation has been selectively leaked, leading to a social media calumny against them,” it said. ‘Growing trend’ The Guild, in a statement, said: “Not allowing the media to visit the incident spots and tapping the phone conversation of journalists undermine and obstruct the functioning of the media. The Guild demands that the government create conditions in Hathras that do not obstruct journalists in any way.” “Hathras is the worst such case in the scale of interference, but the Guild also notes with concern that such attacks against the media are becoming part of a growing trend seen in recent months, in which a few other State governments have also indulged in such harassment of journalists. The Guild condemns these and demands corrective action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/editors-guild-slams-curbs-on-media/article32768668.ece

Another jawan was injured seriously in the ambush around 9 a.m. near Hetlong village under the Jairampur police station limits. No group has taken responsibility, but district officials and the security forces suspect that 30 to 35 members of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent, headed by Paresh Baruah, and the Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) had carried out the attack. “A water tanker of the 19 Assam Rifles that was travelling to Hetlong village to fetch water came under attack,” Changlang District Magistrate Devansh Yadav said. “We received reports that there was an explosion, but this cannot be confirmed until we receive the autopsy report. In all likelihood, the death was caused by bullet.” A defence spokesperson said the injured jawan was admitted to a government hospital in Changlang. It was not immediately known how many personnel were travelling in the water tanker. In May 2019, suspected NSCN-K militants had carried out a similar attack on an Assam Rifles water tanker in Nagaland’s Mon district in which two were killed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jawan-killed-in-arunachal-ambush/article32768691.ece

Fight against Google The move comes at a time when Mr. Sharma, among several other Indian start-up founders, has been at the forefront of voicing displeasure against Google over the U.S. company’s requirement that apps use Play Store’s billing system for in-app purchases of digital goods. As per Paytm, more than 300 app-based service providers, such as Decathlon, Ola, Park+, Rapido, Netmeds, 1MG, Domino’s Pizza, FreshMenu and NoBroker had already joined its new programme that comes with a developer dashboard for analytics and payments collection along with various marketing tools to engage with the users.  12 million visits “This app store has been running in beta with select users and witnessed over 12 million visits in September,” the company said, adding that listing and distribution of these mini apps within Paytm would be provided free of charge. Further, the app developers will be able to give a choice of Paytm Wallet, Paytm Payments Bank, UPI, net-banking and cards to their users for carrying out payments. Last month, Google had also briefly removed Paytm from its Play Store, citing a violation of its policy on gambling. Paytm had at the time called upon the Indian start-up ecosystem and developers to “think the bigger question”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paytm-to-open-mini-app-store-for-indian-developers/article32769228.ece

The calf had fractures on its forelimbs and it could not stand. The calf was found near Malali in Sakleshpur taluk. For the first two days after it was born, the mother was around and nobody could reach the calf. The local people and the Forest Department staff noticed the calf struggling to stand. They could reach near the calf only on Saturday, when the mother moved a few metres away. Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu , “The calf had no milk from the mother since its birth, as it could not stand. The staff took care of the calf and fed lactose. Muruli, the veterinarian, provided the calf with saline and glucose. Later we took the calf for scanning at the Veterinary College in Hassan.

The hospital was only conducting emergency surgeries so far. It began out-patient services on June 24. Hospital director B.L. Sujatha Rathod told The Hindu that the plan was to start off with 15-20 surgeries per day. “Usually during the pre-COVID-19 days, we were conducting over 100 surgeries. Now, we will limit the daily number of surgeries till our staff get adjusted to operating with PPEs. Also, our staff are being trained on the additional precautions that they need to take now,” she said. The hospital had stopped its regular functioning when Victoria Hospital was converted into a COVID-19 facility during the early days of the pandemic. Nearly 100 beds in Minto were also set aside for COVID-19 patients. ‘Patient flow is minimal’ “Although we have resumed our OPD services, the patient flow is minimal as people are generally scared to visit hospitals. Our daily patient flow of over 600 during pre-COVID-19 days has reduced to less than 100 now. Although we were open for emergency surgeries, we have not done more than six surgeries in the last month,” the director said. She said all the operation theatres in the hospital had been fumigated and tests for culture growth had been done. “Some reports have come and they are negative. A few more are expected in a day or two. We want to ensure patients do not catch any infection within the hospital. As it is not uncommon for fungal growth to happen in any centralised air-conditioned building that has remained closed for months, we want to be doubly ensure that the operation theatres are fit for use again,” the doctor added.

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||DLSA Warangal helps son reunite with mother||The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) of Warangal has helped reunion of a son with his old-aged mother, a widow, a year after he went missing from Kazipet following his mental illness. The reunion is more heartening to the mother as her son came back to her after recovering from his illness at State Mental Health Hospital at Sendari in Bilaspur of Chhattisgarh. According to Secretary of the DLSA G.V. Mahesh Nath, a Senior Civil Judge in the District Courts, Aruri Shekar of Kazipet, who was suffering from mental illness, went missing from his house on September 19 last year. After the vain efforts of his mother Aruri Komuramma to trace him, she lodged complaint with the Kazipet police and a man-missing case was registered but to no avail. However, a communication received by Telangana State Legal Services Authority from its Chhattisgarh counterpart on September 21 (last month) has set-off the exercise for reunion in motion. On getting a letter from the SLSA to trace the details of one Shashi Kumar (the name given to Mr. Shekhar by the authorities at Sendari Hospital in Chhattisgarh) of Kazipet, who was given treatment for his mental illness at the Chhattisgarh hospital, Chairman of DLSA Warangal, K. Jayakumar, Principal District Judge, asked the DLSA official to trace the details of the person. The hospital authorities wanted him to be sent back to his home as he had recovered from his mental illness after finding from him that he belonged to Kazipet. In spite of the incomplete details – no specific address and changed name – details the staff of DLSA could trace the address and the family details of Mr. Shekar, taken treatment as Shashi Kumar in Chhattisgarh, within a day. Mother of Mr. Shekar appeared before the DLSA on September 22 and identified the person (Shashi Kumar’ photograph) as her son and also confirmed the details. She requested the DLSA to arrange for getting back her son from Chhattisgarh considering her old age and financial constraints. The efforts to get back Mr. Shekar to Kazipet proved fruitful as he arrived at the railway station on October 3 (Saturday) and was received by DLSA authorities. Mr. Shekar was reunited with his mother.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dlsa-warangal-helps-son-reunite-with-mother/article32768858.ece
05 October 2020||Bengaluru,||ED summons Kerala CPI(M) leader’s son in drugs case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED), probing the finances involved in a narcotics racket that was recently busted by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the city, has summoned Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of Kerala CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan for interrogation. He has been asked to present himself before the agency in the city on October 6, Tuesday. The NCB had busted a narcotics ring and arrested two peddlers from a flat in Kalyan Nagar on August 21 - Mohammed Anoop and R. Ravindran, both from Kerala. NCB sleuths had seized 145 Ecstasy pills from the flat. Their interrogation and follow-up action based on the leads they provided led to large seizures and arrest of another peddler Anikha D., whose clientèle included many from the Kannada film industry. The ED, which is looking into the finances of these peddlers and their sources for money laundering and hawala transactions, had recently conducted an audit of their finances, questioned them and recorded their statements at Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where they are currently lodged. “Mohammed Anoop in his statement has said Bineesh Kodiyeri had lent him Rs. 50 lakh. We will question him as to what are his links with a peddler, for what purpose was the money given, what was the source of this money and whether he has declared it in his financial statements,” a senior ED official said.  Gold smuggling case The ED had earlier questioned Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with the gold smuggling case in which gold was being smuggled through diplomatic channels at the Thiruvananthapuram airport, in Kerala on September 9. In documents submitted to a court in Kerala, the ED has claimed there are suspicions that the accused in the drug racket busted by NCB in Bengaluru may have helped accused in the gold smuggling case in Kerala.  The NCB had busted a narcotics ring and arrested two peddlers, hailing from Kerala, in August||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-summons-kerala-cpim-leaders-son-in-drugs-case/article32768887.ece

05 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Airport stamp caused allergy’||Former Congress MP and party spokesperson Madhu Goud Yaskhi on Sunday raised questions about the quality of indelible ink used at the Indira Gandhi International airport in Delhi to stamp passengers arriving from abroad, who have to undergo compulsory home quarantine. The Congress leader complained that he had an allergic reaction to the ink. Mr. Yakshi took to Twitter, posting images of a badly swollen forearm where he had been stamped. In wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had started stamping passengers coming from abroad in March. The stamp states “Proud to protect Delhiites. Home quarantined,” and has a date showing when the person was stamped. “Dear @HardeepSPuri Ji, can you please look into the chemical being used at Delhi airport for stamping on passengers coming from abroad? Yesterday I was stamped at @DelhiAirport and this is how my hands look now,” Mr. Yakshi tweeted, tagging Union Civil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. The Minister was quick to respond. Mr. Puri tweeted, “Thank you for drawing my attention to this. I have spoken to the CMD Airport Authority of India.” DIAL also responded, expressing regret and informed Mr. Yaskhi that Delhi State authorities had been informed. “Currently, this batch of ink is being kept aside for testing by the supplier and further desired action. Thank you for highlighting this issue,” DIAL tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/airport-stamp-caused-allergy/article32769283.ece
05 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘SC orders violated in Chardham project’||The chairman of a Supreme Court-appointed expert committee has alleged violations of the court orders in the execution of the Chardham road project — a 900 km, Rs. 12,000 crore enterprise to connect pilgrimage spots in Uttarakhand. A controversial aspect was the proposed width of the two-lane highways envisaged. The SC committee was divided over the width, with one set of members saying that it can only be 5.5 metre wide and another insisting on a higher width. The top court ruled last month that a width of 5.5 metre be enforced as it was in conformity with a 2018 recommendation of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for mountain roads. The MoRTH is also the key coordinator of the Chardham project. Prior to this, the government had sanctioned a road width of 10-12 metre. “I’m shocked to see that the Intermediate Width design [of 5.5 m] will only be used for stretches where work has not begun and work where hill cutting has been done and where plantation and other mitigation measures have to be undertaken as per the court orders. The same was confirmed to me on the phone by Pariyojana chief engineer, in charge of MoRTH regional office,” Ravi Chopra, chairman of the High Powered Committee (HPC), said in a letter to the Secretary, MoRTH, and the Secretary, Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change. “Further I’m getting reports from concerned people that hill cutting and destruction of forests are on now in full swing.” The letter — sent as an email and viewed by The Hindu — was written on September 28 but no responses were furnished as of Sunday evening, according to sources familiar with the matter. Mr. Chopra demanded that the officials explain how these contraventions were ongoing. The 900 km stretch has been broken up into 53 contracted road projects. About 700 km had already been tendered out this way and work had commenced. “What we are hearing is that the MoRTH has allowed the 700 km road projects to continue with the old 10 metre width and only in the remaining 200 km roads would the new narrow width apply. This is a clear contravention of the Supreme Court orders which said that the road width must apply to the entire stretch,” Hemant Dhyani, environment activist and HPC member, told The Hindu . Where hills had already been cut (in the 700 km stretch), space beyond 5.5 metre should be adjusted to make walkways for pilgrims, plantations and safety barriers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-orders-violated-in-chardham-project/article32768687.ece
05 October 2020||GUWAHATI,||AIUDF joins hands with Congress||The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) led by perfume baron Maulana Badruddin Ajmal will contest the 2021 Assam Assembly election in alliance with the Congress and the Left Front. The decision to accept the proposal from the Congress was taken at the core committee meeting of the party held here on Saturday. “The meeting was delayed because of the COVID-19 restrictions. Our president [Mr Ajmal] gave his assent to joining hands with the Congress and other like-minded, secular political parties that have opposed the Citizenship [Amendment] Act,” AIUDF spokesperson Haider Hussain Bora said. “The AIUDF’s approval for taking on the BJP together has paved the way for a mahajoot [grand alliance],” Congress spokesperson Rhituparna Konwar said, adding that the Communist Party of India, the CPI (Marxist) and the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) had come on board the anti-BJP alliance.  Grand alliance The two parties had discussed the possibility of a grand alliance almost two months ago. But there were differences on the issue of projecting the chief ministerial candidate. The issue is now likely to be discussed after the “grand alliance” is in a position to form the government. Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the 126-member Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, on Sunday reminded the new regional parties that the BJP could return to power if not stopped together. “Some regional parties of Assam have virtually become defunct while a few new ones have been formed with the avowed goal of dislodging the BJP in the 2021 elections. I wish them all the best, but the BJP will return to power if the anti-BJP forces fail to forge a united front before the Assembly poll,” Mr. Saikia said. He said this with reference to the Raijor Dal, the political party that peasant rights leader Akhil Gogoi’s group, the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, and its associates launched on October 2. The Congress leader also alluded to the Asom Jatiya Parishad that two influential students’ organisations — the All Assam Students’ Union and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad — had formed in September. Two other regional parties were formed earlier this year, one of which merged with the AJP. The Congress has 23 MLAs in the 126-member Assembly, while the AIUDF has 14. The BJP leads the table with 60 legislators in the ruling alliance followed by the Asom Gana Parishad with 14 and the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) with 12. Bodo accord The BPF’s relationship with the BJP has soured since the signing of the Bodo Peace Accord in January. The accord was signed with a set of armed groups that had been rivals of the BPF leader, most of whom were members of the now-disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aiudf-joins-hands-with-cong-for-assam-poll/article32768689.ece

Violence, killings of innocents should be condemned, whether it’s the killings of common people or security forces. I appeal to all to contribute towards peace.” Mr. Sinha said during his visit to Ashthal in Kulgam as part of the ongoing “Back to Village-3” programme. Referring to the Rs. 1,951 crore that had been earmarked for the development of villages, he said the agriculture and the horticulture sectors have been provided Rs. 1,872 crore, which is Rs. 680 crore more compared to the previous year. “I am working on four key points for the development of J&K: accelerating growth, providing benefits of social security and social welfare schemes to all, eliminating regional disparities and effective execution of works,” the L-G said. “I have brought the government to your doorsteps. Now, you shall decide the works to be completed and to be taken up on priority. The ‘Back to Village’ is a celebration of people’s participation in development.” Mr. Sinha said, adding that he was surprised to notice unwarranted delays in projects when he took over as the L-G. “I will ensure that those responsible for unwarranted delays will be made answerable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-cant-be-selective-in-condemning-violence/article32768693.ece

Economic indicators allude to a steady recovery in almost all sectors, with some sectors shooting above their previous-year levels as well. This is despite headwinds of increasing COVID cases in non-metro cities and rural areas and rising food prices,” the Ministry said in its economic review for September. “Data from September 17 to 30 suggests that India may have crossed the peak of COVID-19 case-load. During this period, the seven-day moving average of daily positive cases has steadily declined from about 93,000 to 83,000, while the seven-day moving average of daily tests have risen from about 1,15,000 to 1,24,000,” the review said. Terming the partial recovery as proof of “positive results” from the AtmaNirbhar Bharat package, the review said the structural reforms by the government could combat the “downside risk to short-term and medium-term growth” posed by the spread of the virus. Among signs of a recovery in industrial output and manufacturing, the Ministry listed the positive growth in exports, recorded in September for the first time since March and the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index hitting the highest point since January 2012 in September. Contraction in output of eight core sectors was lower in July and August than the 12.9% reported in June, and output prices rose for the first time in six months, reflecting an uptick in input costs, the Ministry pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finmin-says-virus-past-peak-predicts-growth/article32768644.ece

A delegation led by Samajwadi Party leader Dharmendra Yadav met the family of the victim and demanded that, as per the wishes of the kin, the case be probed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. “The administration is being made a scapegoat. The people actually responsible are sitting in Lucknow,” Mr. Yadav said. Action against DM Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati and Ms. Vadra also demanded action against the District Magistrate of Hathras and a probe into his role in the entire incident which culminated in the rushed late night cremation of the victim by the police, allegedly without permission from her family. Ms. Mayawati said the Uttar Pradesh government’s “mysterious silence” on the allegations of intimidation levelled against the Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar by the family of the victim was “sad and worrisome”. Though the government has agreed to a CBI probe, how can an impartial probe be conducted with the DM still posted there, she asked. Ms. Vadra, who visited the victim’s family with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders on Saturday, also targeted Mr. Laxkar and asked who was protecting him. She demanded that he be immediately removed and his role in the episode investigated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/upper-caste-group-backs-hathras-accused/article32768645.ece

Though in the past there were discussions in society about the closure of government schools, now they were being improved, resulting in them attracting more students, he said. Mr. Vijayan was speaking after dedicating 90 schools as “Centres of Excellence” and laying the foundation stone virtually for 54 school buildings on Saturday as part of the government’s Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign to protect the public education system in the State. He said the government was implementing changes in the field of school education, keeping in mind the next generation. “In the past, society discussed the closure of government schools but now that they have become centres of excellence, the number of students coming to study has also increased.

The other two candidates being tested by Zydus Cadilla and Bharat Biotech are in phase-2 trials. Normally vaccines take years to be tested and released but governments and regulators worldwide have allowed accelerated procedures to expedite vaccine availability. Dr. Vardhan has earlier said on multiple occasions that a vaccine is likely to be ready by “early next year.” The government was also keeping an eye on immunity data with regard to COVID-19 disease while finalising plans on vaccine distribution. A committee led by NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul was drawing up the entire process. Vaccine procurement was being done centrally and each consignment would be tracked real time until delivery to ensure it reached those who needed it most, the Minister said. “Even if we have multiple vaccines available, they will all be safe and will elicit the requisite immune response against novel coronavirus,” he added. “People tire out when they have to constantly take precautions. Some of them also give up taking precautions for various reasons. My message to everyone is that we must all diligently take precautions,” Dr. Vardhan said. India now had the capacity to conduct 1.5 million tests a day with a million tests, on average, conducted during the weekend. There were 101,782 deaths, 9.3 lakh active cases and so far, 6.5 million had tested positive for the virus since March, according to the figures as of Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/1-in-5-indians-may-be-vaccinated-by-july-2021/article32768648.ece

An announcement on seats and candidates is expected once the BJP sorts out its seat arrangements with the JD(U) and Jiten Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha. The LJP’s decision is a culmination of many months of a belligerent campaign by Mr. Paswan against Bihar CM and JD(U) head Nitish Kumar. Mr. Paswan had accused Mr. Kumar of taking forward the saat nischey or “seven promises” agenda that was originally part of the RJD-JD(U) government in 2015. Mr. Paswan had started work on his party’s own vision document — “Bihar First, Bihari First” — and at Sunday’s meeting all leaders backed this document. The party has decided to base its campaign on this document. Mr. Paswan had also accused Mr. Kumar of not listening to feedback from alliance partners, going to the extent of saying that for over a year he has not spoken to Bihar CM as the latter refused to reply to any of his letters or respond to phone calls.

The form required to opt for the postal ballot would be delivered at the residence of all those aged above 80 and people with disabilities by the booth level officer under his polling station. It would be up to these two categories of voters to opt for postal ballot. “If he/she opts for postal ballot, then the BLO will collect the filled-in form 12-D from the house of the elector within five days of the notification and deposit it with the returning officer forthwith,” according to the October 3 letter sent by EC to all State chief electoral officers. These instructions have been issued based on the feedback the poll panel received from civil society and media during its visit to poll-bound Bihar last week. The EC said the fresh instructions would be applicable to all elections and byelections. As per the instructions, the returning officer would deploy polling teams, which will deliver and collect the postal ballot on pre-informed dates and then deposit it with the returning officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ec-announces-new-rules-for-postal-ballot/article32768675.ece
05 October 2020||New Delhi,||Will stage satyagraha today: Cong.||Continuing its campaign against the Yogi Adityanath government for the brutal gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl from Hathras, the Congress will hold satyagrahas in district headquarters across the country on Monday. Party workers will stage silent sit-ins at the statues of Mahatma Gandhi or B.R. Ambedkar, it said. In a statement, K.C. Venugopal, general secretary (organisation), said the incident had shaken the conscience of the nation. “The brazen inhumanity and high-handedness shown by the BJP government of U.P. in denying basic dignity to the victim even in death and afterwards towards the family has left everyone beyond shock,” he said. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and State in-charge Priyanka Gandhi were stopped on the Delhi-U.P. border on Thursday when they first tried to meet the victim’s family. They were allowed to meet the family on Saturday after another face-off with the police. “In our continued effort to provide justice to the victim’s family, the party has decided to hold satyagrahas on Monday,” Mr. Venugopal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-stage-satyagraha-today-cong/article32768677.ece

05 October 2020||Belagavi,||Lyricist Kalyan blames ‘astrologer’ for turmoil in his family||Kannada film lyricist K. Kalyan has alleged that an “astrologer” had abducted his wife and parents-in-law. He said at a press conference here on Sunday that he had filed a police complaint against Shivanand Wali, a self-proclaimed astrologer from Bilagi in Bagalkot district, currently living in Belagavi. Mr. Kalyan, in the complaint, said that Mr. Wali had abducted his wife, Ashwini, and her parents, Radhika and Krishna Satvik. It was alleged in the complaint, filed on Saturday, that Mr. Wali had hypnotised the trio and forced Mr. Krishna to transfer Rs. 19.8 lakh to his bank account. The “astrologer” had also forced Mr. Krishna to transfer his property to him, Mr. Kalyan said. Under the influence of the “astrologer”, the Satviks and their daughter had left Bengaluru and were living in Belagavi, the lyricist alleged. The Satviks, who hail from Belagavi, had shifted to Mr. Kalyan’s residence last year. Mr. Kalyan charged that Ganga Kulkarni, a cook in his house in Bengaluru, had sowed the seeds of discord in his family. The cook and the “astrologer” allagedly influenced Ms. Ashwini, resulting in her treating Mr. Kalyan as a stranger. He, however, said that he loved his wife and was hopeful of a reconciliation. “I am sure her behaviour will change if she is counselled. I am confident of regaining her affection. I will write a love song for her and and make her sing it,” he said. Investigating officers, meanwhile, said Ms. Ashwini had contradicted Mr. Kalyan’s claims. She met inspector B.R. Gaddekar of Mala Maruti police station and told him that the couple were facing problems in their marriage. She also dismissed the charge of abduction, the police said. She alleged that her husband had subjected her to mental agony and was not carrying out some marital responsibilities. The couple are fighting a divorce case in the family court in Belagavi. Following Mr. Kalyan’s complaint, Mr. Wali was arrested. Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan said the city police were focusing on the financial transactions and property transfer. “Our officers are trying to find out if it was done under duress or if it was a case of fraud, as has been alleged,” he said. He added that the police would not interfere if the case was of civil nature. He said the women’s helpline in the commissionerate had referred Ms. Ashwini to counsellor Sandeep Patil. Family meetings Meanwhile, family members of Mr. Kalyan on Sunday held a series of meetings to resolve the problem between the lyricist and his spouse. Mr. Kalyan’s brother and sister-in-law met Ms. Ashwini’s parents and other relatives in a bid to end the troubles in the family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lyricist-kalyan-blames-astrologer-for-turmoil-in-his-family/article32768652.ece

Sona, 30, of Moovattupuzha, who was running a dental clinic at Kuttanellur, was stabbed by her business partner Mahesh of Pavaratty last Tuesday. The police said after attacking the doctor, Mahesh escaped in a car. He is absconding. Dr. Sona had lodged a complaint with the police on September 25 against Mahesh following an altercation over financial issues in connection with some interior decoration works. As per the complaint, Mahesh used to threaten the doctor and demand money from her. Mahesh, who was irked by Dr. Sona’s move, stabbed her. She sustained critical injuries in the stomach. Though she underwent surgery, her life could not be saved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/doctor-stabbed-to-death/article32768658.ece
05 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||UDF to resume protests against govt.||The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Sunday flip-flopped on an earlier decision to suspend its agitation against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government given the worrying COVID-19 pandemic situation. Congress leader M.M. Hassan, who took charge as UDF convener recently, clarified that Opposition activists would resume their public protests against the corruption and nepotism of the LDF government within the bounds prescribed by the pandemic prevention protocol. Not more than five people would participate in a demonstration. The protesters would wear masks and observe the physical-distance norm. On October 12 The UDF would stage such pared-down protests against the government in 140 Assembly constituencies on October 12. Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, MP, had on Thursday, questioned the decision of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to suspend mass agitations against the government. He had said the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) was kept in the dark about the resolution. The settlement gave the impression that the Congress had developed cold feet and backed out of the fight. Top leaders were not consulted and the decision appeared arbitrary. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had rejected Mr. Muraleedharan’s charge in their rejoinder later. They said the UDF partners had concurred with the decision. Criticism from CM Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier criticised the Congress and the BJP for organising mass agitations that “imperilled” public health by “accelerating” the spread of the coronavirus. The BJP later stated that it would continue to protest against the government within the limit prescribed by the COVID-19 protocol. Mr. Hassan told newspersons that the government had taken cover behind the pandemic to escape from being held accountable by the UDF. ‘CPI(M), BJP nexus’ The overlapping inquiries by Central agencies into the UAE consulate- linked gold smuggling case had exposed the secret nexus between the CPI(M) and BJP leaders. Mr. Vijayan was beholden to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It could be one reason for the delay in prosecuting Mr. Vijayan in the SNC-Lavalin corruption case. The top leadership of the CPI(M) and the BJP were locked in a secret fraternal relationship, Mr. Hassan alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/udf-to-resume-protests-against-govt/article32768659.ece
05 October 2020||Mysuru,||Rise in surveillance key to wildlife protection in M.M. Hills||Increase in surveillance and monitoring has led to a surge in the detection of poaching cases in M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in recent months. As many as five cases have been detected during September alone, including one of the biggest racket involving trading in wildlife derivatives that has led to the arrest of seven persons so far. Recently, another poacher was nabbed in the Hanur buffer zone and 20 kg of deer meat was seized. The accused, Muruge Gowda of Kanchalli village in Hanur taluk, Chamarajanagar district, was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody. A search is on for four of his accomplices in crime. Villages abutting the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary have a history of poaching for meat. Local residents had a free run during the heyday of brigand Veerappan when the area was out of bounds for the Forest Department. But recently, the wildlife wing and the territorial divisions have reclaimed the administrative writ and have clamped down on poaching. Wildlife activists aver that such crackdown will act as a deterrent and these numbers will decline gradually. “This is a social issue and cannot be resolved overnight but villagers are now aware that killing wildlife for meat is illegal and can land them in prison. Yet, there are individuals who are unable to resist it and this is being addressed through increase in surveillance,” said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. The local intelligence gathering mechanism has also been strengthened and now the authorities have information about individuals with weapons. “We have a list of individuals who own country-made weapons and will ask them to surrender it,” said Mr.Yadukondalu. Though there were similar efforts in the past, the department would fall short in collecting evidence admissible in court and the poachers would go free. “But now we have invited legal experts to train our staff for drafting the case and also collect and present evidence which will increase the conviction rate in the future,” the official said. There are proposals to increase anti-poaching camps in the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, whose notification and upgrade as a tiger reserve is a matter of formality. M.M. Hills is contiguous to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and the BRT Tiger Reserve and is a biodiversity hotspot. Forest protection is the key to ensuring an increase in the number of carnivores like tigers. “We have 40 anti-poaching camps [each manned by five persons] at present and it is proposed to increase it to at least 50,” said Mr. Yedukondalu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rise-in-surveillance-key-to-wildlife-protection-in-mm-hills/article32768662.ece

05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Subscriber base of Kalvi TV YouTube channel crosses 1.6 lakh||The YouTube channel of the School Education Department’s Kalvi TV, which hosts video lessons for students of Classes 1 to 12, has crossed 1.6 lakh subscribers. Apart from being telecast on Kalvi TV and a few private television channels, the video lessons are also being uploaded on the Kalvi TV YouTube channel for students to access at their convenience. “Over 90% of the videos we have are in Tamil, and we are planning to release lessons in English soon,” said P.A. Naresh, joint director, School Education Department, and special officer, Kalvi TV . The telecast of video lessons for Class 11 students began in late September. Similar lessons for all the other classes are being aired on the TV and hosted on the YouTube channel since July, he said. The telecast of lessons began in a bid to reach more students across the State, especially those from government schools who do not have access to online classes, and ensure they continue to learn. While the School Education Department had planned to create 8,000 video lessons meant to be telecast and uploaded online, over 5,000 lessons have already been telecast, and the others are in the works, Mr. Naresh said. A team of teachers from the District Institutes for Education Training (DIETs) and officials from the Department are working on creating the content and recording and checking the video lessons. For students of Class 10 and above who have disabilities, the TV channel has begun telecasting lessons in sign language, and these are being uploaded on the YouTube channel as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/subscriber-base-of-kalvi-tv-youtube-channel-crosses-16-lakh/article32768801.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UPSC prelims held with COVID-19 precautions||The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination was held on Sunday. Students said it was moderately difficult, and those who were retaking the test said it was as tough as it had been the previous year. The exam, that was to be held on May 31, had been postponed to September 30 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved to October 4, despite aspirants seeking further postponement. Safety measures Over 10.58 lakh aspirants across the country had applied for the test. This year, the test was offered in more centres than in the previous years. Candidates had sought more centres as they could not travel due to the lockdown. Over 2,500 sub-centres were set up across 72 centres. Candidates said safety measures such as hand sanitisers and use of masks was mandatory. Their temperature was also measured, and invigilators wore gloves. The test had two components — one on general knowledge and another on aptitude, reasoning and comprehension. The second paper is a qualifying test, while the scores of the first paper are used for qualifying for the UPSC Mains exam. A coach said aspirants from rural backgrounds found the second paper difficult. Kartik Kansal, who has muscular dystrophy, took the test from a centre in Chennai said the paper was on the tougher side. However, he said he faced no difficulty in seeking a change of centre. In July, when the Commission had decided to increase the number of centres, many candidates had flagged the issue of non-receipt of the One Time Password (OTP) or delayed response to their request for changing the centre. Mr. Kansal is currently serving at the Indian Space Research Organisation and is posted in Sriharikota as a scientist. Originally from Uttarakhand, Mr. Kansal had earlier chosen Dehradun as the centre, but changed it to Chennai as he was working in Sriharikota.  Madurai In Madurai out of 7,627 candidates who had registered for the examination, a total of 4,087 candidates were present in the morning session that was held from 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. The attendance marginally dipped in the afternoon session to 53%. A total of 24 visually impaired candidates registered for the examination. As many as 18 inspecting officers were deployed. Six flying squads were formed to ensure there were no instances of malpractices in the examination centres. District Collector T.G. Vinay inspected the conduct of the exam at MSS Wakf Board College. P. Prabhu, a candidate who wrote the exam at Yadava College, said that the exam was difficult when compared to last year. He said that all students were asked to wear face masks and maintain personal distance within the exam halls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upsc-prelims-held-with-covid-precautionary-measures/article32768797.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||50 volunteers get training in monsoon rescue||It is not just the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) personnel who will rush to help during emergencies during the northeast monsoon this season. A 21-year-old woman, a 67-year-old man, a short film cameraman, a hospital employee, and 46 other people from different walks of life are among those who have volunteered to assist the TNFRS in rescue operations. The TNFRS recently started preliminary training for the 50 volunteers. They were taught about the functioning of the Fire and Rescue Services, basic knots and lines, rescue tactics using various equipment, the operation of different TNFRS equipment and snake rescue. Lending a hand The only woman volunteer was Vedhapriya Ganesan, 21. A pet stylist, she was formerly a project assistant with the Central Zoo Authority of India. “I always wanted to be in the uniformed services and was inspired by C. Sylendra Babu, Director, TNFRS. Hence, I volunteer with the Fire Services whenever they are in need,” she said. Another volunteer is B. Narayanan, a 67-year-old security guard at a private hospital at Villivakkam. “I always wanted to help people during emergencies. But youngsters always leave me behind, thinking I am old. Hence this time, I attended the training. It was a really good experience,” Mr. Narayanan said. Priya Ravichandran, Joint Director, Northern Region, TNFRS, said: “It turned out to be a refresher course for the few who were already associated with us. But for the others, it was a new experience.” Ms. Ravichandran said during the northeast monsoon, the volunteers could assist the fire service department in a few rescue calls. “There will be tree falls, animal rescues, wall collapses among other calls that flood our control room. These volunteers can assist us in handling such emergencies,” she said.  It turned out to be a refresher course for a few.

05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stations in Chennai Metro’s phase I extension to be renamed||Chennai Metro Rail stations in the phase I extension project, coming up in north Chennai, may have new names before they are opened to the public early next year. The project will be 9-km-long and will connect Washermenpet with Wimco Nagar. Four stations The names of the stations were decided when the detailed project report was prepared. Washermanpet, Thiyagaraya College, Korukkupet, Tondiarpet, Toll Gate, Thangal, Gowri Ashram, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar were the stations on the route. Four of these are likely to be renamed. Korukkupet station will be renamed Tondiarpet, while the existing Tondiarpet station will become New Washermenpet. Thangal Metro station will be renamed Kaladipet, and Gowri Ashram will become Tiruvottiyur Theradi. Sources said the High Power Committee in the government had approved the renaming. “One of the reasons for changing [the names] may be to use names familiar to the residents of the area,” a source said. All stations are in different stages of construction and the Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) is planning to finish the project by the end of this year or early next year. “Track work is nearly complete and a few key systems for operations will be installed now,” an official said. Renaming of stations has been done a few times in the past, like when the OTA station in Phase I came to be called Nanganallur station. Arignar Anna Alandur Metro, Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G.

05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It is all work and little or no pay for ASHA workers||Every day, Malar (name changed) has to take an 8-km walk on an unmotorable stretch to reach a tribal hamlet. This has been her area of work for almost a decade. An ASHA (accredited social-health activist) worker, Ms. Malar does not mind the daily walks nor the distance. She goes about, carrying out the many health-related tasks assigned to her. But what worries her is the poor pay and lack of recognition. For hundreds of ASHA workers like Ms. Malar, it is a long wait for better pay. Even as their fight for minimum pay — their performance-based incentive is around Rs. 1,500-Rs. 2,000 a month — continues, many of them have not received any amount in the last three to four months. The authorities have cited “insufficient funds” as reason for the same. There are around 3,000 ASHA workers across the State. Their field work in hilly and hard-to-reach areas include conducting follow-ups with pregnant women, including getting them registered for delivery at government set-ups, immunisation of children, checks on adolescent health, health education and community sensitisation. Presently, some of them are also engaged in COVID-19-related work, such as influenza-like illness survey. “I have been working as an ASHA worker since 2010. I cover an interior tribal village that has no motorable road. So it is a 16-km walk to and from my house, every day. My job includes identifying pregnant women, bringing them to antenatal clinics, their registration, taking care of the immunisation of children below the age of five, checking for adolescent anaemia, escorting pregnant women for delivery to government facilities, even during late hours, and visiting them for 42 days in the postnatal period. We continue to carry out these works, but our demands have not been fulfilled,” Ms. Malar noted. An ASHA worker in Kanniyakumari said, “We have not received pay for the last four months. When we asked, the office of the Deputy Director of Health Services told us that there was no funds. We have been demanding a fixed pay of Rs. 18,000 a month, but the government has not even considered our plea.” An ASHA worker and district committee member of AITUC, B. Vasanthakumari, pointed out that earlier, incentives were granted for 32 works. “This has been brought down to nine, and in some districts, incentives are given only for seven to eight works now,” she said. No takers for work Another ASHA worker in Namakkal, on condition of anonymity, said that incentives for works such as creating awareness on family planning and providing vitamin-A supplementation were stopped. “We have not received our pay for three months. As a result, many young girls are not willing to take up work as ASHA workers, or do not stay for long in the job,” she said. G.R. Ravindranath, general secretary, Doctors’ Association for Social Equality, said the State government should fix minimum wages for ASHA workers and make their jobs permanent. “The incentives are not sufficient. The State government should fix a minimum wage of Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000. They should be given special pay for COVID-19-related work,” he said. A Health Department official, when contacted, said he would check on the issue of non-payment of incentives.  The State government should fix a minimum wage of Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000. They should be given special pay for COVID-19-related work G.R.

05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Part of GST Road to be widened soon||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has granted sanction for shifting of utlities on a 13-kilometre-long stretch of the NH45 Chennai-Tiruchi highway, from Guduvanchery to Mahindra City. This is the first step towards the widening of the four-lane road into an eight-lane facility. The State's NH wing will carry out the works on the Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road, said sources in the NHAI. Rs. 230-crore project “These include transplantation of trees and planting new saplings, and will cost Rs. 21.37 crore, which has been sanctioned. The total cost of the widening project would be Rs. 230 crore and will be carried out in three phases,” said an official source. The widening would help reduce accidents on the road, which has many pedestrians crossing it throughout the day. “Both the sides have thick urbanisation, which has also caused local traffic to take the highway. Widening will pave the way for some kind of segregation of vehicles on the busy road,” said another official. T.R. Srivatsan, who runs a coffee outlet near Maduranthakam, said though the distance is only a few kilometers, the time taken to cross it is a lot. “In the mornings, traffic pile-ups happen every few kilometers between 7.30 a.m. and 10 a.m.; in the evenings, it begins by 4 p.m. and goes on till 8 p.m. When buses carrying staffers leave Mahindra City, they stop the traffic on the GST Road. Some kind of solution, and a speedy one, is necessary for that stretch,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/part-of-gst-road-to-be-widened-soon/article32768748.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dairy farmers call for insurance cover for all milch animals||Milk producers in the State have urged the government to ensure universal insurance coverage for all milch animals. Currently, only 10% of the cattle have coverage, causing farmers to bear the losses if an animal without insurance dies. "A cow can cost between Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 40,000, and if it dies it would be a loss of income and investment. Insurance would help in such a case,” said K.A. Sengottuvelu, president, Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association. A former Aavin official said that some ten years ago, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had given funds for insuring milch animals. “However, at present, only about 1.5 lakh cattle of the estimated 14 lakh have been provided coverage through the Tamil Nadu Lifestock Development Agency. Under this, the cost is being borne equally by the Centre, the State government and the milk union,” he said. M.G. Rajendran of the association said it would take only about Rs. 50 crore per year to provide coverage for all the milch animals supplying milk to Aavin. “The amount can be divided between the federation, which is Aavin, the unions, the cooperative society and the farmers. Many unions are earning profits since they only buy and sell milk. They don't convert milk into butter and skimmed milk powder and wait for the prices,” he said. The milk farmers also want Aavin to provide medicines for the cattle, as is being done by some private dairies. “Earlier, Aavin, too, used to provide medicines for the cattle, but now some unions have kept essential medicines for the sake of showing stock,” said a milk producer here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dairy-farmers-call-for-insurance-cover-for-all-milch-animals/article32768750.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hathras case: Kanimozhi to lead candlelight march||The DMK’s women’s wing, led by its secretary Kanimozhi, will take out a protest march on Monday evening to the Raj Bhavan, seeking justice for the Hathras rape victim and urging the Uttar Pradesh government to protect women, minorities and the scheduled tribes in the State, whose safety has been in question, DMK president M.K. Stalin said. Mr. Stalin on Sunday said that Ms. Kanimozhi would lead the march from the Rajiv Gandhi statue in Guindy, to the Raj Bhavan, at 5.30 p.m. on Monday. ‘Protecting the accused’ He said the U.P. government was trying to protect the accused and was creating a situation to help them escape from law. “The incident has created ripples not just in Uttar Pradesh, but across India. The police also stopped Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi when they were trying to meet the victim’s family. What is more atrocious is that the police manhandled Mr. Gandhi, and the visuals of him being pushed to the ground is a blot on India’s democracy. If such treatment is being meted out to Mr. Gandhi, imagine what the situation of the common man would be,” Mr. Stalin said. He said U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should take responsibility for not providing enough security to Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Priyanka when they were allowed to go meet the victim’s family on Saturday. “Claiming to control the Congress cadre, the U.P. police used force against Ms. Priyanka. All this is being done to frighten the people. Democratic and human rights have been thrown to the winds. The Chief Minister should take responsibility for this, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah must give an explanation,” he said. Centre’s responsibility Cases against both the Congress leaders must be withdrawn and the privileges committee of the Parliament must investigate the insult meted out to Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Stalin said. “Minorities, women and the scheduled tribes do not have security in Uttar Pradesh. The media is also understanding the situation there. The Central government has the responsibility to understand this and set the situation right,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hathras-case-kanimozhi-to-lead-candlelight-march/article32768781.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Banned plastics are all over Chennai||With the COVID-19 lockdown relaxed, single-use plastic items, banned by the State government, seem to be flooding the markets from the neighbouring States. The local bodies have been too busy combating COVID-19, and have had no time to enforce the ban. From restaurants to markets, banned plastic carry-bags, cups and straws have made a comeback. On January 1, 2019, the government banned single-use plastic items. Since then, the local bodies, especially corporations and municipalities, have conducted searches, seized these items and fined those selling them. As enforcement was lacking, the products have gradually returned. “Yes, I have started using plastic cups,” said S. Mariappan, a tea vendor on Old Mahabalipuram Road. “When I reopened my shop after the lockdown was relaxed, customers refused to have tea in the glass, worried about COVID-19. So I was forced to switch to plastic cups,” he said. Several other tea stall owners and even those selling fruit juices have embraced plastics. Many hotels, mainly small eateries, are using plastic cups. On Sunday, plastic bags were found in many parts of Chennai, including in key areas like T. Nagar, Sowcarpet, Pondy Bazar, Saidapet and Koyambedu. Vegetable vendors said that consumers wanted plastic carry-bags. “One of my regular customers, who usually carries a jute bag, has been insisting that I give a plastic bag. Since the market is crowded, he is worried about bringing his own bag. Customers can throw away the plastic bags once they reach home,” said a vegetable vendor on Natesan Street. A meat stall owner in Saidapet said that after the 2019 ban, people brought their own containers and vessels, but now they wanted chicken/mutton wrapped in plastic bags. “I managed to source the bags from shops in Pondy Bazaar and Sowcarpet,” he said. ‘Pandemic is priority’ Most shop owners using the banned products said that local bodies across the State had plenty of other work because of the pandemic, and there was no one to monitor them. “The government’s priority is COVID-19 and not plastics,” said a trader on Ranganathan Street, one of the busiest shopping hubs in Chennai. Asked how such huge quantities of plastic items entered the market, S. Rakkappan, president of the Tamil Nadu Plastic Manufacturers’ Association, said all factories that come under the association had stopped making the banned products. “These plastics that you see around are from the neighbouring States and Puducherry.” Shopkeepers selling the banned items said they were sourcing them from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and regions near Mumbai. “There are a few units around Erode that send out these goods on lorries and tempos. With COVID-19, no one has time to monitor these vehicles,” said a trader from Pondy Bazaar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banned-plastics-are-all-over-chennai/article32768786.ece

Additional Commissioner of Traffic N. Kannan told The Hindu that vehicular traffic had increased and fatalities were being reported. “Our analysis reveals that one of the main causes for road accidents is drunken driving. We are curbing drunken driving. The objective is not to punish but to save lives,” he said. Traffic police strictly adhere to standard operating procedures while checking the vehicles. Improve road safety “We will introduce other campaigns as well to improve road safety. We are studying the reasons for traffic congestion and will address the concerns soon. There are plans to introduce road adoption programmes. Under this, traffic violation will not be allowed on a particular stretch,” said Mr. Kannan. Public can complain to traffic police on their WhatsApp number 9003130103 if they find anyone driving under the influence of any substance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-launch-drive-against-drunken-driving/article32769422.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||10 major firms show interest in carrying out Metro Rail phase II tunnelling||Nearly 10 firms, including those from China, have expressed interest in executing carrying out the tunnelling work on a crucial stretch of Chennai Metro Rail phase II project. Among the companies evincing interest are China Railway Tunnel Group, Shanghai Urban Construction Group, L&T, Hindustan Construction Company, Tata Projects, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., and Turkey-based Gulermak. Their representatives attended a pre-bid meeting held. Now, in a few weeks, the companies have to submit their bids, sources said. The mammoth 119-km Rs. 69,000-crore phase II project of the Metro Rail will have underground network and elevated ones. But the focus will be to start the tunnelling work because it takes a long time to finish it. Initial tender At first, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) had floated two tenders for two underground sections — the 9-km Venugopal Nagar-Kellys stretch and another 12-km Kellys-Taramani stretch. According to CMRL officials, the tender should be finalised and awarded in two months. “We are hoping to start the tunnelling work in these two stretches by early next year. The work will commence in different locations simultaneously but we will plan it in such a way that commuters are not put to inconvenience,” an official said. But sources said, owing to COVID-19 pandemic, some companies were apprehensive about coming down to the city and carrying out the construction work. Meanwhile, CMRL will float tenders for building the stations in this 21-km Venugopal Nagar-Taramani stretch. Unless CMRL plans the construction well for this 119-km project and finishes it on time, commuting through key localities of the city will be a major issue for thousands of residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/10-firms-show-interest-in-carrying-out-metro-rail-phase-ii-tunnelling/article32768848.ece
05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin presses for voting for compensation at today’s GST meeting||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday urged the Tamil Nadu government to press for voting at the 42nd GST council meeting slated for Monday (October 5) to compensate the States for the loss of revenue due to the implementation of the tax regime. “The voting should be on the Centre, which has reneged on its promise to compensate the States. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami should realise that merely writing a letter will not secure compensation,” Mr. Stalin said. Recalling Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur’s reply to DMK member P. Wilson that Tamil Nadu’s due was Rs. 11,269 crore, Mr. Stalin said at a time when the State’s finances were in a bad shape, the failure of the Chief Minister to get the Constitutionally guaranteed compensation was dangerous to the financial sovereignty of State. Objection by States Pointing to reports that the GST meeting would discuss borrowings from the market and the extension of time for cess on compensation, Mr. Stalin said many States had objected to the Centre giving up its responsibility. “But the Chief Minister, in his letter, has suggested borrowing by the Centre or releasing the amount from the Consolidated Fund of India to compensate for the implementation of the GST. He has no courage to tell the Centre that its decision was against the rights of the State on finances or to press for voting,” Mr. Stalin said.

This comes almost three years after the State government announced a ban on recruitment by universities to accommodate excess employees from Annamalai University in 2017. Despite protests, the government had insisted that even faculty from the erstwhile private institution would be posted at other government institutions, as it had been taken over by the government. Two faculty — one each for the chemical engineering and civil engineering departments — were posted from the Annamalai University, besides eight non-teaching staff, at the Anna University. Vacancies at the university began to swell. Ban lifted On October 30, 2019, the government lifted the ban on recruitment, paving way for filling the vacancies. Earlier this year, the finance committee of the university approved the recruitment of around 245 persons, including for the position of librarians. 70 professor vacancies There could be as many as 70 vacancies for professors, for which a notification has not been issued, university sources said. Online registration commenced on September 30, and the last date for filing online applications is October 21.

05 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Use number plates complying with MV Act rules: traffic police||In a bid to ensure contactless enforcement in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the Chennai Traffic police will be installing automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the city in the coming days. To ensure that the cameras are able to capture the number plate properly, they have asked motorists to have the registration plates as per Motor Vehicle Act regulations. According to the police, officers find it hard to identify the vehicle on CCTV footage using the number plate as they are in different sizes and are not fixed as per the norms. “This difficulty is faced in cracking law and order offences too,” a senior police officer said. He said the traffic police were trying to implement full contactless enforcement during the pandemic. “The ANPR cameras will be installed across the city as part of the Smart City, Safe City and other projects. This will enable us to track vehicles violating traffic norms using the number plate. So it will be better if they are in the size prescribed by the Motor Vehicle Act,” the officer noted. On Sunday, the traffic police warned motorists to stick to the mandated size while fixing number plates. Action against violators “Action will be taken against motorists using number plates not adhering to the regulations. We have already issued challans to those in violation but enforcement will be stricter going forward,” the officer explained. Vehicles registered after April 1, 2019, should have the high security registration plates. “Action will be taken against those who do not have them,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/use-number-plates-complying-with-mv-act-rules-say-traffic-police/article32768795.ece

At present, 1.79 lakh people are still in home quarantine, including those who had tested positive, their contacts, those in fever clinics and those who travelled to the city. So far, 5.14 lakh people coming from other States or districts have finished quarantine, while nearly 71,000 are still undergoing it. Nearly 3,300 volunteers were pressed into service and they went across the city’s 15 zones to ensure that the people under home quarantine complied with the norms, an official said. Volunteer assistance “From delivering food at their doorsteps to ensuring that they did not step out, these volunteers made a world of difference. In a few cases, volunteers have even gone and fetched water from pumps for those under home quarantine,” he added. As relaxations are put in place around the city, there are some emerging challenges to ensure people do not let their guard down. The Corporation is likely to rationalise the number of volunteers depending on the number of cases and keeping other factors in mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nearly-29-lakh-people-have-completed-home-quarantine/article32769260.ece

A street which is a part of the old town is narrow and the Corporation digging the road had further reduced the moveable space, rues R. Nagarajan, a resident. The Corporation had dug the road more than a month ago as a part of the Rs. 442 crore project to provide underground drainage service to 14 wards that comprise the added areas Kurichi and Kuniamuthur. Mr. Nagarajan said that after digging the road to build manholes and lay pipelines, the Corporation had suspended the work, forcing the residents to tip-toe on the narrow road. And, given the road width, the residents could only walk around and not take out their two-wheelers. He also said that a couple of children who were playing on the street slipped and fell into the pit. J. Daniel, a civil activist, said the Coimbatore Corporation had similarly suspended work on Kurumbar Street, Murugar Kovil Street and a couple of other areas and restored the roads only after the residents took up the issue with the officials concerned. In this case, though it had been around 40 days and the residents had taken up the issue with the officials, the Corporation was yet to complete the work. The residents were left with little choice but to protest if the Corporation further delayed the work, he added. Sources in the civic body said the work was delayed because of the delay in the return of migrant labourers who had moved out during the lockdown period and added that the Corporation would restore the road at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-want-corporation-to-restore-road-at-the-earliest/article32769274.ece

05 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Elderly, people with comorbidities need to take extra caution’||With Coimbatore district witnessing new cases of COVID-19 at a steady pace, the Health Department has urged people aged above 60 and those with comorbidities to be extra cautious as they are more vulnerable to develop severe conditions of the disease upon getting infected. The rationale behind the caution is that aged persons, those who have undergone organ transplantation and those suffering from comorbidities including coronary artery disease, cancer, obesity, renal failure and hypertension are more likely to require care in intensive care units or beds with ventilator support. These are in high demand now. According to Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, people aged above 60 and those suffering from other ailments need to take extra caution though all are bound to follow safety guidelines. He said that adhering to safety guidelines such as use of mask, physical distancing, frequent hand washing and avoiding exposure to crowded places were paramount to combat the disease spread. K. Kolandasamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, also felt that aged and comorbid persons should ensure more caution. According to him, protecting people who are in the vulnerable categories from COVID-19 infection will also reduce casualties caused by the disease. “Asymptomatic patients could be present in the population who become unknown transmitters of the disease. Following safety guidelines is the only means to protect oneself,” he said. The second sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in Coimbatore district to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, result of which was given to the Health Department on September 30, showed that 31 (7.2 %) out of the 428 blood samples collected from the district had IgG antibodies against the virus. According to health officials, this could mean that 31 out of the 428 people, who were randomly examined, had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the viral load could not have been enough to manifest into infection. In the first survey conducted in May, IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 were found in 10 (2.5 %) out of 400 random samples. “The survey result indicates an increase in people’s exposure to the virus in areas from where the samples were collected,” said a health official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elderly-people-with-comorbidities-need-to-take-extra-caution/article32768841.ece

Each package worked out to Rs. 25,000 and the beneficiary would repay it in 12 to 18 months without interest. The funds would be used to support more people. “We target 100 beneficiaries. We are also trying to link them with farmers so that they can procure the vegetables directly from the farms. When we see the efficiency of the model, we plan to expand it (to other products),” he said. The push carts were specially designed to be light weight and yet sturdy.

05 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Authorities’ attention drawn to illegal building completion certificate||In August this year, the Coimbatore Corporation Assistant Commissioner for North Zone issued a letter to an applicant who had sought building completion certificate. The applicant had sought the certificate to avail of power connection, as mandated under the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. The Rules state that completion certificate from the competent authority – local body or local planning authority – was necessary for water, sewerage and power connection for residential buildings with up to three dwelling units measuring not more than 8,000 sq.ft. and less than 12m in height. The Rules also exempt industrial buildings from completion certificates. In his letter, the Assistant Commissioner said the applicant had sought building plan approval for a 1,310 sq.ft. on the ground floor and a similar on the first floor with two dwelling units. And, the applicant had built a building on the ground floor measuring 1,802 sq.ft. with a dwelling unit, a building on the first floor measuring 1,914 sq.ft. With three dwelling units and a stair case room on the second floor measuring 104 sq.ft. The Assistant Commissioner went on to add that the Corporation had assessed the ground floor building and first floor building in two different tax assessments. The Assistant Commissioner’s letter was in gross violation of the letter and spirit of the Rules, said Coimbatore Consumer Cause Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon. The officer had acknowledged the illegality in construction, and by saying that the Corporation has assessed it for tax, seemed to pave way for the Tangedco to provide power connection. This went against the very purpose for which the State government had framed the Rules – check the construction of buildings in violation of rules by denying power, water and sewerage connection. Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the officer's letter also showed that the Coimbatore Corporation did not follow the Rules to issue building completion certificate in a standard format. The Corporation’s tax assessment of building was not the same as issuing building completion certificate. The Coimbatore Consumer Cause had pointed this out to the Corporation and this forced the then Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath to withdraw his letter in this regard. As local body officials still seemed to be unfamiliar with the Rules, his organisation had written to the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department Secretary to look into the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/authorities-attention-drawn-to-illegal-building-completion-certificate/article32769275.ece

05 October 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Residents upset over faulty drainage channel||The residents of Balusamy Nagar in Lakkapuram Panchayat in Modakurichi Union are unhappy with the way the panchayat had constructed a drainage channel in their area. With over 60 houses, the locality lacked basic amenities and sewage was discharged in the open for the last 30 years. The demand for a drainage channel was finally fulfilled with the panchayat constructing a channel for 500 m and the work was completed recently. But the channel was constructed 1.5 metres higher the ground level, while the houses are below the road level. B. Anitha, a resident, said that the drainage channel does not serve the purpose. “The channel is above the ground level, which means sewage and rainwater will enter our houses,” she said. The channel also blocked the entry for most of the houses, and they had to construct steps to enter their houses. “Instead of digging the earth for constructing the channel, the contractor constructed it above the ground level,” said Sathish Kumar, another resident. “Now I need to pump sewage from my house using a motor and discharge it into the channel,” he said.  Residents claimed that their opposition during the construction of the channel went unheard. “The contractor who built the channel asked us to raise the level of our houses by three feet. We want the faulty drainage channel demolished and a new one constructed by digging the ground,” said S. Rani, another resident. Panchayat officials said that after inspecting the channel, they would take necessary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-upset-over-faulty-drainage-channel/article32768832.ece

05 October 2020||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||‘Enforce norms strictly’||The Karaikal unit of India Against Corruption has made a representation to the Lt. Governor of Puducherry seeking strict enforcement of quarantine in the wake of resumption of train services to Kerala via Tamil Nadu. Citing research studies, president of Karaikal unit of IAC S. Anandkumar said 15 minutes of exposure was enough for an infected person to transmit COVID-19 virus to others. A carrier of COVID-19 virus could transmit the disease to 23 other co-passengers. Long-distance trains set to arrive from Kerala via Tamil Nadu would cause spread of the disease in Karaikal. Strict enforcement of quarantine norms should be carried out by the district administration after getting passenger information from the railways. Prolonged exposure of passengers during long distance travel had fair likelihood of spread of the epidemic, he pointed out. It would not be proper for district authorities to blame people for failing to enforce quarantine rules. Free movement of people did not mean flouting quarantine norms. Penalty Like in the case of wearing masks, social distancing and sanitation, penalties must be enforced on those who failed to fall in line. Mr. Anandkumar urged the Puducherry Governor to take up the issue with the Collectors of Puducherry and Karaikal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/enforce-norms-strictly/article32768746.ece
05 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Watch out for MIS-C in children: doctors||Ten children, who had recovered from COVID-19 but later developed multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), were successfully treated at Government Rajaji Hospital. Though only a small percentage of children who recovered from COVID-19 may develop this syndrome, doctors stress the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. S. Balashankar, Head, Department of Paediatrics, says a small proportion of children develop MIS-C after two to six weeks of recovery from COVID-19. The child may display symptoms such as high fever, reddish eyes, rashes, neck swelling, vomiting or diarrhoea, he warns. A doctor from the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Chennai explains that MIS-C cases were first reported in western countries. “But, children with this syndrome are now identified in various parts of the State,” the doctor says. Usually, children with MIS-C syndrome test positive for COVID-19 antibodies. “The level of antibodies in the children might have increased after being infected with COVID-19 or after being in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. But high levels of antibodies lead to an autoimmune reaction and the child develops multi-system inflammatory syndrome,” the doctor says. D. Rajkumar, the Chief of Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at GRH, says this is a critical syndrome which primarily affect the coronary arteries and leads to coronary aneurysm. The syndrome is similar to Kawasaki disease, he says. Dr. Balashankar says it can affect other body functions, including that of heart, liver and kidney or nervous system. The treatment protocol for children depends on the symptoms and severity of multi-system inflammatory syndrome. “Children are given steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin based on the severity. All the children with MIS-C syndrome that were treated at the hospital, which also includes patients referred from private hospitals, have recovered after complete treatment,” he says. “So, early identification and treatment of MIS-C are essential to prevent coronary aneurysm. If any child has high fever, reddish eyes or other symptoms, their parents must immediately take the child to the hospital,” says Dr. Rajkumar.

An official said the damaged road on the bridge was milled and a new road relaid during April during the lockdown. “We received several representations from the public, urging us to relay roads without increasing the existing height as two-wheeler riders tend to climb on to the pedestrian footpath during traffic snarls. So we removed two layers of the damaged road and a new metalled surface was laid in its place,” he said. Bed protection works are under way. The steps under the AV bridge through which the Vaigai flows is also being revamped. The places where plastering is worn out are being replaced. “While 90% of the work has been completed, the remaining work will be finished by next week,” he said. P.S. Srinivasan, a commuter, said the new surface did provide some respite for road users who had to endure hardship while travelling on the damaged road for long. “Previously they made only patchwork in a hasty manner on this bridge,” he said. But it must be ensured that the new road stays this way for the next few years, said B. Balashanmugam, who runs a studio near the bridge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-its-a-smooth-ride-on-albert-victor-bridge/article32768810.ece

05 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||GRH performs epilepsy surgery on two children||Doctors of Apollo Speciality Hospitals in Madurai have successfully performed epilepsy surgeries ontwo children, who had refractory focal epilepsy, where medicines did not help in controlling the seizures. S. Muthukani, consultant epileptologist at the hospital, said the children were monitored through video electroencephalogram (EEG). One of the children would have 100 to 200 seizures in a day and the other child would encounter 10 to 15 seizures. “Medications did not help to control the seizures for both the children. But, after surgery, both the children have not faced any seizures,” he added. India is one of the countries where prevalence of epilepsy is high. While 70% of the people can control epilepsy with anti-seizure drugs, the rest of the patients cannot control their seizures with medications. “There is a myth that epilepsy is not curable and that anti-seizure drugs are the only possibility to control epilepsy. When patients can’t control their seizures through medication, they become potential candidates for surgery,” said Dr. Muthukani. The surgery costs Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh.

Led by the Deputy Chief Engineer (Bridges), Southern Railway, Balasubramanian, the officials made trolley inspection of the bridge, especially the Scherzer’s span. He was accompanied by Senior Divisional Engineer (Coordination), Mohideen Pitchai. Mr. Balasubramanian said that he has just begun the inspection and refused to comment on the stability of the bridge. A senior divisional railway official has already said that trains, with passengers, would not be operated over the Pamban bridge as a safety precaution till the stability of the bridge was fully ensured. Railway passengers who were to board the special train at Rameswaram railway station, were taken to Mandapam railway station by road for the second day on Sunday. “The inspection is likely to continue for two more days,” a railway official said. Southern Railway, in association with IIT-Chennai, had, in June, installed and tested, the working of Continuous Health Monitoring System for a round-the-clock monitoring of the stability of the structural member of the bridge. Any variation in the stability of the bridge would be captured by the strain gauges installed there and give a real-time alert to the railway officials and IIT-Chennai team. With Pamban being one of the highly corrosive environment, Railway officials have decided to replace the Pamban bridge with a new one, which is under construction. “As a precautionary measure, trains are being run at a slower speed of 15 kmph on the bridge,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sensor-issue-officials-inspect-pamban-bridge/article32768757.ece

05 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Accidental death rate in U.T. is the highest||In a mixed report card, Puducherry has topped the nation in the rate of accidental deaths while continuing to register a decline in suicides as per the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs. According to the NCRB’s Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2019, the highest rate of accidental deaths per lakh of population was reported from Puducherry (72.8), followed by Chhattisgarh (68.6), Maharashtra (57.4), Haryana (54.3), Goa (51.5) and Madhya Pradesh (51.4) against the national average of 31.5 deaths per lakh of population. Puducherry led 19 States/Union Territories which reported higher rates of ‘accidental deaths’ than the all-India average. In absolute numbers, Puducherry recorded 1,103 accidental deaths during 2019, against 1,213 the previous year. During 2019, traffic accidents involved a total of 1,401 cases with 156 deaths, including 20 women while those who sustained injuries were 1,619 — 1,270 men and 349 women. In the road accidents category, the Union Territory recorded 1,392 cases and 147 deaths. The other fatalities comprised sudden deaths (heart attacks): 81including six women; accidental poisoning: 24 including six women and one transgender; electrocution: 15 deaths (one woman); drowning: 51, electrocution: 15 and fall from a height: six. Poor governance The cases reported and percentage change in traffic accidents were 1,597 in 2018 to 1,392 in 2019 (minus 12.8). “If a small place like Puducherry is topping the country in accidental death rates, it reflects poorly on the efficacy of governance, especially given the administrative talent available here,” said Sunaina Mandeen, member of Pondy Citizens’ Action Network. In the case of suicides, Puducherry recorded 493 suicides (348 men;145 women) in 2019 accounting for 0.4% share of all suicides in the country with a rate of 32.5 per lakh of population. The Union Territory witnessed a minus 1.4% variation in incidence of suicides over the previous year and did not record a single event of mass/extended suicide. Debilitating or chronic illness, family problems, bankruptcy and debt were the leading cause of suicides in Puducherry followed by much lesser degree factors such as mental illness, marital discord/dowry-related issues, failure in examinations, unemployment and unrequited love. As a group, unemployed persons (97), students (78) and daily wagers (35) topped the list of those ending lives. All the victims belonged to the income bracket of less than Rs. one lakh annually. Suicide rate down In a decade between 2006 and 2016, Puducherry witnessed a 33.6% reduction in suicide rate, said Rasaiya G., Associate Director of the Youth Helpline run by the Trust for Youth Leadership, an organisation with consultative status for the United Nations. The data collated by TYCL from the Puducherry police department through Right to Information Act revealed that there was a significant reduction in the youth suicide rate. Analysis showed that more youth suicides are recorded in rural Puducherry and that men were more prone to suicides than women, said R. Suresh Krishna, TYCL administrator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accidental-death-rate-in-puducherry-is-the-highest/article32769268.ece

05 October 2020||Sattur,TAMIL NADU||CCTV footage exposes man’s fake abduction claim||A 56-year-old driver, Henry alias Hariharan, who claimed to have been abducted “at gun point” by “Hindi-speaking” men on Friday morning, returned home on Saturday night only to admit that he had left home owing to debts. The police said that the man, who was the driver for a BJP functionary, came back to Sattur on Saturday night. He initially claimed that he was bundled into a car and the gun-toting men speaking Hindi, took him to Madurai. After getting him food, they blind-folded him and took him some 100 miles away to a farm in an unidentified place that looked like Theni district. “They threatened me with dire consequences that I should not be working against the BJP. They also said that they need to teach a lesson to two more persons who were against the party,” he told the police. The man claimed that he was later dropped in the district. However, by this time, the Sattur town police had registered a case of abduction. A team led by the Sattur Deputy Superintendent of Police, S. Ramakrishnan, formed special teams to track down the “abducted” person. Investigation Ten Inspectors of Police and 200 men had fanned out across the district and to the neighbouring districts to investigate the case. “Had we not got five video footages that showed this man boarding one bus after another at five different places in Sattur town and Virudhunagar, we would have been left with no option but to believe his words,” the DSP said. After the police revealed that they had the video footages, the man spilled the beans stating that he left home owing to family problems, including debts. The man who came to Virudhunagar from Sattur by a bus on Friday, later left for Thanjavur and from there went to Velankanni. He had returned home after offering prayers there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cctv-footage-exposes-56-year-old-mans-fake-abduction-claim/article32768755.ece

R. Periyakaruppan, for violating the Indian Epidemic Act here on Sunday. Police said that following complaints that the DMK cadre and functionaries organised ‘gram sabha’ meetings on Oct 2, despite the curfew, cases were registered. The government had originally announced the conduct of gram sabha meetings on Oct 2 (Gandhi Jayanthi) across the State. However, after DMK president M.K. Stalin appealed to the panchayat presidents and the people to pass resolutions against the recently passed Farm Acts by the Union government, the State government cancelled the conduct of the meetings. Officials claimed that the government had cancelled as a precautionary measure in view of the COVID-19 virus.

05 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Weekly shandies come alive again||Much to the relief of buyers, the weekly shandies in Tiruchi resumed their activities on Sunday after the State government relaxed lockdown norms. No weekly shandy was allowed to operate in the State since the imposition of lockdown from the last week of March to check the spread of the virus. Though authorities opened temporary markets in different parts of the city to facilitate trouble-free supply of vegetables and essential items, the weekly markets were not given permission due to apprehension of spread of virus in the event of large gathering of people in a particular place. Acting on the demands of traders and consumers, the State government granted permission to reopen the weekly shandies from October 1. The popular weekly shandy at GoldenRock, functional on Sundays from dawn to dusk, was opened after a gap of six months. However, it received just half of its usual traders and customers as many of them had no knowledge about its reopening. It was only after seeing the shops, local residents of Golden Rock, T.V.S. Tollgate and surrounding areas visited the market and bought vegetables, fruits, groceries and other essential commodities, according to traders. Meanwhile, permission on resumption of weekly shandies has raised expectations of cattle traders on reopening of the cattle market at Manapparai near here. The cattle market receives hundreds of traders from different parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry. The market usually meets on every Tuesday and continues up to noon the next day. It is learnt that officials are yet to take a call on the plea for reopening it. Demanding the reopening of the cattle market, a section of traders met officials of Manapparai Municipality and presented a petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/weekly-shandies-come-alive-again/article32768760.ece

05 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Annoyed passengers pay toll for detained TNSTC bus||Passengers of a Villupuram-based Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus coughed up the money to pay toll after the bus was detained at the toll plaza near Samayapuram recently. A video that went viral on social media platforms shows the bus proceeding to Tiruchi from Chennai was detained a few days ago. The toll collector refused to open the barrier because of the non-payment of the toll. As time ticked away, the passengers became restless and questioned the crew about the delay. The crew members told them that the management had not permitted them to pay at toll plazas. Since neither the crew nor the staff members of the toll plaza budged for over half-an-hour, the passengers came forward to bear the toll of Rs. 150. The conductor collected the money and paid the toll. In the video, one of the passengers is heard saying the Transport Minister should take note of the incident and intervene. The video was believed to have been circulated by the trade union of the Aam Aadmi Party to highlight the problem being faced by the crew members of the State-owned transport corporation buses at the toll plazas. S.A.N. Vaseegaran, State convener, APP, Tamil Nadu, said it was unfortunate that the passengers had to pay the toll.

05 October 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Police reach out to Kudankulam villagers||In a move that is expected to bring the public and police closer, the district police won over the hearts of hundreds of families, especially the youth, when Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan gave an assurance in settling the cases registered against them in 2011 during the anti-Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant agitations. The police had registered 248 cases then and after the State government had agreed to withdraw or close them, 213 were treated as closed. The remaining 35 cases were yet to be closed. Following petitions submitted to the SP during the grievance meetings, he had proposed to hold a public hearing in the presence of the KKNPP officials and elected representatives. When the meeting was held on Sunday, the villagers said that many youth in their hamlets who had opportunities to go abroad for work, faced hardships in obtaining NOC from the police as they were told about the cases pending against them since 2011. While the State government had announced that the cases were closed, the police continued to reject applications which sought issuance of No Objection Certificate for obtaining passport and for other purposes. Under such circumstances, the SP gave assurance that the police would give NOC to applicants against whom there were no cases. They would not be made to run from pillar to post. He also said that persons intending to go abroad for educational purposes too can get required certificates from the police. However, he categorically stated that the police cannot give any blanket assurance to all. The applications would be considered case by case. For instance, if the nature of the complaint was serious, in such cases, the police cannot give NOC. The Koodankulam police were also told to be cordial with the applicants and he directed them to use their discretionary powers judiciously and settle issues amicably. Radhapuram MLA Inbadurai, who was also present, thanked the police and district administration for their efforts in reaching out to the people. He said that the government had ordered for withdrawing the cases after the villagers were given assurance on safety and among other issues. Some of the youth, who were present at the meeting, said that the police had dragged for months without issuing NOC when they had approached them. “For local jobs, where private entrepreneurs insisted on a certificate from the police, they directed us to go to the SP office for approval from the superiors. It is heartening to have the SP himself present in our village and give an assurance,” they remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-reach-out-to-kudankulam-villagers/article32768820.ece
05 October 2020||Tirupathur,TAMIL NADU||Man rescues injured monkey||A 28-year-old man was appreciated by the public for rescuing an injured monkey after nearly three hours of struggle in Ambur on Sunday. Ashok Kumar, 28, from Ambur, has been rescuing snakes and other animals in the locality for over 12 years. On Sunday around 9.30 a.m., he received a call from a friend. “He informed me that an injured monkey was spotted above a building on Netaji Road, where he works, and sought my help,” Mr. Ashok said. He rushed to the spot and found that the hands of the monkey were bleeding and it was unable to use them. “When I went near the monkey, it started running and jumping from one building to another. But I could sense it was in pain. It appeared as if the injuries were inflicted by other monkeys or it must have suffered an electrical shock,” he said. After close to three hours, the monkey ran into a garment shop and Mr. Ashok nabbed it. “Being a Sunday, we could not get a government veterinarian. Hence, I alerted forest officials and with the help of a local veterinary doctor, we treated it,” he said. G.D. Moorthy, forest ranger, Ambur, said that the monkey was released in a reserve forest area. “The animal bit the guard while it was being set free. It was in so much pain. At least two to three animals are being rescued everyday from Ambur. The number is more during summer,” he said. Mr. Ashok said residents approach him when they see a snake or any other animal that needs to be rescued. “This is my passion. I rescue animals free of cost and hand them over to the Forest Department. The only snake I have not rescued is a King Cobra,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-rescues-injured-monkey-in-ambur/article32769423.ece
05 October 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Nilgiris’ flora being taken over by invasive weeds||Iconic flora native to the Nilgiris, including more than 30 species of Strobilanthes,  could be under threat of being displaced with the continuing advance of invasive flora such as Cestrum aurantiacum and Lantana camara , experts warn. The mass blooming of the Strobilanthes kunthiana, known commonly as the neelakurinji , gave the Nilgiris (the blue mountains) its iconic name as the slopes were covered once in 12 years by the mass blooming of the shrub. Recently, the blooming of the Strobilanthes foliosa has been reported in parts of the Nilgiris. What has experts worried is the prevalence of invasive species that have come to populate the habitats of the native Strobilanthes plants. While the habitat of the Strobilanthes plants in the upper Nilgiris is being eroded by the Cestrum aurantiacum , they are threatened by other invasive species like Lantana camara in the lower slopes. V. Ramsundar, a horticulturalist working for the Horticulture Department in the Nilgiris, said the spread of exotic weeds and invasive species into habitats that until recently were populated only by native species could prove disastrous for the Nilgiris’ biodiversity. “It is well known that invasive species can smother and out-compete native plants, leading to their localised disappearance from a landscape,” Mr. Ramsundar said. His concerns were mirrored by Pradeep A.K., a naturalist who has documented 19 species of Strobilanthes in the Nilgiris. Mr. Pradeep said invasive weeds posed a serious threat to the native flora. “Of the different species of Strobilanthes seen in the Nilgiris, each needs a specific micro-climate to survive and thrive. Any disturbance to their habitat could lead to their numbers diminishing and disappearing entirely from the landscape,” he said. Invasive species of plants were also posing a serious threat to the Strobilanthes species in Kodaikanal, he said. Habitats wiped out “If we look at records, we can see that in the 19th century, the Strobilanthes plants were recorded in places in the Nilgiris where they have been completely wiped out. In order to protect the remaining habitats, the areas where the plants are located should be identified and invasive plants should be removed immediately,” said Mr. Pradeep. Dr. Tarun Chhabra, an expert in the local ecology of the Nilgiris, said there is a need for a study of the native flora and the threats they face. “That’s why I think the Western Ghats Plants Specialist Group (WGPSG), set up by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), can help ascertain the threats faced by the Nilgiris flora,” said Mr. Chhabra, a member of the WGPSG. “There are certain wild Impatiens (balsams) species endemic to the Nilgiris and the Western Ghats that are found only in a few square kilometers in a particular valley, and are critically endangered,” said Mr. Chhabra, highlighting the rarity of certain endemic plant species in the Nilgiris. Mr. Chhabra said better research and understanding of the Nilgiris’ native plants, as well as the landscape in which they are found and the threats they face, can help formulate more effective conservation strategies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nilgiris-flora-being-taken-over-by-invasive-weeds/article32768776.ece

05 October 2020||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Oussudu bird sanctuary to get a facelift||With the season for migratory birds all set to begin, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department has started the upgradation of infrastructure at the Oussudu bird sanctuary in Poothurai to attract more visitors to the district’s primary eco-sensitive region. Located between the Pulicat and Point Calimere wetlands, the Oussudu lake is identified as a wetland of national importance under the National Wetland Conservation Programme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. It has also been declared as one of the 93 significant wetlands in Asia by the Asian Wetland Bureau. The inter-State lake covers an expanse of 800 hectares, of which over 400 hectares are in the Villupuram district. The Forest Department has sent a proposal for developing the bird sanctuary to add value to the place and to ensure that it becomes a centre for learning about migratory birds. “We have proposed basic infrastructural facilities including fencing around the lake, bird interpretation centre, watch towers and other protection activities at a cost of Rs. 2 crore. The works will be taken up under a Centrally sponsored scheme with a 60:40 split between Central and State funding. The work will begin after the government accords sanction,” said District Forest Officer Abhishek Tomar. The bird interpretation centre will cater to wildlife enthusiasts, environmentalists, tourists and students. It would provide comprehensive information on the flora and fauna of the Oussudu lake, especially migratory birds. The department has also proposed nature and bird trails and wildlife enthusiasts and researchers can see the birds in their natural habitats, Mr. Tomar said. The interpretation centre will also have exhibits that show the path that each migratory birds takes before stopping at the Oussudu lake. Anti-poaching steps Instances of poaching have also come down on the Villupuram side owing to enforcement of strict meausures. The department has deployed five Anti-Poaching Watchers (APW) to prevent poaching of migratory birds, Mr. Tomar said. “As many as 66 species of birds belonging to 47 families were coming in large numbers and staying in the sanctuary for a few months starting October every year,” said K. Raman of the Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF), a non-profit organisation. The critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper and the endangered white-bellied sea eagle were also sighted, he said. Flamingoes, oriental darters, spot-billed pelicans, great white pelicans, painted storks, Eurasian spoonbills and pallid harriers are also frequent visitors to the lake.

05 October 2020||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Farmers encouraged to produce certified vegetable seeds||For the first time, the Department of Horticulture is providing subsidies to farmers interested in producing certified vegetable seeds. The Department has fixed a target of 16.4 hectares to produce 7.631 tonnes of certified seeds of onion, drumstick, cluster beans, bitter gourd, snake gourd, ridge gourd, pumpkin and greens, Collector R. Kannan said in a statement. “In the Virudhunagar district, we are promoting certified seed production for cluster beans, onion, pumpkin and ridge gourd,” said N. Rajasekaran, Assistant Director (Horticulture), Srivilliputtur. Certified vegetable seeds are not adequately available with the Department of Horticulture. Private companies “Now, the vegetable farmers depend on private companies for seeds. To increase the area under vegetables, the State government has come up with a scheme to make vegetable farmers entrepreneurs and encourage them to produce certified seeds,” he said. Farmers with assured irrigation facility need to register themselves with the Department of Seed Certification to produce certified seeds. “The registration fee of Rs. 400 is given as subsidy,” he said. They need to buy foundation seeds from the Department. Drip irrigation The farmers will be given a 30% subsidy, up to a maximum of Rs. 1,200, for integrated nutrient management and integrated pesticide management. The farmers will also be given subsidy of up to Rs. 1.13 lakh for drip irrigation (differs from crop to crop) and 50% subsidy, to a maximum of Rs. 2 lakh, for establishing shade net houses and 50% subsidy for pack houses. Inspection Officials of the Department of Seed Certification will inspect the field at the initial, flowering and harvesting stages. “After testing the seeds, they would certify them. Farmers can sell the certified seeds to private companies, other farmers and the Department of Horticulture. “The seeds of different crops would fetch Rs. 200 a kg to Rs. 2,000 a kg. This will be highly profitable for farmers,” Mr. Rajasekaran said. Farmers can get further details from the office of Deputy Director (Horticulture)-04562-252393. They can also call up the Assistant Directors (Horticulture) of their respective blocks on the following phone numbers: Srivilliputtur-70109-71163; Virudhunagar-94450-06999; Rajapalayam- 90807-19043; Sivakasi-97878-68216; Watrap-89257-92216; Vembakottai- 97878-68216; Sattur-94898-27503; Aruppukottai and Tiruchuli-94893-75653 and Kariyapatti and Narikudi-95667-60917.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/virudhunagar-ryots-encouraged-to-produce-certified-vegetable-seeds/article32768799.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Housing projects pose a threat to bird sanctuary||She pointed out that as early as 2010, then Kanniyakumari Collector Rajendra Ratnoo had, following the depletion of the groundwater table due to indiscriminate conversion of wetlands for housing projects, issued an order directing the village administrative officers not to grant permission for construction on wetlands. But the order has seldom been followed. Already, paddy fields irrigated by Putheri Kulam have become concrete patches. “I have refused to sell my fields to the real estate lobby. They have surrounded my paddy fields with constructions and have even been preventing water from flowing into my fields,” said Satha Sakthi, a native of Putheri. His efforts had previously led to the removal of the local panchayat president and vice-president for granting permission for housing plots. In Parakkai, a 20-foot road divides the waterbody and the paddy fields, and behind the area marked for real estate development runs a canal carrying water to the fields for irrigation. “The first casualty will be the canal. It will be polluted by the residents if housing permission is granted,” Ms. Kosalai said. The real estate lobby circumvents the Collector’s order using a time-tested method. First, they cultivate plantains and coconuts in the paddy field. In two years, they remove the banana crop and nurture the coconut trees. Later, the area is levelled for a housing layout. “But you have to get permission even to change the crop in Kanniyakumari district as the purpose of changing the crop is to create housing plots,” said Lal Mohan, convener, Nagercoil chapter of the Indian National Trust for Culture and Heritage.  “Not just the sanctuary, but the areas around it should also be protected,” ornithologist Robert Grubh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/housing-projects-pose-a-threat-to-bird-sanctuary/article32768777.ece

The highways authorities must repair the road as early as possible. B.B.C. Chandrasekar,  Madurai    Under ‘One Nation, One Ration card’ scheme, cardholders are asked to ensure their identity by biometric authentication to receive their PDS supply from any fair price shop. Presently, the card holder or a representative can get the essential commodities by producing the smart card issued by the government. Then what is the necessity for an additional biometric authentication? Fingerprints need a high-level security to prevent frauds. By stealing biometric information, a hacker may get access even to bank accounts. Moreover, during this pandemic, the card holders contracting COVID-19 is a possibility. Considering the problems of the elderly and the potential abuse of personal information, additional biometric authentication should be avoided for receiving ration goods. G.

05 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||VTU to offer degree programmes on campus — two in Belagavi and one in Muddenahalli||Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) will now offer a few graduate programmes on its campuses in Belagavi and Muddenahalli of Chikkaballapur. The three Bachelor of Technology programmes — two in Belagavi and one in Muddenahalli — will be of four years, on-campus and fully residential courses. The programmes in Computer Science and Business Systems and Robotics and Automation will be offered in Belagavi and the Mechanical and Smart Manufacturing will be offered in Muddenahalli near Chikkaballapur. These AICTE-approved courses will be industry-driven and run by the VTU following a memorandum of understanding with industries and research and development institutions. “We have signed MoUs with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) and the MTAB to run these courses,” VTU Vice-Chancellor Karisiddappa told The Hindu . “This will better chisel our course towards better industry-academia interaction. This will also provide the industry with skilled youth who have specialised training,” he said. According to him, the MoUs allow the partner institutions to train VTU faculty for the new programmes, organise guest lectures and engage with the university for the continuous assessment of the students. “The intake for each course would be 30. Students can choose the seats during the KEA counselling session from this academic year,” said Registrar (Academic) Anand Deshpande. The fee will be regulated by VTU. It is the same as the fee in other government engineering colleges, he added. According to him, the courses have been planned in such a way so as to ensure that the students graduating from the programme not only know the core topics but also develop an equal appreciation of humanities, management sciences and human values. In all the three courses, experiential learning mode will be followed to make students industry-ready, Dr. Deshpande said. In the Computer Science and Business Systems, students will be exposed to analytics, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and related subjects. Students of Robotics and Automation will go through smart technologies, methods of synthesis, analysis and optimisation of newer robots and mechanisms, Mobile Robotics, 3D Robotics, and Robotics and e-commerce. In machine learning, students will be trained in manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, systems engineering, IT, Networks and basic shop floor communications. Students organisations have welcomed this, though with a caution. “We are happy that VTU is starting degree courses on campus. That would help poor students get quality education at reasonable fees. However, we have some doubts about the longevity of these industry-driven courses,” said AIDSO secretary Mahantesh Bilur. “Will the VTU close down these courses after a few years when the corporates feel that they no longer need these engineers trained in niche technologies? VTU should promise that these courses will be continued even after the companies stop their patronage,’’ he said. VTU should not stop at a few courses. It should start a full-fledged engineering college on its Belagavi campus, said social activist Ashok Chandaragi. He said that he had sent a letter to the Chief Minister’s Office demanding the establishment of government engineering colleges in the backward districts of each one of the revenue divisions in the State. His memorandum also urges the VTU to set up a state-of-the-art research laboratory on the Belagavi campus of the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vtu-to-offer-degree-programmes-on-campus-two-in-belagavi-and-one-in-muddenahalli/article32768870.ece
05 October 2020||BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Music from home in times of COVID-19||The COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown and the changed work culture may have been painful for many, but it has turned out to be a boon for some. Himanshu Prakash, a young music technologist from Mumbai, has shifted to his home town of Dharwad and has begun working from home. “It has been such a pleasure!” he declares as he tunes his guitar to sync it with his electronic piano and other instruments. Sitting in thesecond floor of his house, he fiddles on his laptop, plays on the piano, adjusts the guitar strings, and checks the ultra-sensitive microphone while humming a tune set to Hindustani music. He has received several pieces of instrumental and vocal music sent to him online by his team members from Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi. He slits them as if they were pictures or video clips, and pastes them over each other. What comes out at the end is a complete musical number with sounds of instruments in the background and the leading voices treated and processed by software tools. “The slow pace of this town, the nearly silent surroundings, and the near-zero visitors to our house because of the lockdown has increased my productivity. You can never get such an ambience in Mumbai,” he says. “COVID -19 has forced music technologists, otherwise bound to their high-tech studios, to work from home with minimal equipment and new-age software.” “The whole music team meets online to discuss projects. We divide our work, as though we were employees on an assembly line. Each one does his bit like singing a song, playing an instrument, or recording such performances, as per the music director’s instructions. Then those pieces are sent to technologists like us who sew them together, enhancing or diminishing some sounds, eliminating noise, and adding echo or effects. The final product seems as if it were created in one room with all the stakeholders sitting across the same table,” he says. Mr. Prakash is a trained music technologist and a reference music director. He is also a trained a Hindustani classical musician and has worked on several film and TV projects and advertisement campaigns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/music-from-home-in-times-of-covid-19/article32768895.ece

05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Doctors update families on patients’ health via videos||The isolation of COVID-19 patients is traumatic not just for those afflicted by the virus, but also for family members who are unable to care for their loved ones and are dependent on the hospital authorities to keep them updated at all times. With hospitals restricting visiting hours even for non-COVID-19 patients as a precautionary measure, there have been an increasing number of complaints from people that they are being kept in the dark about the health status of their family members after hospitalisation. In an attempt to address this, many private hospitals in Bengaluru have started making short videos of their patients, which they send to families to keep them updated on treatment plans, how the person is responding, etc. Risk of infection Doctors point out that people are being told not to make hospital visits unless absolutely necessary. R. Ravindra, Medical Director, Suguna Hospital, said that they restrict visitors as they may be at risk of catching the infection at the hospital itself. “While patients regularly video call their family members, we send videos when our doctors visit them particularly if they are in our intensive care units,” he said. This is to avoid miscommunication during the course of the treatment. “If the family of a patient does not know what is happening, they get tense and tend to assume a lot of things regarding their loved one’s health condition. So we have decided to use this method to keep them in the loop,” he said. Positive feedback Anoop Amarnath of Manipal Hospitals said that the frequency of the medical team’s interaction with the families has gone up over the past two weeks. “It serves two purposes. One, it comes as a relief to families who are informed about the treatment that is being provided. It also helps our doctors get some feedback on the medical history of elderly patients,” he said, and added that the system of communication has received good feedback. Families too are relieved with this move. “My father was admitted in the hospital and we did not visit as we were afraid of contracting the virus in the hospital. As my father is not tech-savvy we were not able to communicate properly with him. But we were relieved after the hospital started sending us videos of how he is responding to treatment,” said a software professional in Malleswaram whose father was admitted for treatment.  Hospital managements say that this system has eased the pressure on their medical staff who would otherwise be spending the better part of the day fielding calls from anxious relatives. Vikram Sreeram, MD, Mallige Hospital, said that in the recent past, different teams at the hospital were being flooded with calls from families of patients. “Families of COVID-19 patients are not allowed to visit them but non-COVID-19 patients can have one attender. We are trying to reduce the footfalls at the hospital.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/doctors-update-families-on-patients-health-via-videos/article32768879.ece
05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Handlooms across Karnataka are now weaving a sad tale||For more than a month now, 20 handlooms of Yellanna Ganti, at Kerur in Badami taluk, have fallen silent and the skilled weavers working on them have lost their livelihood. Mr. Ganti’s Banashankari Handloom Production Unit has piled up a stock of 6,000 metres of fabric as it has reported very poor sales in the post-lockdown months. Mr. Ganti, who produced an average of 3,000 metres of handloom a month before the lockdown, has stopped production and is now focused on clearing his stock to generate capital to restart his unit. ‘Out of work’ “I feel very bad as weavers have been out of work for more than a month now. I have stocks but no cash to pay weavers. Only if I clear the stock can I get money to restart the looms,” Mr. Ganti told The Hindu over phone. “The younger generation of weavers has left and those who are still in villages are those who cannot migrate. My biggest worry now is how to provide them work,” he said. Similar stories echo from different weaving clusters in Bagalkot, Gadag, and Yadgir districts which have a high number of weavers. Already, the weaving community has shrunk significantly as per the 4th Handloom Census 2018-2019, conducted by Union Ministry of Textiles , and the COVID-19 crisis is another blow. Mudhol-based Dhaneshwari Kaimagga Nekarara Batte Utpadakara Ghataka, a self-help group (SHG) in Bagalkot, has unsold stock of 5,000 metres, while the monthly production has come down from an average 5,000 metres to about 2,000 metres. “We never faced a situation like this. We have tried different products too but they have not yet received market acceptance,” said Shivashankar E. Moodalagi of the ghataka. Shivamogga-based Charaka Women Weavers’ Cooperative has a stock pile of nearly 80,000 metres. A serious consequence of the current situation has been that weavers, not finding work in their villages, have started migrating in search of jobs. “If we stop weaving completely, weavers will go away. Many other jobs yield better wages and are less strenuous. We are struggling to give them work,” said Mallikarjun Rawat of Shahpur-based Shambhavi Kaimagga Nekarara Sangh in Yadgir district. “Of the 50 weavers we had, 20 have left. We will have to run around to get weavers if all of them leave,” he added. Cancelled orders Gajendragad-based Sri Banashankari Nekarara Sahakara Sangh has not only seen high stocks, but also cancellation of existing orders, resulting in finances going haywire. “Despite the crisis, we continue to give some work because if we let the weavers go, we have to shut the looms permanently. We have to show interest in retaining the talent. As it is, the younger generation is not interested in weaving,” said sangh secretary Ambareesh R.S. “In fact, due to capital crisis, many societies are near closure. After the current crisis, the number of active weavers may come down further.” Of the 50 weavers attached to the Dhaneshwari Kaimagga in Mahalingapur, at least 15 are expected not to return.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/handlooms-across-karnataka-are-now-weaving-a-sad-tale/article32768903.ece
05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Amendments to KMC Act will further delay BBMP elections||Amendments to The Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, which was notified by the State government on Saturday, will push elections to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) by a few more months. The amendment has not only said that BBMP should have not less than 225 and not more than 250 wards, but has also provided for a delimitation commission. This means, as per the KMC Act, 1976, elections cannot be held for BBMP in its present form of 198 wards. The delimitation and reservation exercise that the State government carried out recently has gone for a toss and the exercise has to be redone to increase the number of wards to at least 225. This is expected to push the BBMP elections by at least four to five months, sources in the government said. A writ petition filed by the Karnataka State Election Commission and a few Congress councillors in Karnataka High Court seeking timely polls is expected to come up for hearing again on October 12. “Since this is the will of the legislature now made into a law, it is to be seen what the High Court that has been keenly following up on the delimitation and reservation process to ensure timely elections will do now,” a senior official in the Urban Development Department said. S. Raghu, chairman of the legislature committee on the BBMP Bill, 2020, said the committee had recommended the size of a ward be limited to an average population of 35,000, which will give the city 241 wards in the present area under BBMP limits. “As per the new amendments, the delimitation exercise has to be redone to increase the number of wards. The Chief Minister, who also holds charge of Bengaluru Development, will shortly chair a meeting to decide on the number of wards and other modalities,” he said. Adopting the Chennai model, a delimitation commission is likely to be chaired by the BBMP Commissioner to carry out the delimitation and reservation of wards exercise, sources in UDD said. However, many have criticised this as another “time buying mechanism” and say that the entire exercise is likely to be rendered null and void again in a few months as the government plans to bring in a dedicated law for the city’s governance. “The BBMP Bill, 2020, is a long-pending governance reform for the city. We want to transition the city into a new governance setup and hold elections under the new law and not under the existing KMC Act, 1976. If elections are held under the KMC Act today, the operationalisation of the BBMP Bill, 2020 will likely be postponed for five years which the city cannot afford,” a senior BJP functionary said. A Congress member of the legislature committee on BBMP Bill, 2020, said the Bill in its present form was not radically different from the KMC Act, 1976 and made only cosmetic changes. “There seems to be no will to fix the structural governance deficit in the city and the entire exercise seems to be aimed at postponing polls, which is unconstitutional,” he said. No consensus Meanwhile, Mr. Raghu said that there was no consensus over the inclusion of new areas to BBMP. “A call on addition of newer areas to BBMP and the criteria for that will be decided at a later date,” he said, indicating newer areas may be added to the city corporation limits when the BBMP Bill, 2020, is made into a law. This will force the government to go for another round of delimitation, officials said.  As per the new amendments, the delimitation exercise has to be redone to increase the number of wards. The Chief Minister will shortly chair a meeting to decide on the number of wards and other modalities.S.

05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students write to Prime Minister demanding justice for Hathras victim||Many alumni and students from Mount Carmel College and the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, have condemned the brutal attack on a Dalit girl in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, and the response by the government machinery to the crime. In a letter to the Prime Minister, faculty, students and alumni of IIMB also sought support for the victim’s family. “We seek assurance that the family will not be intimidated, but rather supported to get justice,” the letter said. “We demand that our law and order system follows due process. Not encounters. Not cover-ups. Not extra-judicial killings. Not use tools of governance against us every time we peacefully protest actions of our government,” said the 187 signatories. The letter goes on to read:. “We stand together and say “Enough!” This stops in our generation. This stops with us.” In an open letter to the Union Home Minister and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, many students and alumni of Mount Carmel College took objection to the response of the U.P. government and statements by police officials denying the rape. “These statements and actions provide excuses and only serve to strengthen patriarchal mindsets and the impunity that upper caste men, including Thakurs and Brahmins, enjoy,” they wrote. They also demanded that recommendation by the SIT to conduct narcoanalysis tests on the victim’s family members be withdrawn. “With most of these cases meeting the same fate, that of negligent investigation and inaction against the accused, members of the upper castes have been allowed to retaliate against the reporting of cases with further brutality,” they wrote. Action sought Signatories of both letters called for strict action against those officials who tried to “cover-up” for the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-write-to-prime-minister-demanding-justice-for-hathras-victim/article32769243.ece

05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RTOs given target of 26,000 cases a month||Meeting targets and generating revenue is not limited to the corporate world alone. Officials at Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) have been given targets to meet for filing cases. After being directed by the State government to take action against motorists flouting road safety rules, the Transport Commissioner has directed RTOs to file 26,000 cases every month. “Targets have been fixed for each RTO. Instructions have been given to them to book cases pertaining to overloading, not wearing seatbelts, unauthorised modification of vehicles, and others. In August, the field officials managed to achieve 80% of their targets,” said Transport Commissioner N. Shivkumar. The Commissioner had also warned of taking action against officials in charge for lapses in enforcement activities. However, following this is not an easy task for field officials who say they are understaffed. The shortage of motor vehicle inspectors at the RTO level is a burden, said one field official. According to sources, the department has around 214 senior inspector posts of which only 116 are filled. There are 430 posts for inspectors but only 125 inspectors are working; the remaining posts are vacant. Due to various factors including legal issues, posts remain vacant for years. An RTO official pointed out that targets have to be met in conjunction with other department work. “We have to manage with the available staff and book cases against violators. In addition to staff shortage, we are facing other issues too,” said an RTO official. He pointed out that while the traffic police in Bengaluru are using gadgets to file cases, they are stuck with issuing challans. “With this outdated system, it takes us at least 20 minutes to file a case. There is a need to shift to advanced technology to carry out enforcement. We are also facing problems of space when it comes to parking impounded vehicles in Bengaluru,” the official added. Accusations Some of the RTOs in Bengaluru are also facing accusations that they are using unauthorised people to flag down the vehicles on roads. Vishwanth, secretary of the Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners’ Association, said, “On highways, lorry drivers are often subjected to harassment. Officials use unauthorised people to collect money from the drivers and cases are filed against only a few vehicles. Higher ups in the department must address these issues while instructing field officials to do more enforcement activities. If not, this harassment will continue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rtos-given-target-of-26000-cases-a-month/article32769241.ece
05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bookstores turn to delivery apps to up sales||About five months after they were allowed to reopen, bookstore owners in the city are looking at ways to get people back. While some store owners remain optimistic and say that business is picking up, others say that it has been “up and down”. Mayi Gowda, owner of Blossom Book House at Church Street, which reopened on May 4, has observed an uptick in customers over the last fortnight. “The number of walk-ins is at 60% — the majority being regular customers — of what it was before the pandemic. One reason is that post-Unlock 4, nearly everything is open and so more people are out. The other is that people have been sitting at home for such a long time so now they want to step out,” he said. While children’s books always sell, he noted that new releases are also in demand now as most people have finished reading the books they had at home. Customers have also been getting books delivered for months now via delivery apps. Blossom, for instance, has tied up with Dunzo to deliver books to customers, and provides about 800 titles that are sold at full price. As for whether the number of deliveries has come down with walk-ins going up, Mr Mayi Gowda says, “Some people still have that fear of being out so deliveries are also going on. We get about 12 to 15 orders in a day.” He adds that they also get 10 to 12 orders a day from across India such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Lightroom Book Store, Cooke Town, which caters to children and young adults, gets orders within the city — via delivery apps or the store sends couriers — as well as from outside Bengaluru. “We got on Instagram only in February this year and that has resulted in orders from a lot of new people and orders from places such as Nagaland and Assam. We send packages out every day,” said owner Aashti Mudnani. Stating that it’s difficult to pinpoint the number of orders the store gets every day, she said, “This whole week has been good and we sold 10 books a day. But last week, business was slow with only three sales a day.” As for the walk-ins, Ms. Mudnani says, “From the time we reopened on April 27, we have had two or three walk-ins a day. I think it’s a lot to do with the fact that we are located in a residential area. Initially, people would come without children, but now I see that more and parents bring their children.” Nagasri Book House, which is located in Jayanagar BDA Complex, reopened on June 3. Guru Prasad, who, along with Venkatesh K.V., owns the store said that business had been very good in June when they reopened. “But afterwards it came down. Now, business is 50% to 60% of what it was pre-pandemic and it’s only given by regular customers.” Krishna Gowda, owner of Bookworm on Church Street, which opened on April 25, said that the walk-ins are at a maximum of 40% compared to pre-pandemic. “But we were sending books via delivery apps even during the lockdown and that has continued. Regular customers with elderly people or children at home tell us their requests and we send their orders.” He added, “While it’s mostly been regulars, one positive point is that a lot of new customers have been calling us, particularly youngsters. It looks like they developed a reading habit during the lockdown. We have also seen a fantastic response on Twitter.”  The number of walk-ins is at 60% of what it was before the pandemic. One reason is that post-Unlock 4, nearly everything is open and so more people are out. The other is that people have been sitting at home for such a long time so now they want to step out.Mayi GowdaOwner of Blossom Book House||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bookstores-turn-to-delivery-apps-to-up-sales/article32769239.ece
05 October 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Is R.R. Nagar turning out to be tricky for BJP?||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s choice of candidate for Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency has kept everyone guessing even as the party is expected to announce its candidates for the two constituencies going to bypolls either on Monday or Tuesday. While it is speculated that Rajesh Gowda, son of former Congress MP Mudalagiriyappa, could finally bag the party’s ticket for Sira, it is the choice of candidate for R.R. Nagar that has kept everyone on tenterhooks. The R.R. Nagar byelection has been necessitated by the resignation of Congress legislator Munirathna, who was among the 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators to resign and cause the fall of the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition. There is quite a bit of resistance within the party to giving Mr. Munirathna the ticket, party sources said. Sources said that the choice of candidate had become tricky because of the feud between Mr. Munirathna and Tulsi Muniraju Gowda, who could end up playing against each to ensure the other’s defeat, potentially costing the party the seat. Meanwhile, on Sunday, Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi said that there was no confusion in the party over the choice of candidate, but acknowledged that there were many aspirants for the ticket. “No State leader, including the Chief Minister, has announced the name of the candidates so far. The BJP is stronger in R.R. Nagar. Even when D.K. Suresh was candidate, the BJP got more votes. We will win both constituencies,” he said, adding that he did not wish to comment on the possible candidature of H. Kusuma, wife of the deceased IAS officer D.K. Ravi.

05 October 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||In Sira constituency, JD(S) has a problem of plenty||The Janata Dal (Secular) is under pressure to retain the Sira Assembly seat after its legislator B. Satyanarayana passed away recently, but the party is faced with a problem of plenty with several candidates wishing to contest. This has delayed the selection of a candidate. The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had, last Thursday, announced that the party would declare its candidates for the two Assembly segments which are set to see byelections. While the JD(S) is keen to give ticket to the widow of the deceased, the late legislator’s son Satyaprakash is learnt to be keen to contest. Before the election was declared, the JD(S) had said that the first priority in ticket distribution was to the family of the late Satyanarayana. However, when Mr. Kumaraswamy spoke at a public rally a day after the election schedule was announced, he was non-committal to the family. However, on Sunday, Tumakuru Rural legislator D.C. Gowrishankar is learnt to have met the party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda to request ticket for his brother. Party sources said there were at least three serious contenders from the grassroots level in Sira, and they could emerge spoilsport for the party. Sunday also witnessed a large number of JD(S) workers from Sira joining the Congress, now helmed in the State by Vokkaliga leader D.K. Shivakumar. Sources said the JD(S) was currently faced with not only problems related to the choice of candidates, but also other issues such as finances to meet the bypoll costs. The party’s R.R. Nagar candidate is also yet to be announced, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/in-sira-constituency-jds-has-a-problem-of-plenty/article32768898.ece

05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Civil Services preliminary examinations held||The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducted the civil services preliminary examinations on Sunday with a slew of precautions in place. Many candidates who appeared for it said they found the paper tough. “Due to the pandemic, the exams were delayed for over four months. There were many guidelines in place. I found the preliminary exam tough. The questions were tricky and analytical,” Haricharan, a candidate from Bengaluru, said. Candidates were allowed inside the exam centres after temperature checks and hand sanitisation. However, norms of social distancing prior to entering the exam hall were not followed strictly at some centres, said several students who took the test. Another aspirant said, “I expect the cut off will be lower this year. Questions asked from polity, environment and other subjects were analytical and required more time to answer.” The preliminary examinations were initially scheduled to be held on May 31, but got postponed to October 4 due to the pandemic. “Unlike previous years, there was uncertainty over conducting the preliminary exams. This has also impacted our preparation,” said another candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/civil-services-preliminary-examinations-held/article32768885.ece
05 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Withdraw decision to allot land on BU campus, HDK tells government||Criticising the State government’s decision to allot 32 acres of land on Bangalore University campus to three institutions, including yoga university and the CBSE, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Sunday urged the government to withdraw the decision immediately. Mr. Kumaraswamy said: “The decision to allot 32 acres, including 15 acres each to yoga university and Gulbarga University and 2 acres to the CBSE for its South India office, will turn the Bangalore University campus into a concrete jungle. The State government should allot land to these institutions elsewhere and protect the park.” “Environment experts have put in their efforts for two decades to develop the biodiversity park. The government's unilateral decision that was taken without any consultation is dangerous and will destroy the park,” the former Chief Minister said in a series of tweets on Sunday. He further said: “Veteran environmentalist Yellappa Reddy has announced his decision to return the honorary degree in protest against the decision. Environmentalists have also supported him.” “The government’s decision to hand over the biodiversity park area, which was developed by the NSS students and public, to these three institutions is condemnable as the flora is going to be destroyed.” The former Chief Minister pointed out that former Vice-Chancellor K. Siddappa had started the work on this park with a vision to make it an open laboratory. “Today, it is supporting hundreds of research work of students from botany, biology, environment sciences and social sciences. Such a park has to be protected,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/withdraw-decision-to-allot-land-on-bu-campus-hdk-tells-government/article32769242.ece

05 October 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Rains disconnect this locality from the world for six months||For nearly six months in a year, a locality with few houses at Halanduru in Sringeri becomes an island with no road connectivity to the rest of the world. Residents of the 20 families that live here have to cross a stream to reach the nearest habitation or walk a long distance. They have been facing this ordeal for decades with no government agencies offering any solution. They regularly face difficulty getting aged or sick people immediate healthcare. Says Divakar, one of these residents, “Last year, my mother fell ill. It was difficult to take her to a hospital at Sringeri in a four-wheeler. We had to get the vehicle down and push it until it crossed the stretch.” Halandur is about 9 km from Sringeri taluk centre. Though there is a road to connect to Halandur village from Sringeri, there is no connectivity to a cluster of houses. In Malenadu, houses are scattered. One has to walk a long way to meet the nearest neighbour. Venkataramu, also a resident of the locality, said, “People living elsewhere will not understand the gravity of the problem we have been facing. Outsiders might find it difficult to believe that we have had no road since the country got independence. We and our forefathers have been living in this condition since time immemorial.”. The only way available for their movement is the path of a stream, which is full of water during the rainy season. Schoolchildren often face a tough time as they have to cross the flowing stream or take the alternative walk path to reach their destinations. “Only four-wheel drives can cross the stretch through the water. Otherwise we have to walk a couple of kms to reach the nearest alternative road to reach Sringeri. We have appealed to elected representatives and officers repeatedly. We have also offered to give a portion of our lands so that they could lay a road. But, our request has not reached them,” said Mr. Divakar. It is said that estimations were made twice to lay a separate road, but the work did not proceed further. When The Hindu contacted Menase Gram Panchayat PDO Gopal Handa, he said there was a road to connect Halandur from Sringeri. “Recently we have taken up the improvement of other roads in the area. But, for this particular habitation, there is a problem. We cannot lay the road on the stretch where the stream flows,” he said. Further, he said a solution could be found if private people came forward to offer their land to lay a road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rains-disconnect-this-locality-from-the-world-for-six-months/article32768883.ece

For the last two years, movement of vehicles on this stretch has been hit by repeated heavy rains and landslips. The growers, hoteliers, businessmen of Kottigehara had called for a bandh on the day to pressurise the State government and elected representatives to repair the road. They also took out a protest march on the highway from Kottigehara. As of now, the movement of heavy vehicles has been banned on the stretch, affecting business. Hasanabba, a hotelier at Kottigehara, said that for the last two years, the hoteliers and owners of petrol bunks and other activities had no business, as the road was closed for many months. “The road offers major connectivity for Dakshina Kannada and the rest of the State. Every day trucks carry vegetables from Chikkamagaluru to Dakshina Kannada. Besides, the people of Mudigere taluk send their children for studies to Dakshina Kannada and for healthcare, we travel to Mangaluru or Manipal via this route. Whenever the road is closed, we face hardships,” he said. The protesters maintained that earlier too landslips had occurred on the stretch but it was restored without much delay. “Now, despite having advanced technology and heavy machinery, the National Highways wing of the Public Works Department has not been able to take up the work to strengthen the road. We, the residents of Kottigehara, demand that the government and elected representatives attend to this issue,” said Sanjay Gowda, who led the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kottigehara-residents-observe-bandh-demanding-road-repairs-along-nh-73/article32768881.ece
05 October 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||One year on, this family is still in a relief camp||It has been more than a year since a family of Chickpet near Hosanagar moved to a relief centre after their house collapsed during heavy rains in August 2019. Even as the locality was battered by another spell of heavy rains this year, the family continues to remain in the relief centre, thanks to a delay in providing them with an alternative facility. The four families settled at Chickpet were badly hit during the heavy rains last year. The residents are daily wage workers with no land to cultivate. A house collapsed completely, while three other houses developed cracks, forcing them to move out. The local administration set up a relief centre at a government quarter meant for Health Department staff, which was unoccupied, for them. A couple of days later, when the rains receded, three families, headed by Suresh, Udaya and Subramanya, returned to their places, while Sumitra Bangari’s family remained at the centre as their house had collapsed completely. Many officers, elected representatives visited the place and promised the affected families of relief. As none of the four families had the land of their own, they could not get the relief amount meant for repair or construction of a house. The recent rains also battered the village again. Ms. Bangari, who stays with her two children in the relief centre, said she had appealed to local panchayat officials and Revenue Department repeatedly for a solution to the problem. “Whenever we raise our demand, the officers ask us to remain in the relief centre until an alternative arrangement is made. How long should we continue to stay there?” she questioned. All four families have appealed to the district administration to provide them with permanent relief. Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner K.B. Shivakumar visited the village recently and spoke to the affected people.

A visit to temporary vegetable markets functioning at various places in the city revealed that the prices of bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, lady’s finger, capsicum, potato, tomato and green leaves, including coriander, spinach, and fenugreek, have sky-rocketed. The price of almost all vegetables has increased from Rs. 50 per kg to Rs. 80 per kg. Capsicum, lady’s finger, cauliflower, carrot and cucumber are being sold at Rs. 100 per kg, which was earlier available at Rs. 60 per kg. Garlic is being sold at Rs. 200 per kg. Among the green leaves, fenugreek leaves (methi) is super expensive in the market with a bunch being sold at Rs. 40 in retail. As the standing vegetable crops have suffered damage, arrivals in the wholesale market have fallen by 40 %. Vegetable sellers Siddu and Veeresh said that vegetables were now being transported from far-off places. “Most of the retailers are bringing vegetable stock from neighbouring taluks and even from neighbouring districts. “As transportation charge is a major component while fixing prices of vegetables and fruits, this additional burden has to be ultimately recovered from retailers and the consumers,” said another vegetable seller Dashrath. Yet another retail vegetable seller Mohammad Jelani said that “a bag of 10 kg vegetables was priced at Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 in the wholesale market during the month of June and July; now, I pay around Rs. 400 to Rs. 600 per for the same quantity. And, a bunch of methi leaves is being charged around Rs. 25 for retailers themselves,” he added.  The prices of bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, lady’s finger, capsicum, potato, tomato and green leaves, including coriander, spinach, and fenugreek, have sky-rocketed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vegetable-prices-go-up-as-heavy-rain-hits-crops/article32768875.ece
05 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Once an IT engineer, now a proud farmer||Sathish Hudgi, a 41-year old software engineer from Halakunda village in Kalaburagi district, who had worked with many companies in India, the U.S. and in Dubai for 14 years, has now been a proud farmer of his village for a couple of years now. “The monotonous routine of work bored me. It provoked me to do something different and be creative to rejuvenate my life. A thought of taking up agriculture on 12 acres of my ancestral land prompted me to leave a lucrative job and take up agriculture as business,” Mr. Hudgi told The Hindu on Sunday. When he landed in his village after giving up a job in Dubai that was fetching him 30,000 Dirham (about Rs. 6 lakh) a month, the community around him was unwelcoming. Some laughed at him while others tried to discourage him. But, he continued with his plans. He got borewells drilled and had solar pumpsets, drip irrigation system and CCTV cameras installed at the farm, got the soil tested, consulted farm scientists at Kalaburagi’s Krishi Vigyan Kendra and so on and so forth. “In 2018, I experimented with onions on one acre. The yield was wonderful, but the price had fallen. It was break-even with no loss and no gain. The yield, however, gave me confidence and I moved ahead to experiment with sweet corn and watermelon. Watermelon cultivation in an acre of land fetched me Rs. 1.60 lakh net profit in just two months. The sweet corn in two acres gave me Rs. 2 lakh net profit,” Mr. Hudgi said. After two years of hard work, Mr. Hudgi is now more confident. Mr. Hudgi’s case is not an isolated one as hundreds of highly educated individuals are showing more interest in agriculture, particularly after the outbreak of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown. Shankar Rathod, for instance, who had worked as a chartered engineer since 2006, has now taken up anjeer, lemon, jackfruit, mango and coconut cultivation. Srinivas Rathod, who worked as lecturer in engineering colleges at Bhopal, Jaipur and other cities, has returned to his native place after the outbreak of COVID-19. He is now seriously thinking of undertaking agriculture. Mohammad Pasha, who worked as a manager at a Pune-based export company, is now planning to cultivate his 11 acres of land and also develop a business of exporting agricultural produces. “After most of the sectors were hit by the pandemic, the educated class has realised that agriculture is one of the good and sustainable sectors to invest in and work on. Doctors, engineers, advocates, lecturers working on contract basis and other professionals, some of whom have returned from different countries, are visiting the KVK to inquire about the latest farming technologies, crop varieties, market availability and suitable crop pattern for Kalaburagi weather,” P. Vasudev Naik, horticulture scientist, told The Hindu . Raju Teggali, an entomologist who heads the Kalaburagi KVK, said that most of the educated and foreign-returned were showing interest in advanced technologies such as polyhouse farming.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/once-an-it-engineer-now-a-proud-farmer/article32768872.ece

05 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Work on Rs. 174-crore Adyar-Harekala vented dam-cum-bridge begins||Drinking water needs of areas on the southern bank of the Netravathi, from Konaje to Ullal under Mangaluru Assembly constituency, and a bridge connecting the southern bank with the National Highway 75 are likely to materialise in about two years with the Minor Irrigation Department commencing the construction work of a 520-m-long vented dam-cum-bridge between Adyar on NH 75 and Harekala. An initiative of the then Minister and now Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader, the Adyar-Harekala vented dam-cum-bridge would be built at a cost of about Rs. 174 crore, work order for which was issued to contractor G. Shankar, Udupi, in November last. Having got clearance for the project from the Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority in March, the contractor recently commenced the work. Besides providing drinking water to the fast developing regions of Mangaluru Assembly constituency, the bridge would offer a breather to thousands of residents of Konaje, Deralakatte, Mudupu, for a faster commute to NH 75 as well as to the city. Hitherto, they depended upon road transport via Thokkottu or boats at different Dhakkes. The education hub around Deralakatte entirely depended upon fast-depleting groundwater hitherto. The structure being built in the CRZ of the Netravathi would submerge 19.2 hectares of land, including agricultural, a major portion being on the Harekala side, said Department’s Assistant Executive Engineer in Mangaluru K. Krishnakumar. Land acquisition proceedings would soon begin, he told The Hindu . Having commenced the work, the contractor was also in the process of fabricating girders for the bridge, getting gates for vents and other prerequisites, he said. Coffer bunds, for one third portion of the riverbed at a time, would be erected to facilitate the dam construction. Though given two years time for completing the project, the contractor was confident of completing it ahead of the deadline, latest by the end of 2022, according to Mr. Krishnakumar. While the department’s responsibility was to build the structure and provide irrigation facilities to about 260 hectares of land in Harekala, Pavoor and surrounding villages, the local authorities or the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department would arrange for drinking water supply, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/work-on-rs-174-crore-adyar-harekala-vented-dam-cum-bridge-begins/article32769387.ece
05 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||NHAI starts filling potholes on NH 75||In the midst of the #RoadChallenge campaign by Youth Congress leader Mithun Rai exposing the poor highway network in Dakshina Kannada on his Facebook page gaining momentum, the National Highways Authority of India has commenced the pothole filling exercise on National Highway 75 after rainfall subsided. When The Hindu visited BC Road-Melkar stretch of NH 75, the affected stretches were found to have been filled with bitumen mix even as bitumen mixing process was on near Panemangaluru Junction. Though the potholes and craters have been filled, the road surface has not been made even. Mr. Rai launched the campaign about 10 days ago following a large number of road users decrying the sorry state of the highways connecting Mangaluru with the other parts of the State. In his first of the several posts on September 25, Mr. Rai said, “#RoadChallenge, Let’s have this one as well #NitinGadkari. Mangalore is a land of Ports, an education hub, a city of IT companies and mega industries and many more. Mangaluru is the 2nd largest business centre in Karnataka. Around 75% of India’s coffee, timber and cashew nuts exports are handled by the New Mangalore Port. (sic)” Continuing further, Mr. Rai said that almost all National Highways connecting Mangaluru are in pathetic condition and the city does not deserve to have such roads. Though this was brought to the notice of MP Nalin Kumar Kateel several times, he does not seem to understand and see any of these. He asked people to record videos and take pictures of bad highways and post on social media, #RoadChallenge tagging Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari. While four-laning work on NH 75 between BC Road and Addahole in Dakshina Kannada and between Maranahalli and Hassan in Hassan district has almost come to a standstill after four years of beign launched, the existing carriageway was poorly maintained. Thus, says Nitin Keshav Bhandary, a regular traveller, he has not seen the highway in a motorable condition at least for two decades now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nhai-starts-filling-potholes-on-nh-75/article32769392.ece
05 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Forum urges Railways to rescind train cancellation||The Pashchima Karavali Railway Yatri Sangha on Sunday urged the Railways to rescind the order cancelling Bengaluru-Mangaluru-Bengaluru four days a week Special Train (0615/0616) as the service was getting popular amid the COVID-19 situation. “Sale of tickets for the service that was introduced just a few days ago cannot be the parameter for cancelling it,” said sangha president G. Hanumanth Kamath in a statement here. He said that the cancelled Bengaluru-Mangaluru Special as well as Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Special (06585/06586), which is under the threat of being cancelled, were serving the travel needs of the entire coastal districts. At a time when travelling had come to a standstill during COVID-19, services of these two trains were required for those in dire need of travel, Mr. Kamath pointed out. He said that the services were gaining popularity within a short span, from September 4, and the cancellation of the Mangaluru service was uncalled for. Mr. Kamath noted that second class coaches were not required as there was no counter sales of tickets. So were air-conditioned coaches as people did not prefer to travel on them in view of COVID-19 threat perception. Counting their occupancy too while cancelling the service was fallacious, he argued. With over 200 advance reservations every day, there was every chance of the services getting popular in the coming days. People stop online booking once availability position reaches RAC, Mr. Kamath said and added that general quota should be increased to facilitate more booking. At a time when the economy was yet to recover from COVID-19 blues, train travel offered affordable mode of commuting. If that too are stopped, people would be put to greater hardship, he said. The special trains were necessary for the revival of the coastal economy. For that matter, almost all special trains across the country were running with fewer occupancy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forum-urges-railways-to-rescind-train-cancellation/article32769393.ece

According to Barke Police, a group of right wing activists tried to stop a mini-lorry that was carrying the cattle in Mannagudda at about 5 a.m. The vehicle was heading towards an abattoir in Kudroli. The vehicle sped away and as it crossed a road hump, seven head of cattle fell off the vehicle. The activists alerted the police, who rushed to seize the vehicle near the abattoir. The police found two head of cattle in the vehicle. The Barke Police registered a case of theft under Indian Penal Code and also under the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. In the evening, three persons were arrested in this connection.  Another case A pair of cattle was reported stolen from a place of worship in Surathkal on Friday. The Surathkal Police are working on clues to trace the accused.

05 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Processing unit seeks to handle chicken waste||A private chicken waste processing unit at Baikampady here has come forward to collect, transport and process about 30 tonnes of chicken waste produced in the city daily. It has approached Mangaluru City Corporation to hand over to it the waste for converting it into animal feed and also, oil used in soap manufacturing industry. According to sources in the corporation, the council of the civic body will take a decision on handing over the waste to the unit, at its meeting later this month as such an arrangement can help save some funds being spent on solid waste management annually. As per the seven-year solid waste management contractual agreement with Antony Waste Handling Cell Ltd., which is valid till January 2022, the latter will collect and transport the waste for the civic body now. The waste transported is deep buried in the Pachchanady landfill site. Hence, the civic body cannot deny this waste to the same company as the payment to the company is being made on the basis of the quantity of solid waste collected by it. The corporation will have to hold talks with the company for diverting chicken waste to the unit at Baikampady and a solution will have to be worked out. The council will discuss the two aspects before taking the decision. Sources said that the corporation now spent between Rs. 3.5 crore and Rs. 4 crore annually for the collection, transportation and disposal of over 10,000 tonnes of chicken waste annually. If the unit at Baikampady is allowed to collect, transport and process the waste on its own, the civic body can reduce a part of its budget on solid waste management. They said that two other major chicken retailers in the city with their own poultry farms have their own processing units for converting the waste into animal feed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/processing-unit-seeks-to-handle-chicken-waste/article32769395.ece
05 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Conditional clearance for vented dam||The Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority (KSCZMA) has given conditional coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for the construction of the vented dam-cum-bridge between Adyar, off National Highway 75 and Harekala across the Netravathi by the Minor Irrigation Department. Important among the conditions was allowing the flow of 10 % fresh water into the downstream when the gates of the dam were closed to facilitate fish breeding, Deputy Conservator of Forests and Regional Director of the Authority in Mangaluru Dinesh Kumar Y.K. said. The proposal was cleared in the 29th meeting of the authority on February 14 this year. The condition becomes significant in view of a large number of fish dying downstream Malavoor vented dam across the Phalguni (Gurupura) a couple of years ago during peak summer. As water outflow had completely stopped and the coffer dam built during the construction of the vented dam was not removed, dissolved oxygen levels near the dam had substantially decreased. The condition to allow flow of fresh water as well as removal of coffer dam immediately after the construction of the dam at Adyar should ensure the marine life was not affected downstream the Netravathi, Mr. Kumar reasoned. The other conditions prescribed by the authority include ensuring that the river bank was not eroded or affected and disposing of construction waste according to Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conditional-clearance-for-vented-dam/article32769388.ece
05 October 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Yakshagana academy plans to bring out encyclopaedia||The Karnataka Yakshagana Academy is planning to bring out an encyclopaedia on Yakshagana, according to academy chairman M.A. Hegde. The academy has identified G.S. Bhat of Mysuru, recipient of the government’s Parthi Subba Award for Yakshagana, to be its honorary editor. The project is estimated to cost about Rs. 50 lakh, Mr. Hegde told The Hindu. He said that the academy will request the Department of Kannada and Culture for funds. The editorial committee will be constituted once the government promises the funds. As per the proposal, the encyclopaedia will have details on the birth and growth of Yakshagana, information on artistes and Yakshagana literature, glossary of Yakshagana and the like. It should serve as a one-point reference for Yakshagana, he said. Various schools Referring to different schools or forms of Yakshagana, Mr. Hegde said that the “Ghattadakore” school is on the verge of extinction. Only members of a family of Kollegal in Chamarajanagar district have sustained this art form. This family migrated from Kundapur area long ago. The “Kelike” school is also under threat. Performance of this art form can be seen in some pockets of Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts. The “Moodalapaya” school is prevalent in 14 districts, including Tumakuru, Mysuru, Davangere, Ballari and Chamarajanagar. These three schools have not received as much patronage as “Tenku Thittu” and “Badagu Thittu”, which are performed in the coastal and Malnad belts. Mr. Hegde said that earlier Yakshagana scholar M. Prabhakara Joshi had worked on Yakshagana Padakosha , which was a descriptive lexicon on the technical terms of the art. The Regional Resources Centre for Folk Performing Arts, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College, Udupi, published it in 1994.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yakshagana-academy-plans-to-bring-out-encyclopaedia/article32768905.ece

05 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Surge in COVID-19 cases impacting Mysuru’s industrial activity||More than six months into the pandemic, the industrial scenario in Mysuru – as elsewhere in the State – is beginning to look up, but only marginally. The city known to be a cluster and hub for ancillary units for the auto component sector is gaining traction but most firms are still functioning at about 50 to 60% of their capacity. Though there are signs of revival, it is too early to suggest that the manufacturing was fully back on track, said Ramprasad from the Nanjangud Industries’ Association. He said industries were beginning to get orders but a majority of the firms were doing with two shifts instead of three of 8 hours each. “This is a far cry from the pre-COVID-19 scenario where the manufacturing sector would function at 85% to 90% of the capacity. But this is surely an improvement over the situation that prevailed during the lockdown,” said Suresh Kumar Jain, General Secretary, Mysuru Industries Association. He said the labour force is back in most factories though the migrant labourers from U.P., Bihar and other States who constituted the bulk of the work force have not returned. However, there is growing concern among the manufacturers that the surge in the pandemic was preventing the industrial units from working at their full capacity. “The auto sector is showing signs of revival and the demand for components has gone up compared to what it was a few months ago. This is an encouraging sign. But the COVID-19 spread is decelerating any efforts to ramp up production,” said Sudhakar Shetty of the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI). This is because the surge in the COVID-19 cases had led to adopting new protocols with reduced work force to ensure social distancing. Only a fraction of the workers are being deployed during a shift and whenever an employee tests positive, the entire manufacturing process gets disturbed for a few days and this was becoming a regular affair, said Mr. Jain. That the manufacturing sector and the industrial activity were yet to regain full traction is also evident in the power consumption which has declined. “Nanjangud industrial area used to run up a bill of Rs. 15 crore to Rs. 20 crore per month towards electricity charges. But in the recent months following the pandemic, this hovers around Rs. 7 crore to Rs. 8 crore, which is an indication that the manufacturing units are functioning at half the capacity,” Mr. Ramprasad added.  The auto sector is showing signs of revival and the demand for components has gone up compared to what it was a few months ago. This is an encouraging sign. But the COVID-19 spread is decelerating any efforts to ramp up production.Sudhakar ShettyFederation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surge-in-covid-19-cases-impacting-mysurus-industrial-activity/article32769016.ece

05 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tests made mandatory for street vendors, retailers||All street vendors in the city and retailers at the three main markets, including the Devaraja Market, have been directed to get themselves tested for COVID-19 within a week. This was decided by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) authorities in a bid to curb the possible spread of the cases which is on the rise in the city. Mysuru reported 1,514 new cases on Saturday – the highest since the pandemic broke out – sending the authorities into a tizzy. The district has also recorded 798 cumulative deaths and has become a major source of worry for the administration. Hence the authorities though it fit to increase testing in places where there is large public movement and transaction as in case of the main markets. Gurudutt Hegde, Commissioner, MCC, said there are nearly 900 vendors and merchants in Devaraja Market alone and they expect about 2,000 vendors to be covered from the three markets, including the Mandi and Vani Vilas markets. In addition, there are over 2,000 registered street vendors in the city as per the 2018 records but the actual numbers are manifold as not all have registered. “We have given them one week’s time for getting tested for COVID-19. Our mobile teams will also visit the three markets and the vendors can make use of the opportunity to get themselves tested,” said Mr. Hegde. But this is not a one-time testing and the MCC has announced that repeat tests will be necessary to ensure that those testing positive are quarantined and do not come in contact with the public. “Vendors have to get themselves tested once in a fortnight and the police will be empowered to enforce the rules,” said the Commissioner. As part of the unlocking, markets have opened but it has been found that in most cases both the vendors and the customers tend to be casual about wearing masks while social distancing is compromised. Mr. Hegde said they have ramped up the capacity for testing and the mobile units will offer both RT-PCR and rapid tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tests-made-mandatory-for-street-vendors-retailers/article32769022.ece
05 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Teerthodbhava: MLA suggests devotees to bring COVID-19 certificate||There are suggestions that devotees keen to participate and witness the Cauvery Teerthodbhava at the birthplace of river Cauvery on October 17 be advised to bring a COVID-19 negative certificate. This is in view of the surge in the cases across the State and the imperatives of preventing its spread by discouraging mass gathering. The suggestion was made by Appachu Ranjan, MLA, who urged the authorities to ensure that people coming to the event be armed with the certificate. Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy said a medical team will be asked to assess the modalities on its implementation and whether it was practical. She said it was one of the suggestions discussed in the meeting held on Saturday but no final decision had been taken yet. Kodagu district in charge Minister V. Somanna said all the rituals and traditions associated with the event will be held as per schedule and the district administration and Muzrai Department were directed to ensure that preparations and arrangements are in place. The Minister also handed over a cheque for Rs. 1 crore towards the development of Talacauvery. It was also decided that devotees would not be allowed to take a dip in the kalyani and instead holy water would be sprinkled after the Teerthodbhava which is scheduled to take place on October 17 at 7.03 a.m. Teerthodbhava refers to water gushing out from the Brahmakundike at the birthplace of the Cauvery at a specified time to witness which devotees gather in large numbers every year and also take a bath in the large kalyani or pond. Road repair Mr. Somanna also directed the PWD to ensure that all roads connecting to Bhagamandala and Talacauvery were repaired. Police were instructed to ensure proper barricading so that social distancing was not violated.  A medical team will be asked to assess the modalities on its implementation and whether it is practical. It is one of the suggestions discussed in the meeting but no final decision has been taken yet.Annies Kanmani JoyKodagu Deputy Commissioner||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/teerthodbhava-mla-suggests-devotees-to-bring-covid-19-certificate/article32769017.ece

This move is one step towards upgrading the city council as a corporation, said H.M. Suresh Kumar, party’s spokesperson in a press conference here on Saturday. Mr. Suresh Kumar said people residing in villages around the city had demanded that their localities be brought under the CMC limits for many years. With the efforts of Hassan MLA Preetham Gowda, the demand had been fulfilled by the government. This would help improve basic infrastructure facilities in these villages. “With the expansion of the area under CMC, the population in the city limits would increase to 2.26 lakh. However, it would require 3 lakh people in an urban body to declare it a corporation,” he said. Development projects The city would get many development projects in the coming days. The project to provide drinking water for 24 hours in a day had been going on, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/move-to-bring-25-villages-within-cmcs-ambit-welcomed/article32769018.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||As the byelections to two Assembly constituencies and polls to four Council seats were announced, two Opposition parties and erstwhile coalition partners, the Congress and the JD(S), once again sharpened their knives to attack each other. JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who seems to have softened his attack against the BJP government, has trained his guns on the Congress, calling it “not worthy of an alliance”. Hours after the Congress ruled out an alliance with the JD(S), Mr. Kumaraswamy, who became Chief Minister for a second time with the support of the Congress, said the party does not honour coalition dharma and is not worthy for an alliance. Interestingly, during a rally at Sira on Wednesday, Mr. Kumaraswamy said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to make him Chief Minister for five years soon after the fractured 2018 Assembly results. Are more “revelations” to be expected as the campaign picks up?   The much-awaited State Cabinet expansion once again seems to be on the back burner. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa(in picture), who rushed to the national capital to obtain the approval of the top leaders for a Cabinet expansion/rejig before the commencement of the legislature session on September 21, now seems to be in no hurry to induct new Ministers. Keeping in mind the party’s unity during the upcoming bypolls to two Assembly seats and polls to four Council seats, the Chief Minister might consider putting off the plan till after the polls. Meanwhile, pressure from legislators such as R. Shankar, N. Nagaraj (MTB) (both MLCs), Umesh Katti, and Arvind Limbavali (MLAs), all aspirants for ministerial berths, is said to be mounting on Mr. Yediyurappa. With the expansion unlikely to satisfy all, given the number of aspirants, deferment seems likely.   Rohini Sindhuri(in picture), a 2009 batch IAS officer, is among the civil servants in Karnataka constantly under media glare. Little wonder that her appointment as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru recently, replacing B. Sharat who served barely a month in the post, sparked off a row. While Congress leader B.V. Seetharam, who belongs to the Bhovi community, cried foul over the transfer of Mr. Sharat, contending that the BJP government had sacrificed the interests of an official belonging to their community, JD(S) leader S.R. Mahesh, MLA, claimed that Ms. Sindhuri had been posted to Mysuru in return for the alleged favours she had extended, as Commissioner of Endowment Department, in a project to provide accommodation to devotees at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh. Ms. Sindhuri chose to reply to the allegations on the Tirumala project in her own style. “The project symbolises universal brotherhood showcasing the ideal — Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — which cannot be held hostage to narrow minds and narrower hearts,” she said. Meanwhile, Mr. Sharat, appearing to take a cue from Ms. Sindhuri’s own legal battle against her “premature” transfer from Hassan in 2018, has moved the Central Administrative Tribunal questioning his transfer within 29 days of taking charge as DC.

According to the Health Department, at least five confirmed dengue fever cases and three confirmed leptospirosis cases were reported from the district in the last six days. The dengue cases were logged from Pallippuram, Vayalar, Thanneermukkom, Cherthala and Champakulam, while Nelamperoor, Panavally and Alappuzha registered one leptospirosis case each. The district also witnessed two suspected leptospirosis deaths during this period. Although the situation is nowhere near spiralling out of control, the diseases are threatening to pile more pressure on a severely strained health machinery in the district. In 2019, Alappuzha logged 355 dengue cases including one death and 188 leptospirosis cases with four deaths. This year, around 200 dengue and 100 leptospirosis cases have been reported so far. “Regarding dengue fever and leptospirosis cases, there is nothing unusual this year, as it follows the same pattern as in the previous years. As a waterlogged place, the district is vulnerable to diseases like leptospirosis. The only difference this time is that a large part of the health machinery is involved in fighting the pandemic. We are short-staffed and this has an impact on other activities of the Health Department,” said a Health Department official. Officials said that the department had strengthened surveillance in affected areas utilising the available resources. As leptospirosis would spread through the urine of infected animals, officials urged the people involved in jobs, which brought them into contact with stagnant water to ensure personal protection. They added that those vulnerable to the disease could take preventive medicines. Dengue fever, caused by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, could be kept at bay by keeping possible mosquito breeding grounds clean and avoiding mosquito bites, experts said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/double-whammy-for-alappuzha-district/article32768970.ece

The deceased were identified as a 62-year-old man from Arattuppuzha, a 67-year-old woman from Kareelakulangara, a 68-year-old woman from Kattanam, and a 59-year-old woman from Pulinkunnu. According to the Health Department, the district so far recorded 48 COVID-19 deaths. Of the fresh cases, as many as 520 patients contracted the virus through local transmission. Rest of the cases include 22 people who came from other States, one from abroad, and one health staff. While 62 new cases were reported from Mararikulam South, Chennam Pallippuram registered 60 cases, Ambalappuzha North (39), Alappuzha (29) and Venmony (25).

It has been two months since the road was washed away in landslips that also disrupted power connection to the area. Landline and mobile connections too have been disrupted putting the 27 tribal settlements spread over a wide area in the forest out of connectivity. With no road, the only option for Edamalakkudy residents was to walk the hilly stretch of 18 km from Pettimudy to Societykudy, the headquarters of all the settlements. Goods movement and online education of students in the tribal village is also still in limbo, according to sources.  Power lines A senior official of the KSEB said the power cable to Edamalakkudy, which was damaged in the landslips, was being set right and supply would be restored by the end of this week, he said. Devikulam Sub Collector S. Prem Krishnan said repair work on one more kilometre of Edamalakkudy road needed to be done before setting the road link right. The Forest Department said they would complete the works within one week. Temporary solution Yet the repair work was just a temporary solution, as the road was made of mud that would most likely be washed away in the next floods. Only a concrete or keeled road would ensure proper road connectivity, a Forest Department official said, adding if the government issued a special order, a proper road connectivity to Edamalakkudy could be made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/edamalakkudy-totally-cut-off/article32768976.ece

Blood stains were found in most kits supplied by the Kerala Medical Services Corporation. It is suspected that used kits might have been repacked and supplied for use. Meanwhile, the District Congress Committee (DCC) demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. DCC president Satheesan Pacheni said it could only be viewed with apprehension that blood stains were found in PPE kits supplied to nurses looking after COVID-19 patients. “The fact that most packets available at the medical college were examined, and that blood stains were found in most of them reveals the depth of fraud,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nurses-at-mch-get-blood-stained-ppe-kits/article32768922.ece
05 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic curbs in place at Palarivattom||Traffic regulations were introduced at the NH Bypass Junction at Palarivattom on Sunday, as part of which the crossing along Civil Line Road was barricaded, and vehicles along the road were diverted through U-turns that were created on either side of the flyover. With Sunday being a lean day and curbs on people gathering in public places, traffic was minimal through the junction. “More number of vehicles are expected on Monday, when the junction generally encounters snarls. Vehicles in the east-west direction will thus take a left turn and cross over to the other side through newly-built U-turns on either side of the flyover. They need to travel only 350 metres extra on each side. Over 30-metre wide U-turns, each capable of accommodating vehicles in multiple rows, have been carved out on either side of the flyover. Vehicles will have to use this facility till the flyover is rebuilt,” said Francis Shelby, Assistant Commissioner of Police, City Traffic Police (East). The advantages of having two U-turns, 700 metres from each other, are many. Commuters will face minimum inconvenience, while monitoring traffic will be easy. Around a dozen personnel, including four wardens sponsored by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), will be posted in and around the junction to regulate vehicles and to ensure the safety of pedestrians. Electronic signal lamps will be installed at both the U-turns, to regulate traffic coming from the NH Bypass and those taking U-turn. Their importance will go up during night. Adequate number of lights too will be installed at the two U-turns, to ensure visibility from a distance, the officer said. On Sunday, barricades were erected beneath the central spans, to ensure safety of road users when the flyover is dismantled and rebuilt. Barricades have been installed beside the flyover too, wherever concrete crash barriers are being demolished. The DMRC has also set up sign boards to warn motorists to slow down, considering civil work over the flyover. Potholes remain In the meantime, potholes along potential traffic diversion roads like Vennala-Puthiya Road stretch have not being repaired by the Kochi Corporation. Encroachments by houses and shops abound on Puthiya Road and at Vennala High School Junction, obstructing traffic. The DMRC and Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), the stakeholders engaged in reconstructing the flyover, will have to repair potholes on Civil Line Road and alternative roads, in case the PWD and the Kochi Corporation do not repair them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-curbs-in-place-at-palarivattom/article32769356.ece
05 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Local testing for symptomatic persons to be done daily||Till recently, COVID-19 testing at the community or primary health centre level in local bodies would take place only once or twice a week and symptomatic persons might have been required to wait to get a test done at a government facility nearby. Now, district health officials have issued an order to conduct testing daily at the panchayat level. Daily testing at the local level would begin in about a week, said Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Symptomatic people were required to report symptoms to the medical officer or health worker at the nearest government health centre, after which they would be given an appointment at a testing facility, said Dr. Numpeli. Walking into a government facility to get tested for COVID-19 on demand was neither allowed nor feasible since it could lead to a further spread of the disease, he added. A doctor at the Ernakulam General Hospital said over 50 swabs were collected daily at the hospital. Allowing people to walk in and get themselves tested at the hospital without prior intimation could prove to be unmanageable, the doctor said. Getting symptomatic people tested had earlier been managed by the district’s COVID-19 control room. But in an attempt to decentralise and hasten the process, local bodies had been asked to inform residents of a local control room or health worker they could contact, said Dr. Numpeli. Private facilities People who suspect that they might have contracted the disease from a contact have resorted to private facilities to reassure themselves. After their acquaintance tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, a 39-year-old woman and her 47-year-old husband, residents of Pettah and both asymptomatic, got themselves tested at a private lab, where the woman tested positive. Ten days later, after a repeat test at a government facility, the man tested positive as well. “Since health officials might have asked us to wait 10 days before we get tested, we decided to get tested at a private lab to avoid that intervening period of anxiety,” said the man. As per protocol, asymptomatic people are no longer tested even if they are high-risk primary contacts. If an asymptomatic person wanted a test done, they could choose a private lab, said District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan. Walk-in kiosks While the COVID-19 walk-in sample kiosk (WISK) was initially envisaged as a telephone booth-like facility where samples could easily be collected in case of a surge in caseload, problems of infection control could arise if they were set up in public places, said Nikhilesh Menon, nodal officer for COVID lab surveillance. The gloves and tunnel of the kiosk, that allows the health worker to collect the sample, would have to be disinfected by a worker in PPE after each use. That, in addition to waste management, could be an issue in public spaces, he said. Consequently, the kiosks have been placed in taluk hospitals, the two General Hospitals, the Government Medical College Hospital, a few community health centres and first-line treatment centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-testing-for-symptomatic-persons-to-be-done-daily/article32769371.ece
05 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Ernakulam to have 237 toilets in public spaces||In a collective effort involving the district administration, Suchitwa Mission and local bodies, 237 toilets are either to be newly constructed or renovated in public spaces in the district under a campaign named ‘Take a Break.’ Under the project, eight toilets will be allotted within the corporation limits, five each in municipalities and two each in panchayats. Local bodies have been asked to submit images of facilities that could be renovated. “The focus is on renovating existing ones into beautified and hygienic facilities. Local bodies can use Plan or own funds, finance commission grants, aid from MLA funds, and even use corporate social responsibility funds,” said P.H. Shine, assistant development commissioner and district coordinator, Suchitwa Mission, Ernakulam. Though initially, the plan was to achieve the target by the end of this year, it may overshoot that time frame on account of the impending local body elections and the pandemic-related restrictions. User fee Plans are afoot to rope in Kudumbashree workers for proper maintenance of the toilets. Different models in tune with local conditions and infrastructural feasibility are being explored alongside a user fee for making the facilities self-sustainable and ensuring their longevity. One of the proposals is to rent out space for ATM counters or material collection facilities alongside toilets at places where spacious buildings could be found so that the rent covers operational expenses. Setting up stalls in association with Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam or stores for local products, thus creating a market space to bankroll the project, is also being considered though nothing has been finalised yet. Depending on facilitating factors, some toilets will be scaled up to premium standards with feeding room, dressing room, sanitary napkin vending machines and even small eateries. However, not all local bodies seem overly excited. Aluva municipality which already has toilet complexes in the market and bus stand, though some of them have fallen into disrepair, said it would not be easy to find space for new ones. “The only potential locations are along the national highways for which we will have to secure permission from the NHAI,” said municipal chairperson Lissy Abraham.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulam-to-have-237-toilets-in-public-spaces/article32769357.ece

The centres will come up in areas such as Aluva, Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Kolancherry, Koovappady and Kothamangalam. Libraries, clubs, halls, and anganwadis easily accessible to migrant communities and having the necessary infrastructure to facilitate online learning will serve as training centres. “As per a survey, there are around 939 students, predominantly migrants, who may have access to online learning through Victers channel but still need the assistance of such special centres since their families are not in a position to help them with their studies. School dropouts, children who never got enrolled among the local populace, including tribal communities, will also be covered under the project,” said Usha Manatt, district project coordinator, SSK. Nearly Rs. 55 lakh has been earmarked for the project in the district, which will cover the expenses of setting up basic infrastructure such as televisions and projectors wherever needed, monthly salary of education volunteers and refreshments, and conveyance of participants. The centres will be run thus only till the reopening of schools, after which all the 30 centres will be co-opted into as many schools where fixed hours will be allocated either before or after school hours or during weekends. “The plan is to conduct sessions five days a week at different timings between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. for batches belonging to Classes 1 to 12 to maintain physical distancing and COVID protocol. EVs (education volunteers) will be present at centres all through,” said P.B. Ratheesh, urban coordinator, SSK. Multilingual EVs capable of switching between different languages to communicate effectively with migrant students have been roped in. That EVs will be paid a monthly salary of Rs. 6,500 has come in handy for the likes of Thahira N.E. from Muvattupuzha who taught in an unaided college till two years ago. “Hopefully, there will be good participation in the sessions,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/special-centres-for-migrant-students-to-turn-operational/article32769359.ece

The district witnessed an increase of 1,55,112 voters since the finalisation of the 2015 list, which was used as the base document for the civic polls during the year. Ernakulam had 23,79,087 voters as per the 2015 list. The 2020 electoral roll, which was released by the State Election Commission on October 1, will serve as the voters’ list for the local body polls likely to be held by year-end. The new list has 12,29,057 male voters and 13,05,107 female voters and 35 others on the rolls. Ernakulam comes in the fourth position in terms of the total number of voters as Malappuram topped the list with 32,83,647 voters followed by Thiruvananthapuram (27,69,252) and Thrissur (26,54,699). The scrutiny witnessed 1,19,765 voters going out of the list in the district, which included 1,57,164 men, 62,598 women and three others. At the same time, 80,434 men, 99,103 women and 10 others found place in the revised list as political parties and prospective candidates worked overtime to enrol voters. Chance to enrol The total number of voters may undergo minor changes as people will be given one more opportunity to enrol themselves just before the local body elections. The Commission will also provide another opportunity for filing complaints regarding the entries or deletion in the list before the elections. The 2015 elections had 3,104 polling stations in the district. The number of stations may be increased, considering the increase in the number of voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/district-has-2534-lakh-voters/article32769362.ece
05 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||QR code-based visitors’ log finds few takers||While a QR code-based visitors’ registration system is available on the State government’s COVID-19 Jagratha portal as an alternative to the manual recording of visitor details at shops and other establishments to help with tracing contacts of patients, most commercial establishments in the district continue to use handwritten registers. The shop or establishment will have to be registered on the Jagratha portal to get a specific QR code generated. A copy of the code can then be placed at the entry. Scanning the QR code on entry redirects the customer to the Jagratha portal, where they are required to enter name, phone number, and address. Some establishments like a large supermarket chain with a few branches across the district have both the QR code displayed and a register where customer details are manually entered by the guard at the entrance. The manager of a supermarket in the Ernakulam South area said they had retained the manual register system. “We have customers who might not possess a smartphone. A QR code system is not entirely practical,” he said. Staff at a clothing store near Kadavanthra said that customer contact details were being collected manually. Since they were only allowing a limited number of customers into the store at a time, recording their details manually was not a hassle, the manager said. Other factors A senior health official, however, remained sceptical about the use of such a system. “In the contact tracing process, factors like how close somebody was to a patient, whether they were both wearing masks, and the amount of time the two people might have spent in contact, are important. Entering a shop or establishment need not make somebody a contact and collecting all that information might not really be useful,” he said. A directive from the Health and Family Welfare Department had, last month, suggested that the QR code system be implemented in establishments functioning under the department.

In a statement, the forum, comprising all trade unions, said the government should not pass the Major Port Trust Authority Act, 2020. It demanded that the government reconsider the conditions in the licence agreement with the operator of the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam. The conditions should be rewritten in keeping with the interests of the port, the forum said. The trade unions expressed the view that the expenses for dredging the shipping channel for the Kochi port should be shared by the Cochin Shipyard and the Indian Navy, so that the burden did not fall exclusively on the port trust. They also said that the smooth operations of the port should be ensured by appointing personnel to vacant posts and streamlining operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unions-protest-against-privatisation-of-port/article32769364.ece

05 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Farmers welcome move to quash field auctions||Farmers under the aegis of Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti have welcomed a decision by the district administration to quash the auction of pokkali rice fields at Maruvakkad for shrimp culture for the ensuing season. The auction of the rice fields broke the crop calendar and was done in violation of the COVID-19 lockdown, said the district administration on a complaint filed by Chanthu Manjadiparambil, a pokkali farmer. Pokkali fields are cultivated in a fish-and-rice cycle in which rice cultivation is taken up between May 15 and November 15. However, less than four acres of the 260 cultivable acres in Maruvakkad were brought under sowing this season because of the delay in field preparations, which should have begun in the middle of May, said Francis Kalathungal of Pokkali Samrkashana Samiti. There are a total of 420 acres of pokkali fields in the Mavuvakkad paddy collective. Sabotage bid alleged He welcomed the decision by the district administration as the shrimp culture lobby had been consistently trying to sabotage rice cultivation, he alleged. “Only less than 10 acres of the pokkali fields have been brought under sowing over the past decade for various reasons,” he added. He alleged that the Paadashekhara Samiti had been trying to ‘harass’ pokkali farmers in order to carry out shrimp culture throughout the year. He said the rice season in 2020 was lost because the fields could not be drained from April 15 as the fish culture prolonged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-welcome-move-to-quash-field-auctions/article32769358.ece

Responding to a petition by Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, seeking to convene a high-level review meeting to assess the progress of railway development works in his constituency, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that focus would be on expediting these works. Petition In his petition, the MP pointed out that work moved at a snail’s pace in the 17-kilometres stretch while the proposed renovation of the Kottayam Railway Station and the proposed second entrance to the station near the goods shed too lagged much behind the schedule. The Central government already allotted Rs. 20 crore to renovate the station here, which would be flaunting a touch of indigenous Kerala design on completion of the works. The project also envisaged developing the circulation area, besides renovating the pilgrim shelter. Bridges The petition further demanded that the construction of bridges across the Meenachil and Kodoor rivers at Kottayam, Muttambalam subway, and the ROB at rubber board be completed in a time-bound manner. Inconvenience to public According to the MP, the delay in construction of ROBs at Chottanikkara Road, Mulanthuruthi, Kaduthuruthy, Kuruppanthara, Manjur, Kothanallur, Carithas, Kottayam P&T Quarters, and Pakil were causing severe inconvenience to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railways-to-expedite-track-doubling-in-kottayam/article32768968.ece
05 October 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||IIIT-Kottayam has its own learning platform||In August when the academic year took off at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam, (IIIT-Kottayam), the institute saw an open-source future for learning. The unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak had already forced the education sector to embrace technology. But in the absence of robust connectivity, questions on the efficacy of remote learning continued to linger. So, instead of the usual re-purposing of the work-based platforms such as Zoom or Google Meet, the Centrally funded institution opted to build a customised application using Moodle plugins — OSOC-P — that supports the rich ecosystem of classroom learning. This new learning management system, developed with the active support of its faculty members and technical support staff, is now reaping rich dividends. “IIIT-Kottayam has innovated an #OpenSourcePlatform for the Teaching & Learning Process (OSOC-P). The platform is capable of delivering online classes & conducts all virtual activities like online classes, content sharing, etc. for registered users. Great work team!”, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Union Minister of Education, recently wrote on his social media page. According to M. Radhakrishnan, Registrar, IIIT-Kotttayam, the platform is capable of handling requests by multiple students and faculty members at the same time. It can also be used for organising virtual programming labs. “Each course maintains a separate dashboard containing its own announcements and lecture notes and is connected to an own meeting room,” Ebin Deni Raj, a faculty member of CSE Department explained. Online exams It also enables the conduct of online examinations. Plagiarised content is flagged instantly .  Having achieved cent percent attendance of students — a rare feat in the age of online learning, IIIT-Kottayam now seeks to help other institutions in the region to adapt to virtual learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iiit-kottayam-has-its-own-learning-platform/article32768990.ece
05 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||‘More govt. hospitals needed to treat COVID-19 patients’||With the number of active COVID-19 cases inching towards the 10,000-mark in Kozhikode, demand is rife to earmark more government hospitals for treatment in the district. There has also been a suggestion to set up more intensive care units (ICU) and start dialysis for infected persons at the hospitals. Right now, the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) and the Government General Hospital alone are the designated facilities in the public sector for treating infected persons. Malabar Medical College Hospital, Ulliyeri; KMCT Medical College Hospital, Mukkom, and IQRAA International Hospital and Research Centre, Eranhipalam, are those chosen in the private sector where low-cost or free treatment is offered. However, the number of new cases has been hovering around 1,000 in the past few days, and almost 3,000 people were found infected in the past three days alone. A senior doctor at the MCH, who did not wish to be quoted, told The Hindu that more government hospitals would have to be designated for treating patients. Though the number of infected persons at the MCH and the General Hospital is only 325 and 280 respectively, those in need of critical care among them are less than 100. So, if at least some who are not in need of critical care can be provided treatment at other government hospitals, it will help the health apparatus to focus more on severely infected persons, he claimed. “Also, another major area of concern among the infected population are people who have renal issues. Right now, only the MCH offers dialysis to them in the district. In view of the rise in the number of newly infected persons, more government hospitals should also have similar facilities,” he pointed out. Another doctor at the hospital suggested that taluk hospitals and community health centres be opened up for COVID-19 treatment. They should also be equipped with ICUs. “A person with another health issue is tested positive for the virus and admitted to the MCH. Within a couple of days, the patient’s condition may become better. Such people could be sent to nearby government facilities where their condition could be monitored regularly,” he said. According to him, apart from treatment, a few infected persons may need personal attention and care. If the number of patients goes up at the MCH, providing it could be difficult, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/more-govt-hospitals-needed-to-treat-covid-19-patients/article32768913.ece

The completion of the multi-crore project, which is estimated to cost Rs. 858 crore, will be one of the milestones in Kozhikode district’s development apart from realising its long-pending dream to have an alternate road to bypass the hairpin bends to Wayanad district. Since prohibitory orders and COVID-19 regulations are in place, the launch event will be held online. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran will attend the online event along with the Chief Minister. To mark the occasion, it will be screened live in Thiruvambady in the presence of 20 specially invited persons including Ministers T.P. Ramakrishnan and A.K. Saseendran. Entry of the public will not be allowed as part of efforts to comply with the rules. Three-year work The plan is to complete the mega project in three years. Konkan Railway Corporation Limited has been entrusted with the survey works, preparation of the Detailed Project Report and project implementation on turnkey agreement. The State government has also taken utmost care in the eco-friendly realisation of the project. “The survey work is in progress now in the project area. It is going to be a big development leap for our district to have better connectivity with Wayanad district,” said Thiruvambady MLA George M. Thomas. He said the actual cost of the project could be estimated only on completion of the ongoing survey. It was in 2014 that a feasibility study of the innovative proposal was done by the government. In 2016, it was officially approved for further proceedings and survey works. A few months ago, the State government accorded sanction to the estimate of Rs. 658 crore for implementation under the Kerala State Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. Bridge to be built Officials who prepared the preliminary estimate said the cost to complete one-km stretch of the proposed road alone would come around Rs. 150 crore considering the additional requirements. It would also include the cost of constructing a 70-metre-long bridge at Kundanthodu. The total length of the sub-terrain road would be seven kilometres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anakkampoyil-meppadi-tunnel-road-project-to-be-launched/article32768931.ece

Those who earned a living by working in such shops are now finding it hard to cope with the unexpected situation. Efforts to launch online service delivery are yet to be successful in the case of many small-scale traders in the city. Some are facing legal action apart from the suspension of their trade licences on the charge of COVID-19 protocol violations. “We are not trying to challenge any official protocol by endangering public safety. Some of us do it out of our helplessness to survive the crisis by other means,” says Abdu Rahiman, a trader on the S.M. Street. He says that the existing regulations will have to be reworked in such a way to ensure better support to the community. Merchant association leaders say containment zone regulations are literally leading to the closure of all major shops, which were not included in the list of essential services. Within the Kozhikode Corporation limits alone, the majority of the wards are now containment zones, which predicts bitter days ahead. They add that some possible amendments in the existing rigid regulations, including in the permitted working hours, will help the struggling traders to survive. ‘No communication’ “For example, there is no proper communication from the authorities to make traders actually aware of containment zone regulations. No proper instructions are given to them in advance other than some sudden public directives. Many are struggling with the blanket ban on shops which were casually labelled as inessential,” says K. Sethumadhavan, secretary of Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES). According to KVVES functionaries, the plight of traders on the S.M. Street is beyond words. “The majority of the shops fall under the essential service category and traders are unable to function now. Hundreds of workers are jobless with a looming crisis in the sector,” they say Meanwhile, Quick Response Team members, who oversee the implementation of the health protocol, say there is a very dangerous situation prevailing now in the district with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and no relaxation can be entertained for at least a month. Like traders, many are going through challenges and it is time to put such individual concerns aside for a big safety cause, they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/small-scale-traders-find-the-going-tough-amid-tight-regulations/article32768915.ece

05 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Mobile app for KSRTC for booking seats||Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has rolled out mobile reservation app ‘Ente KSRTC’ for hassle-free booking of seats in the long distance buses operated by it as part of improving the quality of services. The app along with the logo of the ‘KSRTC Logistics,’ the exclusive division set up for transporting official letters, parcels of government departments, public sector units, constitutional institutions and private entrepreneurs, and that of the ‘KSRTC Janata Service,’ the unlimited ordinary service that stop anywhere on demand, will be launched on October 6 by Chief Minister Pinaryai Vijayan. Online reservation Although the KSRTC had an online reservation facility, the State transport undertaking did not have an exclusive mobile app for taking care of those reserving the seats through mobile phones. “This is being addressed through the rolling out of the Ente KSRTC. It will have all the latest payment facilities,” Transport Minister A. K. Saseendran said on Sunday. The mobile app, developed in association with Abhi Bus, can be used on Android and iOS platforms, would come in handy for the long distance commuters. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. The ‘KSRTC Janata Service’ for the unlimited ordinary service that stops anywhere on demand was selected from the 1,000-odd suggestions received from the commuters on the KSRTC’s official facebook page. The service that commenced to overcome the low patronage due to the lockdown and the fear of using public transport has evoked good response, he said. The logistics division has been set up to mobilise funds to overcome the fall in the revenue over the last six months due to the low patronage following the lockdown and to meet the rising fuel bill and spare parts for the fleet, Mr. Saseendran said.  The mobile app, developed in association with Abhi Bus, can be used on Android and iOS platforms and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-app-from-ksrtc-for-booking-seats/article32768973.ece

The command control centre is meant for providing the Corporation with real-time data from the ground on everything from street lights to water supply to traffic situation. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mayor K.Sreekumar said that the system can function as a control room in crisis situations like floods or other natural disasters. It will also streamline the civic body's co-ordinated activities with the Police, Revenue and Health Departments. Through the video management solution to be installed in the command control centre, constant monitoring of public spaces for traffic-related issues, accidents or other issues will be made possible. Cameras enabled with various types of sensors will be placed in different parts of the city for monitoring by the centre. Traffic system The traffic lighting system in the city is also set to be modernised into an adaptive system under the Smart City project. Through the traffic diversion and management system, re-routing and management of traffic will take place. For the public, the system will also help in identifying parking lots with vacant spaces in real-time and also place bookings for the same. A single payment gateway for various services will be part of the system. Tracking waste collection and disposal will also be enabled. The command control centre will function as the nerve centre of all these diverse smart systems, spread over various departments. Mr.Sreekumar said that the Corporation plans to step up its property tax collection by a study of the city's land data bank and identifying leakages in tax collection. Inventory An asset management inventory, including the land and other properties owned by the civic body, will be prepared for the purposes of planning in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpns-command-control-centre-being-set-up/article32769463.ece

The hourly rates for the public to park their vehicles here are yet to be decided. The work on yet another multilevel parking lot near the Saphalyam complex at Palayam will also be inaugurated on Monday. This project will be as part of the Corporation’s Smart City projects. Work on another parking lot is progressing at Putharikkandam while one more proposed at the Medical College junction is at its design stage. December last The structure of the parking lot on the Corporation office premises was completed by December last. But the work on the fire safety equipment and testing had remained pending. The technicians from the Coimbatore-based company that constructed the facility were unable to travel to the city after the COVID-19 pandemic struck, which further delayed its commissioning. “The rates for parking have to be discussed in the finance committee after which it will be presented in the council for approval. Discussions will also have to be held with the employees’ unions to decide on whether the employees should have it free or should they pay a concession rate,” said a Corporation official. Across seven floors, the facility can accommodate 102 cars at a time. A sensor placed at the entry point calculates the weight and dimensions of the incoming vehicle, based on which the most suitable space is allocated by the system. On swiping the card provided at the entry point, the ramp from the specific spot allocated will arrive on the ground floor. The driver can leave the vehicle and exit the ramp, after which it will move and lock into the space allocated. Swiping card During exit, the location and the time taken for the car to be brought to the ground floor will be indicated on swiping the card at the out-booth. Executed under the Central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, the parking lot was completed at a cost of Rs. 5.64 crore. Out of this, 50% of the cost was borne by the city Corporation, 30% by the Central government, and 20% by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporations-multi-level-parking-lot-set-for-opening/article32769466.ece

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) had held the submission aloft in an attempt to put Mr. Chennithala in a spot. The builder’s name had emerged in the public domain after the UAE Red Crescent contracted him to construct 140 dwellings for the poor at Thrissur. LIFE Mission, a State agency, had facilitated the project. Recently, the builder had come under Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) scrutiny on suspicion of violating the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010, by partnering with the UAE charity.  ‘Rs. 9-crore bribe’ The builder deposed that he had paid Rs. 9 crore as bribe to various intermediaries, including Swapna and UAE consulate officials, to bag the Rs. 20-crore construction contact. The businessperson had bought five expensive phones in 2019 for Swapna, who allegedly told him that the devices were for select attendees at the UAE National Raising Day celebration at the consulate in 2019.   The builder had deposed that the phones were a minor part of the substantial bribe component.  Mr. Chennithala had attended the function as the chief guest. He later clarified that the organisers had welcomed him with a shawl, which he gave away immediately. He had not accepted any other gift though there was a raffle for attendees. A personal aide of his received a wristwatch as a lottery. Simultaneously, Mr. Chennithala moved the police to use the IMEI number of the gift phones to trace the recipients. Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has demanded the resignation of Mr. Chennithala for “violating” protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-to-sue-builder/article32768986.ece
05 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Anger boils over at MCHs across State||Faculty in all Government Medical College Hospitals (MCHs) across the State have decided to continue their agitation against the suspension of one of their senior colleagues in Thiruvananthapuram and will boycott OP clinics from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Monday. Faculty, who have the additional duty as COVID Nodal Officers at all MCHs, will also relinquish this charge as a mark of protest against the government action. Doctors and nurses in Thiruvananthapuram MCH have been on the path of agitation since Friday after the government issued orders suspending the COVID Nodal Officer and two head nurses for the alleged negligence in the care of an elderly patient. Medical fraternity had pointed out that the unfortunate incident had occurred because of the acute shortage of support staff in the hospital, about which the government had been informed time and again. Indefinite boycott The joint action council led by Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) and other professional organisations have decided to indefinitely boycott OP duties from Tuesday and to stop all online classes if the government does not revoke the suspension order and take necessary steps to improve the acute shortage of support staff at the MCH. Health-care workers who have been relentlessly working on the front lines for COVID-19 management should not be made scapegoats to cover up the government’s failure to resolve systemic and administrative issues, KGMCTA leaders said here. The 48-hour relay hunger fast launched by KGMCTA at Thiruvananthapuram MCH to protest against the treatment meted out to their colleague will end on Monday morning.  Nurses too Meanwhile, nurses too have launched an indefinite relay hunger strike here demanding that the government revoke the suspension of their colleagues. The government, meanwhile, has drawn flak for demoralising health-care workers, who have been functioning under tremendous stress. S.S. Lal, a public health professional, pointed out that the MCH, with over 700 COVID-19 patients and over 850 non-COVID-19 patients, would need to invest heavily in human resources to care for all these patients as per the COVID protocol. Shashi Tharoor, MP, has also come out in support of doctors and said that “our brave medics needed our understanding, sympathy and support”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anger-boils-over-at-mchs-across-state/article32768987.ece
05 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Tackling children’s mental health during COVID||Children’s mental and physical health after being cooped up inside homes for months on end has parents increasingly worried. When it comes to differently abled children, these concerns are amplified, especially against the backdrop of rise in COVID-19 caseload in recent days. In a first, the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala’s Payyannur block resource centre is piloting an online programme in which an entire panel of doctors will address concerns related to the differently abled children and their parents every week. The programme ‘Doctor Live’ will see experts from various medical disciplines reply to doubts and queries live on a WhatsApp group at specific times in a week. Parents of differently abled children can text their problems or doubts to the group any time. Live questions too can be posed. Continuous attention T.V. Viswanathan, district programme officer, Kannur, says some differently abled children need continuous medical attention. However, in the wake of the pandemic, parents are unable to take them to hospitals or doctors fearing COVID-19 infection. Forced to manage various problems at home, they are under a lot of strain fearing the impact of the lack of medical attention on their children. The children too find themselves frustrated, unable to go to school, play or engage in various activities, and confined indoors for the most part. Therapies for children too have been affected in cases. Many issues Parents who are already stressed from trying to take care of their children at the best of times are also groaning under loss of income, financial difficulties, and heightened social isolation in the aftermath of COVID-19. Some problems also arise from families stuck together round the clock, day after day. S.Y. Shooja, State Programme Officer, Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, says differently abled children are finding themselves without their usual support structures such as resource teachers, therapists, doctors, and so on. Managing children with problems such as ADHD or intellectual challenges has parents completely overwhelmed in the current circumstances. The ‘Doctor Live’ initiative will help address such physical or mental health concerns virtually in the absence of face-to-face meetings. Mr. Viswanathan says the positive response to a motivation class for parents involving games and other stress-relief activities that was helmed by a State award-winning teacher led to the Doctor Live initiative. After the try-out in Payyannur BRC, the Samagra Shiksha is considering extending it across the State. “A programme such as Doctor Live is essential in these COVID times,” Mr. Viswanathan says.  Experts from various medical disciplines will reply to doubts and queries live on a WhatsApp group every week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tackling-childrens-mental-health-during-covid/article32769409.ece
05 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||MCH releases wrong body to family||A few days after a doctor and two head nurses were suspended for the alleged neglect of a patient, the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital courted yet another controversy when it released the wrong body to a family. The mistake came to light only after the body of the COVID-19-infected patient was cremated. The issue cropped up after the death of 57-year-old native of Venniyoor, near Vizhinjam, on October 1. He had succumbed to kidney ailments for which he was undergoing treatment. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 later. The next day, the authorities handed over the body of a COVID-19-infected unidentified person, who had been brought dead to the hospital, to the Venniyoor native’s family. His son, who had recently come from Abu Dhabi, wanted to see his father for the last time. When he raised doubts upon seeing the deceased person’s face, his relatives attributed the changed appearance to the treatment. The body was consigned to flames at Shanti Kavadom in Thycaud on Friday evening.  Body in mortuary However, the family’s suspicion came true after the hospital realised its folly on finding his body in the mortuary. Government Medical College Principal Sara Varghese tasked Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Mohan Roy with conducting an inquiry. The hospital claimed to have released the body after being informed by the Vizhinjam health inspector that his son had identified the deceased. The hospital handed over the Venniyoor native’s body to his family on Sunday following which it was cremated by 4.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mch-releases-wrong-body-to-family/article32768991.ece

The aim is to retain its edge in the post COVID-19 era for the official websitekeralatourism.orgthat has been ranked first in search results since 2004. Visitors to the website, which crossed one crore annually, are in the range of 2.5 to 3 lakh at present. The Rs. 6.70-crore campaign to reboot the tourism economy using the website comes at a time when other tourism brands within the country and abroad have started virtual marketing of the destination. In the six-month Virtual Tour Campaign 2021, estimated to cost Rs. 3.38 crore, selected tourist destinations across the State will be posted on the website every month and viewers will be asked to select their favourite destination. The destination that secures most votes in online voting will be featured on the website. High-definition videos and 360 panoramic videos will be used for destination promotion. Enhancing traffic The ‘click campaign’ is to be used to enhance traffic to the website from the country and abroad by 15 lakh and thereby increase footfall in 2021-2022. Kerala cuisine is also being exploited in the digital platform for the first time to overcome the impact of the pandemic. One hundred Kerala dishes will be featured on the website for viewers to see how the dishes are prepared. Non-Keralite viewers will have to prepare dishes of their choice at their home and post the videos. A committee will hand-pick 10 videos and winners and their families will be brought to the State on a fully paid trip for seven days. Their visit will be featured on the website. Tourism authorities hope to increase web traffic by 30 to 40 lakh by the Rs. 3.32-crore project aimed at foodies.

05 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Bottled water from KIIDC’s Aruvikkara plant to be delayed||The wait for bottled water from the Aruvikkara plant in the district is likely to take longer than expected with the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) scrambling to sort out technical issues at the facility. Established by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) at a cost of Rs. 16 crore, the bottled water plant is yet to obtain certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) which is a prerequisite for launching commercial operations. Water quality tests conducted after KIIDC took over the facility in June this year had failed BIS tests reportedly after fungi presence was detected in the water. Another inspection by BIS is expected to be held this month. Steps have been taken at the plant to strengthen the water purification process, a senior KIIDC official said. Commercial operations can be launched once the BIS certification is obtained and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issues its clearance. KIIDC, which markets the 'Hilly Aqua' bottled water brand, hopes to launch operations at Aruvikkara with 20-litre jars in collaboration with the Kudumbashree. KIIDC officials said they had encountered several technical glitches at the plant following the take-over. The findings have been presented to the State government in a report. The government decision to transfer the 7,200-litre-per-hour plant from KWA to KIIDC had kicked up a controversy with major KWA unions staunchly opposing the move. The KWA director board had cleared the proposal on September 5 last year. The Water Resources Department had issued orders transferring the plant on a seven-year lease on February 28 this year much to the dismay of the unions. The construction of the plant had been completed in February 2019. But it has since lain idle with the KWA failing to obtain BIS clearance. Subsequently, the government had cleared the transfer proposal reasoning that the KWA was already burdened with major water supply projects across the State. Moreover, commercial operations needed to be started at the earliest at the Aruvikkara facility since public money had already been spent on it, the government noted. Meanwhile, KIIDC officials pointed out that the KIIDC has spent several lakhs of rupees for correcting technical problems at the facility after the take-over. Demand The bottled-water plant at Aruvikkara should be returned to the KWA as the KIIDC has failed to launch commercial operations, the AITUC-backed All Kerala Water Authority Employees' Union has demanded. The union plans to observe a 'Rights day' on Monday raising the demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bottled-water-from-kiidcs-aruvikkara-plant-to-be-delayed/article32769474.ece

The CDS which has been adjudged one of the best Kudumbashree CDSs has succeeded in making one woman of each below-the-poverty line family in Kottukal panchayat a member of the Kudumbashree, says Kottukal CDS chairperson Prasanna Kumari S. When she took over as chairperson in January 2018, they had been bagging the award for best CDS in the district since 2010. With her two-decade-long experience in the Kudumbashree network, Ms. Prasanna Kumari kept up the good work. She was not disappointed, and says they will bag the award for the third time on the trot in 2021 too. With Kottukal largely an agricultural village, the CDS has formed the members into farming joint liability groups and made available to them bank loans, interest subsidy, seeds and so on, so as to retain at least 90% of farmer families in the agricultural sector. The coastal areas too have witnessed a change. From the days when the women had no idea of what how to start a venture or the technical knowledge required to launching microenterprises such as fish processing, dry fish, fish pickle, curry powder, and even beauty parlours, things have come a long way. The coastal wards alone have 127 neighbourhood groups. All of them have been provided a revolving fund of Rs. 15,000, she says. An amount of Rs. 5 lakh received as part of the ‘Ini Njangal Parayaam’ reality show in 2015 has been utilised for purchasing utensils and table chairs. Twenty-one of 36 Haritha Karma Sena members have been registered as a microenterprise unit to make paper bag and cloth bags for sale. They also provide food catering services in uniform. Besides 89 Balasabhas, the CDS has formed 42 elderly neighbourhood groups for the protection of senior citizens. Community kitchen during the early days of the pandemic, Janakeeya Hotel, awareness programmes, medicine delivery, food for those in home quarantine in containment zones were some of the COVID-19 related activities undertaken. Campaign launched On Sunday, the CDS launched Karuthal, a product-marketing campaign to support microentrepreneurs and farming groups who faced losses during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/success-story-at-kottukal-community-development-centre/article32769462.ece

He said that the public can depend on the Mayor's complaint redressal cell (whatsapp no-8590036770, e-mail -complaints. tmc@ gmail.com). As on Sunday, seven councillors of the Corporation, including the Deputy Mayor, have tested positive for the virus. In addition, 12 other employees have also tested positive. Mr.Sreekumar said that this is not an alarming situation, as this is just one percent of the Corporation's total employee strength. It showed the success of the plan with which the Corporation has gone about its COVID-19 prevention activities. The Corporation workers have been involved in disinfection activities, in the burial of bodies of those who died due to COVID-19, in running community kitchens and in ensuring strict quarantine, along with all its regular work. Still, only 53 of the employees and councillors, who were all involved in these activities, have tested positive, said the Mayor. As the last date for tax payment and for renewal of various licences was on September 30, the Corporation office had witnessed a major rush last week. Although more staff were deployed to reduce the rush at the counters, the large crowd that still gathered might have led to two of the employees of the Corporation's main office testing positive. All those who have come into contact with them have gone into quarantine. Alternative arrangements have been made to ensure the smooth running of all sections, said the Mayor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/avoid-corpn-office-mayor/article32769471.ece

Action sought BJP activists laid siege to Akademi chairperson KPAC Lalitha’s house on Sunday. Alleging that the Akademi denied opportunity to Mr. Ramakrishnan as he was a Dalit, BJP Thrissur district president K.K. Anish Kumar demanded action against Ms. Lalitha and secretary N.

Nagesh, who visited Ramakrishnan at the hospital, said it was an example of the ‘upper caste fascist stand’ of the CPI(M). “The intellectual and cultural leaders, who often cry foul against atrocities against Dalit in BJP-ruled States, are silent on this issue. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should express his stand on the issue,” he added.

Mr. Prakasa Rao noted that the government schools had opened for clarification of doubts and holding of online classes but no masks were supplied and sanitisation and cleanliness were not ensured, which pose a threat to the safety of children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/reconsider-decision-to-reopen-schools/article32769516.ece

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre allots Rs. 280 crore for police reforms in Hyderabad||Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said on Sunday that the Central government has earmarked funds for the ‘Safe City’ project in eight major cities across the country for surveillance, protection of women and rapid criminal investigation. As part of it, Rs. 280 crore has been allotted to Hyderabad, he said. Addressing a gathering after dedicating the Amberpet assembly constituency’s CCTV network to the DCP’s office at Amberpet, he said that the city is expanding daily, with a wide range of activities, as well as crimes. Hence, it was imperative to use the currently available technology and CCTVs for the protection of people. Mr. Kishan Reddy appreciated the police for bringing services closer to people using the latest technology and observed that the upcoming Raksha National University in Gujarat approved by Parliament would bring about key changes in the functioning of the country’s police system. “The National University of Forensic Sciences Bill, approved by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, would enable students enrich themselves in law, criminology and other related disciplines, as well as excel in forensic science research. Women will get 33% reservation in all police wings,” he said.

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS rebuts BJP criticism on the issue of river waters||Rebutting the criticism of BJP that the State government failed to resolve river water disputes with Andhra Pradesh, senior TRS leader and Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar asserted that the onus in this regard is squarely on the Central government. He told media persons here on Sunday that the issue was something that could not be settled between States because Section 3 of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act mandated the Centre to constitute a tribunal for the purpose. In the last six years, the State government had approached the Centre several times to set up the tribunal for a permanent solution to water disputes between the riparian States of Telangana, AP, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti and her successor Nitin Gadkari. Within six weeks of Telangana formation, Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao had also written a letter in this regard to Union Water Resources Minister. A notice to the Secretary of Ministry was also given by Principal Secretary of Irrigation S.K. Joshi the same day, he said. The TRS mounted pressure on Ms. Uma Bharti and Mr. Gadkari to resolve the water disputes in the last Parliament also. But, the MPs of Karnataka and Maharashtra set up obstacles in the House when Ms. Bharti made an effort to address the issue. The State government invoked a provision of Inter-State Water Disputes Act to move the Supreme Court if the Centre did not respond for one year. Yet, there was no response from Centre, he said. Mr. Vinod Kumar said it is unfortunate that Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar targeted the State government without knowledge about the efforts put in by the State government. Mr. Reddy made irresponsible remark that the Central government would mediate in talks between Telangana and AP Chief Ministers to find the solution. Mr. Sanjay Kumar towed Mr. Reddy's line without a clue about the whole episode. The latter's comment that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao woke up to the issue and wrote a letter to Union Water Resources Minister only now speaks about his ignorance. If Mr. Reddy, Mr. Sanjay Kumar and two other BJP MPs who targeted the State government should use their offices to ensure that the Centre hands over redistribution of Krishna water between Telangana and AP to the present Brijesh Kumar tribunal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-rebuts-bjp-criticism-on-the-issue-of-river-waters/article32769333.ece
05 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Tougher Prelims exam with focus on history, economy||With increased focus on history and economy, the Civil Services Preliminary test conducted on Sunday was designed for elimination process more than testing the knowledge of aspirants. While the test covered all areas mentioned in the syllabus, the questions had a specialist orientation rather than the expected generalist orientation, according to civil service exam trainers. Many candidates have expressed the view that they found no cause and effect relationship in their preparation and their performance at Paper-I. “It is evident that the paper was designed to reject and reduce the candidates to a manageable number rather than test any knowledge relevant for a prospective administrator,” said V. Gopalakrishhna, director of Brain Tree, while analysing the paper. General Studies Paper-I, which determines merit, was held in the morning and General Studies Paper-II, popularly known as CSAT, which is of a qualifying nature, was held in the afternoon. In a statement, Rambabu, a teacher at La Excellence, said there was less emphasis on current affairs this time and the focus shifted to traditional areas. He opined that Paper-II was very tricky and geography questions were “tremendously increased” compared to last time. Questions from history and environment were a bit difficult while those from polity and economy were relatively easier. As the question paper was tougher, the cut-off marks can be expected to be much lower this time, around 100. The results are likely to be released in November. Aspirants were of the opinion that the Union Public Service Commission, which conducts the test, should review the style of questions and the pattern as the present system was only useful as a gatekeeper. Many feel too much is left to chance and there is no direct cause and effect relationship. This year 52,934 aspirants had applied from two centres in Telangana — Hyderabad and Warangal. From the twin cities, there were 46,171 applicants who appeared for the test at 99 centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tougher-prelims-exam-with-focus-on-history-economy/article32769351.ece
05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘People of all ages susceptible to COVID’||It is a misnomer to think COVID-19 kills only the older populations as people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection like any other respiratory infections like influenza. As people age, their immune system response is lowered and they have more chances of conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiac disease, which increases risk of death, say public health experts as the pandemic rages on with no signs of let-up. “Some people age faster (biological age) compared to their actual chronological age due to frailty. Frail people or those with co-morbidities have higher risk of severe disease and death. Therefore, a significant proportion of COVID-19 deaths are in the elderly. Irrespective of age, the transmission of COVID-19, severity and risk of death depends upon how much of the virus the person is exposed to,” explains Public Health Foundation of India’s (PHFI) Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH)-Hyderabad Director G.V.R Murthy. The infectious dose required to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is low because people have never been exposed to it before. So, children and younger adults — more active and mobile compared to adults have a high chance of contacting adequate infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 either at play, school or work. Dr. Murthy says for most of the younger population the immune system responds rapidly to fight the virus invasion and successfully blocks more severe disease. However, underlying unknown or undetected health conditions may be present among the younger people, which increase the risk of death, he warns. Exposure to a high infectious dose can lead to a higher viral load which also increases severity. It only means all age groups are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, but most youths show milder infections so recover faster compared to the elderly where even with a lower infectious dose, a more severe infection is observed. More severe the infection and the lower the person’s immunity, greater is the risk of death. Behaviour a factor People’s attitudes and behaviour contribute significantly to the increased transmission and doubling rates of infected persons. Recent evidence which has looked at doubling times in nine countries including India shows that the doubling time is significantly affected by preventive measures taken and large gatherings also impacts the doubling time adversely. Since health, social and economic development go hand-in-hand and one affects the other, ‘empathetic development’ is the way forward. “We have seen opening the metro has not lead to a sudden spike in cases because steps have been taken to enforce people to behave properly. Study after study has reiterated face masks should be considered a useful low-cost device along with social distancing and hand hygiene,” says IIPH State chief, who had worked with World Health Organisation (WHO) and was UNAIDS Consultant with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Mask measure Masks should now become a ‘fashion statement’ since studies reveal early termination of social distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave. Yet, if greater than 70% of population uses ‘safe’ masks properly, it can lead to cessation of transmission, he insists. This data should be effectively used to educate people and change their behaviour and for governments to mandate safe measures and strictly enforce them. ‘Safe’ mask is one that’s worn properly, cleaned (if reusable) and used as long as people are outside their homes or in offices and disposed off in a closed bin/ bag. Lockdowns reducing physical contact between individuals outside the house have a limited role as most transmission is within the confines of a house, adds Dr. Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/people-of-all-ages-susceptible-to-covid/article32769305.ece

05 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Fed up with regular fights, woman murders husband||Fed up with her husband’s regular drinking and frequent fights, a 35-year-old woman killed him using a knife in the wee hours of Sunday at Thimmaipally in Jagtial district. The woman later walked into the police station and confessed to the crime, police said. The accused, Alakunta Laxmi, along with her husband Alakunta Laxman (40), a daily-wage earner, and their two daughters were living with her parents at Thimmaipally for the past four years. According to police, Laxman used to come home drunk and pick up altercations with the woman and her parents frequently. The couple got married 17 years ago and had two daughters aged eight and 14 years, police said. For the past five years, she was living with her parents, as she was unable to bear the domestic violence by Laxman and his parents. On Friday evening, he hit his mother-in-law, who suffered a severe head injury and was hospitalised. The next day, villagers tied and confined him in the Gram Panchayat office. “Somehow he managed to escape on Saturday night and tried to kill Laxmi, who took him back to the GP office and stabbed him. Later, she slit his throat,” Korutla Circle Inspector K. Rajashekar Raju said, quoting Laxmi’s statement. After killing her husband, Laxmi went to the Korutla police station around 8 a.m. and surrendered, and narrated the incident. “She also accused Laxman of molesting their elder daughter, who is now living with her aunt in Fakir Kondapur in Ibrahimpatnam mandal,” Mr. Raju said, adding that the allegations are yet to be verified. A case was registered by the police and an investigation is on.

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BC leaders urge Kishan for caste-wise enumeration||Leaders of several Backward Classes associations led by R. Krishnaiah, president of the National BC Welfare Association, on Saturday requested Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy to take up enumeration of BC communities as part of the forthcoming Census exercise. The delegation called on the Union Minister here and explained him about the necessity of community-wise enumeration of BCs as part of the Census. Mr. Krishnaiah reminded that it was due to BJP’s pressure the Congress-led government at the Centre had agreed to enumerate BC communities in 2010. In 2018, a meeting on Census chaired by the then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh too had decided to take up enumeration of BC communities as part of the Census. Mr. Krishnaiah sought to know why there was the change in the Centre’s decision on community-wise enumeration of BCs after the BJP returned to power in 2019. He also brought to Mr. Kishan Reddy’s notice the Supreme Court judgment wherein it was directed to take up enumeration of BCs community-wise. Later too, both the Supreme Court and several High Courts had reiterated the view for taking up community-wise enumeration of BCs. The BC bodies leaders later stated that Mr. Kishan Reddy had assured them that the BJP government at the Centre is ready for community-wise enumeration of BCs as part of the Census and a decision would be taken after discussing the matter with the ministry concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bc-leaders-urge-kishan-for-caste-wise-enumeration/article32769353.ece

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Twist to woman’s allegations on BJP leaders||The controversy surrounding Telangana BJP leaders following allegations of a woman, who claimed herself as BJP worker, took a twist with pictures of her association with ruling TRS leaders surfacing on Sunday. It all started when a video clip showing a man in semi-nude condition with a woman Bhavitha (name changed) in Karimnagar leaked and went viral. Along with the video clip, an audio of the conversation between the two in the video clip (said to be a top Karimnagar district BJP leader) and Bhavitha too emerged. The video clip and audio conversation were aired by a local TV channel in Karimnagar, kicking off speculation over the identity of the BJP leader in the video clip. Meanwhile, the BJP State party office suddenly sacked Karimnagar BJP district president Basa Satyanarayana. He was replaced by Krishna Reddy of Huzurabad. Though no reasons were explained by BJP for sacking Basa Satyanarayana, it strengthened the suspicions that the man in video clip was possibly him. Even as this became an embarrassment to BJP leaders, Bhavitha made even more startling allegations on Saturday. She claimed that she had been in live-in relationship with Basa Satyanarayana for over a year. She charged that she complained to BJP state president Bandi Sanjay about Satyanarayana. Bhavitha also alleged that Mr. Sanjay’s close associate K. Murali used to come to her house in Karimnagar with a woman BJP worker and indulge in immoral activities. Mr. Sanjay, who is also Karimnagar Member of Parliament and presently in Delhi, told The Hindu over phone that he would not spare any party worker indulging in illegal activities. He cautioned party workers and leaders to ensure party’s image is not damaged by their personal actions. Interestingly, by Sunday evening, pictures of Bhavitha with ruling TRS party began getting circulated in social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/twist-to-womans-allegations-on-bjp-leaders/article32769341.ece
05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR shedding ‘crocodile tears’ over Pothireddypadu||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of “shedding crocodile tears” on the Andhra Pradesh government trying to take the lion's share in Krishna waters through the Pothireddypadu lift irrigation scheme and questioned why he did not send a single communication to the Centre on the contentious project till date. Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar in an ‘open letter’ to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media on Sunday, charged Mr. Rao of trying to shift the entire blame on the Centre on the sharing of Krishna river waters whereas he had actually “forged a secret understanding with AP Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy” on the issue. Objecting to the contents of the letter written by Mr. Rao to Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Shekawat, Mr. Sanjay Kumar questioned the timing of the communication when the Apex Council meeting has been scheduled to be held in the next few days. “The letter is full of lies and falsehoods. It is only meant to divert people's attention to cover up for the TRS government’s failure to safeguard the legitimate water rights of Telangana,” he charged. The BJP leader, also Karimnagar MP, charged that despite being warned, Mr. Rao did not react when the AP government had called for tenders for raising the capacity of the Pothireddypadu irrigation scheme as had a "tacit pact" with AP CM due to their common objective of calling for big project tenders only to “benefit the contractors”. In fact, it was his letter to the Centre objecting to the new proposal to increase the capacity of the lift irrigation scheme that the Apex Council meeting has been called for and this too Mr. Rao ensured was postponed, allowing the tenders to be finalised in the meantime, claimed Mr. Sanjay Kumar. He demanded Mr. Rao to “confess” about the pact with AP CM on accepting 299 TMC for TS and 512 TMC for AP when it was actually entitled to 555 TMC of Krishna water. The Centre is anyway duty bound to implement the verdict of the tribunal and the Supreme Court orders on this issue, hence both CMs should desist from their respective “duplicitous stances,” said the party president.  KCR forged a secret understanding with Jaganmohan Reddy.

05 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Governor should stop step-motherly treatment’||All India Congress Committee spokesperson Dasoju Shravan found fault with the Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan for her reported comments on Congress party's that it is indulging in politics over farmers issues and said the Governor’s office is not expected to make such statements. Addressing a press conference here along with Mahesh Goud and Indira Shobhan, he said it was not the Congress party but the Governor who is indulging in politics at Raj Bavan. “When Congress requested an appointment with Governor to give a memorandum on farmers agitation against newly brought in farm bills, she refused citing COVID-19. But at the same time she had no problem with Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao visiting her husband to felicitate him despite prevalence of COVID-19,” he said. He said the Congress clearly mentioned that the delegation would consist just two or three Congress persons and if Governor is not ready to receive memorandum, it will be presented to her liaison officer. She even refused that and Congress leaders did not say a word, he said. “It is condemnable that the Governor has termed our agitation and struggle for saving Indian farmers as a political drama," he said. Mr. Shravan claimed that such accommodating endeavour from the Governor to the CM only exposes the nexus between the BJP and the TRS. “ We respect Tamilisai as a woman leader and doctor and welcome several of her initiatives. She should also reciprocate the goodwill and stop step-motherly treatment of Congress,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-should-stop-step-motherly-treatment/article32769334.ece

05 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CPI demands judicial probe into Nayeem’s case||The Communist Party of India State Committee has demanded that the government order a judicial inquiry into the killing of gangster Nayeem to bring out the facts relating to the case. CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said the clean shit given by the Special Investigation Team to 25 police officials named in the case is tantamount to diluting the entire episode. He wondered why the government is reluctant in making public the contents of the gangster’s diary. Hundreds of people suffered at his hands and Nayeem was involved in forcible acquisition of lands, besides in rape cases, he said. The government had constituted a special investigation team to inquire into the incident. But four years after the constitution of the SIT, there is no progress in the case. The government should therefore order a judicial inquiry into the case for bringing out the facts pertaining to the case. This would also help in instilling confidence among the victims who suffered at the hands of Nayeem, he said. In a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Venkat Reddy expressed concern over the rampant encroachment of government, Inam and endowments lands in Jogulamba-Gadwal district by vested interests. People who lost their lands because of the encroachments are looking at the government for restoration of their rights. Similar complaints were also being registered from different parts of the State and the government should take care to ensure that the encroached lands are protected and the rights of genuine owners restored, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpi-demands-judicial-probe-into-nayeems-case/article32769349.ece

It is for this reason that government is focusing on raising awareness, early screening and diagnosis among women,” she said, adding that India needs to step up the number of oncologists from the current 1,250, radiographers, and other allied specialities, and upskill physicians, and nurses working in district hospitals and primary health care centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gift-mammo-screening-to-women-rather-than-sarees/article32769302.ece

AvadhaniTEKUR (SANGAREDDY DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Farming with faith in the rain god||Byagari Ratnamma, a farmer in 40s, cultivates about four acres of land on the outskirts of Tekur village. She has planted about 25 varieties of millet crops including bobbarlu, togarlu, anumulu, korralu, taidalu, ulavalu, gongura, nuvvulu, gaddi nuvvunlu, pesarlu and minumulu. During the months of April and May every year Ratnamma and her husband Tuljaram till their land with tractor as it would be very difficult to for bullocks to till the land spread with rocks, literally. They remove the rocks, weed, and start cultivation. They have been doing it for the past two-and-half decades or so. A major portion of the farm land in and around the village is full of rocks and it is a routine for them every year. Surprisingly, there is no irrigation for them to cultivate all these crops and they are completely dependent on rains. Then how do they cultivate so many crops? Leaving their fate completely to nature and rain, they continue their job. Rain god has never ditched them. Always they happily take some crops home and the yield is more than sufficient for them to sell after keeping a portion for their consumption. When there is no irrigation why do they cultivate so many crops? They have a right answer with them. “We trust mother earth and rain god. Both of them are always with us and have blessed us. Out of the 25 crops we cultivate, at lest 15 crops give sufficient yield and thereby we will be on the safe side. Not only that, we sell the surplus yield and meet our expenditure,” Ms Ratnamma told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farming-with-faith-in-the-rain-god/article32769461.ece

Describing the three new farm laws as ‘anti-farmer’, Narayana Swamy said the contract farming system would deprive the marginal farmers of competitive prices for their produce. “With corporate firms having a final say in the procurement of produce, the farmers will be reduced to farm labourers.

05 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,TELANGANA||Delay in resumption of RTC services to TS||The inordinate delay in resumption of the inter-State RTC bus services between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana after the lockdown, primarily due to differences over key issues such as parity in operations, is as worrying for the people as it is for the management of the public sector giant. The deadlock continues even after three rounds of talks between the two sides. Officials of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) had met their Telangana counterparts to discuss key issues and resume operations but, the talks hit a roadblock each time. Admitting that the delay does not augur well for the APSRTC, which is reeling under serious financial crisis due to accumulated revenue loss over the years, the officials are eager to break the ice. “We are trying our best to find a way forward, and we expect to get some clarity on the issue by Wednesday (October 7),” said the corporation’s Executive Director (Operations) K.S. Brahmananda Reddy. The APSRTC, which operates more number of buses to Telangana and covers a greater distance in terms of kilometres in the neighbouring State, had to make a difficult decision on reducing its operations to arrive at a parity in kilometres. “Telangana now is insisting on parity in routes, which does not exist in any State agreements. We will have to look into it and discuss the issue threadbare before arriving at a decision,” Principal Secretary (Transport) and APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director M.T. Krishna Babu, had said, emerging from the talks. Expressing concern over the fact that the RTC of both States are incurring a daily loss of around Rs. 5 crore due to the stalemate, Union leaders urged the government to thrash out an early solution to the problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/delay-in-resumption-of-rtc-services-to-ts/article32769348.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||It’s all about voter enrolment now||With elections to two seats of graduates constituency in the Legislative Council in the offing, enrolment of eligible graduate voters has become a buzz word in the political circles. The BJP and the Congress have intensified efforts to retain their traditional votes for giving a tough fight to the ruling party. The TRS on its part has taken the poll as prestigious issue given the reverses it suffered in the past. The party could not win Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency despite being in power while it lost Karimnagar-Medak-Adilabad-Nizamabad constituency after registering thumping victory in the previous Assembly elections. Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao is particular on enrolment of all eligible voters as it will pave the way for easy victory. This said, solutions to the problems of graduates - be it job opportunities related or inordinate delay in announcement of unemployment dole - continue to persist. How far the contesting candidates will take the issues faced by graduates is only to be waited and seen.     The political landscape in Telangana is heating up with elections to a few MLC seats, Dubbak Assembly constituency, and to few civic bodies including the GHMC due over the next few months. The appointment of new in-charge to oversee the party affairs of Congress in the State by AICC has also added some energy not only to the political activity but also to the trading of charges by Congress, TRS and BJP. The exchange of political barbs is more intense in the State Capital with GHMC elections due soon as the stakes are high not only to the ruling TRS and its ally MIM but also to the Opposition Congress and BJP as the civic body houses nearly one-third of the State’s population. Amid such a political scenario, a BJP leader Velaga Srinivas is storming the social media throwing repeated challenge at Minister for Urban Development and IT K.T. Rama Rao on the condition of roads in GHMC. Through text and video messages on social media he seeks Rs. 100 crore funds and 6 months time to make the City roads water-logging free even in case of deluge!      With the GHMC elections round the corner, the sitting TRS corporators are spending sleepless nights over their renomination. A survey by the ruling party apparently revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to increase its strength to over 30 in the 150-member Council and the TRS is looking at fresh faces to build up the KTR team as well, many sitting ones are worried. Some of them expressed their feelings to the MLAs hoping that they will have some say in the party nomination. TRS, a senior leader felt, was also worried on a section of the YSRCP supporters in the city voting to the BJP this time. In the last GHMC elections, the YSRCP supporters overwhelmingly supported the TRS candidates to settle scores with the TDP, but the changed political equations in Andhra Pradesh, where Chief Minister Jagan’s team has close working relations with the national BJP leaders, may reflect here as well.      Bars have reopened but the managements dread the thought of paying annual licence fee which was due last month. After six months of closure of bars on account of COVID, the bars resumed business last week with government permission. However, the government has not spelt out whether the licence fee already paid for the six month period will be adjusted in the next year. The excise officials maintained that there was no such provision of carry forward of fee but some concession in further payments could be given. For instance, the managements may be given the option of paying fee in four instalments against three at present. (M. Rajeev, B. Chandrashekhar, R. Ravikanth Reddy & N.

05 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Woman gang-raped, beaten up in Gurugram; four held||In two separate incidents, a 25-year-old woman was allegedly gangraped and beaten up by four men in upscale DLF Phase-II and a minor was raped in the Millennium City on Sunday. The woman sustained head injuries during the assault. While the four men, including three delivery boys, have been arrested in connection with the gang-rape, the accused in the rape case of the minor is on the run. According to the police, one of the four accused, Ranjan, met the woman near Sikanderpur metro station late on Saturday night and took her along to his employer’s office in the basement of a building on Bougainvilla Marg. “When the woman reached the house, she found three men were present inside. The four allegedly took turns to rape her. When she resisted, they beat her up and smashed her head against the wall causing injuries,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police( DLF) Karan Goyal. Fled away The four fled the spot leaving the woman behind on the road outside. The security guards in the area alerted a police patrolling team on hearing her cries for help. A team from the local police station also reached and took her to a hospital. Ranjan was arrested in the morning when he returned to office. “The security guards informed the police when Ranjan returned around 6 a.m. He locked himself inside, but the police smashed the glass door to enter the office,” said a resident of DLF Phase-II. Rajan works at the office of a realtor and had the keys to it. The other three have been identified as Pawan, Pankaj and Gobind. All four are aged between 20-25 years. In another case, the accused, Bablu Sheikh, a chauffeur, allegedly dragged a 15-year-old girl inside his room when she went to a washroom near her jhuggi in Sector 45 in the early hours of Sunday. The accused allegedly raped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident. A case has been registered at Sector 40 police station. Claims over complaint Haryana Shiv Sena spokesperson Ritu Raj said, “The family called the police control room in the morning, but the police ‘persuaded’ not to pursue the matter legally citing social ignominy. The case was registered after I took up the matter with the Police Commissioner,” claimed Mr. Raj. Station House Officer, Sector 40, Sunil Beniwal denied the allegations and said that the case was registered soon after the family gave a complaint in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/woman-gang-raped-beaten-up-in-gurugram-four-held/article32769028.ece
05 October 2020||GURUGRAM/NEW DELHI,||A shock awaits many||Vijay Mishra, a chhole-poori vendor on Jharsa Road in Gurugram, is the odd man out among a row of fruit sellers. The 38-year-old makes Rs. 200-Rs. 300 daily, not even half of what he used to earn at his job in Maruti Suzuki India Limited before the lockdown. Like thousands of workers and labourers in the Millennium City, Mr. Mishra left for his home town in Bihar along with his wife and two kids, aged five and seven, after the lockdown was imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Being the breadwinner, I did not have enough savings to stay in the city without work. Besides, there was no certainty over the resumption of production at the company,” he said. Little support “I had left with a promise to myself to not return. I have no landholdings back in my village but was confident of finding some work to make ends meet. I also expected the government to help the migrants returning to Bihar to find jobs. But we got little support from the government except the sanctioned ration against ration cards,” laments Mr. Mishra, while frying pooris for his customers. Seeing hordes of workers returning to cities in search of jobs, Mr. Mishra too decided to come back to Gurugram in July in the hope that he could get back his factory job. But he was in for a rude shock. “On reaching Gurugram, I found that the company had fixed a deadline for workers to join work. Those who could not make it, lost their jobs,” said Mr. Mishra, who had been a contract worker with the company for eight years. With no other option left, he decided to become a roadside vendor. Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union general secretary Kuldeep Janghu said most of the automotive companies were granted permission to resume operations in May. The three original equipment manufacturers in the region – Maruti Suzuki, Honda Motorcycles and Hero Motorcorp — and other automotive companies had asked their employees, both regular and contractual, to return to work by the first week of June. “Maruti Suzuki extended the deadline till June 23 following a request from the workers’ union. The other companies too extended their deadlines by a few days or weeks. But many workers, mostly those on contract and hailing from far-off places like Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, could not make it in time and were not taken,” said Mr. Janghu. He claimed that hundreds of workers who returned to the city in July and August called him up seeking help in getting their jobs back, but he could do little to assist them. “The company had hired workers in their place before they returned,” Mr. Janghu said, adding that the company’s production is on a par with the corresponding period last year. Babul Haq, an operator at Richa & Co., a garments unit based in Udyog Vihar Phase-III in Gurugram, had a rather pleasant experience. He returned to his home town in May after his mother died, but got a call from the company in August to join work. “The company had hired many new workers during the lockdown, but they are now being replaced by the old workers returning to their jobs. We have also got a raise of Rs. 500 per month,” said Mr. Haq. Munender Gautam, a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, went back to his village in June. Though not keen to return, he came back after a call from his supervisor. “I did not have any work, so I decided to come back. The company called its old employees and also gave a raise of Rs. 1,000 per month,” said Mr. Gautam, who works at a textile unit in Panipat. He added that most of the old employees had returned to work. Biju Rai from Raghopur in Bihar returned to Delhi a fortnight ago but has been unable to find a job or earn two square meals a day. “Work is scarce but I hope things improve,” he said, adding that he had gone back to his village in June when some restrictions were eased. The journey was an ordeal as Mr. Rai was unable to get a train ticket and had to take several buses as well as walk long distances intermittently to reach his home town. Tough phase Another migrant worker, Asaram, said he returned to Delhi only some days back. He had left for his home town in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, during the lockdown. Like most migrant workers returning to the city for work, the 24-year-old left his wife and two kids at home. “I share a room with others near Ambedkar College and cook my own food to save money,” he said. The nature of his job has, however, changed. “I am a construction worker but currently doing road maintenance work,” he said. Brijesh, working with BLU Smart Mobility,  an app-based cab company, said he got his job back after the lockdown but suffered a salary cut. A resident of Agra, Brijesh said that salary had been cut substantially but the expenditures remained intact. “Though it is difficult to survive on the paltry income, I feel lucky to have a job at least. Job loss, salary cuts and dwindling incomes — this is the story all around,” summed up Brijesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-shock-awaits-many/article32769033.ece
05 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Take action against officers for neglecting woman’s complaint’||The Delhi High Court has ordered the Commissioner of Police here to take “serious and effective” action against its officers — who neglected the complaint of a woman to trace her missing daughter as she was “poor”. “We are not only anguished but also disgusted at the manner in which the police carry out the investigation in such cases, particularly when it involves the poor,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar remarked. “The petitioner [mother] works as a maid and her complaint/FIR was, therefore, neglected and not acted upon with the urgency that it deserves,” the Bench said. “The action taken against those found guilty of negligence and dereliction of duty should be such that it sends message to the entire police force,” the court demanded. The court’s direction came while hearing a habeas corpus plea of the woman to produce her minor daughter, who went missing on May 27 this year. She complained that despite her registering the complaint with the police in Trilokpuri here, the officials took no action. Verification of age When the case was first heard by the Bench on September 23, Standing Counsel Delhi Police Rahul Mehra said the date of birth of the girl was verified from the school record, which shows that she is 16-years-old. Mr. Mehra said she got married to one Sandeep on the basis of the date of birth in her Aadhaar Card, which was incorrect. The court had then opined that it was inclined to transfer the case to transfer the investigation to the Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU), Crime Branch, as she is a minor and, has been missing for nearly four months. Girl found in Hathras On September 29, when the court took the case again, the Delhi Police filed a status report stating that she has been recovered from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. The girl was produced in court, where it was also revealed that she was three months pregnant. The police said Sandeep is in judicial custody. Her mother said she wishes to take the minor home but the latter refused. Considering the fact that the girl is a minor, the Bench said, “We cannot let her go anywhere according to her wish.” It directed that she should continue to be housed at Nari Niketan where she should also be provided counselling so that she is able to take responsible decision with regard to the continuation or discontinuation of her pregnancy. The court then noted that despite Sandeep being named in the FIR, no serious effort was made to locate her. It was only when the petition was filed and the court called for transfer of the investigation to AHTU (Crime) that the girl was recovered. “This delay on the part of the police in carrying out effective investigation has ruined not only the life of the girl but also the accused and put in dark the future of the unborn child,” the Bench said.

05 October 2020||New Delhi,||Section 29 of POCSO Act applicable only after trial begins: HC||The Delhi High Court has ruled that the presumption of guilt engrafted in Section 29 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act gets triggered and applies only once trial begins, that is after charges are framed against the accused. Section 29 of the POCSO Act says that when a person is prosecuted for committing an offence of sexual assault against a minor, the special court trying the case “shall presume” the accused to be guilty. Proving innocence This reverse burden on the accused to prove his innocence was incorporated in the POCSO Act keeping in view the low conviction rate of sexual offences against children. The question of whether the presumption of guilt applies only at the stage of trial or does it also apply when a bail plea is being considered cropped up while hearing the bail plea of a 24-year-old man arrested for alleged sexual assault of a minor. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani clarified that if a bail plea is being considered before charges have been framed, Section 29 has no application. ‘Trial’ commences when charges are framed against an accused and not before that, Justice Bhambhani said. Only at the stage when charges are framed does the court apply its judicial mind to whether there is enough evidence on record to frame a precise allegation, which the accused must answer, Justice Bhambhani said. Disclosing one’s defence “Therefore, it is only once charges are framed that the accused knows exactly what he is alleged to be guilty of; and therefore, what guilt he is required to rebut,” he said, adding an accused cannot be asked to disprove his guilt even before the foundational allegations with supporting evidence that suggest guilt are placed by the prosecution before the court. “It would be anathema to fundamental criminal jurisprudence to ask the accused to disclose his defence; or, worse still, to adduce evidence in his defence even before the prosecution has marshalled its evidence,” the High Court said. Justice Bhambhani also set out fresh norms while deciding a bail plea at the post-charge stage. “In addition to the nature and quality of the evidence before it, the court would also factor in certain real-life considerations,” Justice Bhambhani said. This include whether the offence alleged involved threat, intimidation, violence or brutality. Also the court, hearing the bail would consider, whether the offence was repeated against the victim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/section-29-of-pocso-act-applicable-only-after-trial-begins-hc/article32769025.ece
05 October 2020||New Delhi,||Four arrested for extortion, posing as BSES employees||Four men have been arrested for allegedly posing as employees of a power distribution company to extort money from a man by telling him that there was a complaint against him for tampering with an electricity meter installed at his house in Uttam Nagar, the police said on Sunday. The accused — Rohit (34), Lalit (30), Vinay Kumar (30) and Rahul Attri (27) — told the police that they used to work in BSES. After losing their jobs during the lockdown, they hatched a plan to extort money from people through fraudulent ways. Gold recovered The police have recovered Rs. 3,000 and gold earrings, belonging to the victim's mother, from the accused. The incident happened on September 22 at 12.30 p.m. when the accused came to Sonu’s house and introduced themselves as employees of the power distribution company. Two of the accused started checking the electric meter and told Sonu about a 'tampering in the electricity meter'. They threatened him by saying that he will be punished if a police complaint is filed. Meanwhile, another accused told Sonu to pay Rs. 7 lakh to avoid consequences, said an officer. When Sonu expressed his inability to pay the amount, they reduced the amount to Rs. 3 lakh. Sonu told them that was jobless and will not be able to pay more than Rs. 30,000-Rs. 40,000, the officer said. One of the accused then demanded ornaments from Sonu's mother. When she denied, they took away her two gold earrings. The accused then took Sonu in their car and drove him to a nearby ATM from where they forced him to withdraw Rs. 25,000. They also took Rs. 6,000 cash from his pocket. He was also forced to transfer Rs. 8,000 via Paytm into the account of one of the accused, the officer added. An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Uttam Nagar police station. During the investigation, the driver of the alleged vehicle was traced and he revealed details of one of Vinay, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena. Vinay was apprehended and subsequently, all the remaining three accomplices were also arrested, he said. The police have seized the vehicle involved in the crime along with two BSES ID cards. Efforts are being made to ascertain their involvement in other criminal cases if any, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/four-arrested-for-extortion-posing-as-bses-employees/article32769035.ece

05 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Silent protest march for man killed in road accident||Nearly hundred people took out a silent protest march in Nirvana Country, a township in Sector 50 here, seeking justice for Alok Gupta, a 49-year-old senior executive with a multinational company killed in a road accident near DLF Phase-II Rapid Metro station over a month ago. They marched till The Close, South, where the juvenile driver resides, said a press statement issued by the family. Demand parents’ arrest “It is shocking how the family of the culprit continues to remain untouched while the family of Gupta has been shattered. The march was to foreground the police’s disregard against the parents of the juvenile and to demand their arrest,” said the press statement. Gupta was on his way to Noida riding his bike around 6 a.m., when a car coming from the direction of Shankar Chowk hit the central verge to jump on to the opposite carriageway and rammed the motorcycle after hitting the metro pillar. Gupta’s friend Rahul Malik, a developer, riding another motorcycle behind him, took him and the two others in the car to Naraina Hospital in DLF Phase-III in an ambulance with the help of security guards. Alok died during treatment. He was a resident of Sector 57 and was the chief financial officer of an MNC.

05 October 2020||Mumbai,||MVA allies target BJP over Sushant, Hathras cases||The tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance has trained its guns at the Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a day after the medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The three parties in the alliance demanded the BJP to tender an apology to the Mumbai Police for casting aspersions on its investigation into the actor’s death case. Leading the attack, State Ministers from the Nationalist Congress Party ran the hashtag #MahaPoliceMyPride on Twitter on Sunday, highlighting that the AIIMS board had submitted its conclusive report to the CBI that there are no injuries on the actor’s body indicating a struggle or scuffle. The NCP ministers asked the BJP to apologise to the Mumbai Police for raising suspicions over its capability to find the truth in the case and accusing it of having ulterior motives. “There were unsuccessful efforts to malign the image of Maharashtra police by vested political interests. I’m confident that neither the wise people of Maharashtra will let them succeed in their intentions nor forgive them for their deeds,” tweeted NCP MLA Rohit Pawar. The Congress criticised the BJP over its MLA Ram Kadam’s letter alleging that the Mumbai Police had concealed the drug angle in the probe. “This letter is BJP’s attempt to save its face. The drug investigation has nothing to do with Rajput’s death. On the contrary, there are connections with the BJP which have emerged in the drug case and those need to be probed,” said State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. The party has already demanded a Special Investigation Team to probe the alleged plan to defame the Mumbai Police using the actor’s death case. The MVA allies also targeted the BJP over the Hathras gang rape case. State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said the party will hold a State-wide satyagraha on Monday to demand justice from the ‘egoistic and insensitive BJP government in Uttar Pradesh’. He said, “The arrogant and dictatorial Yogi Adityanath has dismantled democracy in U.P. He has no moral right to continue as CM.” Meanwhile, Dr. Neelam Gorhe, Shiv Sena leader and Deputy Speaker of the Council, has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, questioning the absence of women police personnel during Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi’s visit to Hathras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-allies-target-bjp-over-sushant-hathras-cases/article32768957.ece
05 October 2020||Mumbai,||No HC relief for aspirants who missed job deadline||The Bombay High Court on Sunday declined relief to 10 persons employed with an ammunition factory in Maharashtra who missed the application deadline to appear in a recruitment exam scheduled on October 5. A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni conducted a rare Sunday morning hearing since the petitioners expressed an urgency. The Bench, however, noted that since the petitioners did not meet the eligibility criteria, it could not help them. The petitioners, Mahesh Balke and nine others, had applied for the post of chargeman (technical) issued by the Ordnance Factory Board in May. As per the recruitment notice, the last date for submitting applications was June 15. Applicants should have completed their diplomas in mechanical and civil engineering by the last date of applying. The petitioners said they were all students of such diploma courses. Their final exams were to be held in April-May and their pass certificates issued by June. However, due to the pandemic, the final exams were deferred and are yet to be held. They approached the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking permission to take the exams for recruitment as chargemen, pending their diploma course final exams. The, tribunal, however, refused any relief last month. They approached the HC, seeking that they be permitted to write the exams,since their diploma course exams had been deferred for no fault of theirs. The Bench, however, noted that the petitioners should have challenged the recruitment notification and its eligibility criteria. “Had they challenged the fact that final year students were not permitted to apply pending their pass certificates, the HC could have looked into the issue,” the court said. However, a Supreme Court judgment said if a candidate did not meet the eligibility criteria on the last date of application, a prospective employer was not obliged to entertain the applicant, the Bench said. “We are fully sympathetic to your case as you have said in your petition that this job opportunity comes only once in four years. But a judgment of the Supreme Court stares us in our face,” Chief Justice Datta said In conducting the hearing on Sunday, Chief Justice Datta said doors of the court were open 24 hours a day if an urgency arose. Justice Kulkarni added that the last time the court conducted a hearing on a Sunday was in 2013. A Bench of Justices S.J. Vazifdar and K.R. Sriram conducted a day-long hearing in an examination-related matter at that time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-hc-relief-for-aspirants-who-missed-job-deadline/article32768965.ece

05 October 2020||New Delhi,||CM will launch mega anti-pollution campaign today||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign here on Monday. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the campaign would be launched following a meeting chaired by the Chief Minister with the departments concerned, at 11 a.m. “Chief Minister will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign after a meeting with officials from departments of environment, transport, development, PWD, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Jal Board, traffic police and municipal corporations,” Mr. Rai tweeted. At a meeting of NCR States with Union Environment Prakash Javadekar last week, Mr. Rai had asked the Centre to take time-bound action to ensure that 11 thermal power plants and more than 1,900 brick kilns using outdated technology in the NCR controlled their emissions. There are 11 plants located in three States around the Capital — Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab — which were to retrofit their units with technology called flue-gas desulphurisation to reduce emissions by December 2019. According to Mr. Rai, there are more than 1,640 such brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, 161 in Haryana and 164 in Rajasthan which contribute significantly to Delhi’s air pollution. Mr. Rai also said that the Delhi government had presented its plan to tackle stubble burning in the city during the meeting with Mr. Javadekar.  Centre in Najafgarh He said a centre is being set up in Kharkhari village in Najafgarh where “bio-decomposer” solution will be prepared in around 400 containers, starting Tuesday, as announced by Chief Minister on Wednesday. The new technology involves a liquid formulation prepared using bio-decomposer capsules, fermenting it over 8-10 days and then spraying the mixture on crop residue to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of the stubble.

Mr. Kejriwal said all arrangements for spraying the solution on farm fields will be made by the Delhi government and will be provided free of cost to farmers. The process will be executed under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute and the cost of the implementation of the entire project is less than Rs. 20 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-will-launch-mega-anti-pollution-campaign-today/article32768943.ece
05 October 2020||New Delhi,||CM to address global forum on climate change||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be among the five urban leaders from around the world to speak at the prestigious ‘Daring Cities 2020’ conference on October 7, the Delhi government said here on Sunday. The conference is being hosted by the ICLEI and the City of Bonn, Germany, with the support of the German government. ‘Daring Cities’ is a global forum on climate change for urban leaders tackling climate emergency, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement said. The plenary session, to be held at 7.30 p.m. through a virtual forum on Wednesday, will also include keynote addresses by Mr António Guterres, UN Secretary General, and H.E. Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), Germany. Multilevel action “CM Kejriwal has been invited alongside urban leaders and decision-makers from Bogota [Colombia], Sao Paolo [Brazil], Los Angles [USA] and Entebbe [Uganda] to discuss multilevel action to tackle the climate emergency and environmental sustainability. The event recognises these five as daring urban leaders who are going beyond the limits imposed by their respective local contexts to take bold climate action,” the government said. Mr. Kejriwal will speak on how Delhi has responded to the existing climate emergency, air pollution crisis, including recent innovative solutions such as the Pusa decomposer and the first-of-its-kind EV policy in India to tackle air pollution in the Capital. “The distinguished urban and sub-national leaders will also present their thoughts on the most essential changes that should be achieved in their respective city/region in the next five years,” the government also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-to-address-global-forum-on-climate-change/article32768945.ece
05 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi schools to stay shut till October 31: Sisodia||Refuting reports of partial reopening of schools in Delhi in the wake of fresh guidelines by the Centre, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, on Sunday tweeted that all schools in Delhi will remain shut till October 31 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the latest Unlock guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions outside containment zones can reopen after October 15. However, the decision on whether to reopen educational institutions has been left with States and Union Territories. The Delhi government had earlier said that schools will remain closed till October 5, though the Centre had permitted calling students of Classes IX to XII to schools on voluntary basis from September 21. “The Directorate of Education [DoE] has been directed to extend the ongoing closure of schools till October 31. Formal orders to this effect will be issued by the DoE tomorrow,” an official at the Deputy Chief Minister’s office said. Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre had announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown.  The Directorate of Education has been directed to extend the ongoing closure of schools till October 31.

05 October 2020||New Delhi,||Air quality expected to be ‘moderate’ over next 3 days||The overall air quality of the Capital was in the higher end of the moderate category on Sunday and is expected to remain at the edge of the category for the next three days, according to government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). “AQI [Air Quality Index] is forecast to stay at the edge of moderate category for the next three days as ventilation coefficient is still moderately high due to not so calm prevailing surface winds,” SAFAR said in a statement. Though stubble burning fires were observed on Saturday around Punjab, Haryana, and border regions and boundary layer wind direction is favourable for transport of its effect towards Delhi, higher local wind speed is preventing accumulation of pollutants in the city. Also, only a marginal stubble impact on AQI is expected for the next two days, according to SAFAR. The AQI on Sunday was 184, which is “moderate” and slightly less than 189 on Saturday, according to CPCB. “Currently, about half the stations in Delhi are in the poor category and the rest in moderate. So, the overall AQI is moderate. Local wind speed is above 4 km/hr and the ventilation coefficient (VC) is about 4,000. But later this week, the probability of the air quality turning poor is very high,” a SAFAR official told The Hindu . VC is the product of mixing height (the height of the atmosphere up to which pollutants can be dispersed) and average wind speed. So, a higher VC means that mixing height and wind speed at high and this aids in better dispersion of pollutants and hence reduce pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/air-quality-expected-to-be-moderate-over-next-3-days/article32768946.ece

05 October 2020||Pune,||Closure of gyms has hit over 30,000 families in Pune: BJP MLA Shirole||With restaurants, hotels and bars across Maharashtra set to reopen on Monday with up to 50% occupancy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Pune, Siddharth Shirole, has questioned why gymnasiums in the State continue to remain shut. On Sunday, he targeted the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s vacillation on re-opening fitness centres. Mr. Shirole said the livelihoods of more than 30,000 families in Pune alone were severely afflicted by the continued closure of health establishments. The irony of this prolonged closure of gymnasiums, he argued, was in fact proving counter-productive to the health of citizens as the lack of daily exercise was lowering immunity levels. ‘Unfair restrictions’ “It has been more than 200 days since gymnasiums and fitness centers have been shut, while malls, hotels and public transport have been allowed to reopen. Gyms, which comparatively have a lesser density of social gatherings, have been subjected to unfair restrictions,” said the BJP MLA from Shivajinagar, who had written to the Chief Minister last month seeking immediate reopening of gyms. Mr. Shirole said the shutdown of gyms across Maharashtra had disrupted the regular fitness regimen of health-conscious citizens. He said the restrictions did not make sense as gym owners, operators, trainers and their patrons were the most health-conscious among all citizens and rigorously observed hygiene rules. “At a time when there is no vaccine against COVID-19 on the horizon, daily workouts can act as natural immune boosters to help combat this contagion. Since there is a clear pattern of the virus acutely afflicting those with comorbidities like obesity, high sugar levels and hypertension, it is essential for the State government to start opening up gyms,” he said, adding that other States had already reopened their health and fitness centers. With surging liabilities, at least a 100-odd gyms in Pune have been forced to shut down, while many are struggling to keep their heads above water by seeking investment through partnership. Mounting rent charges, electricity bills and bank EMIs have spelt the death knell for many fitness establishments in the city. Despite numerous protests by gym associations in Pune and elsewhere, along with repeated letters to civic authorities, the government, until now, has turned a deaf ear to them. Job losses in the health industry have been particularly high in bustling metros like Pune and Mumbai, with scores of gym trainers forced to quit and seek other employment avenues. Earlier, the Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule, too, had urged the State government to re-open gyms. Ms. Sule, the MP from Baramati, had urged Chief Minister Thackeray to permit the functioning of gyms in August itself, observing that several gymnasium owners had invested heavily in their health centers. The same month, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray as well as the BJP Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had taken up the cudgels on behalf of gymnasium owners, urging the State government to reopen gyms by following norms laid down by the Union Health Ministry.  Daily workouts can act as natural immune boosters to help combat this contagion Siddharth Shirole BJP MLA from Shivajinagar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/closure-of-gyms-has-hit-over-30000-families-in-pune-bjp-mla-shirole/article32768961.ece

05 October 2020||Beijing,||Xi pitches for closer ties with Bangladesh, seeks BRI push||Chinese President Xi Jinping said he stands ready with Bangladesh leaders to better align the two countries’ strategies and jointly promote the construction of his multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to take the strategic partnership of the two countries to new heights. Mr. Xi made the remarks on Sunday in an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Bangladesh counterpart, Mohammad Abdul Hamid, on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral diplomatic relationship. In his message, Mr. Xi hailed the steady and long-term friendship, saying he is ready to work with Mr. Hamid to better align development strategies with Bangladesh, step up cooperation under the framework of the BRI and push forward the China-Bangladesh strategic, cooperative partnership to a new level, official media reported. With over $26 billion Chinese investments and $38 billion dollars funding commitments, Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of China’s massive infrastructure project. China has also offered zero-tariff treatment to 97% of Bangladesh’s exports by adding 5,161 more items to the existing list of 3,095 duty-free products. The BRI seeks to build rail, maritime and road links from Asia to Europe and Africa in a revival of ancient Silk Road trading routes. India’s concerns The BRI has been a major bone of contention between India and China as one portion of the corridor passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Besides Pakistan, where China initiated over $60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has stepped up its huge infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives rising concerns of its growing influence in India’s immediate neighbourhood. The BRI is President Xi’s top priority initiative, which aims firm up China’s global influence. ‘Debt-diplomacy’ The initiative has, however, attracted allegations, especially from the U.S., of debt-diplomacy after Sri Lanka handed over its Hambantota Port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease in a debt swap amounting to $1.2 billion. Malaysia has also deferred several projects under the BRI, citing cost revaluation. Mr. Xi, in his message to Mr. Hamid, also said the two countries had worked jointly to fight against COVID-19. Earlier, China had sent medical team to Bangladesh to share its experience of handling coronavirus, which had emerged first in Wuhan in December last year. Bangladesh is also among a dozen countries where the clinical trials of Chinese vaccine are under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-pitches-for-closer-ties-with-bangladesh-seeks-bri-push/article32768634.ece
05 October 2020||Islamabad,||Maulana to lead Pak. anti-govt. front||Pakistan’s firebrand cleric-cum-politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman has been unanimously appointed as the first president of the Opposition’s newly-formed anti-government alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a media report said on Sunday. The decision was taken on Saturday during a virtual meeting of the Opposition parties attended by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, BNP chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal among other senior politicians. According to PDM’s steering committee convener Ahsan Iqbal, deposed Prime Minister Sharif proposed Rehman’s name as the alliance president and it was endorsed by PPP chairman Bilawal and others, the Dawn newspaper reported. There was an agreement among the leaders that Mr. Rehman should lead the PDM in the first phase as he had already led a demonstration, dubbed as Azadi March, against the present Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government last year. “Since the Maulana has already done a rehearsal and his party is more disciplined and has the ability to effectively mobilise the masses, therefore, in the first and decisive phase, he is the best choice,” said one of the participants in the meeting. Most of the participants were of the opinion that in order to maintain continuity, it was necessary that the tenure of key office-bearers, including that of the PDM president, should not exceed four to six months. ‘No link to India’ The Maulana’s nomination to lead the movement came only a week before the formal launch of the anti-government campaign by the opposition parties with PDM’s first public meeting scheduled for October 11 in Quetta. The opposition parties’ heads in their meeting also passed a resolution. Through it, the PDM leaders condemned the PTI government’s statement linking the alliance to India, stating that such a statement was a proof of the government’s frustration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/maulana-to-lead-pak-anti-govt-front/article32768641.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Afghan woman leader makes it to Nobel front-runner list||Afghanistan’s first women Deputy Speaker in Parliament and member of the team of negotiators engaging the Taliban in talks in Doha, Fawzia Koofi has been named one of the “favourites” among nominees for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, due to be announced on October 9. Ms. Koofi, who has survived at least two assassination attempts, including one just two months ago before talks began, said the nomination itself was a “recognition” for the peace process, and would “empower” the role of Afghan women at Doha in particular. “I think this is a recognition of all of the efforts that Afghan women have undergone in order to be included in the [reconciliation] process, to be heard,” Ms. Koofi said, speaking to The Hindu from Doha, where she will participate in the next round of talks beginning Monday. And I think that the [Nobel nomination] gives me personally, much more power, along with my other three sisters (other women negotiators in the team) who are in this process of negotiation because we do have to try harder,” she added. Votary of women’s rights Ms. Koofi, one of Afghanistan’s most prominent politicians, was first elected to Parliament in 2005 when she was also elected the Deputy Speaker of Parliament. Her bid to stand for President was thwarted after new age rules disqualified her, but she has been a strong votary for women’s rights, piloting a Bill on the eradication of violence against women, and has campaigned for the inclusion of women in the reconciliation process. Ms. Koofi, whose father and brother were killed during the Taliban regime (1996-2001), also lost her husband who was repeatedly jailed by the Taliban, and died of an illness contracted there. She has been targeted by militants a number of times, including in 2010, when she was shot at, and again on August 16 this year, just weeks before the Doha talks began, when gunmen shot at her and her daughter, and a bullet injured her right arm. She attended the talks with her hand in a sling, nevertheless. “I do not want to be considered as just a woman, I want to be considered as representative of my country and as a politician, who have equal rights to sit across the table and discuss the future of her country. and therefore, if [the Taliban] want to really reconcile and if they want to pursue their political agendas, not through bullets, but through ballots, then they have to respect diversity and accept that we are part of the new Afghanistan.” The announcement of the winner will be made in Oslo by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday. According to the committee’s rules, the names of nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, and the frontrunner list is not “official”. However, last week, the Norwegian Peace Council, an umbrella NGO of 20 Norwegian Peace organisations in Oslo released its list of five frontrunners for the Nobel Peace Prize, choosing Ms. Koofi as the top favourite, out of a total number of 318 candidates. The list of favourites included media freedom groups Reporters Without Borders & Committee to Protect Journalists, New Zealand PM Jacinda Arden. “The fact that we have come up to hear in the peace process, and had our voice heard is very important, and whether we win or not, this recognition itself is a big success for women and for all of Afghanistan,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-woman-leader-makes-it-to-nobel-front-runner-list/article32768643.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Lost in the border crisis — political ownership||In October 2017, when India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar was the Foreign Secretary, he appeared before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs to depose on the 73-day-long Doklam stand-off. In two separate depositions, he underlined to the committee that “the issue [on the Sino-India-Bhutan border] is more of attempting to alter the status quo on the ground... It is this aspect that transforms a transgression into a larger diplomatic and political issue shifting the matter from the domain of the Armed Forces to that of Foreign Policy”. Armed forces as the cover Three years later, it is now clear that China has unilaterally altered the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh over the past five months — and at multiple points. As in Mr. Jaishankar’s benchmark, it has become transformed into a larger diplomatic and political issue, but the armed forces are still fronting the issue, whether in bilateral talks or in public communication. Once the matter had moved away from the domain of the armed forces, attention should have shifted from the military to the government as the public face of the crisis. However, that has not been the case so far as the government has been keen to shield itself from public criticism by demanding unquestioning support for the armed forces. Tightly embracing the military and pushing it to the forefront of domestic public imagination is an insurance policy for political leadership when it is facing severe criticism. Civil-military relations theorists have long warned against the participation of armed forces in domestic political roles in democracies, especially in times of a crisis. Micromanagement of the type we have witnessed during the Ladakh crisis, where the precise agenda and specific arguments of the Indian military delegation during the talks have been decided at the highest levels of government in Delhi, has drawn the armed forces into the political debate. If stark political divisions over this issue exacerbate, it could draw the military even deeper into the political slugfest, a situation best avoided. Peter D. Feaver’s research shows that linking the prestige of the military to debatable political decisions, as the government has attempted, carries with it the potential for reduced overall public confidence in the military and increased doubts about the military’s competence, truthfulness, and other dimensions of trustworthiness. Key men, mixed signals The government is headed by a Prime Minister who is a master at public communication and not short of words on any issue. He regularly speaks directly to the people, either through his own radio show, by updates on social media platforms, through his public speeches broadcast on television channels, or his addresses to the nation. He has been, however, conspicuous either by his silence on the border crisis or by his laboured efforts to avoid mentioning China by name. The one time he chose to speak in detail on the issue was during the all-party meeting, on June 19, called by the government to discuss the violence on the India-China border, where he said: “ Na koi wahan hamari seema mein ghus aaya hai aur nahi koi ghusa hua hai, na hi hamari koi post kisi dusre ke kabze mein hain (No one has intruded and nor is anyone intruding, nor has any post been captured by someone)”. His rather convoluted formulation, that needed an elaborate official clarification, handed the Chinese officials an argument they have gleefully used to embarrass the Indian interlocutors in all bilateral negotiations thereafter. From his cabinet, the External Affairs Minister has not spoken at any great length about the border crisis, although he has held multiple events related to the launch of his new book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World . Only the Defence Minister, who was the first to confirm the border crisis in a news television interview, delivered a carefully prepared statement in Parliament on September 15 (https://bit.ly/30wNVbU). The statement was factually correct but did not leave anyone better informed at the end of it. He took no questions from Members of Parliament, denying the Indian citizen an opportunity to have authoritative information and form her own view about the government’s decision-making. Compare this to the reality in the British Parliament, where some of the toughest questions on the most sensitive issues are thrown at the Prime Minister, who has to answer them as a measure of his accountability to the people. The presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha asked the Defence Minister to brief the leaders of opposition separately but there has been no such briefing even two weeks later, and Parliament has been prorogued. The country still does not know whether the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is the highest authority in the country on matters of national security, has met and discussed the grave border crisis in the past five months. In contrast, the previous National Democratic Alliance government had conducted official daily briefings during the 1999 Kargil War and senior Ministers were available to answer the media’s questions. The government’s argument for not taking any questions in Parliament was the surmise that these were sensitive operational issues which cannot be discussed in public. It holds little credence going by the operational details shared by top armed forces officials in unofficial media briefings. It means that there are enough relevant aspects that can be made public without compromising military operations or national security. A more viable argument in support of the government’s stance is that every government needs a free hand during negotiations and making information public ties its hand for any give and take during parleys. For e.g., the government may have hypothetically wanted to ignore the territory China has ingressed in Ladakh after May, if it could have a firm commitment from Beijing on delineating the international boundary. That would not have been possible had the Prime Minister told the Indian public on June 19 that China now denies India access to more than 1,000 square kilometres of territory in Ladakh — he would be under pressure to publicly ask the military to throw the Chinese out. By stating that no Chinese soldier was in Indian territory, he retained the flexibility to clinch such a hypothetical deal. On public opinion However, democratic governments can use public opinion to strengthen their hand during negotiations and to avoid making concessions to the other party. Pakistani leader Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto did it during the 1972 Simla negotiations after Pakistan’s loss in the 1971 Bangladesh war. Nearer home, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee nudged the Opposition parties to hold public protests against plans to send Indian troops to Iraq in 2003, an idea his deputy, L.K. Advani had agreed to in Washington DC The excuse of adverse public opinion allowed Vajpayee to pull back from Advani’s assurance to the Americans. Wanted, official information The lack of official information about the crisis has been damaging in other ways too. Not only are people uninformed; they are also misinformed by the gung-ho jingoistic, hyper-nationalist commentators and journalists who have hyped up the Indian military and diplomatic capabilities. Their desire to believe the most exaggerated version of events showing India in the greatest light, has put more pressure on this muscular government which cannot afford to be seen as weak. The gravest warning of keeping the people in the dark comes from neighbouring Pakistan — on the day its armed forces surrendered to India in Dhaka on December 1971, the Pakistani media was running reports of a glorious military win. A more honest dissemination of information prevents such situations from developing, which can have damaging consequences for the country going forward. India is facing a grave crisis on its borders which shows no sign of ending. As an issue in the middle of a raging novel coronavirus pandemic and a plummeting economy, it needs a ‘whole-of-government’ approach directly under the visible leadership of the Prime Minister. But the government seems shy of taking ownership of the crisis, instead placing the armed forces as the public face of the challenge. Having the uniform as a shield to avoid democratic accountability may be politically profitable for the government but it carries the risk of aggravating the crisis and hurting India.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||The future of GST hangs in the balance||Today is the crucial meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council. It may not be an exaggeration to claim that today’s meeting could mark a milestone in the history of India’s fiscal federalism and shape the future of Centre-State relations. In 2017, the Centre made a promise to the States that a certain minimum amount of GST revenues will be guaranteed to every State for every year until 2022. GST was born in the cradle of this promise and hailed as a harbinger of ‘cooperative federalism’. Now, there is not enough money in the GST kitty for the Centre to honour this obligation. The Centre has therefore proposed that the States should borrow money to bridge this gap and that it will act as a guarantor to facilitate this borrowing. Many States have accepted this proposal while many others have rejected it and implored the Centre to borrow. There is a bitter stand-off between the Centre and these protesting States. Widening trust deficit This is further complicated by the recent revelation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and explained by Professor Govinda Rao in The Hindu, that in the last few years, the Centre deliberately mis-allocated nearly Rs. 3 lakh crore collected through various cesses, to reduce the States’ share of tax revenues. The Centre’s dishonesty has eroded its credibility with the States and widened the trust deficit. Amidst this background, the GST compensation issue could be put to vote in the GST Council meeting today. The GST Council has 31 States and Union Territories represented. The Council was set up in 2017 as a new financial institution with the enormous economic responsibility of directing policy for half of all tax revenues of the country. Sadly, this vital institution, like many others, has dwindled rapidly into yet another avenue for political power play. Twenty members of the GST Council that have agreed to the Centre’s proposal are governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or a BJP alliance. The 11 States that have opposed the Centre’s plan are all governed by the Opposition. The 11 opposing States account for a greater share of overall GST revenues than the 20 supporting States. But it does not matter since every State, large or small, has equal weight in the GST Council. Twelve votes can veto a proposal in the GST council. The Centre has reiterated its commitment to fulfil the GST compensation obligation to the States. So, only the modus operandi of raising funds to fulfil this obligation is to be decided. This is primarily an economic issue and should be settled based on what makes the most economic sense for each State and for the nation overall. Each State’s economic realities are distinct. Just four States — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — account for nearly as much GST tax revenues as the remaining 27 States and Union Territories combined. But Gujarat and Karnataka support the Centre’s proposal while Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have opposed it. GST compensation constitutes a significant share of the revenues of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, yet Himachal Pradesh supports the Centre’s plan while Punjab is against it. Rajasthan and Haryana have similar sized fiscal deficits . Rajasthan is understandably apprehensive, but Haryana seems ready to indulge in more borrowing. Naïve and clichéd as it may sound, a State’s decision to borrow or not should be based on its fiscal situation, not its political affiliation. State fiscal policies are complex matters and cannot be decided through a ‘high command whip’. The GST compensation imbroglio has exposed the shallow rhetoric of ‘cooperative federalism’ and exacerbated the politicisation of the GST Council. Alternative revenue sources Economic logic suggests that the Centre, and not the States, is best positioned to raise additional resources to bridge the GST compensation gap. State governments don’t have the powers to levy direct taxes or indirect taxes to earn additional revenues. A State’s finances are not in the hands of the State government any more. But the Centre has multiple alternative revenue streams. It is true that COVID-19 has ravaged the economy and strained government finances. But even in this severe economic slowdown, the Centre can find some new and creative options for tax revenues that are not available to the States. Purely for illustrative purposes, one such revenue opportunity can be through increased taxation of capital market transactions. Between April and June, when economic activity in the nation had come to a complete standstill, India’s stock markets experienced its highest activity levels in its history, with a 75% increase in transactions vis-a-vis last year. The stock market rose 30% in this period and a minority few profited handsomely. In all likelihood, this buoyant stock market activity did not create one extra job in the real economy. The Centre can levy a higher tax on such speculative stock market trading to earn additional revenues during these difficult times, which will also not hurt the economy like an increase in GST rates or cess will do. A five-fold increase in the securities transaction tax from its current minuscule levels of 0.025% can potentially generate an additional Rs. 50,000 crore of revenue for the Centre, which can be very handy in these times. Contrary to belief and fearmongering by stock market participants, 15 years of data show there is no evidence that, in India, raising securities transaction taxes adversely impacts stock market activity or the overall economy. The larger point is that such options for new revenue generation are not available for the States. In these dire economic conditions, the Centre has many more avenues to raise additional resources than the States. A combination of additional revenues and borrowing by the Centre can help resolve the GST compensation issue amicably. There is fear that the international ratings agencies may downgrade India’s rating to “junk” status if the Centre’s borrowings rise exorbitantly. It is understandable that no finance minister or bureaucrat wants the badge of a downgrade. But it is inane to believe that just offloading the borrowing to States can fool the ratings agencies. The economic argument is crystal clear that it is more prudent for the Centre to use its much greater ammunition to raise additional tax revenues and/or to borrow to keep its GST promise. It makes no economic sense for the States, regardless of which party is in power, to increase their borrowing at the behest of the Centre. States will be forced to borrow anyway for their own expenditure. The credibility of the GST Council and the larger idea of cooperative federalism can still be salvaged if, in today’s meeting, the Centre can shed its cussedness and end this impasse by committing to raise resources to plug the GST compensation gap.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Transforming business and the insolvency system||The Prime Minister mentioned the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC 2016) as one of the key legislative reforms that would help aid India’s path to self-reliance on a high growth trajectory. The IBC, along with the Goods and Services Tax regime, among other key reforms, were helping in significantly improving the ease of doing business in India and enabling it to emerge as a ‘Make for World’ platform. He also credited these reforms for a surge in Foreign Direct Investment into India in 2019-2020, to the tune of nearly $74.5 billion, or a significant increase of 20 per cent from the previous year. A key reform step The IBC has been a far-ranging and structurally significant reform that has transformed insolvency resolution in India. Replacing a rather inefficient bankruptcy law regime, the IBC has focused on time-bound resolution, rather than liquidation, as an empowering tool to support companies falling within its ambit. It has successfully instilled confidence in the corporate resolution methodology, and perhaps, more importantly, on creating a possibility for the creditors recouping some of their investments in firms being liquidated or going in for resolution. Its core implication has been to allow credit to flow more freely to and within India while promoting investor and investee confidence. Despite the suspension of the IBC for a limited duration due to the COVID 19 pandemic, in the short, medium and long term, it will prove to have been a timely reform. It will greatly streamline insolvency processes in a sustainable, efficient, and value retaining manner. India, unfortunately, suffers from a serious backlog in court cases, to the tune of nearly four crore matters pending final judgment. The novel coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate this. The enforceability of contracts has been a challenge. On an average, it takes as many as 1,445 days for a contract to be enforced, and that too at a cost of nearly 31% of the claim value. This is simply unacceptable. Criminal penalties Along with further streamlining and reinforcing the IBC, the Government of India is also working toward decriminalisation of minor offences. NITI Aayog is playing an active role in this exercise, which will significantly reduce the risk of imprisonment for actions or omissions that are not necessarily fraudulent or an outcome of mala fide intent. Criminal penalties including imprisonment for minor offences act as major deterrents for investors. The government’s intent is to help differentiate between good faith mistakes and intentional bad faith actions, so as to penalise the former, and criminalise the latter. Moves that will help Other legislative measures that will further improve the investment climate, include the rolling out of the commercial courts, commercial divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions Act, 2015, to allow district court-level commercial courts, and the removing of over 1,500 obsolete and archaic laws. Together with the IBC, these highlight a major and multi-dimensional effort by the government to provide comfort, relief and reliability to the potential investors. The IBC is both flexible and dynamic, which makes it impactful, given how forward thinking the concept of an omnibus legislation of its nature actually is. The IBC goes beyond other similar pieces of legislation across the world, and through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), it has established an unprecedented organisation that both regulates and develops insolvency policy, and assesses market realities. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), in its year end summary press release (https://bit.ly/2EXXEQH), provided the context of India’ s rapid rise in the Ease of Doing Business rankings, and IBC’s important role of the IBC in it. According to the Resolving Insolvency Index, India’s ranking improved to 52 in 2019 from 108 in 2018, a leap of 56 places. Further, the recovery rate improved nearly threefold from 26.5% in 2018 to 71.6% in 2019. And, the overall time taken in recovery also improved nearly three times, coming down from 4.3 years in 2018 to 1.6 years in 2019. Two key drivers for the IBC are relatively short time-bound processes, and the focus on prioritising resolution rather than liquidation. The report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee (https://bit.ly/33uW4zj) speaks of the critical need for speed in the working of the bankruptcy code. It is clear that the inability to make significant decisions without full clarity of ownership and control delays resolution. And, the longer the delay, the more likely that the entity in question would move towards liquidation rather than resolution. The delays result in low value liquidation due to a high economic rate of depreciation. Higher value stems from the firm being acquired as a going concern. Going forward, there could perhaps be a look at institutionalising the introduction of a pre-packed insolvency resolution process, the need for which is highlighted by the necessary suspension of the IBC proceedings. This will also help resolve matters expeditiously, outside of the formal court system, and allow resolution even during the COVID-19 altered reality. Helping MSMEs The MCA along with IBBI are working diligently on putting in place a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and non-MSME framework to help expedite this process. At the same time, given the need for social distancing and the suspension or limitation of physical hearings, a concerted effort should be made to enhance the role of digitally conducting all processes and hearings to achieve greater efficiency in the new normal. Bringing in technology would help ease of access to justice and greatly help ease of doing business from a process and efficiency standpoint as well. The IBC has provided a major stimulus to ease of doing business, enhanced investor confidence, and helped encourage entrepreneurship while also providing support to MSMEs. Its further streamlining and strengthening will surely instil greater confidence in both foreign and domestic investors as they look at India as an attractive investment destination. Rajiv Kumar and Desh Gaurav Sekhri are, respectively, Vice Chairman and Officer on Special Duty, NITI Aayog.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||English is an Indian language||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 proposes a three-language formula under which schools must teach at least two languages that are “native to India”. Conspicuous by its absence in this category is English, threatening access to English instruction in public schools. This has played into popular notions that English is no more than a “colonial imposition”, not “native” to Indians. It is time to retire and reject these notions and recognise that English is very much an Indian language. Rather than trying to justify contentious historical criteria for “native”, we must focus on what English is to India today: an aspirational, cosmopolitan, widely spoken language we have made our own. An inclusive language The history of language and learning in India has been fraught with problems. Education in traditional knowledge systems has been highly discriminatory, especially along caste lines. English education emerged as an emancipator and equaliser, allowing people across social groups to break away from exclusionary knowledge systems. Dialect and vocabulary in regional languages are still indicators of caste and community, and enable further exclusion. English presents an opportunity to master a language that no one can exclusively claim as their own in India. This has helped sustain its appeal long after the British left. Middle-class Indians, many of whom have never studied English, want their children to attend English-medium schools, not just because of a promise of jobs, but of a respectability that English represents. This has made English a pathway to unique economic and sociocultural mobility that has given us a global advantage. English is the global lingua franca; it is the world’s preferred language of commerce, science, diplomacy and culture. Competence in English has enabled India to establish itself in these areas and its diaspora to thrive across the world, especially in the field of technology. The association between English and stable, well-paying careers is obvious and apparent. Today, Indians give shape to new thought through English. Science has relied on it to pool the best minds of the country and create a strong base of research, innovation and teaching in the field. We have drafted a Constitution and given shape to essential rights and ideals in English. Legal processes in India rely heavily on what has become the international language of the law. It is the language of our courts and some of our greatest legal minds such as H.M. Seervai, Nanabhoy Palkhivala and Krishna Iyer. Indian authors have also produced enduring English literature. R.K. Narayan, Khushwant Singh, Vikram Seth, Shashi Tharoor (who has made big words cool), Aravind Adiga, Chetan Bhagat, Shobhaa De, Arundhati Roy and many others have given us a rich Indian English which is as much our own as any other “native” language. Part of daily life Our debates on language are often detached from practical reality; the truth is that in India, the usage of English is already much more pervasive than people acknowledge. Languages borrow from English with abandon. Whatever part of the country we are from, we talk on mobile phones and say “hello”, “thank you” and “happy birthday”. Whatever language one speaks, texting uses the Roman alphabet (in convenient Indian English keyboards), and emailing in any other script is unheard of. We have English words for many parts of daily life, and every Indian language relies on them. Would a car/cycle mechanic, electrician or postal worker be able to conduct tradecraft without some English? Do we have a well-developed and widely known vocabulary of medical jargon in any other Indian language? Every city has its own impressive English slang. How long can people hold a simple conversation on their own without using any English words? The convenience that even a passable knowledge of English lends to general communication is unparalleled. English is most popular in parts of India where the opposition to the homogenising ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindutva’ agenda is strongest. The NEP’s refusal to consider English as an Indian language is simply a backhanded effort to impose Hindi nationwide, restricting the autonomy of schools and States. In Tamil Nadu, a two-language policy has worked successfully for decades. Children have continued learning Tamil while also benefiting from the practical advantages of English. The NEP threatens this, and will not be acceptable to the people of Tamil Nadu. The fact is that today, English has become essential to success in India. For an aspirational middle class, knowledge of English is a great emancipator — a path to a better future. In making rich contributions to the country and world through English, we have made it our own. The time has come to recognise it.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||A commission misguided||The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is the apex body for upholding, monitoring and facilitating child rights in the country. However, as persons previously associated with this esteemed body, we note with great concern some of the recent actions of the Commission that suggest a grave departure from its primary duty to ensure the well-being of all children, especially children in need of care and protection. Major concerns Amongst its significant powers and duties, the NCPCR has been specifically charged with the monitoring of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) and was instructed to carry out a social audit of the same by the Supreme Court. The social audit was initiated in 2015 and upon its completion, the NCPCR, in its wisdom, directed District Magistrates in eight States to ensure that all children within CCIs be de-institutionalised, repatriated and rehabilitated within a specified period. Civil society organisations have raised several obvious concerns about this, especially because most of these children are in CCIs due to abusive conditions in the family, and a mandated repatriation without an adequate case-by-case assessment plan within a short period of time would likely place the children again at grave risk of abuse, exploitation and neglect. They also point to the sheer inadequacy of current systems to organise adoption and foster care. Juxtaposed with this diktat is the disturbing report of raids being undertaken on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti by the NCPCR in select NGO-run CCIs, in order to establish whether foreign funds have been misused in any manner. Not only is monitoring of the FCRA regulations outside of the mandate of the NCPCR, but the raids also seem to target individuals who have been outspoken in the criticism of the Central government on issues such as the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Such raids seem to have communal overtones as an enquiry led by none less than the Chairperson reportedly delved into whether the previously homeless children in the CCIs belonged to a particular community (Rohingya), and what religious practices they engaged with, even as the institutions are known to maintain a secular character.   A lot to be done The pandemic has exacerbated existing issues of child malnutrition, child labour, child abuse, child marriage and mental illness. We would have expected the NCPCR to show concern for the gross violation of children’s rights during the lockdown and in its aftermath. The NCPCR could have used its authority and power to issue recommendations to relieve these grave conditions by reiterating the need for strengthening all child-related institutions (government and non-government) through adequate funds, and appreciating the relief measures that many civil society organisations, including the ones being raided and instructed to close down, were engaged in. As citizens concerned with the rights and welfare of children, we have also been appalled at the daily reports of Dalit children and young women being raped and murdered, with gross irregularities by the very institutions that are charged with their protection. We would have expected the NCPCR to exhibit its priorities better by taking suo motu cognisance of the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh, to make a test case of the lack of systems to fight crimes against children instead of moving to undermine and dismantle whatever little does exist for their protection. Undoubtedly, CCIs need monitoring and reforms; the Commission should be in the vanguard to ensure the support that would necessarily be required to implement these reforms. Yet, it seems to be deriving its priorities from the political agenda of the day rather than upholding a steadfast and fair commitment to the welfare of children.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Mixed signals||In these pandemic-hit times, when most economic news has been grim, the latest GST data give cause for some hope, albeit cautious, especially to policy makers overseeing beleaguered public finances. Gross revenue collections from GST scaled a six-month high of Rs. 95,480 crore in September, the first time in the current fiscal year when the tax receipts exceeded the year-earlier period’s figure. Clearly, with lockdown restrictions having been significantly eased, economic activity appears to have regained some momentum as people strive to reclaim a semblance of normality and businesses rush to restock inventory ahead of the peak consumption season in festival-marked October and November. Other high-frequency indicators, including automobile wholesales and the survey-based Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing, both for September, reflected this push to build up stocks. The IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI reading was at its highest in more than eight years as accelerated increases in new orders and production buoyed the sector’s outlook. GST revenue from the import of goods was also marginally higher than in the year-earlier period, signalling that inward shipments of commodities used as inputs in manufacturing had inched up. Merchandise trade data from the Commerce Ministry show Indian purchases of metal ores and pharma products in September posted increases of almost 43% and 28%, respectively, appearing to correlate with the trend in GST. However, the 3.88% year-on-year growth in gross GST revenue must be seen in the backdrop of the fact that GST receipts had slid to a six-month low in September 2019 — a 2.7% contraction — as overall economic momentum slowed considerably. The key concern now would be to gauge the durability of the trend in GST collections, especially considering that over the first six months of the current fiscal, the cumulative revenue receipts are 25% lower year-on-year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s annual Budget for 2020-21, announced in February before the pandemic and lockdowns pushed the economy into a record contraction, had projected a 12.8% growth in GST receipts, a goal that now seems surely impossible to realise. With the GST Council expected to meet today and attempts to resolve the contentious issue of GST compensation shortfall, Finance Ministry officials have their task cut out in trying to assess if their earlier projections of a Rs. 3-lakh crore shortfall in GST compensation would need to be recalibrated in light of the uptick in receipts. A reasonably accurate prognostication for the tax collection trend for the second half may well hold the key to untangling this logjam over the ways to fund the shortfall and the Centre-State trust deficit it has created.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mixed-signals/article32768615.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Until vaccine||India’s fifth round of unlock regulations for October, allowing a further expansion of public activity mainly in education, entertainment and business conferences, comes at a time when COVID-19 transmission is steady in many cities. Nationally, though, the new infections being added everyday, at about 60,000, represent a decline in recent days, as per Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center data. The stringent March-April lockdown, and the subsequent measures to unlock the economy to prevent an equally debilitating crisis to livelihoods, have made India an uncommon case study. The decision to allow States to consider reopening schools and coaching centres after October 15, for students who wish to optionally attend, will prove a difficult one, considering new research evidence based on data from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh pointing to high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of virus cases in the same age group. Slowing community spread is bound to become more complicated, since governments blame careless attitudes for continued transmission — notably in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While essential movement for economic reasons, including use of public transport, is unavoidable, indifference towards safe public behaviour is extracting a heavy social cost. Even in the face of a deadly pandemic, governments are taking a benign view of recalcitrant people who do not wear masks, even on buses and trains, spit in public, and crowd commercial locations. During the monsoon and winter months, and the festive season, polite, persuasive enforcement would be essential to reduce infection rates. Among the relaxation measures in the October unlock phase is permission for cinemas and multiplexes to open at 50% capacity, but the risk surrounding enclosed spaces and transmission from asymptomatic individuals is real. Viewed against the enhanced risk of environments where masks are removed for eating and drinking, such as cinemas and restaurants, these entertainment options may not have wide appeal in the pre-vaccine phase. While the economy shifts gears in the activity phase, the Centre should be focusing on improving the understanding of the health impacts of COVID-19. Disappointingly, while it has emphasised massive recovery rates from the infection, it has failed to standardise testing and reporting methods among States, and publish fine-grained data on types of tests carried out in each State, anonymised patient histories, post-recovery status for complications and mortality. Repeated emphasis on a large number of recoveries, which were expected anyway, but without the necessary caveats, may be encouraging millions to lower their guard. Every effort to relieve the citizen’s fatigue over COVID-19 should be made, but the goal is to preserve health until a medical breakthrough is made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/until-vaccine/article32768616.ece

They suggest at once a criticism and an argument for Non-Co-operation. We have rarely in the history of the Councils come across a feebler and a more inane assemblage than that to which fell the onerous task of saying ditto to the bureaucracy in measures so important as the Elementary Education Bill and the Local Boards Bill. We doubt if a more complaisant legislature or one more ready to lose itself in ecstasies of joy at the condescending smiles of officialdom could be found anywhere else than in a country where gratitude is emphatically a lively anticipation of favours to come. We are accustomed to go into paroxysms of delight at a smile and fade into unobtrusiveness at a frown from the powers-that-be and so long as this mentality does not undergo radical alteration, so long will all talk of self-Government remain a hollow mockery.

The agency report also called Mao “the Supreme Commander of the whole nation and the whole army” and “the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China.” Some observers here attached significance to the use of these titles at this time when preparations are said to be under way to convene the National People’s Congress, which will formally have to approve of the new appointment. China has been without any functioning Head of State since the removal of Mao’s arch enemy and one-time heir Liu Shao-chi.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Returns tango with risk||Most of us think that ROI means Return On Investment. This is true; but ROI can also mean Risk on Investment. Risk and return are two sides of the same coin. When we say ‘high risk, high returns,’ the word ‘returns’ impacts our mind prominently. This is because we all want returns on our investment and rightly so. However, think quietly: should it be ‘high risk, high return’ or ‘high return, high risk’? When we say the former, we feel everyone who takes higher risk will get higher returns. The fact is all high-return investments also have a high risk component. Risk and returns are inseparable. Is it ever possible for a rose plant to grow without thorns on it? Can a butcher say, I will not see blood and flesh. What about a fisherman who is scared of water? Similarly, there cannot be returns on investment without risk attached to it. The very first risk we take is parting with our money. There are many kinds of risk attached to different kinds of investments. Before investing, it is important to know about them. A car driver ought to have complete knowledge of the brake and accelerator before starting the vehicle. The suggestion, however, is not to stay away from investing. One of the biggest risks an individual takes in life is not investing. An equally huge risk is to invest without knowing the associated risks.  Biggest risk Mitali and Sudhir are a very young, newly-married couple. They wanted to purchase a home. Their landlord was willing to sell the property to them. He was also considerate towards structuring the deal in a manner which would be a win-win for both the sides. For down payment, they needed Rs. 25 lakh. Most of the couple’s funds were locked in tax-saving instruments and a plot of land purchased from the money received at the time of marriage. Funds were available but locked in. This is the biggest risk that faces investors of today. Investments are made without keeping in mind ‘My GDP’ – My Goals and Dreams Plan. Always keep an eye on ‘My GDP’ before investing. Types of risk Apart from the above, the two important categories of risk associated with any kind of investment are (1) transparent and non-transparent risks (2) systematic and unsystematic risks. When we invest in stock markets or gold, the risk is transparent. We can see the movement of prices and market value of our investments. When we invest in bank fixed deposits, there is no way to find out how much we are losing to inflation on a daily or weekly basis. Therefore, investments in stock market and gold are transparent risks. On the other hand, investment in fixed deposit, and for that matter, even real estate to some extent, is a non-transparent risk. Systematic risk is one which exists in the system. Inflation, for example, is a part of the economic system. The moment we invest in any kind of instrument, we inherit inflation risk. Similar is the case with government policies, geo-political tensions and the like. Unsystematic risk is attached to a particular investment. For example, if the investment is in an equity mutual fund and the government decides to tax investments in gold, our investment in equity will not affected, but that in gold will be. Similarly, if we have shares of ABC Ltd. and if the MD of XYZ Ltd. resigns there will not be any impact on ABC Ltd. This is because tax on gold and the resignation of MD of XYZ Ltd. are not a part of the system and hence, will not affect all forms of investment. We must invest to achieve our financial goals but keep an eye on ‘My ROI’ – My Risk On Investment.  (The author is a financial planner and the author of Yogic Wealth)   When we say ‘high risk, high returns,’ the word ‘returns’ impacts our mind prominently. This is because we all want returns on our investment and rightly so. However, think quietly: should it be ‘high risk, high return’ or ‘high return, high risk’ ?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/returns-tango-with-risk/article32768609.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Save tax with the Sheltering Principle||It is better to have income and pay taxes than not have income. But it is important that you carefully plan your taxes. In this article, we look at how you can avail deduction of Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act as part of your goal-based investments. The following discussion is based on the assumption that you choose the old tax regime. Tax-efficient investments Saving taxes on your goal-based investments helps you enjoy a better lifestyle. How? The higher the taxes on your goal-based investments, the lower the returns. And lower the returns, the more you have to save every month to achieve your goal. Therefore, tax-efficient investments will leave more money for your current consumption. Therefore, it is important that you optimally use your Section 80C limit. What products should you choose to achieve your life goal and simultaneously exhaust the Section 80C limit? For any goal that you pursue, your investment portfolio will have equity and bonds. Your equity investments will be typically through mutual funds (MFs) while your bond investments will be in bank fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits (RDs). So, your equity investments predominantly earn capital appreciation whereas your bond investments earn only income return. This sets the stage for applying the Sheltering Principle to create tax-efficient portfolios. The principle in question You should protect (shelter) from tax those investments in your portfolio that provide the lowest post-tax returns. Typically, income returns are taxed at a higher rate than returns from capital appreciation. Note that your equity investments will typically attract long-term capital gains because you are likely to hold the investments for more than one year; this is because you are investing to achieve a life goal which will have a typical horizon of more than three years. Therefore, your equity investments will be taxed at 10% whereas your income returns will be taxed at your marginal tax rate (30% typically). So, if your goal-based portfolio contains equity funds and bank FDs, your investments will suffer 10% tax on equity investments and 30% tax on bond investments. Therefore, it is logical to shelter bond investments (PF and PPF) from taxes. The arithmetic behind the Sheltering Principle is simple. Suppose you are planning to invest Rs. 1.5 lakh in PPF and your total investments for the year is, say, Rs. 4 lakh. Suppose PPF pays 7% per annum, your portfolio’s expected portfolio return will increase by 0.79% (7% times your marginal tax rate times Rs. 1.5 lakh divided by your total annual investments). This shows that the benefit decreases as your total investments in a year increase. There is some benefit, nevertheless. There is a reason why the Sheltering Principle works. The long-term capital gains on ELSS is taxed at 10% just like other equity funds. So, the benefit in investing in ELSS is only the amount you save as taxes in any year you make the investment, which is Rs. 45,000 (marginal tax rate of 30% of Rs. 1.5 lakh). In contrast, by investing in PPF, you not only save Rs. 45,000 in taxes in any year you invest, your interest income and accumulated amount you withdraw at maturity are also tax-free. This adds to the post-tax expected return on your portfolio through the time horizon for a life goal. The higher post-tax returns reduce stress on savings, giving you more disposable cash for current consumption. Note that investments in ELSS have a three-year lock-in period under the Income Tax Act. So, you risk losing your unrealised gains if the market moves up during the lock-in period only to decline thereafter. Also, if you invest in ELSS through a systematic investment plan (SIP), each SIP will be subject to the three-year lock-in period.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||In cooling-off mode||After a period of consolidation, the prices of precious metals saw a cool-off in September. The firm trend in the U.S. dollar along with a recovery in the equity market affected market sentiment. Comex gold closed 4.4% lower in September to settle at $1,890.9 an ounce. The fall in comex silver was dramatic with the metal losing 17.9% to settle at $23.3 an ounce. In the domestic market, MCX gold futures closed 3.2% lower to Rs. 50,334 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 14.9% lower to Rs. 59,919 per kg. Comex gold ruled weak with prices slipping below the lower end of the prior trading range at $1,910-$2,025. While the long-term outlook for Comex gold remains positive, there are no signs of completion of the recent price cool-off. A move above $1,980 would indicate the resumption of the long-term uptrend. Until $1,980 is taken out, the premise would be that the short-term cool-off phase is at play. Comex gold may slip to the immediate target range of $1,825-1,840 range in the short term. A move past $1,980 is required to invalidate this short-term weak outlook. Comex silver, too, breached the prior support zone at $25.5 resulting in a slide to $21.2. The price has subsequently recovered in the past few trading sessions. While the long-term outlook is positive, the price may drift lower in the near term. A fall below $23 would be a sign of weakness and could push silver price to $21-21.5 an ounce. MCX gold has been consolidating in the Rs. 49,500-54,500 range. This trend may persist until the price gets past the Rs. 55,000 per 10 gm- level. A fall below Rs. 49,400 would impart weakness and price could then drift to the next target of Rs. 47,500-48,000. Until the price gets above Rs. 55,000, a slide to Rs. 48,000 would be the preferred short-term outlook. MCX silver dropped below the lower end of the prior range at Rs. 64,000, resulting in a sharp crack thereafter. The short-term trend is weak and a slide to Rs. 58,300 appears likely. The short-term trend could turn much weaker on a close below Rs. 57,500. Until price moves above Rs. 64,000, a slide to Rs. 58,300 would be the preferred view. To summarise, precious metals are in a short-term downtrend while the long-term trend remains positive.  (The author is a Chennai based analyst/trader.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Watson, du Plessis put Kings to the sword||Shane Watson (83 n.o., 53b, 11x3, 3x6) and the in-form Faf du Plessis (87 n.o., 53b, 11x4, 1x6) pummelled Kings XI Punjab into submission to lead Chennai Super Kings to a thumping 10-wicket win at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. Chasing Kings’ competitive 179-run target, CSK emerged victorious with 14 balls to spare and snapped its three-match losing streak. Relief, finally The three-time champion will finally be relieved to have Watson back in form after a sedate start to the tournament. The Australian looked in good touch from the beginning, leaning into drives and clearing the in-field with ease. At the other end, du Plessis cut loose when he went after Chris Jordan, hitting him for four boundaries to help CSK finish the PowerPlay with the score reading 60. The duo did not allow the left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar and leggie Ravi Bishnoi to settle, employing the sweep shot effectively to find boundaries at will. Watson then hit three boundaries and a six in quick succession to race towards his first half-century of the season. He welcomed Jordan back into the attack with two consecutive boundaries to get to the mark, while du Plessis got to his three balls later. They went on to stitch together a 181-run association — CSK’s highest for any wicket in the IPL — to flatten the Kings. Earlier, K.L. Rahul once again led from the front with a half-century (63, 52b, 7x4, 1x6) to help Kings XI Punjab post 178. He was assisted by some brutal hitting from Nicholas Pooran at the back end of the innings – a 33-run cameo off just 17 balls (1x4, 3x6). Laying the foundation Electing to bat, Rahul and Mayank Agarwal laid the foundation for a challenging score with a 61-run opening-wicket stand. Rahul was not at his fluent best but still produced some glorious cuts and drives when allowed to free his arms. After being watchful in the middle overs, Rahul launched into Shardul Thakur in the 15th over, scoring 14 off it to get to his half-century. At the other end, Pooran went berserk, hitting a four and six off Jadeja’s final over, before picking two more maximums of Curran and Bravo. Shardul, however, removed both Pooran and Rahul off successive deliveries at the start of the 18th over, helping keep the target within CSK’s reach.   CSK 112 for no loss  Chennai Super Kings was 112 for no loss in 11 overs, with Watson (55) and du Plessis (50) at the crease||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-pooran-pilot-kxip-to-178/article32768709.ece
05 October 2020||Dubai,||Kohli matches wits with Shreyas||A back-in-form Virat Kohli’s tactical acumen will be put to test against Shreyas Iyer’s unassuming but dynamic brand of captaincy when Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals face off on Monday. Back in form While Shreyas has been in good form in all four matches, Kohli finally got his act together against Rajasthan Royals on Saturday. On Monday, both skippers would look to lead from the front in what promises to be a thrilling contest. While Prithvi Shaw has so far looked in control at the top of the order for Capitals, Shikhar Dhawan’s form would be a cause of concern. Rishabh Pant seems to have dusted off his rustiness with a quick-fire 17-ball 38 on Saturday. On the bowling front, Kagiso Rabada will still be the go-to man even though he leaked runs against KKR. South African pacer Anrich Nortje has been brilliant in the opening and slog overs. RCB, meanwhile, has been served well by the young Devdutt Padikkal at the top. The left-hander, considered the next big thing in Indian cricket, is fourth in the run-scorers’ tally with 174 from four games, including three fifties.  And, Aaron Finch finding his touch would be the icing. Kohli’s return to form is a relief with A.B. de Villiers, Shivam Dube and Gurkeerat Singh to follow. Welcome addition Isuru Udana has been a welcome addition to RCB’s bowling line-up alongside Navdeep Saini and the spin duo of Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal. But Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa is yet to adjust to the conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-matches-wits-with-shreyas/article32768706.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||de Kock, Boult do it for MI||Openers Quinton de Kock and David Warner scored maiden fifties for Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad in this edition, but it was the performance in the death overs — with bat and ball — that proved decisive in the IPL clash between the two teams at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Sunday. de Kock’s 67 (39b, 4x4, 4x6) and valuable contributions from the big-hitters — Kieron Pollard, going berserk at the back-end helped Mumbai Indians amass 208 for five against an attack missing the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Despite Warner’s maiden fifty of the season (60, 44b, 5x4, 2x6), an on-song pace troika of Mumbai Indians meant Sunrisers’ chase fell apart in the latter half. With Mumbai Indians conceding just 80/5 in the last 10 overs at the high-scoring venue meant that Sunrisers could trudge to 174 for seven, the first sub-200 total of the season at Sharjah. At the halfway stage, at 94 for two, Sunrisers was on course to make it yet another thrilling finish. Mini-battles However, Trent Boult and James Pattinson won mini-battles against their national counterparts to seal the fate of the game. Left-armer Boult’s tennis-ball bounce coerced his Black Caps captain Kane Williamson into an edge in the 13th over. When Pattinson won the all-Australian battle against Warner in the 16th, courtesy a diving effort by Ishan Kishan at short third-man, the game was all but over. Jasprit Bumrah then proved too hot for the inexperienced lower-order, which resulted in a comfortable win. Earlier, de Kock’s knock ensured that Chris Lynn will have to keep cooling his heels. Had Manish Pandey not dropped a regulation catch off leggie Samad at long-on in the seventh over, de Kock’s (on 16) and MI’s misery would have compounded. MI could have been reduced to 52 for three. Once he was let off, de Kock set the platform for the Pandya brothers and Kieron Pollard to finish on a high. Despite Pandey’s stunning effort to dismiss Ishan Kishan in the 15th, the last six overs saw 74 runs being scored, with Krunal hammering Siddarth Kaul for 20 runs off the last four balls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/de-kock-lower-order-and-boult-do-it-for-mi/article32768711.ece
05 October 2020||KOLKATA,||Tripathi holds out hope: Morgan||For Eoin Morgan, Rahul Tripathi’s cameo was a ‘huge positive’ for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 18-run loss to Delhi Capitals in Sharjah on Saturday. Coming in at No. 8 in his first match, Tripathi hit a 16-ball 36 to keep KKR, chasing 229, in the contest until the last over. “When he (Tripathi) bats down the order and produces something like that, it is a huge positive,” Morgan said. “To score at a strike rate of 250-300, it’s almost Andre Russell-like. The argument would be, why wouldn’t you keep him where he is when he does such a positive job.” Morgan downplayed ‘impact’ player Sunil Narine’s failures as an opener. Morgan, who scored an 18-ball 44 batting at No. 6, defended the decision to send him behind Russell. “When he (Russell) comes up, everybody shifts down. We went from a position of being behind the eight ball, because Delhi bowled well, to a position of strength and looking like winning it,” he said. Morgan said KKR should stick to the basics. “Going back and looking at the execution of our yorkers, wide yorkers, length balls, bouncers and being honest about how we did today and how we need to move forward and learn is important,” he concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tripathi-holds-out-hope-morgan/article32768601.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Capitals prevail in power-hitting battle||Kolkata Knight Riders’ Eoin Morgan (44, 18b, 1x4, 5x6) and Rahul Tripathi (36, 16b, 3x4, 3x6) turned a stiff chase into an exhibition of power-hitting, but their side fell 18 runs short of Delhi Capitals’ 228 in an IPL encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday. With KKR reeling at 122 for six, Morgan and Tripathi brought the team back into contention with a pulsating 78-run stand. Morgan was particularly severe on Kagiso Rabada (one for 51), hitting him for a hat-trick of sixes in the 18th over, after Tripathi had collected 22 off Marcus Stoinis in the previous over. However, Anrich Nortje's dismissal of Morgan followed by Tripathi's wicket in the final over bowled by Stoinis saw DC home. KKR suffered an early setback when it lost opener Sunil Narine in the second over. But Shubman Gill (28, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) and Nitish Rana (58, 35b, 4x4, 4x6) were unfazed and accumulated 59 in the first six overs. Rana was dropped on 27 by Amit Mishra off his own bowling, but the leggie made amends in his next over, getting Gill caught by Rishabh Pant. Andre Russell briefly entertained, hitting a four and a six off Rabada, before falling. Tings became difficult from there though Morgan and Tripathi did their best.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/capitals-prevail-in-power-hitting-battle/article32768702.ece
05 October 2020||Sharjah,||Playing hard and smart is Shreyas’ mantra||Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer doesn’t consider himself a “gifted player” and has attributed all those big sixes against Kolkata Knight Riders to the “hard and smart work” that he has put in. Shreyas hit 88 off 38 balls with six 6s and seven 4s in Delhi’s 18-run win over KKR here on Saturday. “I know the hard work and the smart work I have put in through my gym sessions, so I wouldn’t say I am a very gifted player,” Shreyas said at the post-match presentation. Satisfied “It was the right time for me to take on the bowlers and then rotate strike. Luckily, it worked. Really satisfied with the way everyone stepped up.” Capitals seamer Anrich Nortje (3/33) said they tried to exploit the conditions and focused on mixing up the deliveries. “We wanted to use the conditions to the best of our ability. There was a little bit of dew. Myself and KG (Kagiso Rabada) tried to get a few to go through. “It’s great bowling with him (Rabada), really enjoying the time we spend together. Trying to feed off each other,” he said. The 26-year-old from South Africa said they worked on their death-bowling skills ahead of the match in Sharjah. “We worked on our yorkers, we can still improve a little bit, but we were hitting them in the nets.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/playing-hard-and-smart-is-shreyas-mantra/article32768598.ece
05 October 2020||London,||Tottenham wallops shambolic United by tennis scoreline||A shambolic Manchester United suffered a club record-equalling defeat in the Premier League era as it crashed to a 6-1 loss at home to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Son Heung-min and Harry Kane each scored twice for Spurs while United’s Anthony Martial was sent off in the 28th minute as Jose Mourinho celebrated a stunning victory. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had taken a second-minute lead through a Bruno Fernandes penalty but Spurs responded quickly, taking advantage of some awful United defending as Tanguy Ndombele and Son put it 2-0 ahead. United went down to 10 men after Martial was sent off following a clash with Erik Lamela at a corner and then Harry Kane made it 3-1. Son added his second shortly before the break as United conceded four goals in the first half of a league game for the first time since 1957 — also to Spurs. Serge Aurier made it 5-1 in the 51st before Kane completed the rout from the penalty spot. Earlier, West Ham shattered Leicester’s unbeaten start with a surprise 3-0 win. In Saturday’s late night match, Leeds United fought back to earn a 1-1 draw against Manchester City. Goals from Michail Antonio, Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen ruined Leicester’s bid to win its opening four league games for the first time in its history. Scoring streak Papu Gomez extended his scoring streak as Atalanta crushed Cagliari 5-2 for a third consecutive win.  The result: Premier League: Leicester 0 lost to West Ham 3 (Antonio 14, Fornals 34, Bowen 83); Southampton 2 (Djenepo 41, Romeu 69) bt West Brom 0; Arsenal 2 (Saka 61, Pepe 64) bt Sheffield United 1 (McGoldrick 83).

05 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,||‘Stokes will change Royals’ formation’||Rajasthan Royals won its first two matches and lost the next two. The successive defeats, at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore, have put Steve Smith’s men on the backfoot. The addition of arguably the world’s best allrounder — Ben Stokes — could well lift the team’s morale. The Englishman, who is already in the UAE, is expected to be available for Royals’ match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 11 after he completes his quarantine. “Stokes will change the formation of our eleven,” Royals coach Andrew McDonald said. “We have to pick the right team at the right time. That’s the real challenge.” McDonald, however, ruled out changes in the top-order. “(We have) Jos (Buttler) and Steve at the top and Sanju (Samson) coming in at three,” he said. “The best players getting the most number of balls gives the best opportunity to win games.” McDonald said the side’s fielding needed to improve. “Just when we were building pressure against RCB, it was released by some poor fielding.” He said the players were putting in their best. “Sometimes there are errors and we have to minimise them in all three departments.” The Royals coach said Mahipal Lomror did a fantastic job against Kohli’s men. “We backed him to bat in the middle-order and it worked.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stokes-will-change-royals-formation/article32768595.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Yagna Varaha||The Lord takes the Varaha avatar to rescue the earth that is submerged in the depths of water. This happens when Swayambhuva Manu, who is assigned the task to rule over the earth and propagate the race by Brahma, finds the earth missing. Brahma then meditates on the Lord who alone can solve this problem and sure enough the Lord appears as a small boar from Brahma’s nostril and soon grows huge in size. Seeing the earth, Bhu, the support of all beings and whom He had sheltered in his abdomen at the time of deluge, now in Rasatala, the Lord enters the waters, roaring and grunting. He rises from the depths lifting up the earth on His tusks. Hiranyaksha fights with Him but is killed by the Lord. The word picture of this avatar that is described in the Bhagavata Purana through the vision of Brahma and the rishis is most amazing, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. It is not only precise in details of the size, colour, texture, etc of the Lord’s Varaha form but it also highlights His symbolic Yagna form. Brahma and the rishis offer salutations to Him, who is manifest as all mantras, all the celestials, all the ingredients of worship, as the entire system of sacrifices and forms of worship. They see Him as the very state of enlightenment and jnana attained through renunciation, vairagya, devotion and concentration, etc. The Earth resting on His tusks appears as a lotus plucked and held by a sporting elephant from the waters of a lake The rishis beseech the Lord to place aside the earth, His consort and the Mother and abode of all beings so that they can pay obeisance to both of them. The Lord is the Father of all and His infinite power is present in the earth and is the cause for creation to evolve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/yagna-varaha/article32768698.ece

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Influencing success||What are educators doing to ensure that students in Indian universities are ready to excel in the world outside college? The need of the hour is not only to focus on the intelligence quotient but also on the emotional quotient. Most students are unable to capture the different philosophies that drive expectations for academic excellence and ideal career pathways. Isn’t it the responsibility of educators to ensure that students receive the necessary resources to achieve what they are capable of? This is where mentorship becomes important. Mentorship is an opportunity to provide a student with the necessary academic and emotional support. Most colleges don’t have a platform to provide holistic mentorship to students. What does this involve? Content for learners Today, the resources that are part of classroom teaching are not enough for real-world requirements. One solution is to have a platform that gives access to “quality” content by top faculty across universities. This will enable students from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges to get such content and also teach students various other skills that will also make them job ready. Career guidance How many actually know which career path to pursue when they enter college? Some get some guidance from family members, others find mentors in seniors and teachers, but most are clueless. Career guidance should be mandatory and personalised to each student. It should help learners decide which career paths are most aligned to their interests and guide them to achieve a defined goal. This should be continuous rather than one-stop. A student’s career goal is evolutionary and a good mentor can assist him/her with his/her professional evolution. So, chalking out an end-to-end path, developing milestones and keeping it flexible can help one land his/her dream job/university. Psychological support Students face many challenges including academic pressure, relationship issues, parental pressure, ragging, cyber bullying ... all of which affect their mental health. Unfortunately, most people are not willing to seek help because of the stigma attached as well as the lack of psychological support systems in schools and colleges. One way to resolve this is to have tech-enabled solutions since there will not be a need for the counsellor to be physically present and to maintain anonymity. Equally important is to conduct awareness drives to sensitise people towards mental health issues. Students need to know how important it is to seek help and not ignore their mental well being. Skills enhancement The current job market needs people who have good leadership skills, enhanced soft skills and are capable of innovating. Universities provide opportunities in the form of clubs, activities and managing fests but soft skills training also needs to focus on developing empathy. These skills can be mapped in the initial months of undergraduate study, and periodic checks conducted to see if it is developing as planned or if any amendments are required. This may take time and effort but will be an immense boost to the students’ performance. Connecting recruiters and candidates Many colleges still do not have a formal placement process. Even in on-campus recruitment, students are generally not aware about all companies. Ideally, they should be made aware of all possible options to empower them to select the firm of their choice. What is required here is recruiter and candidate mapping. Technology can help with this and make the recruitment process easier and more effective, both for companies and students. Colleges should invest in mentoring relationships so that all students benefit from it. It is time to develop customised solutions for students that cater not just to their academic requirements but also offer career guidance, psychological and emotional support, and soft skill enhancement. A complete mentorship approach should take the students’ individual qualities and interests into account and help them grow in a holistic manner.  Disclaimer: The views expressed here are personal.

05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||The right pitch||Every sound holds a meaning and adds an emotional quotient to a visual experience. It impacts us on a primitive and subconscious level. According to the well-known film editor Paul Hirsch, “Sound is the key... If the track makes sense, you can do almost anything visually.” Over time, consumers have also understood the importance of sound. With music and audio becoming important, there is a huge demand for quality content, whether it is movies, games, songs or anything else consumed digitally. This has also led brands to focus attention on developing enhanced audio technologies. What is sound designing? The art of sound designing helps content creators generate an emotion, or make a presence felt, even when it is not visible on the screen. Sound designing and mixing can be used across disciplines like filmmaking, television production, theatre, live performance, video game development, sound recording and reproduction, post-production, radio and musical instrument development. Sound designing not only involves editing and enhancing previously recorded content like dialogues or songs, but also includes the process of creating sound from a scratch. A sound designer plays a crucial role in bringing the elements together on the screen and uniting them through the art of sound. This is different from sound engineering, which emphasises the complex systems related to recording, creating and editing sounds and also producing multi-channel sound mixes, often using special software and equipment. A sound designer needs to develop his/her creative abilities to foresee and imagine a sound that will suit a situation and then create it through varied mixes. Therefore, a basic understanding of music and sound can be an added advantage. In case of sound engineers, a background in physics and mathematics is advisable, as they will be dealing with sound as an energy form and involved in calculating and converting sound waves into electrical energy along with various other technicalities. However, they too should have a creative mind to envision the needed sound situation. The study of sound design opens a career in creative fields where one encapsulates the emotion, atmosphere or message within a sound piece. A sound designer offers the viewer an immersive experience and transports him/her into the story depicted. Sound Engineering, on the other hand, opens up varied career options including studio sound engineer, audio engineer, live sound engineer, studio designer, mixing engineer, music arranger, mastering engineer, audio post-production, dialogue and music editor, location Recordist, Digital Media Entrepreneur, Sound Recordist, among many others. In India, many diploma-level courses ranging from six months to a year are available at institutes like the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune; Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute of India, Kolkata; Whistling Woods International, Mumbai; MIT School of Film and Television, Pune; Ramoji Academy of Film and Television, Hyderabad; SAE Technology College, which has various campuses; and Annapurna College of Film and Media, Hyderabad.

Those who can upgrade their knowledge and skills and explore new opportunities will keep the growth engine moving. This is the one of the reasons why many certification courses, professional degrees and skill development programmes are emerging in varied domains. One professional degree that has not lost its sheen is the MBA programme. While the stream one is from doesn’t matter, what is required to get into a top college is to crack the three-hour computer-based CAT and perform well in the second round. The CAT is more than just an exam; it is is a test of one’s persistence, composure, decision-making abilities, temperament, knowledge and resilience. Here are some tips for those planning to appear for CAT-20, apart from solving the previous years’ papers. Prepare to score well  Make a timetable and stick to it: Create a schedule based on the number of hours at your disposal. Give yourself daily and weekly targets i.e. number of topics to be finished weekly and number of questions to be practised.  Don’t do selective studying: CAT is about surprises. Any module can have more weightage in the exam. So, complete all the topics thoroughly; not just conceptual knowledge, but also application.  Enroll in a test series: Appearing for mock tests is crucial, as it streamlines your preparation and familiarises you with the test environment. It will help devise strategies on maximising scores, identify weak and strong areas, understand concepts and their applications and keep the preparation grounded. One can also experiment with strategies to figure out what works best. Ideally, a candidate should take 30-40 full-length mock tests.  Analyse mock tests : A detailed analysis will help identify what went wrong and what areas need improvement. Keep track of the performance across the mock tests and also make a note of all the good questions encountered.  Fitness is important: Keep yourself physically fit and mentally active, as falling ill can derail both the preparation and the momentum built up. Make sure the preparation is consistent and that the pace can be sustained.  Flexible approach: Don’t entertain preconceived notions or have a fixed mindset. A surprise element may throw you off track. The CAT is as much a test of character as of content. The writer is an IIT-Roorkee alumnus and co-founder of Kitabee.  Keep track of the performance across the mock tests and also make a note of all the good questions encountered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/self-preparation-kit/article32769204.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||When a student works from home||The COVID-19 pandemic has become the accelerator of one of the greatest workplace transformations of our times. How we learn, train ourselves, work, exercise, shop and communicate has changed dramatically.  Future talent hunt  The increasing spread of the virus has led to cancellations/delays in many exams and a shift to online learning. Even internships, which help students get practical experience and potentially land a good job after college, have now moved to the virtual world. Some organisations have chosen to honour their commitments rather than completely rescind offers, as they consider their internship programme critical to their talent pipeline. As major companies initiated tele-work internships, smaller companies have followed suit. Most have launched platforms by which interns can interact with other employees through chatbots or video calls, work on a wide range of tasks, take psychometric tests and access e-learning resources to expand their skills. While implementing such changes quickly is not easy, it is important, as it not only benefits the students but also enhances the company’s organisational value and image.  Here to stay  Once the threat of COVID-19 abates, organisations will hire people with advanced skills, knowledge and training. Hence this is the best time to invest in internships. With online learning likely to be a part of our lives, it is highly likely that virtual internships are also here to stay. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, organisations will need to work towards designing talent outreach programmes and innovate ways to conduct internships.  Flexibility and comfort  With internships being an important part of a student’s entry into a real-world work environment, organisations are looking at ways to have a fulfilling and holistic experience online. As people realise that a judicious implementation of Work From Home can be both productive and ineffective, the same may be applied to internships and thereby open up the online market even more. The writer is Founder and CEO, Talerang  It is highly likely that virtual internships are here to stay. Even in a post-pandemic world, organisations will need to work towards designing talent outreach programmes and innovate ways to conduct internships.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/when-a-student-works-from-home/article32769215.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Forming connections, forging friendships||While popular students may take the camaraderie and comfort of friends for granted, not everyone is able to forge friendships in adulthood. In an article in Psychology Today , psychologist Marisa Franco confesses that she was often lonely in college. Though she went on to author a book on the psychology of friendship later, she rues that, as a college student, she had “no idea how to form connections”. In fact, the naïve belief that friendships “just happen” can curb a person’s ability to fashion meaningful ties with others. First, know that making friends entails effort. Franco cites a study that found a correlation between loneliness and believing that forming friends happens by chance. Like all self-fulfilling prophecies, if you maintain that friendship is based on luck, then you are less likely to exert effort into cultivating relationships, thereby setting yourself up for loneliness. Overt vs. covert If you want to make friends, show up at group events. But, your mere presence isn’t going to guarantee making a friend. Franco discusses overt and covert avoidance, a distinction that author Ellen Hendriksen also points out. Not attending clubs or events constitutes overt avoidance. The subtler form, covert avoidance, entails not interacting with others during social events. If you are keen to make friends, then you need to take an active role and introduce yourself to others. But what if you feel diffident? Or scared of being rebuffed? Interestingly, our “perceptions of the social environment” is linked with our own behaviour. Franco cites a study that found that those who interacted with others in a classroom found the atmosphere to be cordial. On the other hand, those who didn’t mingle felt the classroom was cold. Franco offers a useful tip to avoid being misled by our presumptions. If you feel a group is unfriendly, ask yourself if you have tried to reach out. If your overtures are not reciprocated, then they might not be the right fit, and you can move onto befriending others. However, if you haven’t approached them, don’t wait for them to initiate contact. Franco offers one more suggestion that can help you get through the awkward initial phase when people don’t know each other. A study found that familiarity breeds affinity, even when participants don’t interact. If you keep meeting the same people regularly, chances are that with time they will grow to like you, and vice versa. However, ensure that you aren’t emitting negative or hostile signals, either explicit or implicit. To guard against this, reframe cynical thoughts with more salubrious ones. Reassure yourself that making friends takes time. Finally, give others the benefit of the doubt, especially when you are unsure of how to read a situation. The writer is the author of the forthcoming book Zero Limits: THings Every 20 Something should know. She blogs at www.arunasankaranaryanan.com  Our “perceptions of the social environment” is linked with our own behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/forming-connections-forging-friendships/article32769222.ece

Long before a pandemic was even on the horizon, NeoStencil (founded in 2014) set out to ensure that students from all walks of life could compete with the best in the exams like the UPSC, IES, GATE, NEET, and JEE among others. Kush Beejal, the founder, said that his brother and he were lucky to have been able to attend top coaching institutes in different cities as students. However, they also witnessed a lack of similar opportunities for students in tier-2 and 3 cities and villages. “Many people’s aspirations die because of lack of resources,” says Kush. “This led us towards the idea of creating a platform that could be accessed by anyone, anywhere, without spending beyond his/her capabilities. The point was that learning should not stop at any cost.” Thus NeoStencil began as a way to level the playing field for students from across the country. Kush says that, while the tools and technology such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are now key factors in online education, the content is even more important. The idea was to bring the excellence of top coaching centres and reputed teachers to the students. All that a student needs is an Internet connection and a computer or a smartphone. NeoStencil takes care of everything else — from study material to mock-exam evaluation. “We live-stream classes to ensure the student gets a high-quality current learning experience — identical to what they would get if they went to a classroom. There are also recorded classes that they can access at any time or go back to whenever it suits them. Students do not have to compromise on their jobs, the comfort of their home, or spend large amounts to relocate to ‘coaching hubs’.” Till date, NeoStencil has helped more than 400 people achieve their UPSC dream. Like Pradeep Singh from Tewri village in Sonepat, who topped the 2019 UPSC exams. NeoStencil also digitises material from traditional coaching institutes they have partnered with. An added benefit is that teachers can now reach out to both their regular offline students and hundreds of others online. Not only is the content available 24/7 but assignments, mock examinations and evaluations are also the same for both sets of students. Challenges and trends While technology is improving daily, what happens when Internet connections in more remote parts of the country are either non-existent or extremely slow? Kush says that, while an Internet connection is definitely needed, all videos are optimised for all forms of devices. To overcome issues with internet speed, buffering, data consumption and so on, they have begun to work with Edge Computing technology to help reduce buffering times and to allow users to watch high-definition videos at the same bandwidth they already have. Today, NeoStencil has about 11 lakh registered users from across the country. During the pandemic, however, many regular institutes too began to go online. Did this pose a challenge? Kush says that NeoStencil’s advantage is that they had already established themselves and could ride out this wave. “We often get students who want to pursue multiple exams. So we are a place where students have ready access to various products. This generates a lifetime value, which will win over an online institute that caters to a single exam.” During the initial months of the lockdown, the start-up doubled its partnerships to encompass 100 institutes, as compared to the 50 it had accumulated over the past five years. “One of the biggest trends amongst EdTech companies is trying to master blended learning,” said Kush. “While there will always be excellent online content, bringing that element of interactivity and peer-to-peer social learning to be on a par with offline learning is what companies are constantly working towards.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/learning-should-not-stop-at-any-cost/article32769209.ece
05 October 2020||October 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Develop the spirit of entrepreneurship||Globally, the world of business is changing at an unprecedented pace and newcomers barely have time to adapt to a new company or a competitive environment. The challenges they face include a complex corporate world, lack of experience, and theoretical education that is out of sync with the real world. Instead of being part of the problem, our education system can be a solution by making learning more engaging and hands-on by blending traditional business dogmas with real-world, practical experiences and challenges. There are numerous ways to improve entrepreneurship education, put degrees on the competitive map, and empower students for productive careers. Some of these are listed below:  Allow students to participate in entrepreneurship contests: There is nothing more experiential than letting students participate in contests that focus on a social cause or tech start-up ventures. For instance, a contest that pits groups against each other will encourage students to brainstorm and come up with unique and innovative ideas.  Focus on practical assessments: Case studies or practical assessments are an effective method to spur students’ curiosity and creative thinking ability. By studying corporate success stories and operational barriers, students can dig deeper into processes and strategies that lead to executive decision making.  Innovation is the key: Instead of relying on uniformity and discipline, our education system should focus on innovation, self-reliance, collaboration and innovation. We need to teach students how to apply their knowledge to do something out of the ordinary.  Incorporate technology into the curriculum: Given how technological change is disrupting all industries, educational institutions can jumpstart their students’ careers by teaching how companies are using these changes to innovate, communicate, and make money.  Promote internships: This will help students get hands-on experience in real-life situations and skills and learn from each other while solving operational challenges. To encourage entrepreneurship capabilities in students, educational institutions must focus more on practical, action driven, experiential and hands-on coursework. When we connect education and entrepreneurship, it teaches students to use their strengths to make an impact, analyse situations, evaluate alternatives, pick a solution, and track progress over time.

Flanked by farmer leaders at a press conference in Chandigarh, Mr. Yadav also extended support to a call by 17 farmers’ groups in Haryana on behalf of AIKSCC to lay siege to Mr. Chautala’s residence in Sirsa on October 6 on the issue of farm laws. In an obvious reference to the resignation of Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur from the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre over the controversial laws, Mr. Yadav said the farmers of Punjab had claimed a “wicket” in the very first over and now it was the turn of the Haryana farmers to take the second wicket. Posing the questions, Mr. Yadav demanded to know whether Mr. Chautala or his party had ever demanded any law or a change similar to the three farm laws and were they ever consulted by the Bharatiya Janata Party before or after the ordinances were brought in. He further asked whether the three laws were in any way connected to the lockdown and coronavirus, and if not, then why they were brought amid the pandemic through ordinances. Referring to the demand of the farmers to guarantee Minimum Support Price, Mr. Yadav sought to know as to why the demand for MSP was not guaranteed through law if these laws posed no danger to it. “Does Mr. Chautala support the manner in which the laws were passed in the Rajya Sabha? How the farmers would be benefited by the amendment in the Essential Commodities Act allowing hoarding? Have the companies been allowed to loot both — the farmers and the consumers?” asked Mr. Yadav.  Stance questioned Questioning the stance taken by the JJP over the three farm laws, Mr. Yadav demanded to know as to why the descendant of Chaudhary Devi Lal alone was defending the laws when none of the farmer leaders and organisations were ready to speak in their support. Asking Mr. Chautala to reply to the questions on October 6 to the farmers, he demanded to know as to why the Deputy Chief Minister was clinging to the chair when crop was being sold at a price lower than the MSP right under his nose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/answer-questions-on-farm-laws-or-quit-yadav-tells-dushyant/article32768937.ece

After the killing, a video in which the deceased, Shakti Malik, accused RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of seeking Rs. 50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest the poll from Raniganj seat and threatening to eliminate him if he continues with his good work in the constituency, went viral. The ruling JD(U) claimed that Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has exposed his true colours before the nation. Repeated efforts to reach senior RJD leaders for their reaction were unsuccessful. Police said that three bike-borne men entered the house of Shakti Malik in Purnea in the morning and shot him in the head while he was sleeping, killing him on the spot, and fled. A country-made pistol and an empty cartridge were found from the spot, K. Haat Station House Officer Sunil Kumar Mandal said. Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma and Sadar Sub-Divisional Police Officer Anand Pandey visited the spot.

05 October 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||Protection of community land sought in Odisha||Residents in Dhinkia village in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur district have opposed laying of pipelines by Indian Oil Corporation using their common land — a space earmarked for community use. A few years ago, villagers of Kharkhari Patharkata village in Dhenkanal district had lodged a complaint with public authority that their playground was demarcated as plot under Forest Rights Act. There were innumerable grievances against government which was accused of acquiring community land for creating land bank for future industrial use in the State. With community land gradually vanishing under development pressure, villagers in Odisha have understood the danger of community being stripped off the important resource and started protesting the move. While the environmental players are celebrating World Commons Week from September 30 to October 9 to reiterate the critical importance of commons in promoting rural livelihoods and sustaining climate order, experts have voiced concerns over growing pressure on community land. “Till Indian Oil recently started digging our 11 acre of village common land for laying pipeline, villagers had no information. Both company officials and government had surreptitiously planned to use village common land without seeking permission from us,” alleged Debendra Swain of Dhinkia. Dhinka villagers have registered a formal complaint with Jagatsinghpur district collector and sought immediate halt to laying pipeline. Similarly, Laxmi Tudu of Kharkhari Patharkata under Kankadahad block of Dhenkanal expressed surprise over handing over of football field as individual forest right under FRA while villagers were kept in dark.  ‘Industrial land bank’ The State government has created over one lakh acre land bank across the State for allocation to the industries after dispute over land acquisition proved stumbling block for setting up of projects. Villagers allege most of these land patches were common land. Common land or common property resources are meant for collective use of community. These land patches are either used as playing ground or grazing ground for livestock. Marginal farmers and landless people heavily depend on this critical resource. “While commons substantially contribute to rural livelihoods and also provide a range of ecological services, the benefits have largely been invisible,” said Sanjoy Patnaik of Foundation for Ecological Security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protection-of-community-land-sought-in-odisha/article32768939.ece
