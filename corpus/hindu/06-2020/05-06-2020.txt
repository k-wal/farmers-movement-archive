05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||India-China dialogue to focus on three areas||The first-ever talks between Indian and Chinese Lieutenant-Generals over the weekend to ease the tension on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will focus on eastern Ladakh with the aim of moving back to the earlier positions, sources said on Thursday. “The focus of the talks will be on the Galwan area, Pangong Tso and Gogra. The agenda will focus on the recent use of force, getting back to the positions before May 5 and subsequent de-induction of troops by China,” defence sources said. The General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Leh-headquartered 14 Corps will lead the Indian delegation at the talks to be held at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on the Chinese side. The delegation would also include officers of the rank of Major-General and Brigadier of that area and a translator. These are the first-ever talks at the level of Lieutenant-Generals, which shows how critical the discussions are, an official said. Pangong Tso is an important focus area as Chinese troops have taken positions in large numbers at the Finger 4 area. India holds one-third of the 135 km boomerang-shaped lake. India has always held areas in Finger 4, while it claims areas so far as Finger 8. Major scuffles have broken out in this area in the past and on May 5, which were acknowledged by the Army. There was at least one more major scuffle later in this area, the sources said. Galwan has never been an area of contention, and sources said this would be strongly conveyed to the Chinese delegation. India and China have identified 23 “disputed and sensitive” areas along the LAC and both Galwan in Ladakh and Naku La in Sikkim do not figure on the list. In the month-long stand-off at several areas along the LAC in Ladakh and Sikkim, Chinese troops have moved in large numbers into Indian territory at points in Pangong Tso, Galwan and Gogra in Ladakh and Naku La in Sikkim, besides the massive build-up on its side.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-china-dialogue-to-focus-on-three-areas/article31753101.ece

05 June 2020||MUMBAI,||Cut prices, clear building stock: Goyal||Union Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has reportedly asked builders to cut prices and clear unsold inventory by “selling at any price they get now, as things were not going to improve in a hurry”. Mr. Goyal was speaking at a closed-door online meeting organised by builders’ body National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO). He is heard saying in a video reportedly taken at the meeting, which has gone viral:“We are trying to see if some concessions can be allowed. If you don’t get [concessions] then you have to sell [the unsold apartments]. The rest is up to you. I cannot be more explicit about it.” The Minister is seen saying that contrary to expectations, the government was not going to provide a financial helpline that would enable builders to hold their inventory and then sell at higher prices, when the market improved. “Unless you reduce your rates, you are stuck with your material. You can choose to be stuck with your material and default with the bank and let the material go away, or you can choose to get rid of whatever you bought at high prices. You can think it as a bad decision or an unfortunate situation and move forward,” the Minister is seen saying in the video. He was addressing a battery of real estate tycoons, including developer Niranjan Hiranandani, national president of NAREDCO. Asking builders to be pragmatic, the Minister is heard saying in the video, “If any of you feel that the government will be able to finance you in such a way that you can hold longer and wait for the market to improve, the market is not improving in a hurry. Things are seriously stressed and your best bet is to sell.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cut-prices-clear-building-stock-goyal/article31753103.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC asks Centre, States to devise ‘common pass system’ for NCR||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Centre to meet Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana officials to devise a “common, uniform” pass system for inter-State movement in the National Capital Region (NCR) during the pandemic. Noting that the common man should not suffer, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the Centre and the three States should meet and decide in a week on a common pass system. “The petition says that in the NCR there should be one policy, one pass recognised by all the three States to avoid confusion, difficulty to common man... Convene a meeting of the States’ officials and endeavour to find out a common programme with respect to inter-State movement in the NCR,” the court ordered. Justice Bhushan said unless there is a common system in the three States, they would pass contradicting directives and the Centre’s guidelines on movement may become redundant. Gurugram man’s petition The court was hearing a petition filed by Gurugram resident Rohit Bhalla who alleged that “complete sealing of borders” within NCR and curbs on movement of citizens were in violation of the new guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The plea sought to declare as unconstitutional the measures adopted by the district administrations of Haryana and U.P., which allegedly restrict movement for permissible activities due to “blanket orders of sealing borders without reasonable exceptions”. Mr. Bhalla’s petition referred to the April 29 order of Gurugram and Sonipat districts in Haryana, and the May 3 public statement by the district administrations of Gautam Buddha Nagar and Ghaziabad in U.P. “Residents of the NCR who have family members or loved ones residing on either side of the inter-State border are facing harassment in crossing the said borders in cases of medical emergency and essential needs. There is no manner of expediting a pass for medical emergencies,” the plea claimed. It has sought directions to the three State governments of to set up a mechanism for movement passes , as per the MHA’s guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-asks-centre-states-to-devise-common-pass-system-for-ncr/article31753332.ece

05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||High Court to decide on SSC exams today||Confusion over commencement of the rescheduled Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams from Monday will be cleared by Telangana High Court today (Friday) by adjudicating a PIL plea seeking further deferment of the exams in the backdrop of rising COVID-19 cases. ‘Illegal and arbitrary’ A private engineer and social activist Ch. Mani Varun filed the plea requesting the High Court to instruct the government not to conduct the SSC exams. Conducting the exams even as COVID-19 positive cases going up was illegal and arbitrary. It amounted to violation of protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, he contended. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, after hearing the plea on Thursday, asked Advocate-General B.S. Prasad if the government wanted to go ahead with the exams despite more people contracting the virus with each passing day. The AG replied that the government was all set to conduct the exams. He told the bench that consolidated report of the precautions being adopted by the government to hold the exams would be placed before the bench. The bench decided to take a call on the matter on Friday after perusing the report to be presented by the government. Earlier, the High Court on March 21 directed the government to defer SSC exams after hearing a PIL plea challenging the government’s decision to conduct the exams while coronavirus was spreading. Subsequently, on May 19, the HC permitted the government to go ahead with the exams after it filed a counter affidavit detailing all safety measures it would adopt while conducting the exams. Delivering the order, the bench said the government should review COVID-19 situation on June 3 before going ahead with the exams. The government “shall be free to postpone the exams, if necessary, going by the situation then,” the direction said. The government decided to conduct the rescheduled exams from Monday. However, within days of its decision, a sudden and consecutive spurt of coronavirus positive cases was reported in the State. In this backdrop, the fresh PIL plea was filed praying for further deferment of the exams stating that it was risky for the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/high-court-to-decide-on-ssc-exams-today/article31753375.ece

Leaders of all religions endorsed the government view and offered practical suggestions. The State would place the suggestions before the Centre and wait till the guidelines were issued, he said. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president N. Vasu, who attended a session of Devaswom board presidents, said the board favoured reopening of temples, but strictly in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol.

Karnataka recorded four fatalities and Andhra Pradesh, three deaths and 141 fresh cases. Kerala also reported 94 COVID-19 cases, of which 84 were imported cases of infection involving people from abroad or from other States. Seven cases were among those in contact with known or unknown sources of infection. Among the three deaths, the case from Kollam was that of a 65-year-old patient who was brought dead to hospital and later confirmed to have had the infection. The test to diagnose COVID-19 was done as per the advice of the Medical Board. The other COVID-19 deaths were that of a 73-year-old woman at Palakkad, who had returned from Chennai and a 27-year-old Malappuram native who had retuned from Abu Dhabi. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed that the youth was being treated for blood cancer. Kerala’s case burden, mortality rate and disease transmission patterns changed after May 4, when the post-lockdown return of Keralites from abroad and other parts of the country began. On Thursday, 39 persons were reported to have recovered from the disease The number of active cases was 884. Of the cumulative 1,588 cases so far, there were 690 recoveries. COVID-19 cases in Andhra Pradesh rose steadily and on Thursday, the tally crossed 4,000. Local cases of community transmission and migrant returnees and people from other States were contributing to the rise. A staffer of KIA Motors India in Anantapur district tested positive after he travelled to the manufacturing unit from his native place in Tamil Nadu over a week ago. In Guntur, four new cases were detected in Christianpet of Tadepalli near the Chief Minister’s camp office.

05 June 2020||New Delhi,||‘Lockdown flattened the GDP curve’||A draconian lockdown flattened the wrong curve as it decimated the GDP and economy, industrialist Rajiv Bajaj has said. Mr. Bajaj was in a conversation with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, an edited video of which was released online on Thursday. On exiting the lockdown, the head of Bajaj Auto, the country’s leading two-wheeler manufacturer, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should allay the fears of people if the government wanted the ‘living with the virus’ strategy to succeed. Talking about the lockdown, he said India ended up with the “worst of both worlds” as it followed western nations such as Italy, France, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S. “On one hand, a porous lockdown makes sure that the virus will still exist and as you said, it is still waiting to hit you when you will unlock. So you have not solved that problem. But you have definitely decimated the economy. You flattened the wrong curve. It is not the infection curve, it is the GDP curve,” he observed. Mr. Bajaj urged the government to offer stimulus to generate demand and cited the examples of Japan and the U.S., where each person was offered $1,000. Mr. Gandhi said the world had not seen such lockdowns even during the Second World War. He once again termed India’s lockdown strategy a ‘failed’ one, and noted that the country was opening up when infections were rising. He asked why the government was not going in for massive injection of cash, and claimed that he tried to understand the ‘logic’ behind it. Mr. Gandhi said the government did not want to ‘spoil’ the workers by giving handouts as that would make them stay in villages, affecting India’s pitch as an alternative investment destination. “Later we might consider giving money to these labourers and SM businesses,” he quoted government sources as telling him. ‘Clear narrative’ Both Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Bajaj agreed that the government’s messaging created a scare about a high mortality from the pandemic. Mr. Bajaj noted, “I think we have fallen very short of disclosing facts, logic and the truth. And this has then got amplified and instilled such an enormous fear in people that people seem to think that the contagion is equal to a contagious cancer or something”. He said, “ I think that the first problem is to get this fear out of the minds of people. There has to be a very clear aligned narrative, I would say from the PM because, right or wrong, when he says something people seem to follow”. Asked about an ‘atmopshere of fear’ in the country, Mr. Bajaj claimed a friend advised him not to have a public conversation with Mr. Gandhi. “I shared with someone yesterday that tomorrow 12 p.m., I’m speaking with Rahul ... And the first reaction was, don’t do it. I said but ‘why not?’ Mat karna [don't do it, they said], this can get you into trouble,” he said. Last year, at an awards function where Home Minister Amit Shah was present, the industrialist’s father, Rahul Bajaj, talked about an ‘atmosphere of fear’ prevailing among the business community. Mr. Bajaj, however, said that he never faced any ‘repercussion’ for speaking out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lockdown-flattened-the-gdp-curve/article31753076.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||India-Australia meet strengthens ties||India and Australia raised their relationship to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” after a ‘virtual’ summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who concluded nine agreements including a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) and issued a joint declaration on a “Shared Vision for Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.” The two countries also agreed to increase the frequency of meetings between the two Prime Ministers, and took the “2+2” format of bilateral meetings to the level of Foreign and Defence Ministers, who will meet to “discuss strategic issues” at least every two years. The two leaders, who are expected to meet in person at the extended G-7 summit to be held in the United States later this year, spoke for more than an hour over a video link, a first for a bilateral summit for India. “Both India and Australia share a vision of a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific region to support the freedom of navigation, overflight and peaceful and cooperative use of the seas by adherence of all nations to international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and peaceful resolution of disputes rather than through unilateral or coercive actions,” said the statement issued in New Delhi and Canberra. ‘No talks on China’ The summit came amidst tensions between India and China over the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control, and Australia-China tensions over trade issues and differences over handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Ministry of External Affairs officials said there had been “no discussion” on China, and the two leaders had not discussed including Australia for “Malabar” or quadrilateral maritime exercises that would include India, Australia, U.S. and Japan, something that China has opposed in the past. “Both sides agreed to continue to deepen and broaden defence cooperation by enhancing the scope and complexity of their military exercises and engagement activities to develop new ways to address shared security challenges,” the joint statement added, referring to the MLSA which will allow both militaries the reciprocal use of bases, humanitarian and disaster relief cooperation, port exercises, and passage exercises. Other agreements announced included a framework arrangement on cyber technology, an MoU on mining and processing critical and strategic minerals including Australian rare earth metals used for electronics, governance, vocational training and water management. Mr. Modi said the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) took on new meaning at the time of the global pandemic. “The world needs a coordinated and collaborative approach to come out of the economic and social side effects of this pandemic. Our government has decided to view this crisis as an opportunity,” he told Mr. Morrison. Mr. Morrison said the CSP would raise the level of “trust” required to improve the “trade and investment flows” between India and Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-australia-meet-strengthens-ties/article31753083.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Disasters displace lakhs: study||India had one in five of all internal displacements caused by disasters across the world in 2019, mostly caused by floods, cyclones and drought, according to the State of India’s Environment in Figures 2020 report released on Thursday. Also, 19 major extreme weather events claimed 1,357 lives last year. There were more than 50 lakh internal displacements in India last year, the highest in the world. This refers to the number of movements, not people, as individuals can be displaced several times, said research and advocacy organisation Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which published the report. Flooding caused by the southwest monsoon led to 26 lakh displacements, while Cyclone Fani alone led to 18 lakh displacements, followed by cyclones Vayu and Bulbul. On the other hand, drought conditions in 19 States led to another 63,000 displacements. Apart from such forced migrations, many move for work. With migrant workers in the news due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, the report also broke down 2011 census data on migrant populations. There were over 45 crore migrants in the country at the time, with the vast majority migrating within their own State. In 2011, over 1.7 crore new migrants had moved for employment purposes, mostly from rural to urban areas. Shrinking forests The compilation also offers a snapshot of data on forests, water, waste, air, land, wildlife and other natural resources. It notes that there were 747 more tigers in 2018 than in 2014. However, the net area meant for tiger conservation shrunk by 179 sq.km. Forest cover has shrunk in 38% of districts, while five out of 21 river basins are now in a state of absolute water scarcity. CSE also publishes the environment magazine Down to Earth . Its managing editor Richard Mahapatra, in a foreword to the report, said, “Each data is a story. It will raise your curiosity towards a development and will help you understand its impact better.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disasters-displace-lakhs-study/article31753096.ece

Following a news report in these columns showing her attending an online class from her rooftop, officials of a private service provider came to her house at Areekkal, near Kottakkal, on Thursday and ensured that she got high-speed connectivity. Augmented facility The technical staff of the company set up an augmented facility at her house, which will ensure steady and high-speed connectivity on the premises. “I am happy I can now learn from the comfort of my house,” said Ms. Namitha. Her elder sister, Nayana, too, was happy about the positive response from the network operators. A picture showing Ms. Namitha on top of her two-storey house had made wide impact with a number of people sharing it. While many appreciated the positive spirit displayed by the student in circumventing hurdles, a few others used it to snipe at the government. Offers of help Sayed Abid Husain Thangal, MLA of Kottakkal, offered help to address the problem of poor connectivity. E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP, too, also contacted the family.

05 June 2020||Bengaluru,||Siddaramaiah says dissidents in BJP met him||Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has claimed that a few BJP MLAs in the State met him and shared their “dissatisfaction” over the functioning of the B.S. Yediyurappa government. Mr. Siddaramaiah’s comments assume significance in the wake of talks of dissident activity within the BJP following recent meetings by a section of senior party legislators over the selection of candidates for the upcoming Rajya Sabha and Legislative Council elections. He said some legislators had shared their discontent on the functioning of “ de jure Chief Minister” (Mr. Yediyurappa) and “ de facto Chief Minister” (Mr. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Vijayendra) in the State. “People say Mr. Vijayendra is working as the unconstitutional Chief Minister; we are not saying it. Mr. Yediyurappa is Chief Minister only for namesake, it is Mr. Vijayendra who clears things,” he alleged. “Several disgruntled BJP legislators met me and shared their discontent.” Participating in a function at Koppal on Wednesday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Congress would not interfere in the functioning of the BJP and the BJP government would fall on its own following discontent. Reacting to this, the BJP claimed that the Congress leader was indulging in “diversionary tactics” and there was no evidence to substantiate his claim of BJP MLAs meeting him. Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar said that in the past three months, he has never had to consult Mr. Vijayendra on anything. “Nor did Mr. Yediyurappa ask me to consult his son,” Mr. Somashekar said, adding that none of his ministerial colleagues had any such experience. Mr. Vijayendra has not interfered in transfers either, the BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/siddaramaiah-says-dissidents-in-bjp-met-him/article31753046.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Opposition, NDA divided on online House panel meetings||The Opposition and the ruling alliance are divided on the issue of holding meetings of parliamentary standing committees through videoconference, allowing members who can’t travel to Delhi to participate in them. Two key National Democratic Alliance constituents — the Akali Dal and the Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP)— support the idea, while two Opposition parties, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), oppose it. On Monday, Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla referred the matter to the rules committees of the Houses. The panels, headed by Mr. Naidu and Mr. Birla, draw members from all major parties. Confidentiality clause SP leader and chairman of the standing committee on Health Ramgopal Yadav said that at present it was far more critical to save lives. “The views expressed in a standing committee by the members and the officials are confidential till they are tabled in Parliament in the form of a report. If meetings are held via videoconference, the confidentiality clause can’t be maintained and this would mean that no government official will speak freely for the fear of their own supervisors.” The last meeting of the health committee was held on March 22 to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic. BSP floor leader and member of the standing committee on External Affairs Ritesh Pandey also called for a ‘foolproof mechanism’ to ensure confidentiality. Both the SP and the BSP had skipped the Opposition parties’ May 22 meeting. On the other hand, Akali Dal Rajya Sabha member Naresh Gujral argued that the principle of accountability could not be suspended just because there was no vaccine for COVID-19. “I believe, some way has to be found. If we don’t find a cure for Coronavirus, will we not have standing committee meetings?” he said. LJP president Chirag Paswan said there were far too many critical issues pending before the standing committees and their meetings should be immediately called. Meanwhile, a meeting of the standing committee on Information Technology, scheduled for June 10, has been cancelled, making it the second meeting to be cancelled in a week after the meeting of the panel on Home Affairs scheduled for June 3 was called off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-nda-divided-on-online-house-panel-meetings/article31753069.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘What relief is ultimately granted if interest accrues?’||The Supreme Court, in a virtual court hearing, reacting to RBI regulatory package, wondered what relief had ultimately been granted if loan interest continued to accrue for the moratorium period. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, sought time to consult the Finance Ministry. Justice Ashok Bhushan, who led the Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M.R. Shah, said there were two issues in the case. One, whether interest should be charged at all during the moratorium period. Two, whether there should be an accrual of interest to be paid by the borrower in bulk or at a monthly basis after the lifting of the embargo. The court scheduled a hearing on June 12. The hearing came a day after the RBI filed an affidavit in court saying it did not consider it prudent or appropriate to go for a forced waiver of interest, risking the financial viability of the banks it (RBI) was mandated to regulate, and putting the interests of the depositors in jeopardy. In its affidavit, the RBI was responding to a petition challenging the charging of interest on loans during the moratorium period. The RBI recently extended the moratorium till August 31. Senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, appearing for petitioner Gajendra Sharma, said the affidavit reflected that the Central bank placed “profitability of banks over and above public interest in these distressing times”.   The RBI said its regulatory package introduced amid the lockdown was “in its essence in the nature of a moratorium deferment and cannot be construed to be a waiver”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/what-relief-is-ultimately-granted-if-interest-accrues/article31753072.ece

The Ministry’s spokesperson said that out of the total registered number, 1,07,123 Indians have been brought back by a mix of non-scheduled commercial flights,ships and cross-border bus service from Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan and the rest will be brought back in the coming weeks.

In the Gulf airlift, Air India had brought back 1,76,000 nationals. The final count of Vande Bharat mission is expected to go higher, officials have said. Mr. Srivastava said out of the total number of repatriated citizens, 17,485 are migrant workers, 11,511 students and 8,633 professionals. “More than 32,000 Indians have returned through land border immigration checkpoints from Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh,” said Mr. Srivastava. The repatriation operation covers only those who register to return under “compelling grounds”. The third phase of the mission will be launched on June 11 and go on till the end of June. The third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission will evacuate 38,000 citizens from 31 countries in 337 commercial flights. 54 flights will take off from the U.S. , 24 will arrive from Canada, and 11 such flights will come from Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Seychelles, and Mauritius.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vande-bharat-mission-set-to-break-evacuation-record/article31753088.ece

Venugopal said on Thursday. He was responding to the statements of Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi. The death of the elephant after it ate a pineapple stuffed with firecrackers has made headlines across the world. Mr. Venugopal said any kind of mindless violence against wildlife was unacceptable. But Mr. Javadekar and Ms. Maneka Gandhi were “deliberately” using the incident to spread communally motivated false information. They were even dragging Congress leader Rahul Gandhi into the controversy. “This propaganda has proved once again that the BJP will stoop to any level to twist the facts for its narrow, divisive political purposes. It is shedding crocodile tears over the incident, and this divisive propaganda has exposed the BJP’s hypocrisy,” Mr. Venugopal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-giving-communal-colour-to-killing-of-elephant-in-kerala/article31753042.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||No action against employers for not paying wages: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday restrained the government from taking any “coercive action” against private employers unable to pay full wages to their workers during the COVID-19 lockdown. A Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, reserved its order on a batch of petitions challenging the legality of a notification issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on March 29, compelling employers to pay full wages to their workers during the entire period of the lockdown. The court said it would pronounce its judgment on June 12. The petitions, filed by the owners of small commercial establishments, industries, shops and factories, said the pandemic had already driven them to the brink of insolvency. Paying workers full wages with no work done would irretrievably send them out of business. The economy would fall flat. They said the notification was ill-devised and arbitrary. “You [the government] said everybody across the board should pay their workers 100% wages. Some of them [private employers] would be able to pay full wages, but many may not even be able to pay 25% or 50% wages... You have made such employers even liable to penal action,” Justice S.K. Kaul, on the Bench, questioned the logic behind the notification. “The problem is on the one hand, you want to put money in the hands of the industries and on the other, workmen cannot be abandoned. A balance has to be maintained... Some negotiations have to be held from industry to industry, from workmen to workmen,” Justice Kaul observed. Senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan, for some petitioner-employers, submitted that the global pandemic had affected all. “Let this not be considered a bonanza for some and ruin for others. Quash the March 29 notification and let parties start negotiations with a clean slate,” he said. Justice Bhushan questioned the government’s authority to compel private employers to pay full wages to their workers. “When it comes to governmental authorities, you can give such directions, but how can you force private persons,” he asked. Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal, for the government, said the notification was no longer operational and most workers had already returned to their villages. “The measure was pro-actively taken by the respondent to prevent perpetration of a financial crisis within the lower strata of society, labours and salaried employees... It would neither be in the interest of justice nor in public interest to adjudicate the validity of a notification which operated only for 54 days to mitigate the financial hardships of crores of workers and employees,” the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-action-against-employers-for-not-paying-wages-sc/article31753090.ece
05 June 2020||MYSURU,||Lockdown helps unite man with his family||When Pradyum of Rajapur village in Uttar Pradesh received a call from a stranger in Mysuru a few days ago, he could not believe his ears. Imagining it to be a prank, Pradyum asked for a video chat to confirm if what he had heard was true. As the person in Mysuru came online, there was disbelief and tears of joy on both sides. For, it confirmed to Pradyum and his family that their father Karam Singh, 70, who had gone missing four years ago from their village and was presumed dead, was alive. “It was the peak of COVID-19 lockdown sometime in April when the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) health officers Jayanth and D.G. Nagaraj approached us to take care of a homeless man living on the streets and accommodate him in one of the ad hoc shelters,” recalled M.P. Varsha, Managing Trustee of Centre for Rural Education Development and Innovative Technology of India (CREDIT-i), an NGO working on social and development issues. Initially, there was resistance because the temporary shelter for the homeless at Nanjaraja Bahadur Choultry opened by the MCC was already full. Yet, given the frailty of the person, the NGO decided to take him. With unkept beard and hair, it was initially presumed that the person was mentally unsound. However, closer interaction indicated no such sign though he appeared depressed, said Dr. Varsha. He was segregated from the rest and they heaved a sigh of relief when the test results proved that he had tested negative for COVID-19. The NGO used to conduct musical programmes for the inmates and it was observed that Karam Singh too would hum along. When given a mike to sing, he rendered a few old Hindi songs with flawless pronunciation and it was clear that he was from north India. After a week of interaction Karam Singh opened up slowly and one day saw Dr. Varsha wearing a T-shirt with an image of an elephant printed on it. “He immediately connected it to the BSP party symbol and said this belongs to our Mayawati,” recalled Dr. Varsha who was now convinced that Karam Singh was from Uttar Pradesh. After a few more days of continuous engagement, Karam Singh opened up a little more and recalled that he was from Rajapur village in Saharanpur, U.P. “He had left his village for Haridwar in search of a job and ended up doing odd chores and shifted places before ending up in Mysuru. He does not remember since how long he was in the city but the family members say he was missing since four years and they had presumed him to be dead,” said Dr. Varsha Finding himself in a strange place with a different language and no money, Karam Singh is suspected to have taken to begging for survival and lived on streets. That is until his rescue during the COVID-19 lockdown. Karam Singh will now embark on his return journey home to be reunited with his family. He will leave for Delhi by train on Friday and his children will receive him there on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lockdown-helps-unite-man-with-his-family/article31753155.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre launches internship scheme for 25,000 graduates||At a time of soaring unemployment and few prospects for new entrants into the labour force, the Centre has launched a scheme to provide internship opportunities with smart cities and urban local bodies for 25,000 fresh graduates, mostly from technical courses. However, there is no guarantee that these interns will get paid any stipend. “Students come for internships for the purpose of gaining valuable experience. It makes them market ready, after which they may go on to jobs in the private sector or elsewhere. It will give them multiple options,” said Hardeep Puri, Minister for Housing and Urban Development (MoHUA), when asked about stipend and employment possibilities for these interns. He was speaking at the launch of the TULIP (The Urban Learning Internship Programme) portal on Thursday. The scheme is a five-year joint venture between MoHUA and the All India Council for Technical Education, and the fulfilment of a promise made in the 2020 Budget speech. City administrations can register available opportunities on the portal, ranging from positions in urban planning or water supply and waste management to slum improvement and digital governance. Applicants must be Indian citizens who have completed their final year of college within the last 18 months. Internship durations can range from eight weeks to one year. “TULIP is founded on a value-driven pull strategy. For students, it’s about experiential learning that makes them ready for the job market or may help them contribute to start-ups developing solutions for ground zero India,” said Kunal Kumar, MoHUA Joint secretary who heads the Smart Cities Mission. “For city administrations, it is a valuable way to inject fresh energy and ideas into our urban governance.” The programme does not have any budget of its own, but the 100 smart cities and 4,400 urban local bodies can use the administrative expenses allocated by the Centre to pay stipends or perks, if they wish to. They are also free to develop their own selection procedures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-launches-internship-scheme-for-25000-graduates/article31753094.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Health Ministry lists measures after cases among staff increase||The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday issued a four-page memorandum listing out precautionary measures to be strictly complied with after it admitted that the Ministry was seeing a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases among its staff, along with a violation of social distancing norms at the workplace. The office memorandum said the entire premises of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at Nirman Bhawan (including washrooms, lift and staircase) would remain closed for thorough sanitisation on June 6 and 7, except emergency COVID-l9 team. The memorandum adds that all officials are advised to take care of their own health and look out for symptoms such as fever and respiratory problems. Mask must It has also maintained that wearing a mask is mandatory for all employees and that only asymptomatic persons would be allowed in the building premises to attend the office. “People should maintain social distancing at least one metre between them while walking or seating and queuing up for entry and inside the building premises... No meeting/conference should be done physically. Meetings may be organised through videoconference only,” the memorandum said. ENT high-risk group The Ministry has also identified ear, nose, throat (ENT) doctors as high-risk speciality and advised that tele-consultation be used as much as possible while walk-in patients should be discouraged. In its advisory to the group, the Ministry has said that all patients entering ENT OPD should be thermal screened to minimise exposure to staff and to patients. “Patients having symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 [whether ENT symptoms or respiratory symptoms] should be seen in a separate ‘COVID-19 screening clinic’ and not in the ENT OPD,” stated the Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/health-ministry-lists-measures-after-cases-among-staff-increase/article31753078.ece
05 June 2020||KOCHI,||23,182 instances of man-animal conflict in State since August 2016||A total of 23,182 instances of man-animal conflicts causing death or injury to people were recorded in the State between August 1, 2016 and June 4, 2020. The State paid a compensation of Rs. 29.39 crore in connection with the cases. There were 17,116 instances of crop raid by animals during this period while incidence of cattle lift stood at 1,214, according to data available with the State Forest Department. A total of Rs. 12.25 crore was paid to farmers by way of compensation for crop loss while a sum of Rs. 2.65 crore was paid as compensation for loss of cattle. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 514 people lost their lives in conflict with animals. Twenty-three animals too died in these incidents. Senior forest officials said that while the State had taken numerous measures to reduce incidence of man-animal conflict, there was no way this could be completely halted. Solar fencing was done along 2,413.7 km of forest area, elephant trenches were dug along 631 kms, and stone-pitched trenches were made over a six km area while concrete walls were raised along 178.13 kms as a defence against elephants in certain stretches and sanctuaries. This is apart from biofencing, hedges and crash guard rope fences done to prevent both animals and people living in the vicinity of forests from coming to conflict with each other. A senior forest official said that the SMS alert system, set up in places like Wayanad, Munnar and Aralam in Kannur to alert villagers on presence of radio-collared rogue elephants, was working well. The Jana Jagratha Samithis set up in panchayats and the Rapid Response teams of forest officials for turning back to forests animals wading into human habitation were also effective mechanisms, he said. Fencing animals “Whether we should construct a huge wall to fence animals in is a philosophical question. Animals cannot be contained like that and we should be able to approach the issue with a large heart,” says Surendrakumar, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/23182-instances-of-man-animal-conflict-in-state-since-august-2016/article31753442.ece
05 June 2020||MUMBAI,||Cut prices, clear building stock: Goyal||Union Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has reportedly asked builders to cut prices and clear unsold inventory by “selling at any price they get now, as things were not going to improve in a hurry”. Mr. Goyal was speaking at a closed-door online meeting organised by builders’ body National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO). He is heard saying in a video reportedly taken at the meeting, which has gone viral:“We are trying to see if some concessions can be allowed. If you don’t get [concessions] then you have to sell [the unsold apartments]. The rest is up to you. I cannot be more explicit about it.” The Minister is seen saying that contrary to expectations, the government was not going to provide a financial helpline that would enable builders to hold their inventory and then sell at higher prices, when the market improved. “Unless you reduce your rates, you are stuck with your material. You can choose to be stuck with your material and default with the bank and let the material go away, or you can choose to get rid of whatever you bought at high prices. You can think it as a bad decision or an unfortunate situation and move forward,” the Minister is seen saying in the video. He was addressing a battery of real estate tycoons, including developer Niranjan Hiranandani, national president of NAREDCO. Asking builders to be pragmatic, the Minister is heard saying in the video, “If any of you feel that the government will be able to finance you in such a way that you can hold longer and wait for the market to improve, the market is not improving in a hurry. Things are seriously stressed and your best bet is to sell.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cut-prices-clear-building-stock-goyal/article31753157.ece
05 June 2020||KOCHI,||24 unnatural jumbo deaths in Kerala in 5 years||Twenty-four elephants have met with an agonising end in the State during the last five years. Death has come to them in the form of bullet shots, electrocution, explosives and vehicle hits besides the infighting among the herds, predation, accidents and contagious diseases, say official records. Since 2015, the State has lost 416 elephants, according to a conservative estimate. The real numbers could go up even further, fear forest officials. Most of the pachyderms have breathed their last due to natural causes, including old age, during the period. The year 2019 saw 120 wild elephant deaths, 10 of them owing to unnatural causes, according to data available with the State Forest Department. The State is home to 5,706 wild elephants, as per the latest elephant census held three years ago. Wild elephants of Kerala have become a talking point nationally after the death of a pregnant elephant in a stream at Thiruvizhamkunnu, near Marnnarkad, in Palakkad district. The animal died allegedly after it chewed a fruit-laced snare set up by someone. Last year, six elephants died due to unnatural reasons, which could be linked to human activities, and two elephants fell prey to ‘deliberate electrocution.’ Six others died due to accidental electrocution. The reasons that led to the end of eight others remain unknown. The year also witnessed poachers finishing off an elephant, moving trains mowing down four, and seven others succumbing to contagious disease, say the data keepers of the department. The elephants killed 15 persons during the year and the State had distributed Rs. 95 lakh as ex gratia to the survivors of the victims. The year witnessed a payment of Rs. 3.03 crore as compensation for crop loss. Poachers had a free run during 2013-14 period in the State. As the guard was lowered and enforcement activities took a back seat, poachers gunned down 12 elephants from the Malayattoor, Vazhachal and Munnar forests.As many as 20 cases were registered in relation with poaching and 50 persons booked. One of the accused is still at large. The cases are in various stages of trial, said a forest official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/24-unnatural-jumbo-deaths-in-kerala-in-5-years/article31753444.ece

The “save public sector, save India” protests would be held on June 10 by BMS units in various public sector undertakings, a statement said. The decision was taken at a meeting of the BMS national coordination committee for public sector on Tuesday and Wednesday, with representatives of workers’ unions of the coal, defence, railways, postal, banking, insurance, steel, telecom, power sectors, etc. in attendance. “The meeting was held to decide the BMS’ plan of action against the privatisation process aggressively pursued by the Centre in different names in different sectors, such as the commercialisation of the coal sector, corporatisation of defence ordnance factories board and railways, strategic sale of PSUs, merger and privatisation of banks, insurance, increasing FDI cap etc.” it said. The agitation on June 10 would include day-long dharnas, protest meetings and campaigns at the unit level, it said. “The BMS is committed to fight until it stops the government from taking the anti-public sector and anti-worker decisions,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bms-to-protest-against-privatisation-of-psus/article31753062.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC rejects plea challenging Chidambaram’s bail||The Supreme Court has dismissed a plea by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to review its judgment granting regular bail to former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in the INX Media case. A three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi granted Mr. Chidambaram bail on October 22. The same Bench decided the CBI’s review plea in chambers, concluding that there was no “error apparent” warranting a reconsideration of their decision to grant him bail. The CBI argued in its review petition that the judgment contained errors apparent as it did not take into account the material placed on record to prove that Mr. Chidambaram, if allowed bail, would influence the witnesses in the case. On the allegation that Mr. Chidambaram would tamper with evidence if released on bail, the court in its October 22 judgment said the case was based on documents already in the custody of the prosecuting agency. Hence, there was no chance of any tinkering of evidence. ‘No direct evidence’ The court had referred to how the CBI had alleged in the High Court that Mr. Chidambaram and his son, Karti, had approached two material witnesses for their silence. The allegation was part of a sealed cover note handed over to the High Court. The apex court had agreed that this allegation surfaced only when the former Minister's bail came up. “CBI has no direct evidence against the appellant regarding the allegation of appellant directly or indirectly influencing the witnesses... There are no details as to the form of approach of those two witnesses either SMS, e-mail, letter or telephonic calls and the persons who have approached the material witnesses. Details are also not available as to when, where and how those witnesses were approached”, it observed in the October judgment. The three-judge Bench led by Justice Banumathi had refused to buy the argument made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that, across board, accused in economic offences should be treated as a “flight risk” and denied bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-rejects-plea-challenging-chidambarams-bail/article31753067.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Tablighi activity now a specific visa violation||The Union Home Ministry has included “indulging in Tablighi activities” as a specific visa violation that will attract a fine of $500. It has added a new category—“restriction on engaging in Tabligh activities” in the “general policy guidelines relating to Indian visa”. The guidelines provide details of 24 categories of visas and the various conditions under which they could be granted online or by missions abroad. Amended guidelines The amended guidelines read, “foreign nationals granted any type of visa and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders shall not be permitted to engage themselves in Tabligh work. There will be no restriction in visiting religious places and attending normal religious activities like attending religious discourses. However, preaching religious ideologies, making speeches in religious places, distribution of audio or visual display/ pamphlets pertaining to religious ideologies, spreading conversion etc. will not be allowed.” The $500 fine is also for other violations such as overstay of more than two years, visiting protected areas and cases involving both overstay and visa violations. The MHA had blacklisted 960 foreigners who participated in the Tablighi Jamaat event in March at Nizamuddin markaz (centre) in Delhi in early March. Till June 2, a total of 2,600 Tablighi foreigners have been blacklisted from entering India for 10 years under “Category A” of the Visa Manual 2018, a senior government official said. A foreigner who is blacklisted cannot get a visa from any of the missions to come to India. In 150 countries Founded by a Deobandi Isamic scholar at Mewat, Uttar Pradesh, in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat (Society of Preachers) focusses on ‘purifying’ the Muslim faith. It has a presence in 150 countries. In an interview to Aaj Tak news channel last week, Home Minister Amit Shah said the markaz organised congregations throughout the year and it was not a public event. “However, if the programme was stopped in time and medical help provided, then such a situation wouldn’t have arisen,” he stated. On March 21, the MHA asked the States to “screen, quarantine” and deport them if possible. All international flights were suspended on March 23 and the country was placed under a 21-day lockdown on March 24 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tablighi-activity-now-a-specific-visa-violation/article31753085.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Bring PM CARES Fund under RTI, says plea||A public interest litigation (PIL) petition has been moved before the Delhi High Court seeking greater transparency in the PM CARES Fund by bringing it under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The petition by Surender Singh Hooda cited recent newspapers reports of the PM CARES Fund refusing to divulge information sought by one Harsha Kundakarni under the RTI Act by claiming that the fund is not a ‘public authority’ within the ambit of Section 2(h) of the RTI Act, 2005. “The reluctance of the trustees of the fund in divulging information as to the management of the fund raises a profoundly serious apprehension since the fund has been set up to fight COVID-19 which a public cause,” Mr Hooda, who is also a practising Advocate-on-Record at the Supreme Court, said. The petition is likely to come up for hearing on June 10. The PM CARES Fund was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 28 and he urged all Indians to donate to the fund to help the country fight COVID-19. “After two months, the total corpus of the fund stands at approximately Rs. 10,000 crore and the amount has been so collected upon strength of prestige lent by the office of the Hon’ble Prime Minister,” the plea said. Mr. Hooda argued that the corpus had been created by donations largely from the Public Sector Undertakings, Central Ministries and Departments and even the salaries of armed forces personnel, civil servants and members of the judicial entities have been compulsorily donated into the fund. He contended that if the PM CARES Fund was held not to be a public authority, it needed to be examined as to whether the public authorities at the highest level could prompt the government agencies, public servants to contribute to the fund. “The victims of COVID-19 who desperately need funds to fight the deadly pandemic are spread all over the country and are not in a position to enforce their fundamental right of being treated and financially supported, by the use of funds collected in the PM CARES Fund,” the plea said, adding that the public who had contributed also had a right to know how the funds were being used.

05 June 2020||KOCHI,||Forest Dept. detains three for questioning||The State Forest Department has reportedly picked up three persons for interrogation in connection with the death of a pregnant elephant at Mannarkad even as online campaigns and tweets by celebrities and politicians have added new dimensions to the incident. The location of the incident, wrongly reported as Malappuram by some, has set the twitter on fire besides kicking off social media rage. Condemning the incident, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi tweeted that the incident took place in Malappuram. CM’s warning Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan took a dig at those who used the “tragedy to unleash a hate campaign.” Condemning the “wrong priorities” of some quarters, Mr. Vijayan said “lies built upon inaccurate descriptions and half-truths were employed to obliterate the truth. Some even tried to import bigotry into the narrative.” He promised that justice would prevail. In Palakkad The Forest Department clarified that the crime took place in Palakkad. “The place where the unfortunate incident took place falls in Palakkad district,” said the official twitter handle of the department. There was no conclusive evidence that injury to the lower jaw of the animal was caused by pineapple stuffed with cracker. However, this may be a possibility, it said. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala accused Ms. Gandhi of having “given a space for airing hate speeches abusing a district and all its people.” Surendrakumar, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, said the campaign that the animal was fed with explosives-laden fruit was baseless and wrong. It was a wild elephant and no one could go near it or feed it. It might have stumbled upon the fruit, kept in some farmland. Rewards would be offered to those who give solid clues into the incidents. Statewide combing operations would be held to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, Mr. Surendrakumar said. In his tweet, Ratan Tata said he was “grieved and shocked to know that a group of people caused the death of an innocent, passive, pregnant elephant by feeding the elephant with a pineapple filled with firecrackers.” Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli also shared his anguish in a tweet. Teams of forest officials on Thursday perambulated the fringe areas of forests of the Silent Valley National Park, Nilambur South, North Mannarkad, Nenmara, and Palakkad as part of the preventive drive. A probe into the crime was progressing and senior police officers are cooperating in it, said P.P. Pramod, Chief Conservator of Forest (Eastern Circle). Governor’s anguish “I have already taken up the matter with State govt. expressing my anguish. Govt. of Kerala is taking adequate & strong actions & those responsible for this abominable act will be brought to justice,” official Twitter handle of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said.

05 June 2020||PEDDAPALLI,||Investigation begins into Singareni Collieries blast||The Directorate General of Mine Safety (DGMS) and the Ramagundam Commissionerate of Police have launched parallel inquiries into the first-of-its-kind explosion in an open cast mine of the Singareni Collieries Company Limited, which claimed four lives and injured three others, at OCP-1 in Ramagundam-3 division on Tuesday. The DGMS officials and the police are probing separately into the reasons for the explosion, which includes the high temperature, poor quality of explosives, cellular phone radiation and negligence of the supervisory staff while using the explosives by a private contractor to remove over burden earthwork for the expansion of the open cast mine. In order to remove the boulders as part of the blasting process, the authorities had planned to drill at least 80 holes on Tuesday. They could drill only 33 holes, two to two-and-a-half metres deep, and filling them with hot slurry and fixing detonators. The explosive slurry got ignited in only one hole, maybe due to some spark or maybe because of hot temperature in the hole, sources opined. Luckily a major mishap was averted as the slurry (gelatine) carrying vehicle and other holes did not explode due to ignition, they said and added that it would have been a major disaster if the explosives in all the holes had exploded along with the slurry vehicle. It is also being alleged that the officials have not used thermometers to check the temperature in the holes to avoid such casualties.  The investigation teams have sent samples of detonators and explosives for analysis. The police suspect that the detonators were not of good quality and are collecting scientific evidence. They said that the explosives also have a shelf life and were collecting evidence to prove it. Suspecting that the radiation from working of a cellphone in the vicinity might have triggered the explosion, the police have seized mobile phones of those who were working at the explosion site. They were also probing the role of the officials in checking the use of slurry and other explosives during the blasting. Following a complaint lodged by the bereaved family members and trade union leaders, the Ramagiri police have registered a criminal case against the RG-3 General Manager, project officer, project manager, deputy manager, site incharge, representative of a private contractor under IPC sections 304 (A) 286, and Explosive Substances Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/investigation-begins-into-singareni-collieries-blast/article31753052.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Cut prices and clear building stock: Goyal||Mr. Goyal also says, “Those who have sold and are less leveraged or got rid of their bank loans have survived this downturn. Those who are saddled with large loans, who kept holding on to their prices, have suffered.” Commenting on the remarks, Mr. Hiranandani told The Hindu , “We must compliment Mr. Goyal for saying this. Even Mr. Deepak Parekh [Chairman, HDFC Bank] and Mr. Uday Kotak [President, Confederation of Indian Industry] have said this. It is for the people [builders] who have borrowed money from banks and sitting with the stock [of unsold real estate]. This advice is not for all developers.” Mr. Hiranandani said the provisions of the Income Tax Act are such that any sharp reduction in prices would attract heavy penalties for both the seller and the buyer. “As per the Section 43CA of the Income Tax Act, anyone selling below 10% of the ready reckoner rate or circle rate will be liable to pay a penalty of 35% of the difference [between the original and revised price]. The buyer will also pay a penalty of 35%. So, unless this Section is amended, no further price cut is possible because people have already cut prices by 10% in a year. So, we have requested Mr. Goyal to tell the Finance Minister to amend the provision.” Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD of real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank India remarked, “Developers are already dealing with mounting concerns over unsold inventory and liquidity. Most developers are struggling to maintain their margins and may not have too much leeway to cut prices further. At some level, the suggestion by the Minister to developers to lower prices is valid as it may help reducing inventory, though it may not be the most viable [option].” The crux of the problem lies in dwindling demand that the sector has been experiencing for the last few years, he said. “Therefore, the main solution will be in creating stable long-term demand by providing adequate boost to economic growth and stability. Any movement on ready reckoner rates, stamp duties and taxes will come as a further relief to help converting latent housing demand to sales. The real estate sector thus needs tangible measures to resurrect demand and ease the concerns of its stakeholders,” Mr. Baijal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cut-prices-and-clear-building-stock-goyal/article31753057.ece

The Central Information Commission (CIC) held an urgent hearing of the appeal on May 27 and ruled that the information must be uploaded on the CLC’s website within a week. The document now available on the CLC website gives State-wise data on stranded migrants, saying that there are a total of 26,17,218 across the country. Chhattisgarh had the highest number of almost 11 lakh, of which 8.6 lakh are in clusters outside workplaces and shelters. Kerala has the largest number in relief camps, with 1.3 lakh out of a total 2.8 lakh stranded migrants in camps. “The first step towards resolving a problem in public administration is to collect adequate information and data about the problem. The CLC’s action of demonstrating some measure of compliance with the CIC’s advisory is to be welcomed as a good start,” said Mr. Nayak. “However, there is no indication of when this data was collected and whether it is reasonably complete.” He pointed out that the Centre has said 91 lakh migrant workers have returned in trains and buses organised by the government, well after the CLC’s order, which counted only 26 lakh stranded migrants. The CLC’s figure of 88,852 stranded migrants in Karnataka is only a fraction of the 11 lakh figure for the State that was submitted to the High Court, he said. “I am hoping that they will be more forthcoming with such information in the coming days. However, if this is all they have managed to collect after the D.O. was issued, it is indicative of the inadequacy of existing structures to channel adequate information to the CLC in real time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/26-lakh-migrants-in-halfway-houses-data/article31753058.ece

However, there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mr. Mallya’s extradition can be arranged,” said the spokesperson. The nature of the legal issue is not yet clear.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Follow and then preach||Among the characters in the Mahabharata, we find men like Duryodhana who are ambitious, envious and unjust in their thoughts, words and deeds. We find characters like Sanjaya, whose very name means ‘he who has won in the right way.’ Sanjaya had conquered his indriyas and had acquired jnana. Among the most virtuous ranks Vidura. We must not hesitate to take the advice of a person, even if he does not have a high position. Vidura was the son of a servant maid, and yet he was virtuous, whereas Dhritarashtra, the king, was not, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. Vidura never swayed from the path of dharma, and Dhritarashtra turned to him for consolation. Dhritarashtra sent Sanjaya to the Pandavas, with a request that they avoid war. But because of the adamance of Duryodhana, it was clear that war was going to break out soon. Dhritarashtra knew the war would go against his sons, and he was worried. Moreover, when Sanjaya returned, an anxious Dhritarashtra asked him what Krishna and the Pandavas had said. But Sanjaya said he would tell about that in court the next day, in the presence of the ministers and elders. Dhritarashtra was sleepless, and sent for Vidura. He asked Vidura for advice. In the Mahabharata, Vidura’s advice to Dhritarashtra is covered in 450 slokas, and it is advice not just for Dhritarashtra, but it is advice for all of us, and has validity at all times. Vidura adhered to dharma and so was qualified to offer counsel. In the Rama avatara, the Lord adhered to dharma. Mareecha said, “RamO vigrahavAn dharmah - Rama is the embodiment of dharma.” In the Krishna avatara which comes later, the Lord talks about dharma. So, the Lord shows us the importance of keeping to dharma, before we preach dharma to others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/follow-and-then-preach/article31753087.ece

The court also observed that they must be sensitised to the need to use masks and gloves. Continuing to hear the public interest litigation petition filed by People’s Watch, a Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi observed that there was a need for a monitoring mechanism. While advocate Henri Tiphagne, representing the petitioner, argued that sufficient protective gear were not provided to conservancy workers, Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian said not all workers were using the protective gear. The court observed that the State must not only ensure that protective gear were given to conservancy workers, but also see to it that they were being used by them in view of COVID-19 pandemic. The court said sanitary supervisors should inspect and submit reports to sanitary officers of the zones concerned. Assistant City Health Officer of Madurai Corporation S. Vinoth Raja submitted that 5,300 conservancy workers were engaged by the civic body. He said it was essential to use personal protective equipment in containment zones and outside these zones it was not required.

We have also achieved 30% of the peak requirement of 10,000 beds at COVID-19 health centres. The city needs 10,000 beds in its tertiary care hospitals during the peak.

05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry CM goes on appeal in free rice distribution case||The Madras High Court on Thursday sought the response of the Centre to a writ appeal preferred by Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy against the dismissal of his writ petition for permitting distribution of free rice as against Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi’s decision to disburse cash to ration cardholders. First Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy ordered notices returnable by July 23 to the Centre, L-G as well as the Assembly Secretary. The order was passed after Additional Solicitor General (ASG) G. Rajagopalan sought time to file a detailed counter. The ASG told the Bench that the judgement under challenge before it was passed by a single judge on February 21. However, now, the Centre had permitted distribution of rice to the family cardholders in Puducherry for three months in view of COVID-19. Hence the appeal could be heard after two months, he said. On the other hand, senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, representing the Chief Minister, recalled that, on March 11 this year, another Bench comprising the Chief Justice and Justice Subramonium Prasad (since transferred to the Delhi High Court) had delivered an elaborate verdict on the role of the L-G and the elected government in Puducherry. In that verdict, it was stated that “the Central Government, through the Home Ministry and under orders of the President of India, exercises a referral role to umpire a decision in the event the Administrator (L-G) makes a reference as per the 1963 Rules (of Business of the Government of Puducherry) for its decision. “Such a decision should rest on a sound foundation based on objective material and a rational subjective satisfaction recording a firm opinion.” However, on the present dispute between the elected government and the L-G over distribution of rice or cash to ration cardholders, the Centre had passed a single line cryptic order, the counsel claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-cm-goes-on-appeal-in-free-rice-distribution-case/article31753225.ece
05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. caps rates for COVID-19 treatment under CMCHIS||The State government has fixed package rates for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals empanelled under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS). A committee headed by the Health Secretary was formed to arrive at package rates for empanelled private hospitals under CMCHIS. The committee fixed the package rates to be granted to these hospitals by the government under the scheme, and submitted its report, outlining a few conditions. The government, after looking into the recommendations, gave its nod for the recommended rates, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said in a press release. For asymptomatic persons and for those with mild symptoms, package rates for grade A1 and A2 category hospitals as well as grade A3 and A4 hospitals is Rs. 5,000 for a general ward.

05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cauvery Water Management Authority meeting on June 10||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), after being notified formally as a body under the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti in late April, will hold its first meeting through videoconferencing on June 10. The Central Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) will have its meeting a day ahead (June 9). The two events will take place a few days before the opening (June 12) of the Mettur dam, regarded as the lifeline of the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu, for irrigation. Sixth meeting After the establishment of the CWMA in June 2018, this will be its sixth meeting. As for the CWRC, it is the 28th meeting.. To be chaired by Rajendra Kumar Jain, who is also acting as the part-time chairman of the Authority, the CWMA meeting will see the participation of all the basin States — Karnataka and Kerala — and Union Territory of Puducherry. Secretaries of the Irrigation or Water Resources departments of the constituents of the basin are members of the Authority. K. Manivasan, Principal Secretary (Public Works) is the representative of the Tamil Nadu government. As Tamil Nadu received around 275 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of Cauvery water during the 2019-20 water year, which was about 100 tmc ft more than the stipulated quantity, it does not have much to complain against Karnataka. With the onset of the southwest monsoon (the most important season for the Cauvery basin) on the due date, the proposed meeting is expected to deal with general matters of interest to all the participants. However, Tamil Nadu, in the meeting, may reiterate its stand against proposals of Karnataka such as the Mekadatu project. Comfortable storage It is because of the excess flow of the Cauvery water and relatively moderate rainfall during the northeast monsoon (October-December) in 2019 that the dam is now having a comfortable storage. After a gap of 12 years, the dam is getting opened on the customary date. It is after an interval of nine years, the opening is happening in June. Meanwhile, officials in charge of the Public Works and Rural Development & Panchayat Raj Departments are making attempts to ensure that channels of different categories and other water courses are made free of silt and other obstruction. These works are being executed essentially through the State government’s special scheme for desilting and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). In addition, the “Kudimaramathu” scheme is in progress. Even though the date of opening of the Mettur dam is only a week away, the authorities have programmed the execution of the works in anticipation of the period of water flow. For example, at the tail of the Cauvery system — say in Nagapattinam district — water is likely to reach only in the fourth week, beginning from June 22, and Pudukottai will get its turn of water in August, points out a PWD official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cauvery-water-management-authority-meeting-on-june-10/article31753294.ece
05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘For prisoners, phone calls not a right’||The State government on Thursday told the Madras High Court that Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict V. Murugan alias Sriharan was a Sri Lankan national and hence could not demand, as a matter of right, that he should be permitted to make phone calls to his relatives in London and Sri Lanka. Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Hemalatha, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan said that prisoners, in general, were now being allowed to make video phone calls to their relatives within the State since personal meetings with friends and relatives had been suspended to curb the spread of COVID-19. Such a concession was only a privilege and not a right, he said, and added that Murugan, being a foreigner, could not claim any right to make phone calls to foreign countries. However, advocate M. Radhakrishnan, appearing for the convict’s mother-in-law S. Padma, contended that every prisoner had the right to talk to relatives. Not in agreement with the stand taken by the State government, Justice Kirubakaran pointed out that Murugan and his wife S. Nalini, also a convict undergoing imprisonment for the last 28 years, wanted to talk to his mother Somani Ammal in Sri Lanka and sister Raji in London to console them on his father Vetrivel’s death on April 27. “When a father dies, the emotion is the same for everyone, be it an Indian or a foreigner. Just because he (Murugan) happens to be a foreigner, does his identity as a human being get destroyed? Does he get the status of an animal? What is expected of the State at this juncture is only humane consideration of the request,” the judge said. “No doubt, the convicts have committed a grave crime. What they have done is atrocious and for that they have already been undergoing imprisonment but we should also not become inhuman,” the judge said and adjourned the case to Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-prisoners-phone-calls-not-a-right/article31753245.ece

05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown triggers slump in demand for power in April||Tamil Nadu’s power demand crashed by 28.6% in April, as against the corresponding month last year, amid the COVID-19 lockdown which led to a decline in consumption by commercial and industrial establishments. According to data from the Central Electricity Authority, the State’s peak demand slipped to 11,398 MW in April from 15,972 MW in the corresponding period last year. The peak demand in March was 15,347 MW. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of factories in India and is a key manufacturing State with the presence of major automotive, auto components and other power intensive sectors. Other major manufacturing States such as Maharashtra saw a decline of 17.9% in power demand, while Gujarat saw a decline of 26.1% in April. The demand for power was expected to be revived with the relaxation in lockdown guidelines for certain economic activities and the increasing demand from domestic consumers with the onset of summer, India Ratings and Research said. “Power consumption by industrial and commercial users has drastically fallen in April and May due to the lockdown. Generation from rooftop solar systems were also at a peak during these times and had been put to use for those functioning under essential segments,” K.E. Raghunathan, former national president of the All India Manufacturers’ Organisation, said. In case of offices, the power demand might fall by 40-50% when compared to last year, as most employees were asked to work from home, Mr. Raghunathan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-triggers-slump-in-demand-for-power-in-april/article31753231.ece

Soon after the outbreak, the women took police permission and cordoned off their street and ensured that the stretch was clean and the people in their area wore masks. Thanks to women like them, Kannagi Nagar has transformed from a locality where, until a month ago, people roamed around without a mask, unmindful of the virus, to an area where 95% of the residents follow safety measures, including handwashing and social distancing. “We heard that one person in the locality was infected by COVID-19. The five of us blocked our stretch to prevent outsiders from coming in. We then kept water mixed with Dettol, turmeric and neem at the entrance and ensured that all the residents washed their hands before entering,” Ms. Mahalakshmi said. T.C. Karuna, former AIADMK councillor, said when cases started cropping up in Kannagi Nagar, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) began implementing containment measures. The GCC and TNSCB were regularly disinfecting the locality. “We identified 3,500 families without ration cards and provided dry rations to them,” said T. Padmanabhan, Executive Engineer, Zone 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kannagi-nagar-turns-model-locality-thanks-to-warriors/article31753207.ece
05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Source of infection yet to be established’||The Southern Railway has said that the source of COVID-19 infection among its employees is yet to be established. In a clarification seeking to dispel apprehension that the virus spread due to physical movement of files or proximity of the Zonal Headquarters/Chennai divisional office to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Southern Railway chief public relations officer B. Guganesan said that the Railways, being an essential service provider, had been involved in train operations even during the lockdown. The source of infection, in this case, is yet to be established. The spokesperson was referring to the report, ‘Dozens of railway employees test positive for COVID-19’ published in these columns on June 2. He said that the report gave an impression that some railway employees in the Southern Railway and the Chennai division tested positive for COVID-19 due to handling of files and proximity of the Southern Railway Headquarters to RGGGH. He opined that such an impression was probably not substantiated with statistics or official version. Mr. Guganesan said that the Southern Railway was in second position in the implementation of e-office in Indian Railways. Only a few files sensitive in nature were handled by a few persons. “In this case, whether the employees who have tested positive were infected due to the files is only conjecture. Among those who have handled these files and have tested, none have been found positive so far,” he said. The author of the report, S. Vijay Kumar, writes: The Railway Board in a letter dated June 1, 2020, sent to all zonal railways, called for correspondence with the Rates Directorate through e-mail only. It laid emphasis on adapting to the new normal in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and said that physical movement of files should be discouraged. The Ministry of Railways, in an advisory to the board’s office on containing the spread of COVID-19, stressed on the maximum use of e-file.  Whether the employees who have tested positive were infected due to the files is only conjecture B.

05 June 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Railways looks to operate three superfast trains in State||The Southern Railway is awaiting the green signal from the Railway Board for operating three additional special passenger trains in the State. The Railways administration has sent a recommendation to the Railway Board, seeking to run three special trains based on a request from the Chief secretary of Tamil Nadu to the Southern Railway General Manager. However, the Southern Railway is yet to get approval for running these trains. The Railways administration has sent a proposal for running three superfast intercity special trains, including services between Tiruchi and Chengalpattu (stops at Ariyalur, Villupuram, and Melmaruvathur); Arakkonam to Coimbatore (stops at Katpadi, Jolarpet, Salem, Erode and Tiruppur) and Tiruchi to Chengalpattu on the main line via Mayavaram (with stops at Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Thiruppadiripuliyur, and Melmaruvathur). A senior Southern Railway official, confirming the proposal for running the three special trains, said that the sanction for running these trains would be received shortly. Presently, the Southern Railway operates five special passenger trains, including the superfast Rajdhani Express from New Delhi to Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railways-looks-to-operate-three-superfast-trains-in-state/article31753243.ece
05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Upscale society’s request denied||The Corporation Commissioner rejected a request from the Boat Club Residents’ Welfare Association to place a gate to prevent entry of non-residents. Ravi Appasamy, association president, said pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, non-residents/outsiders were increasingly using the area for walking and jogging. “Their health background is not known and we don’t know whether they came from any isolated area. This is against principle of physical distancing,” a request letter stated. “In the above circumstances, we request you to permit us to install a drop gate and only permit the residents and their people,” the letter said. The association requested police to monitor the entrance. However, a top police officer said, “We have no power to do as they requested and directed them to approach the Chennai Corporation.” Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said the Boat Club residents’ understanding of COVID-19 containment was incorrect. “Residents have to be safe. But they cannot restrict the movement of people. The law does not have provisions for such special treatment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upscale-societys-request-denied/article31753216.ece

The stalls are being marked and made allowing for social distancing among vendors and buyers. This follows the request of mechanised boat owners, who wanted the government to ensure facilities for retail sales. M.E. Raghupathi, a boat owner, said that without a space for retail sales, the landing boats would not be able to sell their catch. “The department and corporation also need to take steps to open fish markets in the city. They must regulate these facilities to ensure personal distancing,” he said.

05 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Schools find new ways to collect fees’||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Thursday said that private schools are finding innovative ways to collect fees by joining hands with financial institutions that fund the entire school fees and later, parents are forced to pay them back in instalments with high interest rates. In a statement, he condemned the practice and alleged that private schools have tied up with financial institutions and are forcing parents to join these schemes. Mr. Ramadoss pointed out that if there are 1,000 students in a school and if the average fee per student is Rs. 50,000, the financial institution will pay the entire Rs. 5 crore to the school and parents would have to pay them back in 12 instalments. On the face of it, the scheme looks like it is beneficial to parents, however it is equal to the practice of usury, he added. Even though the financial institution charges an interest of 12%, parents would end up paying 19.72% as interest at the end of 12-month instalments and schools won’t bear the interest, Mr. Ramadoss said. He pointed out that despite the State government directive on not collecting fees, schools are adopting different methods and must be stopped. The State government should take strict action, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-find-new-ways-to-collect-fees/article31753220.ece

05 June 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Double whammy for textile mills as operations resume||Textile mills in the State, numbering over 2,000, are facing a difficult situation despite resuming operations — orders are less, prices have fallen, and export enquiries are yet to pick up. Tamil Nadu has almost 45% of the country’s spindle capacity and produces approximately 175 million kg of yarn a month. “With the mills resuming operations in the last one month, the average capacity utilisation is just 40 %,” said Ashwin Chandran, chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association. As the demand was low, yarn prices have dropped nearly Rs. 10 a kg in the domestic market, export enquiries were not high, and for the yarn supplied, the credit period ranges from 60 days to 120 days, he added. Some mills operated at 80% to 90 % capacity, only resulting in rising inventory. Of the total yarn produced in Tamil Nadu, nearly 40% was sold in the powerloom weaving clusters in north India, mainly Maharashtra. Weaving activities were yet to gain momentum in these clusters. Even in Tamil Nadu, where there were nearly five lakh powerlooms, the weaving clusters were operating at just 50% capacity. Hence, the demand for yarn was low. “We expect domestic demand to pick up only in August or September.” Retail sales for clothing should revive to create demand for weaving and knitting units. Only then would yarn sales increase, he said. Govt. intervention sought Mr. Ashwin appealed to the Union and State governments to come out with schemes to boost exports so that Indian yarn was competitive in the international market. However, the open end spinning mills were facing a slightly better situation. Although the 500-odd mills in the State were operating only at 30% to 40% of their capacity, there was demand for the yarn produced. That was because the market worldwide was better for hospital bed sheets and healthcare related products. The home textile units in Karur, which make these products, use the yarn from the open end mills, said G. Arulmozhi, secretary of the Open End Spinning Mills’ Association. The mills face labour shortage as most of the migrant workers have gone home. The demand should revive by the time the workers return, say the spinners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/double-whammy-for-textile-mills-as-operations-resume/article31753288.ece

According to M. Raveendran, president of Coimbatore Compressor Industries Association, the beneficiaries are asked to prepare and submit fresh Memorandum of Title Deposit though the Finance Minister said clearly that these loans should be disbursed without asking for any additional document. By asking again for MoD, the banks are linking the additional loan to the existing mortgage. And the units have to spend for registering the deed. Further, industries that have taken large amounts as credit already are treated with priority. But those who took smaller loans with no collateral or have moratorium are not getting the additional loan. S. Surulivel, president of Railway Suppliers Association, said the banks are sanctioning a specific amount but disbursing only a part of it. They are asking the industries to bring in the documents to disburse the remaining amount. So, the units are not getting complete relief, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-concerned-over-disbursal-of-additional-loan-amounts/article31753289.ece

The protest was against Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani, who allegedly was the person behind the arrest of those DMK men who questioned his corrupt practices, mismanagement of the municipal administration and water supply department and misused the law and order machinery to silence his opponents, east unit in-charge and MLA N. Karthik, north unit secretary C.R. Ramachandran and west unit in-charge M. Muthusamy said in a press release issued here on Thursday after a press meet. Of late, Coimbatore was witness to the Minister’s high-handed approach towards journalists, activists and opposition party members. The latest in the series of his assault on opponents was the DMK’s south unit in-charge ‘Thendral’ Selvaraj. The other DMK members who were in prison, allegedly at the best of the Minister, were farmers’ wing organiser M.S. Ramamoorthy, Kinathukadavu east unit secretary A. Durai, party member Kirthi Anand, 84th Ward secretary N.G. Murugesan and many more. The Minister misusing the law and order machinery to silence his critics made one wonder if there was a democratic or an authoritarian rule in the State, the DMK leaders said and added that the Minister’s knee-jerk reaction only showed his timidity to criticism. The DMK men would be protesting in front of various local body offices while adopting social distancing norms, the leaders added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-to-stage-protest-today/article31753265.ece
05 June 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Environmentalists want Vellalore tank protected||An environmentalists’ group engaged in waterbody conservation Kovai Kulangal Pathugappu Amaipu has urged the district administration and authorities concerned to ensure that the Vellalore tank and its surroundings are not misused and birds not disturbed. The group said its members had come across instances where places near the tank had turned haven for alcoholics. “I often find used, broken liquor bottles, plastic tumblers, used snack covers and other plastic waste when either I go there or take birdwatchers and children,” rued R. Manikandan, an office bearer of the organisation. “That is not all. I’ve also come across instances where bidi stubs had caused minor bush fire. This endangers sparrow, hare and other small birds that use the bushes to nest.” He said he had alerted the police and they had responded but it was too little too late. “Invariably, the police take more than half-an-hour to reach the spot by which time the alcoholics take to their feet.” Mr. Manikandan said anti-social elements approach the tank from either the north or south. From the north it was usually the locals and from the south it was usually the outsiders. And with the outsiders the problem was that they were they were taking women with them as well. The problem of people taking to the tank to drink had increased during the lockdown, particularly after the State government reopened the liquor shops but kept bars closed. While he would welcome the police reaction to be quick, he was looking at a permanent solution by way of posting policemen for at least six months or so or creating barricades to make it difficult to approach the tank or place CCTV cameras to nab the culprits or some such measure so that the tank’s ecosystem was not spoilt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/environmentalists-want-vellalore-tank-protected/article31753268.ece

Many incidents of cattle and livestock being killed by leopards were reported in Soosaipuram, Doddagajanur, Eripuram and Malkuthipuram villages located near the border for many months now. Field inspection by S. Sivakumar, Talavadi Forest Ranger, and team revealed that leopards from Karnataka use the forest stream to enter the State and use the defunct quarries as a hideout and hunt their prey. The department had deployed drones for surveillance, placed cages and also surveillance cameras for monitoring the movement of leopards. It was also found that wild animals started using the cultivated lands in Eripuram and Malkuthipuram villages as their hideout. The issue was taken up with V. Naganathan, Chief Conservator of Forest and Field Director, STR, and K.V. Appala Naidu, District Forest Officer, Hasanur Division and Deputy Director, STR, and cages were placed in the farmlands and crackers were burst to chase away the wild animals. As a move to prevent wild animals using the farm lands as a hideout, farmers in the two villages were asked not to cultivate banana and sugarcane crops for 500 metres from the forest area. “Villagers were also asked not to let their cattle or dogs roam freely during night as it may invite leopards to their place”, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-asked-not-to-cultivate-crops-in-areas-near-forest/article31753254.ece

The scheme, implemented by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD), is to supply 81.10 million litres per day of water to the Corporation which ensures 135 litres per capita per date for people in the city. Work began in 2017 and was to be completed by 2019. However, due to various reasons, 97% works had been completed so far while the remaining works, including providing house service connections, are yet to be completed. A senior engineer at TWAD said that due to COVID-19 lockdown, works were halted for three months and migrant workers from North India had left for their natives. He said that around 250 workers were being mobilised from Andhra Pradesh while another 200-odd workers were being mobilised from other States after obtaining permission from the district administration. “They are expected to arrive in the coming week after which works will be expedited,” he added. Service connections to 94,000 houses of the total 1.05 lakh houses had been completed and the rest would be completed in two months, he added. All the works would be completed before October while water supply to houses in the Corporation wards would begin in a phased manner from this month, the engineer said. The scheme is expected to be commissioned by the Chief Minister along with various other works that are being implemented by the Corporation under the Smart City Mission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/workers-from-other-states-being-mobilised-to-complete-water-scheme/article31753272.ece
05 June 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Transforming lives during lockdown||A couple from Chennai, who got struck in Erode during lockdown, has transformed the lives of 50 alm-seekers, homeless persons and workers by arranging jobs and helping many to give up smoking and alcohol. Naim Khan (39), a software professional from Chennai, visited Erode to take back his family and got stuck due to the lockdown. On March 25, when he and his wife Mahathaj Parveen went to purchase groceries, they found homeless and stranded migrant workers near the railway station at Kalaimadu Statue. “Initially, we gave bread and biscuits to them,” said Mr. Naim Khan, who then decided to provide food to them regularly. The couple started distributing food packets to 50 people which later went up. With the help of Shabber Ahamed, who runs a catering service at Nadarmedu, the couple supplied 520 lunch and 100 breakfast packs a day until April 25 when the Corporation asked them to stop distributing food packets and instead permitted them to shift 75 persons to the Corporation Elementary School at Railway Colony and provide them food. “They were provided food, clothes, bed sheets, essentials and kabasura kudineer, ” he said. Games were conducted to keep their body and mind fit. Funds were sourced from friends and colleagues, and essentials were also distributed to 835 families in the district with the help of volunteers, he said. Since many were addicted to alcohol and smoking, counselling was provided to them and the result was encouraging, he said. Fifty persons were given jobs in power looms, hotels and in constructions, while a few were selling snacks and ice creams in pushcarts. One person was given sewing machine. “We have planned to open a restaurant and six persons will be given job,” he said and added only after all the persons were employed, the temporary shelter would be closed and they would leave for Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transforming-lives-during-lockdown/article31753270.ece

Members said that Section 63 and 65 in the proposed bill says that State Commissions should determine tariff for retail sale of electricity without any subsidy “If implemented, farmers, powerloom owners and the common public will ultimately suffer as there will be no subsidy or free power”, they added. They said that farmers are facing problems, including poor pricing for their produce, and are unable to repay the loans, and they will not be in a position to pay the electricity bill. Also, two sections pave way for cross border trade of electricity for which electric lines could be drawn through farmlands. “Previous projects had already affected the livelihood of farmers and the new bill would have adverse impact on the farming community”, they added. Members said that though the Chief Minister had assured that free power supply scheme would continue, the State Government should pressurise the Central Government to withdraw the bill. They submitted the petition to District Revenue Officer S. Kavitha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdraw-draft-electricity-bill-demand-farmers/article31753256.ece

05 June 2020||KRISHNAGIRI/DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||Government employees oppose labour reforms||Members of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association staged a protest to press for their charter of demands here on Thursday. The members demanded the reversal of changes to the labour laws introduced by some States. The so called labour reforms included revision of hike in the number of working hours to 12 hours, cutting down minimum wages among others. The TNGEA has also alleged that the pandemic has been used as a ruse to roll back on wages, leave encashment, freeze on filling up of vacancies, freeze on withdrawals from the Provident Fund, travel allowances among others. According to the protesters, the recently unveiled economic package was of little use to the poor. The protesters also slammed the government’s proposal to disinvest public sector undertakings and those engaged in defence equipment production. They also condemned opening up of private participation in the defence sector. The members also criticised the State government’s move to increase the retirement age, which would cut down opportunities for the youth. According to the protesters, the COVID-19 crisis had led to a string of anti-labour, anti-people policies by the governments at the Centre and the State, posing a threat to welfare. Similarly, in Dharmapuri, protesters under TNGEA gathered near the district treasury on the Collectorate campus and staged a demonstration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-employees-oppose-labour-reforms/article31753258.ece

05 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Drop in pollution levels a boon for Gulf of Mannar ecosystems||The COVID-19 lockdown has had a positive impact on coastal ecosystems of the Gulf of Mannar, along Thoothukudi district. Limited industrial activities and human interference has reduced the levels of pollution, increased the number of fish species and density and has improved the overall quality of marine water, reveal findings by the Suganthi Devadason Marine Research Institute (SDMRI) in Thoothukudi. Director of SDMRI J.K. Patterson said that while collecting data for a State government project, the institute conducted a study between May 25 and June 2 to assess the level of plastic pollution during the lockdown along the coast of Thoothukudi district. There has been a remarkable reduction in macro and meso-plastic pollution levels at eight locations along the coast — Manapad, Tiruchendur, Thoothukudi Harbour beach, Inigo Nagar, Muthunagar beach, Therespuram, Vellapatti and Tharuvaikulam. The average reduction in the level of macro-plastic is 51.4% and that of meso-plastic is 28%. “This reduction in plastic pollution levels can be attributed to the absence of movement of people along the coast,” says Mr. Patterson. Coral reef fish Another major outcome of the study is the increase in the number of species of coral reef fish, from 89 in February to 96 in May, in the Thoothukudi group of islands of Gulf of Mannar — Vaan, Koswari, Kariyachalli and Vilanguchali. The average fish density has also increased by 22%. “Generally, fish tend to migrate in the summer due to high temperatures. But despite the high water temperature due to climate change and subsequent coral bleaching this summer, the fish population has increased, thanks to less human disturbance during the lockdown period,” he says. Usually, more than 300 fish-traps are illegally deployed every day to collect reef fish. These species are highly exploited as they command high commercial value in the market, he added. Fortunately, during the lockdown, the population of Scarus ghobban (parrot fish) has increased by 39%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drop-in-pollution-levels-a-boon-for-gulf-of-mannar-ecosystems/article31753228.ece

On Tuesday afternoon, K. Murugan, a fruit vendor, who filled a bottle with the leaking water, said at least he could use the water for drinking. V. Nagammmai, a shopkeeper, said many hotels, eateries and tea stalls had been fetching this water for their use. Ganapathy, a resident, said as tail-end areas did not receive water due to low pressure, people walked long distances to fetch the leaking water from the pit. At least, the water was put to better use, he said. Ms. Nagammai said if people did not fetch the water, it would form a small pool.

05 June 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||No more infectious habit||Contrary to a popular perception that COVID-19 lockdown would have led to an uptick in more people heading to lending libraries, it has not happened in a big way in Madurai. T. R. Surya Preethy of Jonathan Lending Library in K. K. Nagar, says only half the number of members had been coming to the library after it opened on May 11. “During summer, our members from even far-off S. S. Colony and Kalavasal come to pick up books. This time, though, not many are coming. Only those living in K. K. Nagar are coming,” she says. Usha Shenbagaraj, who opened her Dheepam Lending Library this week, rues that the habit of reading books itself is declining. “In the last two months, people were glued to their phones. Books, movies and television series are all available on the same device. This makes it difficult to sustain a lending library with very few members,” she says. When she decided to close the library on March 19, before the lockdown, and offered no fine for the entire period, several members came to pick up books. “Usually, books must be returned within two weeks to avoid fine. No one knew how long the lockdown could extend so many readers arrived. Now many are coming back to borrow more books,” she says. T. S. Govarthanan of Readabit.in says since their library was predominantly into book delivery, they have been successful. Home delivery “Last month, we added five new memberships. We have realised that delivering to home is the way to sustain the business,” he says. S. Swaminathan, advisor to Society for the Advancement of Library and Information Science, says it will be unlikely that public libraries would become obsolete due to COVID-19 but says that there might be losses. People who read Tamil books are still heavily dependent on lending libraries, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-more-infectious-habit/article31753523.ece

Some students also downloaded their hall tickets from the website on their own. Chief Educational Officer R.

While two face masks are earmarked for each student, one will be given along with the hall ticket, he said. Headmaster of Madura College Higher Secondary School M. Ravi said a few students from nearby areas came to collect their hall tickets on Thursday. “If the students are unable to come and collect their hall tickets over the next few days, they can collect them on the first day of the examinations as most of them will be writing the examinations at their respective schools,” said a headmaster of a school in Melur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hall-ticket-distribution-for-class-10-exams-begins-in-madurai-district/article31753531.ece
05 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai-Villupuram train timings to change?||The Madurai Railway Division is seeking feedback from passengers to change the timings of Madurai-Villupuram-Madurai special trains. The train leaves Madurai at 7 a.m. and reaches Villupuram at noon. It departs at 4 p.m. from Villupuram and arrives here at 9.30 p.m. Officials feel that the lower occupancy rate in the trains could be because of the timings. “It could be because, the train leaves a little early from Madurai and reaches here late,” a railway official told The Hindu . With limited bus services being operated, passengers may face difficulties in reaching the railway station from remote locations. Similarly, with TNSTC buses being instructed to return to depots at 9 p.m., those reaching Madurai junction will not find buses to go home. “We are seeking feedback from passengers to come up with timings that will suit their needs,” the official said. An option is to start the train late from Madurai and a little early from Villupuram. “We have four hours buffer time between arrival and departure of the train at Villupuram and that can be brought down,” he added. Meanwhile, after the special train started running on June 1, the need to reopen catering units at railway stations has been felt. After the Railway Commercial Department ordered reduction of the licence fee for one month to 3% of the quoted licence fee, one stall each was opened at Madurai, Tirunelveli, Dindigul and Virudhunagar. “The number of train services has come down from around 100 to 2. Tirunelveli and Virudunagar stations are served by only one train. Hence, the licence fee has been reduced as per Railway Board order,” the official added. Meanwhile, the All Railway IRCTC Catering Licence Organisation said with two train services, the licencees who were ready to serve the needs of the passengers were not getting adequate patronage to run the stalls. “We cannot pay even the salary to workers. We appeal to the railway officials to do away with the licence fee so that passengers get service and we manage with break even in business,” said its president M. Mohamed Akbar. He said difficulty in getting e-pass was also a reason behind the low patronage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurai-villupuram-train-timings-to-change/article31753534.ece

05 June 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Traders body challenge collection of user fee||A Kanniyakumari-based traders welfare association has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the authorities concerned to stop collection of user fees being levied on traders by a licensee, even though they were operating from temporary premises. The court was hearing the petition filed by S. Sunil, representing Kaliyakkavilai Thinasari Santhai Viyabarigal Nala Sangam. The petitioner said exorbitant fees were being levied on the traders. Mr. Sunil said the traders were operating from Kaliyakkavilai daily market. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic situation, the market was moved to the bus stand in order to ensure physical distancing norms. The main contention of the petitioner was that the licensee, who collected various fees from the traders at the public market, had also moved to the bus stand and started collecting user fees and other charges from traders and the public.

05 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Bail denied to poachers||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has dismissed the bail petition of three men accused of illegally venturing into a reserve forest in Kanniyakumari district and hunting monitor lizards. They are currently under judicial custody. Justice G. Jayachandran dismissed the bail plea of Kannan, Subash and Balakrishnan. The State had strongly opposed the granting of bail to the trio. The accused had illegally entered Boothapandi Reserve Forest, a biodiversity hotspot. The State argued that the accused had entered the wildlife sanctuary during the COVID-19 lockdown to hunt the animals and if they were to be released on bail, there was a possibility of their repeating the offence. Monitor lizards have been listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. Schedule I and part II of Schedule II provide absolute protection to the listed plants and animal species and offences against them attract the highest penalties. The accused have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Tamil Nadu Forest Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bail-denied-to-poachers/article31753524.ece

Maria Selvanathan, Headmaster, Sethupathi Pandithurai Corporation Higher Secondary School, said the students enjoyed the first session on Thursday. “While skill development programmes are common at private schools, it is a luxury for Corporation school students. However, those who do not have smartphones and internet connectivity cannot attend these sessions,” he said. Thoothukudi Corporation too began a similar exercise, launching a 10-day life skill development workshop for students of Corporation schools. A team of experts would train the participants online in drawing, oration in English, arithmetic, story-telling and other skills. As reopening of schools was getting delayed due to lockdown, private schools had started online classes for students. The Corporation, on its part, had started the online workshop in order to enrich life skills of its students. “The classes are being conducted between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. everyday to teach the students modern art, environmental science, virtual tour of zoological parks, history of Thoothukudi, oration in English, general knowledge, story-telling, time management, skill development and so on,” said V.P.

05 June 2020||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Social media helps missing woman reunite with family||More than two years after she went missing from her home at Arakkambakkam near Chennai, a woman said to be mentally ill and who was in a home for orphans in Pudukottai district was finally reunited with her family. Social media was the tool which paved the way for the family of the missing woman in getting to know about her whereabouts eventually leading to an emotional reunion here on Wednesday. Shanthi- a widow left her home in March 2018 and went missing thereafter. With frantic search on the lookout for Shanthi proving futile, her family thereafter preferred a complaint with the Muthapudupet police station in Chennai. The woman who was found wandering at Erode in October 2019 was rescued by a social worker who contacted V. Maheswari, the managing director of Nesakkaram Home for Orphans at Mettupatti in Pudukottai district as she knew her. “Shanthi was brought the same month by the social worker from Erode to our home and she was under our care and protection since then,” said Maheswari. “Repeated attempts by us to ascertain from Shanthi to know about her family did not succeed as the woman was unable to respond to our queries concretely as she was mentally ill,” Ms. Maheswari further said adding that the woman was taken to a psychiatrist in Pudukottai for consultation. Maheswari said Shanthi’s 19-year-old son Aravind contacted her in March after noticing a woman with striking resemblance of his mother while watching a video posted in the Youtube. The physical features and description given by the woman’s son over phone matched with that of Shanthi, said Maheswari. However, the family of Shanthi could not make a visit to the home since the lockdown was clamped by then. “Nevertheless, they stayed in touch with us over phone”, said Maheswari adding that she had asked them to bring relevant documents in support of proof and a photograph of the missing woman. “A couple of days ago, the woman’s son called us to say that they had obtained e-pass to come to Pudukottai. After verifying the relevant documents including the woman’s Aadhaar card and the First Information Report, her voter ID, her photograph and the Aadhaar card of Aravind, we allowed them to meet her,” Maheswari said. Shanthi’s son Aravind, and the woman’s mother and younger brother had come to take her. Shanthi could recognise her mother and her younger brother. The woman was reunited with her family on Wednesday after obtaining an undertaking from them, says Maheswari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/social-media-helps-missing-woman-reunite-with-family/article31753577.ece

Police sources said the trainee constable, Prema of Narayanadevanpatti in Theni district, actively participated in demonstrations in the past and even courted arrest on three occasions. It was also found that she identified herself as Kalyani and gave a false residential address at the time of arrest.

Raju said here on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said that since the State government had planned to open the Mettur dam on June 12 for irrigation, farmers had begun preparatory steps to raise paddy in the “kuruvai” season. Since, Mettur dam had sufficient storage, it was expected that area of cultivation would go up this year. The government was prepared to meet the credit and fertilizer requirements of the farmers. the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) had already begun distribution of loan and build fertilizer stocks. Interest-free crop loan to the tune of Rs. 44 crore had been disbursed to the farmers up to May 22. All eligible farmers would be disbursed interest free crop loan in delta districts including Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam. Mr. Raju said that the PACS had a stock of 29,889 tonnes of fertilizers including urea, DAP and complex fertilizers for the paddy cultivation in kuruvai season. The stock of urea alone accounted for 11,240 metric tonne. There would be no shortage of fertilizers as sufficient stock was being maintained. The officials had been asked to update the stock position on a daily basis so as to procure fertilizers well in advance. Needy fertilizers would be procured from the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Union and the Thanjavur Cooperative Sales Union. There were 697 Primary Cooperative Credit Societies in the delta areas. The officials were asked to achieve the crop loan target in each district by reviewing the crop loan disbursal regularly, Mr. Raju added. Earlier, accompanied by K.

05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Social distancing norms get thrown under the bus||With limited number of town buses being operated in the city, there appears to be overcrowding on some routes sending social distancing for a toss. Though buses are supposed to operate only with 60% occupancy, heavy rush could be witnessed during peak hours with passengers travelling even on foot board on certain routes. While buses operating within the city seem to have lesser crowd, those plying to the city outskirts and villages in the peripheries from where a large number of people commute for work and other purposes are often jam-packed. Buses operating to and beyond Somarasampettai, Vayalur, Pettavaithalai, Nachalur, Perugamani, Lalgudi, Thuvakudi, Inam Kulathur and some other places are attracting heavy crowd. The bus crew can hardly enforce personal distancing given the heavy rush as only 50% of the buses are being operated now. Commuters also complain of long waits at the bus stops due to limited frequency. “About 15 buses were operating from Chathiram Bus Stand to Pettavaithalai, Nachalur and other villages along the Karur highway. But now only seven are running and hence the buses are running full, leaving little scope for personal distancing. Following the relaxations in the curfew norms, more people are commuting to the city,” observed P. Ayyarappan, a road safety activist of Allur on the outskirts of the city. He emphasized that the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation should increase the frequency so as to check overcrowding. Conceding that more and more people have started their regular commute to the city from the neighbouring villages in the city, Kumar of Kavalkaranpatti, who works as a security guard in the city, said he had no option but to travel in the crowded town buses to go to work every day. “With my income of just Rs. 6,500 a month, I necessarily have to depend on the public transport. There are so many others like me who live in the villages around the city,” he said. TNSTC officials say that passenger traffic was fluctuating. “There was good crowd on Samayapuram and Manachanallur routes on Tuesday and so we diverted more buses on the routes on Wednesday, but the passenger traffic was not much yesterday. However, from Friday officers will be deployed at important points such as Vayalur, Samayapuram Tollgate, Jeeyapuram etc to monitor the situation and organise buses as per demand. We are trying to deploy mofussil buses on town bus routes during their idling time here,” a senior TNSTC officer told The Hindu . Expressing concern over crowds in buses and other places, a senior physician of the city observed that the COVID-19 situation seemed to be under control in Tiruchi so far but could take a turn for the worse with the heavy movement of people to and from the city. “Individuals need to be self-disciplined to protect themselves and others. Everyone must wear masks and maintain personal distancing and hand hygiene,” he observed.

05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Painting the school walls to attract students||School teachers of the Panchayat Union Middle School at Pirattiyur have pooled in money to paint the walls of their school colourfully. Though the school has got additional classrooms with a fresh coat of paint, the teachers decided to improve on it. The work, which was initiated during the lockdown included painting colourful cartoon characters for the primary classrooms, drawing portraits of freedom fighters and writing proverbs and morals. The idea was the brainchild of K. Asha Rani, Headmistress of the school, where students up to class 8 study. “This was the best time to do it as the children would not be around. The new classrooms were to be used from the upcoming academic year, and as part of the renovations, we decided to change the look of the school,” she said. Each classroom also has a painted chart of phonetic pronunciations of important conversational words. “We take an active interest in teaching our children to converse in English. Because of this, our children have won innumerable elocution competitions,” Ms. Devi said. The students of the school have become famous in the locality for speaking in English and have renamed the school “e-campus,” with the “e” standing for English. “All our subjects are taught here in English. Even though Tamil is our life, English is required by the society. The children are therefore taught to speak in English but to never forget their roots,” Ms. Devi said. The teachers have also had hoardings painted to promote the school on at least 22 walls in a five-kilometre radius around the school. The advertisement announces the achievements of the school to the reader, M. Ramesh Kumar, Vice-Principal said. The hoardings have brought at least 60 new enquiries to the school, which already has a strength of 250 students. “This year, we will increase our school strength to at least 500. If the private schools can market, why can’t we? Mr. Ramesh asked. The entire effort cost Rs. 30,000 and it meant that the teachers, especially the headmistress and the vice-principal went to school every day, even during the lockdown. “We have meticulously planned this and had to see it through,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/painting-the-school-walls-to-attract-students/article31753570.ece
05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Man from Chennai dies of COVID-19 in Pudukottai||A 64-year-old patient, who had been residing in Chennai, died of COVID-19 in Pudukottai and 19 persons tested positive for the virus in central districts on Thursday. The deceased was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital in Pudukottai with breathing difficulty on Tuesday. The swab and blood test turned out to be positive for the virus. He died on Thursday early morning due to “cardiorespiratory arrest, type II diabetes mellitus, acute cerebrovascular accident and right side hemiplegia.” According to the media of the Health Department, the maximum number of fresh cases in central districts was reported in Nagapattinam district with eight persons testing positive on Thursday followed by Tiruchi district with seven cases. Pudukottai and Ariyalur districts accounted for two each. Perambalur, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Karur reported no cases on Thursday. Of the seven patients, who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Tiruchi, six were from a same family at Kottapattu in Tiruchi. They had contracted the virus from a person, who was tested positive for the virus a few days ago. The 7th patient was from Uppilliyapuram in the district. In addition to them, according to sources in the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH), six persons from a family in Kallipatti near Manapparai had been admitted to the hospital after testing positive for the virus. Of them, four were female. A staff nurse working in the MGMGH, who had gone to her village about a week ago to look after her mother-in-law who had undergone a surgery in a Manapparai hospital, tested positive on return to duty. Following this, swab samples were lifted from her husband and 16 others of her family. Of them, six tested positive for the virus. All the positive patients were admitted to the MGMGH in Tiruchi. The village has been declared as containment zone. In Nagapattinam, five of the eight positive persons belonged to other districts and three to other States. All of them were examined at the check posts in the district borders on Tuesday and taken to the GH for further tests, official sources said. The number of COVID-19 positive cases undergoing treatment at the Nagapattinam GH has risen to 21 after the addition of the eight new patients, sources added. In Pudukottai, one of the positive patient was from Keelaiyur and other was from Pudukottai town.

05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown pushes transgenders further to the margin||The days when Latha danced nimbly with the ‘karagam’ pot balanced on her head are long gone. Today, the transgender folk artiste, in her mid-sixties, has lost the use of her limbs to a stroke, and lives under the care of a well-wisher in Tiruchi. “None of my transgender friends came to see me when I fell sick last year. I have a huge pile of medical bills, and I was getting by with alms and donations from strangers… the lockdown has stopped that too,” Latha told The Hindu . The stories of trans-women Mallika and Saroja, who had worked as folk artistes and then as vegetable vendors earlier, are similar. “I’ve roamed the city, looking for alms … there’s nobody left to support us,” said Mallika. Already on the fringes of civic society, ageing and ailing transgender men and women were overlooked even before the lockdown. Charity projects have held back the real empowerment of the community, say social workers in the field. “We can live on the free provisions for a few weeks, but what about the future? The transgender community, especially youth, needs proper jobs like everyone else. Begging and prostitution must not be our only avenues of employment,” said Kajol, a transgender woman entrepreneur and social activist based in Tiruchi. Kajol, who also runs a welfare organisation called Social Action for Emancipation (SAFE), said that the lockdown has seen many trans-people in regular jobs becoming unemployed overnight. “Transgender workers in restaurants, folk dance companies and factories were asked to leave when the lockdown took effect,” she said. Kajol has helped two young transgender women to start small roadside stalls selling fruits and juice in the Cantonment area, so that they can be role models to others in the community. “Many transgrander people have gone back to walking the streets and begging because of the lockdown. They are exposing themselves to COVID-19 with this kind of risky behaviour,” she said. As most transgender people don’t pursue education, their options in the workforce are already limited besides the social discrimination, said Kalki Subramaniam, trans-woman artist, activist and founder of the Pollachi-based advocacy group Sahodari Foundation. “We are encouraging our community members to use their creativity and make handicrafts that we can sell through pop-up stalls in schools and colleges. But the lockdown has stopped that for now,” Ms. Kalki said. Though she too is worried by the lack of government policies on caring for aging transgender people, Ms. Kalki said she hoped to establish a facility where young and old members of the community could co-exist. “Since we don’t have a biological family, this would be the best option,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-pushes-transgenders-further-to-the-margin/article31753591.ece
05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Unlock 1 has not buoyed up small industries||But for the partial restoration of public transport services that has made travel easier and hassle free for workers, the measures envisaging revival of economy during the COVID-19 lockdown have otherwise meant precious little for the small industries in the region. Though the current phase of reopening, christened Unlock 1, is purported to have an economic focus, small industries say there is absolutely nothing to feel happy about. For instance, the industries are not able to deploy their full workforce since the work orders are quite limited. “The workers continue to be engaged on a turn system, as there is nothing much to be done. The economic stimulus is not likely to happen until there is some extent of cash flow in the form of easy access to additional loan at less interest,” R. Ilango, president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association said. Last month, the Central Government notified the Rs. 3 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme for Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to extricate the small scale industries from economic distress. The measure was meant to facilitate small industries to secure an additional 20% of the loan outstanding from banks. Borrowers will have a one-year moratorium on repayment, and the interest rate will be capped at 9.25%. Small industries with over dues of up to 60 days are eligible to take these loans. However, what the industries look for at this juncture is a reduction in the interest rates for existing loans, and interest-free or nominal interest loans, along with a moratorium for repayment, in order to revive production activities in the real sense of the term. Till then, under-utilisation of the capacity was inevitable, Mr. Ilango said. It is still early to expect industrial activities to gather the desired momentum. Complete restoration of transport services is a requisite. For now, the operations are being carried out with manpower from the surroundings, said Kabir Ahmed, general manager of Five Star Industries at Mathur Industrial Estates in Pudukottai district. More than the manufacturing units in the MSME sector that have been functioning amid constraints of the slump in work orders from BHEL, the lifting of lockdown restrictions has helped units in IT and ITES sector to deploy maximum strength of manpower, G. Raveendran, General Manager of District Industries Centre, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unlock-1-has-not-buoyed-up-small-industries/article31753574.ece
05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Private school teachers look for timely disbursal of remuneration for valuation||The wait for remuneration for teachers of private schools who had been roped in by the School Education Department for valuation of Plus Two papers is likely to prolong as officials say they need to complete the valuation of Plus One papers as well. The School Education Department had reached out to several private schools for mobilising manpower for valuation of answer scripts. According to sources, nearly 50% of the manpower or even more are teachers from matriculation higher secondary schools. Teachers of private schools usually take part in valuation work to augment their income. Teachers are paid Rs. 10 for valuation of each answer script. Every teacher is given 12 papers in the forenoon session and the same number of papers in the afternoon session. Additionally, they are provided with travelling allowance. Though the work on valuation of answer scripts for the core subjects has been completed, the camp officers have not yet settled the amounts. They are yet to receive the cheques for remuneration from the government, sources said. The normal practice is to settle the amount once the valuation work for Plus Two is completed, a senior teacher of a government higher secondary teacher said, opining that staggered payment would be of help to the private school teachers to meet their daily expenses. “The delay in disbursal of money after completion of the valuation process may not be an issue for government school teachers. But, teachers of private schools had incurred substantial expenditure for taking part in the valuation work despite their critical financial situation. It is not fair to delay the wages for them,” the teacher said requesting anonymity. “I attended valuation work hoping for some remuneration and spent hundreds of rupees on travel, overcoming financial constraints. The delay in settlement of the valuation wages has agonised many like me,” a teacher of a private school lamented. Chief Educational Officer S. Shanthi said the remuneration for valuation of Plus Two and Plus One papers will be paid at one go on the last day. “There is no provision to pay the teachers in between when the valuation work is in progress”, the CEO said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-school-teachers-look-for-timely-disbursal-of-remuneration-for-valuation/article31753593.ece
05 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Man who tested positive detrained in Tiruchi||A Madurai-bound passenger on board the Villupuram-Madurai Intercity Superfast special train was detrained at Tiruchi Junction on Wednesday evening after health authorities here received information that he had tested positive for COVID-19. The 27-year-old passenger, hailing from Karaikudi in Sivaganga district, had come to Villupuram from Chennai by a private car and boarded the express train to Madurai along with his friend from Tenkasi. Samples from the passenger had been lifted in Chennai a few days ago and sent for testing to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. While the results were awaited, the man travelled to Villupuram by road to board the train and was travelling in the D-9 coach of the train, along with his friend.. Railway sources said as the train was on its way to Tiruchi from Ariyalur, the man received a call from the health authorities at Chennai informing him that he was COVID-19 positive. The health authorities also informed the government hospital authorities in Tiruchi, who in turn conveyed the information to the Tiruchi railway officials. Upon arrival of the express train at Tiruchi Junction, the passenger was detrained and taken to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital here along with his friend, in an ambulance. Hospital authorities said the passenger was subsequently transferred to Sivaganga Medical College Hospital in a 108 ambulance, along with his friend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-who-tested-positive-detrained-in-tiruchi/article31753525.ece
05 June 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Turn in fortunes for mechanised boat fishermen||Post-lockdown relaxation, mechanised boats are being allowed to venture into the sea on turn basis, but the decent catch on alternate days has enlivened the fortunes of fishermen in Thoothukudi district. After incurring losses in January and February, the fishermen appealed to the government to allow multi-day deep sea stay fishing. But it was instantly turned down by fficials. Upset over this, mechanised boat owners struck work in the first week of March. Then came the lockdown, which was clamped on March 20 and prevented them from resuming work. And the lengthy hiatus took a toll on their resources. After steel replaced traditional wood in construction of mechanised vessels, owners have had to switch over to high power engines. While these boats can be operated at relatively high speeds than those fitted with domestic engines and can go to ‘harvest areas’ in deep sea, they consume a lot of fuel. Boat owners have to spend about Rs. 1.25 lakh everyday towards fuel (around 1,300 litres of diesel a day), oil, food and other expenses. To Beno, a boat owner of Thoothukudi, if the catch brings in Rs. 2 lakh and above, it has been a profitable day. Else, he and his crew are in trouble. Besides bearing the loss, he has to cough up Rs. 1.25 lakh to foot the fuel bill and other expenses for the next day. “Hence, mechanised boat owners are seeking permission for multi-day stay fishing,” he points out. After regulation of fishing operations in the wake of relaxation, things are improving, he feels. At Thoothukudi Fishing Harbour, 120 of the 240 mechanised boats are being allowed to go for fishing in batches. Also, owners are getting a better price for the catch. For instance, a basket of white bait ( neththili meen ), weighing about 13 kg, sold for Rs. 4,500 on June 1 and 2. But the price came down to Rs. 3,900 on Wednesday. It was Rs. 3,300 in February. “My boat driver estimated the catch on June 1 at just over Rs. 2 lakh, but we made over Rs. 3 lakh,” Mr. Beno says. He attributes the increased profit to operation of boats on turn basis. Anto, a fish trader, endorses the view. “While a kg of barracuda, weighing about 750 gm to 1 kg, sells between Rs. 400 and Rs. 450, heavier ones fetch Rs. 550 to Rs. 600 per kg. Seer fish, a premium variety, sells for Rs. 750 to Rs. 800 per kg,” he points out. So, while owners are getting a better price now, the profit may come down when boats at Chitta Muttom Fishing Harbour near Kanniyakumari resume fishing on Wednesday, he feels. “It will be good for seafood lovers if the price comes down.” Markets in Palayamkottai, Kovilpatti and other places also reflect the latest trend. A kg of seer fish (large) is being sold for Rs. 1,400 and barracuda (Rs. 600-small). A kg of white bait sells at Rs. 360 in Palayamkottai. The fishermen now await the pricey prawn and squid season to begin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/turn-in-fortunes-for-mechanised-boat-fishermen/article31753515.ece

05 June 2020||Tiruvuarur,TAMIL NADU||‘Centre’s moves will hit farmers adversely’||The decisions taken at the recent Union Cabinet Meeting relating to the agriculture sector will ruin the financial status of the farmers in the country, said P. R. Pandian, president, Coordination Committee of All Farmers Association of Tamil Nadu. In a statement issued here on Thursday, Mr. Pandian said that the recent amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, the promulgation of “The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance” and the “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020” were brought with an aim to open up the agriculture sector for multi-national companies. But the provisions of these Act/Ordinances would affect the interests of farmers especially small and marginal farmers as the relaxation on the stock limit of essential commodities would encourage the middlemen to procure the produce at the lowest price available during bumper harvest periods and hoard the same to mint profit by creating a demand-supply gap later. Though the farmers have been given a free hand in fixing the rate for their produce in reality such a situation would only remain a dream as the Union government had already opened up the agriculture sector for contract farming. The Union government’s attempt to relegate its responsibility of fixing the MSP for agricultural produces by enacting such amendments was unacceptable, he said. Meanwhile, K.Venkataraman, general secretary, Tamil Desiya Periyakkam, has termed the Union government’s claim that farmers could realise better prices for their produce by selling directly to the traders and trading companies of their choice was nothing but a travesty. Pointing out that majority of farmers in the country were having landholding of less than or equal to 2 to 2.50 acres of lands, the TDP general secretary said such being the situation how could they be able to elbow their way to get a better price for their produce in a market already flooded with powerful middlemen. Further, the recent Cabinet decisions lead to the suspicion that public distribution system may be wound up, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centres-moves-will-hit-farmers-adversely/article31753584.ece

05 June 2020||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Solar dryers with 50% subsidy announced||Applications are invited from farmers interested to set up solar dryers with a subsidy of 50% to 60%. Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan said agricultural produce lost their natural colour when they were dried on ground or road. The quality further reduced on impurities getting mixed with them. Hence, the district administration had recommended that farmers use solar dryers, which would help the farm produce retain its quality and fetch better market price. The solar dryers would provide heat up to 65 degree Celsius and help the produce to dry faster. The shed provided for the dryer would also safeguard the produce from wind and rain and maintain the quality.  A shed with 400 square feet dimension can be used to dry one tonne of chilly. The freshly plucked chilly would be fully dried in two days by using the solar dryer. The shed could also be used for greens, vadaams, vathal and pickles. For a shed to be set up in the dimension of 400 sq feet, the cost is Rs. 3 lakh and for the shed of 1,000 sq feet, the cost is Rs. 7 lakh. The cost of the shed could be reduced without tray. The subsidy for the solar dryer shed is 60% for the small, marginal, Adi-dravida and women farmers or a maximum of Rs. 3.50 lakh. The farmers need to pay 50% or a maximum of Rs. 3 lakh. Interested farmers can approach the office of Executive Engineer, Agricultural Engineering on the Collectorate premises. He can be reached over 94432-12311 or the Assistant Executive Engineers -- Virudhunagar - 94865-20968 and Krishnankoil – 94980-24227.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Officials hopeful of bumper kuruvai crop||The agriculture department is confident of achieving a bumper harvest during the kuruvai season as cultivation is likely to increase by a little over 50,000 acres in core delta districts. Normally, kuruvai cultivation is taken up in around 3 lakh acres in delta districts with Mayiladuthurai (bifurcated from Nagapattinam district) and Thanjavur districts having more filter-point irrigation facilities in the Cauvery sub-basin below Grand Anicut, contributing to major portion of cultivation. This year, with water for irrigation from Mettur to be released on June 12, the extent of cultivation is likely to increase by 27,500 acres in the combined Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts where cultivation was taken up in around one lakh acres last season. Similarly, the department expects around 15,000 acres to be added to the total extent of around 92,000 acres cultivated in Thanjavur district last season. It expects an addition of 10,000 acres to the last year’s 82,500 acres in Tiruvarur district. Kuruvai cultivation is to be taken up in around 3.50 lakh acres in delta region and the agriculture department is confident of achieving a bumper harvest of around 5 lakh tonnes of paddy, Director of Agriculture V. Dakshinamoorthy told reporters here recently. Around 200 to 300 tonnes of TKM9 variety seed paddy has been procured and distributed to delta farmers, who prefer to tap the market for ‘red rice’ in neighbouring Kerala, he added. Desert locusts On the issue of desert locusts, special committees, headed by Collectors, have been formed in districts bordering Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The dangerous desert locusts normally move in the direction of the wind, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy pointed out. The locusts that have invaded Maharashtra and parts of Madhya Pradesh is all set to move towards Odisha. The Locusts Warning Centre set up by the Centre at Jodhpur has confirmed it. Farmers need not worry about reports of the presence of grasshoppers in large numbers in Vayanadu in Kerala and Krishnagiri district as these are indigenous species that do not cause any harm to the crop, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-hopeful-of-bumper-kuruvai-crop/article31753580.ece

05 June 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Commotion as crowd collects in front of Angadi’s office||The police had to resort to lathi-charge to control a crowd of poor families that was waiting to get foodgrains from Union Minister Suresh Angadi’s office in Belagavi on Thursday. Several hundreds, mostly women, gathered in front of the Minister’s office as, according to them, they were told by his staff that foodgrains would be distributed. However, the gathering went out of control after a few hours and the Channamma Pade, a team of women police constables, was called to the spot. The women police constables had to resort to lathi-charge to stop the women from pushing one another near the gate. Other police personnel dispersed the men who were waiting outside the gate. The Minister came to his office and distributed food kits to some people who had queued up. Others were told to come back later. This angered the women who argued with the officials as to why they were asked to come to the office and then were being sent back empty-handed. “Why were we called to the Minister’s office only to be sent back. This is the second time this fortnight that we are facing this problem. The Minister should not call us if he does not want to give us any foodgrains,’’ said Lakshmi Kamalapure, a weaver from Khasbag. “I would not have come here if our looms were working,’’ she said. Most of them were from Wadagoan, Khasbag and Lakshmi Nagar, where a large number of weavers reside. “We have no orders and no work. We don’t have enough to eat,’’ Jhareppa Jugul, a weaver from the city, said. He said that he had his family members had to hire an autorickshaw to come to the MP’s office and “now we are going back with disappointment,’’ he said. Mr. Angadi said that he had procured the kits from the Department of Food and Consumer Affairs in Bengaluru. He said that he would organise a similar programme to distribute food kits in a day or two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/commotion-as-crowd-collects-in-front-of-angadis-office/article31753360.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fall in demand brings down wholesale prices, but no impact in retail markets||The prices of most foodgrains and pulses have gone down in the wholesale market due to a drop in demand during the lockdown period, but consumers don’t seem to be reaping the benefits as prices in the retail market have not come down. For instance, a kilo of tur dal that was being traded in the range of Rs. 90 - Rs. 110 on March 15, days before lockdown, in the wholesale market was down to Rs. 70 - Rs. 90 on Thursday. However, the retail rates as of Thursday remained in the range of Rs. 120 - Rs. 140, which translates into a margin of around 40%. “Usually, the margin between the wholesale and retail markets is around 15%,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, indicating that consumers are not benefitting. The prices of most essential commodities, like rice, wheat, ragi and other pulses, have similarly seen a fall, but not their retail prices. Rajamohan, a departmental store owner in north Bengaluru, conceded that they were taking a larger margin than before, but defended it saying the lockdown had impacted their business and that they were trying to recover costs. “Contrary to popular perception, even kirana stores have suffered losses during the lockdown. The demand is less. Business has reduced from pre-lockdown levels, even as there has been relief on cost heads,” he said. While retailers defend their decision to not reduce prices citing lower sales, it is the fall in demand that has impacted wholesale prices. “There was some panic buying in April, and demand was good, but May has been very bad. The demand has fallen by more than half compared to the previous month while arrivals in the market are good, leading to a fall in prices,” said Mr. Lahoti. He attributed the fall in demand to distribution of free rations to a large section of the poor, closure of hotels and most eateries, and no functions being held. Mallige Sirimane of Karnataka Janashakti cited the rising number of poor, who find themselves without jobs. “They do not have money to buy essentials. Obviously, the demand for foodgrains has dropped,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fall-in-demand-brings-down-wholesale-prices-but-no-impact-in-retail-markets/article31753172.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Now, Karnataka has no Minister to disseminate information on COVID-19||Even as Karnataka is witnessing a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases, the initial zeal the government and bureaucracy displayed in disseminating information related to the pandemic seems to have waned. While the State Health Department has stopped issuing regular daily midday bulletin for the last two weeks, there has been no daily media briefing since June 1. Two months after taking up the responsibility of briefing the media daily on the spread of COVID-19 and other related developments, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar has excused himself from the task as he is “busy with preparations for conducting SSLC examination”. With this, for now, no Minister is in charge of disseminating information related to COVID-19. Mr. Suresh Kumar said he would request Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to assign the responsibility to someone else. On April 3, Mr. Yediyurappa had entrusted the responsibility of holding the daily pandemic briefings to Mr. Suresh Kumar. This was mainly due to lack of coordination between Health Minister B. Sriramulu and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar over COVID-19 issues. Although both of them were involved in surveillance and formulation of testing and treatment strategies, they made contradictory statements over the total number of cases and deaths. “Following this, the Chief Minister had to intervene by making Mr. Sudhakar responsible for COVID-19 affairs in Bengaluru, while Mr. Sriramulu was asked to take care of the rest of Karnataka,” sources said. The Chief Minister had also asked Ministers to refrain from appearing on news channels for panel discussions on COVID-19. “I have been personally monitoring preparations for the conduct of SSLC examinations during this pandemic. I visited 19 districts and will be covering the remaining 11 in the coming days. Hence, I requested Mr. Yediyurappa to excuse me from the responsibility of briefing the media and he obliged,” Mr. Suresh Kumar told The Hindu.  When contacted, Mr. Sudhakar said that he was not aware that media briefings were not happening and that he would speak to the officials on this issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-karnataka-has-no-minister-to-disseminate-information-on-covid-19/article31753180.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Poor and marginalised people lack money to buy essentials: Survey||A survey of manual labourers, including those in the agricultural sector, small farmers and marginalised and vulnerable communities in the State by Karnataka Janashakti reveals a bleak picture of how their lives have been impacted by the over-two-month lockdown. It also reveals latent anger against the government and bureaucracy among those surveyed over lack of adequate relief during the lockdown. One of the major trends is that people do not have money in their hands to make ends meet. An overwhelming majority – 82.29% of the 1387 respondents – said they do not have the money to buy essentials and run the house for the coming month. While 73.15% of farmers surveyed revealed that they haven’t been able to sell their produce, 77.88% of those who were able to sell their produce incurred losses. Just over half of the small, micro and medium farmers said lack of capital is the major issue they face today. The agriculture labour sector has reported joblessness as the major issue; a majority of them did not find any work during the lockdown. A majority of contract labourers, especially women in the garments sector, reported they had no work during the lockdown and only received partial payment at best for the period. As the living conditions of the poor and working class has been precarious, the survey reveals that relief from the government has not reached a majority of the respondents. While 52.34% said they received no help from the government during the lockdown, 44.27% said they got only foodgrains under the PDS scheme, which they termed “inadequate”. “There is latent anger among the people against the government, as over 90% of the respondents said neither elected representatives had come to inquire of their well-being, nor were the bureaucrats helpful,” said Mallige Sirimane of Karnataka Janashakti. Around 95% of the nomadic communities and over 85% transgenders, sex workers and Devadasis have reported that no relief has reached him. Further more, 62% of respondents among transgenders, sex workers and Devadasis reported health issues during the lockdown. However, the survey doesn’t reveal what kind of health issues they faced. A majority of respondents also expressed unhappiness with the government’s decision to re-open liquor shops during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/poor-and-marginalised-people-lack-money-to-buy-essentials-survey/article31753169.ece
05 June 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Subsidies land in farmers’ Airtel bank accounts||Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil on Thursday said that monetary benefits under some of the agricultural schemes that had been digitally transferred to farmers’ accounts had landed in their Airtel Payments Bank accounts instead of regular bank accounts in some instances, as farmers had not linked their regular bank accounts with Aadhaar cards. Addressing a press conference in Bengaluru, the Minister said such schemes included crop insurance claims and other farm related. Will issue notice “The digital transfer of money under these schemes would be effected based on Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries. In some cases, beneficiary farmers have not linked their bank accounts with Aadhaar cards. They would have submitted Aadhaar cards for getting mobile sim cards based on which the service provider may have linked with its payments bank,” he said. Taking exception to linking without properly explaining the consequences, he said the Agriculture Department would issue notices to the mobile service provider. It would also examine the possibility of proceeding legally, he noted. The incident came to light when 60 beneficiaries among the total 68 in Haveri district complained that they had not received the digital transfer of monetary benefits under a government scheme, he said. Upon verification, it was found that the beneficiary amount had got transferred to the Airtel Payments Bank accounts, he said. The Minister said a verification exercise would be taken up at all the districts to know how much of money had actually gone into the regular bank accounts and how much of it had landed in Airtel Payments Bank. He appealed to farmers to immediately link their bank accounts with their Aadhaar cards to prevent recurrence of such incidents. To a query on whether it was wrong to get the benefits transferred to the Airtel Payments Bank, he said the issue was about matter of convenience as it would be easier for farmers to withdraw money from their banks in villages instead of going to towns. Airtel responds When contacted by The Hindu , the Airtel Payments Bank spokesperson said they had taken note of the comments made by the Minister and will be getting in touch with his department. “Airtel Payments Bank follows stringent, compliant processes which are driven by customer consent, in a secure way through biometrics. The bank also takes additional consent from customers for receiving DBT in their Airtel Payments Bank accounts. It is to be noted that the DBT linking process in the country changed two years back, wherein, the customer must provide consent and self-disclose his previously seeded bank account, which is then verified independently through an industry body, before his new account can be used for the purpose of DBT receipts.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/subsidies-land-in-farmers-airtel-bank-accounts/article31753192.ece

They have also been equipped with gloves and visors. “These overcoats have been provided to those police personnel who have to deal with the public regularly. They are washable and made of all-weather material,” Rohini Katoch Sepat, DCP South, said. In addition, every police station has built a glass enclosure at the entrance for the station house where an officer is deputed to help visitors maintain social distance. The enclosures will have a mike and loudspeaker so that the personnel manning it can deal with queries from visitors and remain protected, said senior officials. In the initial days of the pandemic in Bengaluru, the police had introduced a slew of precautionary measures to be followed and stations were equipped with sanitizers and water for visitors. “These measures continue to remain in place. As per the rules, staff have been directed to wear masks,” a senior police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protective-gear-for-police/article31753165.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||GPs, dentists resume practice, increase consultation charges||Your next trip to the dentist or even your neighbourhood general practitioner is likely to cost more. While they have been gradually opening their clinics and restarting practice for limited hours a day, many have increased consultation fees. Some stand-alone clinics in Benglauru have raised their rates by as much as 30%. Medical professionals justify this saying they are not only more vulnerable to exposure to the coronavirus but have to invest in safety measures for their staff and patients. This includes buying face shields, gloves, masks and sanitisers. Dentists are investing in all of the above as well as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus given the nature of their job. While patients understand the logic behind the higher consultation fees, it will be added financial burden given that many are balancing household budgets after taking pay cuts. Supriya S., an employee of a multinational company, went to her dentist on Monday. “Normally, my dentist charges Rs. 400 for consultation. This time, I was asked to pay Rs. 500, and was told that the increase was because of the additional safety measures. I had no option but to agree to pay the revised fees,” she said. A general practitioner in north Bengaluru opened his clinic after two months on Monday. “I thought of hiking my consultation fee by Rs. 50 to meet the costs of the precautionary measures. But I had to increase by Rs. 100 as fewer patients are coming. So the overhead cost for each patient is higher,” he said. The GP said before the pandemic he would treat around 20 patients a day, which has now reduced to six patients. This trend is observed primarily in stand-alone clinics. R. Ravindra, President of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association said only a few hospitals have hiked their consultation and outpatient fees. “The hike is around 10%. Although procuring PPEs and masks adds to our expenditure, we are trying to manage without passing on the burden to our patients,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gps-dentists-resume-practice-increase-consultation-charges/article31753163.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on ‘Aarogya Setu’ app||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday ordered issue of notice to the Union government on a PIL petition seeking direction that the ‘Aarogya Setu’ app be made voluntary and not compulsory for accessing any government service or facility such as rail and air travel. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order on the petition, filed by Anivar A. Aravind, a city-based software engineer working for a non-profit organisation to protect people’s rights in the digital space. The Aarogya Setu app discriminates against persons who do not have a smart phones and also affects the right to privacy of citizens as it has access to the user’s location, it was contended in the petition. It was also contended that in many other democratic countries, which have developed similar apps for contact tracing of persons testing positive for COVID-19, the action was voluntary, and most of the apps only used Bluetooth and not user location. “The purpose of the Aarogya Setu app is to only inform the user if they come in contact with someone who has tested positive. This purpose can be served by basing the app on Bluetooth. There is no need to track the user’s location,” the petitioner claimed. Considering that merely 35% of India’s population has access to smart phones, it was contended that the lower income groups would be further excluded from using railway or air services, for which the app has been made mandatory. “No other democratic country has made a contact tracing application mandatory for travel and access to public services,” the petition stated. Thepetitioner also stated that the mobile phone was a personal device and the government did not have the authority for directinstallation of any app on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-aarogya-setu-app/article31753185.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Wildlife enthusiasts oppose construction in habitat of Great Indian Bustard||The construction of watchtowers by the Forest Department in Siruguppa, Ballari, which is home to the Great Indian Bustard (GIB), has led to a tug-of-war between the department and wildlife enthusiasts, with the latter alleging that it will lead to the destruction of the habitat. “Forest officers invited some researchers to document the GIB and began patrolling and even took up development and construction works. Now, they are constructing a number of watchtowers/anti-poaching camps, roads and waterholes everywhere in the core GIB area. We were able to see at least five watchtowers being built right in the middle of the habitat,” said Santosh Martin, a wildlife conservationist. According to environmentalists, a large number of black bucks are also found in the habitat, besides foxes, jackals, wolves, and hyenas. The group of conservationists said it has been documenting GIBs since 2006 with the help of locals, and GIBs and their young ones have been sighted every year in the area, with 12 GIBs, including females and chicks, being spotted in 2016. Besides the construction of watchtowers, the environmentalists are worried about the grassland is being converted into farmland, with cotton, sunflower, jowar and the likes being grown in the area. The 250-acre bustard habitat is on compensatory afforestation land given by various agencies in lieu of forest land diverted for non-forestry purposes. “The Forest Department has not probably learnt from the mistakes of the past when it destroyed 100 sq.km of bustard habitat in Ranebennur and drove away all the birds from the notified area. The Karera bustard sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh is another example where lots of development/construction work taken up by the Forest Department and human intervention drove away all the remaining birds,” said Mr. Martin. He demanded that a management committee be formed to look into the issue. He also advocated patrolling on foot or using bicycles instead of four-wheelers. ‘To arrest hunting’ Ramesh Kumar P., Deputy Conservator of Forests, Ballari, defended the department’s move and said only two watchtowers were being constructed in order to keep a check on hunters coming in from across the Andhra Pradesh border. “Hunters come at night for black bucks, foxes and hares. The watchtowers being installed are within a kilometre of the border as these animals are roaming on private land and are being hunted from close range,” he said.

The tax officials earlier last week unearthed undeclared arecanut worth Rs. 3.1 crore in five godowns at Channagiri taluk of Davangere, and levied tax and penalty of Rs. 31 lakh. No documents The action from the Enforcement wing headed by Additional Commissioner Nitesh K. Patil comes in the light of information that during COVID-19 large quantity of arecanut was being purchased and stored by some traders without valid documents. Officials had kept a close watch on the godowns and movement of goods. Searches were conducted on nine locations in Shivamogga and four locations in Sagar in the early hours on Wednesday. During inspection, two godowns were found to be undeclared, and transactions outside the regular books of accounts to suppress a turnover of Rs. 11.02 crore, said a release from Commercial Tax Commissioner M.S. Srikar. It is also suspected that some traders have obtained fictitious invoices from fictitious traders in Tamil Nadu in order to claim input tax credit, the release said, adding that since the transactions were made outside the book of accounts, details will be shared with APMC authorities. GST violations Department sources said that the vigilance has been increased to detect any possible GST violations since lockdown period had ended, and that there was a need to increase compliance to mop up better resource collection for the State. These searchers were part of it, and that the department was keeping an eye in other sectors too, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tax-officials-unearth-rs-11-crore-worth-undeclared-arecanut/article31753193.ece

Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who is the district in charge Minister for Chamarajanagar, told The Hindu that it was possible because of excellent teamwork and coordination between departments of Health and Revenue apart from the district administration. The district borders Kerala and Tamil Nadu. “Although the district had its share of Tablighi Jamaat participants, and over 50 employees of the pharma company in Mysuru are from the district, timely action and meticulous sealing of the borders helped in keeping infection away,” the Minister said. “The credit should go to the people of Chamarajanagar, who helped us in maintaining constant vigil at the borders and strict enforcement of quarantine rules. All vehicles entering the district were sanitised and drivers were screened. I have visited the district 11 times in 60 days and most importantly there was absolutely no interference from political leaders,” Mr. Suresh Kumar said.  Timely action and meticulous sealing of the borders helped in keeping infection away. S.

05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Only marginal change in pollution level in lakes’||The KSPCB on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that there was only a marginal change in pollution level of water in Bellandur and Varthur lakes, and Vrushabhavathi river, and the quality of water has not improved, except at Hampapura as per an analysis during the lockdown. “It is true that due to COVID-19, non-essential industrial activities are closed, and even working population is out of town. The volumetric load is considerably reduced, resulting in lean flow. The water quality of lake reveals that there is marginal change in the parameter concentration,” the KSPCB said. Pointing out that water samples were collected and analyzed at 26 stations all along the Vrushabhavathi valley before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period, the KSPCB said that the reports of analysis reveal that the quality of water has not improved except at Hampapura village. The statements were made before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Geetha Misra. The petitioner had sought directions to authorities to ensure that these water bodies, which witnessed lesser pollution during lockdown, are maintained properly by the authorities. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the KSPCB to clarify whether the NGT-appointed committee has jurisdiction or power to inspect apartments and industrial units in Bellandur and Varthur lake area and whether the committee has taken any steps to stop illegal discharge of effluents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-marginal-change-in-pollution-level-in-lakes/article31753158.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC declines govt. claim on migrant workers’ travel||Declining to accept the claim of the State government that majority of migrant workers were not showing interest in going back to their States, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday said there has to be a fair and transparent method to come to such conclusion. The government had told the court that it had sent SMS to all the migrant workers, registered in the Seva Sindhu portal for travel to their home States, assuring that Shramik special trains would be arranged for their travel. Though separate and specific SMS were sent to migrant workers in batches of 25,000 asking them to report at designated mustering points in Bengaluru city about 24 hours prior to departure of particular special trains, only 1,000 to 3,000 migrant workers turned up for travel, the government claimed. However, a special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna did not accept the claim that those registered for travel are not showing interest now merely on the basis that they did not report at the mustering centre based on the SMS. The Bench observed that there was no guarantee that SMS had reached all. The Bench was hearing through video conference PIL petitions on issues related to COVID-19 lockdown.  Discussion on matter Though the government, in its written statement, claimed that a majority of the migrant workers were chosen for travel based on their date of registration on the portal, the Bench pointed out that discussion on this aspect could not be found neither in the minutes of the meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary to discuss orders of the Supreme Court and the High Court nor in the circular issued based on the outcome of the meeting. Apart from directing the government to place a fair and transparent policy to ensure that all registered migrant workers would get a chance to go back their States, the Bench also asked the government to inform what efforts are being made to send migrants from northeastern States and Union Territories like Andaman and Nicobar. The Bench also said that mustering centres will have to be set up in districts having a large number of migrant workers registered on the portal. Further hearing was adjourned till June 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-declines-govt-claim-on-migrant-workers-travel/article31753177.ece

They simulated movement and dispersal of five wide-ranging species in the Western Ghats (elephant, gaur, leopard, sambar, and sloth bear) and four in Central India (gaur, leopard, sambar, and sloth bear). Natural areas constitute only 20% to 55% (in the Western Ghats) and 50% to 70% (in Central India) of unrestricted, increased and channelled movement areas, they pointed out, concluding that human land use and activities result in the loss of biodiversity and habitat, and also alter how animals move.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/effects-of-intervention/article31753189.ece

The circular asking school heads and teachers to gear up by June 5 for re-starting schools is fraught with danger, he said. The State government should not be in a hurry to re-start schools and its decision may push students and parents into trouble. The Centre has asked the State governments to give their consent after holding parents and SDMC members meeting. Accordingly, a parents meeting is slated from June 10 to 12.

05 June 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fears over likely landslips and floods||Environmentalists and residents of Belthangady taluk fear that there may be one more disaster this monsoon too on the lines of last year’s where a cloudburst not only triggered landslips on the Western Ghats but also caused heavy floods in the tributaries of the Netravathi. The Mrityunjaya one of the tributaries of Netravathi that flows close to Charmadi Ghat wreaked havoc last monsoon. The river course witnessed a flood-like situation last week when there was some rain. This, according to Dinesh Holla from Sahyadri Sanchaya, was silt — sand and stones — that accumulated along the river course during last year’s floods. While individuals having land on the banks of the river had cleared silt from their land, silt from the river was not cleared, Mr. Holla told The Hindu . He said that the river may alter its course thereby wreaking havoc along its course this monsoon because of the silt accumulation. He said that the Sanchaya team had found several precariously standing hillocks after last monsoon’s landslip during its visit. Some such hillocks must have collapsed last week bringing in muddy waters in the Mrityunjaya river course, he said. The river course, right from its origin in Madhugundi to Durgada Halli and Kukkavu, is filled with silt and debris thereby losing its depth. Mr. Holla suspected that landslips may occur this year too along the Western Ghat belt surrounding the tributaries of the Netravathi following the construction of a series of mini dams for the Yettinahole Water Diversion Project. Valleys such as Devagiri, Yelaneer, Himagiriguppe, Mugila Giri, Hebbasale and Heggadde in this range would see floods and landslips, he said. Sreehari Marathe, a progressive farmer from Didupe village on the foothills of the Kudremukh range, said that the Kukkavu river too is left with thousands of wooden logs that washed down during last monsoon. This could amplify the flood effect this time, while the wooden logs may go further down into the Netravathi creating trouble, he felt. Yettinahole project Mr. Holla further said that the construction of a series of dams for the Yettinahole project since four years has almost destroyed the Shola forests in the region. Though the Rs. 20,000-crore project is not yielding water to beneficiary regions, it being continued, he regretted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fears-over-likely-landslips-and-floods/article31753367.ece

05 June 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Three cheers for Chamarajanagar||The State government is set to notify M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve any time now, with the Centre and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) clearing the decks for the final leg of the process. It was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but is expected this month. Once notified, Chamarajanagar will have three tiger reserves, including the Bandipur and BRT reserves, which is a rare distinction for any district in the country. The proposal to declare it a tiger reserve was approved by the State Board for Wildlife in January 2019 and was submitted for approval by the Forest Department in May 2019. However, the NTCA raised questions pertaining to the boundary of the core area in the northeastern portion of the proposed reserve. It also called for delineating the area of religious tourism clearly. Hence, the proposal was reworked and submitted afresh in January this year. Now, the Centre and the NTCA have cleared it for notification. Sanjai Mohan, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife, told The Hindu that the official notification was a matter of administrative formality. V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests of M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, said if not for COVID-19, the notification would have come through by now. However, the formalities are expected to be completed in a week or so, he added. M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary has about 20 tigers, as per the camera trap exercise results obtained from various forest ranges. But what is significant is that it is contiguous to other protected areas, including BRT Tiger Reserve, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, and Satyamangalam Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu, which have a combined spread of nearly 3,500 sq.km. With higher protection to the landscape, it is expected to act as a “sink” to absorb the tiger population and help increase their numbers, Mr. Yedukondalu said. Major habitat According to experts, there is potential for the forest region to emerge as another major tiger habitat comparable to the Bandipur-Nagarahole-Mudumalai-Wayanad landscape, which has been identified for supporting one of the highest tiger densities in the wild in the world. Studies indicate that the landscape also supports around 300 elephants and the prey density is pegged at 5.05 animals per sq.km. M.M. Hills Tiger Reserve will be spread over 906.18 sq.km., with a core of 670.95 sq.km and a buffer zone of 235.19 sq.km. There are 18 revenue enclosures in the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary landscape, but they have been kept outside the tiger reserve boundary so that the rights and privileges of the locals are not affected, said Mr. Yedukondalu.

Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, made the announcement on Thursday after offering floral tributes to the statue of the late ruler, also described as “Rajarishi” and architect of modern Mysuru, at K.R. Circle named after him in the city. Acknowledging Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar’s contribution, Mr. Somashekar said honouring the late ruler was the State government’s duty. The process of identifying achievers could not be taken up so far due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But, the district administration will soon begin the process and organise a felicitation programme, he said. Mr. Somashekar’s announcement comes in the backdrop of a controversy brewing over the State government’s plans to install statues of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and the erstwhile Dewan of Mysore M. Visvesvaraya in front of KRS reservoir in Mandya. Retired professor P.V. Nanjaraj Urs, who has authored a book on KRS, led a delegation of like-minded activists to Mr. Somashekar on Thursday and handed over a memorandum opposing the installation of Visvevaraya’s statue of the same size as the late ruler’s statue. Prof. Urs said the Dewan, who was also an engineer, was merely implementing the decisions taken by Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the then ruler. Prof. Urs regretted that the Centre had refused to consider former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s letter asking for Mysuru airport to be named after Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. The Centre rejected the recommendation of Mr. Siddaramaiah while asking for a different name, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ten-achievers-to-be-feted-to-mark-birth-anniversary-of-krishnaraja-wadiyar/article31753175.ece

Eshwarappa has said that the State government is implementing Antarjala Chetana Yojana to help increase groundwater level to meet drinking water needs. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating a component of the yojana in Raichur on Thursday, he said that the project is being implemented by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj in partnership with Sri Sri Ravishankar Guruji’s Art of Living. Under the project, groundwater will be increased by creating Krishi Hondas, Nalas, field bunds and achhukat development, tank and kalyani rejuvenation and rainwater harvesting. “This will help improve groundwater level which will recharge borewells to meet drinking water needs and irrigate dry land,” he pointed out. Under the guidance and supervision of water experts from Art of Living, the project would be implemented, he said and added that the general public should also contribute in increasing groundwater level by taking up rainwater harvesting. Raja Amareshwar Naik, MP, Shivanagowda Naik, Shivaraj Patil, Basanagouda Daddal, Venkatrao Nadagouda, MLAs, and Adimani Veeralakshmi, president of the zilla panchayat, and office-bearers of Art of Living were present.

Talking to reporters at Elebichhali village in Raichur taluk after inspecting work to remove silt in tanks in Yergera, Bichhali and Nelahal villages in the taluk on Thursday, Mr. Eshwarappa said that the “we are ready for election but, if the Election Commission, which has to take a decision, is not ready due to COVID-19 pandemic, we will appoint administrators to gram panchayats.” Asked about Congress leaders threatening to launch an agitation, he said that “Congress leaders, including Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, have no other work to do; therefore, they are talking about protests. They must know that the BJP is ready to face gram panchayat elections.” He said that more work has been taking up under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to help people during difficult times. “MGNREGA work is on in 5,800 gram panchayat limits out of the 6,021 gram panchayats and payment is reaching workers without any delay,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/antarjala-chetana-yojana-will-help-increase-groundwater-level/article31753364.ece

While the barrage at Nayampalli near Kallianpur bridge would prevent salt water intrusion, the other two barrages at Perampalli and Kilinje would help in storing water. The barrages would be about 100 m to 200 m long with a 2.5-km waterspread area behind them. The barrages will come up in the region below the Baje dam. Assistant Executive Engineer of Varahi Reservoir Project Sub-Division Prasanna Kumar Shet, told The Hindu that a feasibility report had already been sent to the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd. for approval. Surveyors would be carrying out work for these barrages. As soon as the feasibility report gets the nod, a Detailed Project Report would be prepared, he said. Once these three barrages are constructed, over 500 hectares of agricultural land in these places would benefit. It would also help recharge groundwater in the region and thus the question of wells going dry during the summer too would be addressed. “Since these will be barrages-cum-bridges, it will also help people to move from one bank of the river to the other,” said Mr. Shet. General Secretary of district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangha Satyanarayana Udupa Japti said that the construction of barrages would help farmers in the summer as they would be able to grow vegetables and other crops in the region. “But maintenance of the barrages should be given importance as there are a lot complaints of leaks in vented dams in the district,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-barrages-to-come-up-in-udupi/article31753357.ece

05 June 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||A fight against invasive plants in forests||While government agencies and environmental organisations elsewhere in the State are preparing to plant tree saplings of various species to mark World Environment Day on Friday, officials of the North Wayanad Forest Division will launch a project to eradicate invasive species of plants spread over more than eight hectares at Appappara in Thirunelly reserve forest. Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., a Government of India enterprise, had drawn a 400 KV D/C transmission line from Mysuru to Kozhikode a few years ago through the reserve forest after felling thousands of trees on an over-4 km-long and 20 m-wide stretch. The area gradually witnessed the rampant growth of invasive plants, especially Senna spectabilis, Lantana, and Eupatorium. Senna Spectabilis among them is posing a major threat to the biodiversity in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve due to its quick growth and coppicing character. As no part of the exotic species is edible for the wildlife, the spread of the plant has increased man-animal conflict in the area. However, forest officials of the Begur forest range under the North Wayanad forest division have started planting stems of CO3 variety of fodder grass on the land after uprooting all the invasive species. “The project has been started on an experimental basis to eradicate the invasive species and mitigate man-animal conflict by ensuring fodder for the wildlife throughout the year,” said V. Ratheesan, forest range officer, Begur. The eradication of Senna would be a herculean task, but it seemed the quick growth of CO3 grass would help in arresting the further spread of the exotic plant, he said. “We are planning to complete the planting work on one hectare on Friday. If the project succeeds, it will be expanded to the remaining area in the coming days.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-fight-against-invasive-plants-in-forests/article31753453.ece
05 June 2020||KANNUR,KERALA||Greens cry foul at mangrove felling||The massive destruction of rare mangrove forests in the name of Kaipad/Pokkli farming in Kannur has raised concern among the public and environmentalists. On Thursday, the eve of World Environment Day, members of the Kallen Pookkudan Mangrove Tree Trust and the Kannur District Environment Committee staged a protest in front of the Collectorate and met District Collector T.V. Subhash seeking his immediate intervention to stop the destruction of mangroves under the guise of ‘Oru Nellum Oru Meenum’ farming project. P. Anandan, member of trust, said the district had the highest density of mangrove forests in the State, which were mostly on private lands. The trees, some of them rare species, were being cut down mindlessly by some persons under the guise of kaipad cultivation. “Just in recent times, over 40 acres of mangrove trees have been uprooted using earth movers at Thavam in Cherukunnu panchayat,” he said. This was being done to prepare the land for kaipad farming. A Detailed Project Report submitted to the government cites it as a traditional farming method but efforts were on to introduce hybrid seeds recently introduced by the Regional Agriculture Research Station, Pilicode, he said. Vinod Payyada, environmental activist and member of the environment committee, alleged that the clearing of mangrove forests was taking place with the knowledge of panchayat authorities. He said vast tracts of land with mangrove trees had already been cleared at Pattuvam, Cherukkunu, and Ezhoham. He said such activities were being carried out under the Oru Nellum Oru Meenum project implemented by the Agency for Development of Aquaculture Kerala. This was meant to ensure additional income to kaipad farmers. However, people with vested interests who were not dependent on farming for their livelihood were behind the project. They were eyeing the subsidy amount given to kaipad farmers and trying to change the character of the land. The aim was to convert the land into prime real estate for the construction of hotels and other establishments, the greens alleged. Significantly, the destruction is taking place at a time when the government is yet to fulfil its promise of acquiring private mangrove forests and handing them over to the Ministry of Environment and Forests to declare them as Reserve Forests. In 2002, a deal was signed under which mangrove forests would be given to the Forest Department in return for using 7,693.22 hectares of forestland to rehabilitate tribespeople in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, and Wayanad. However, even after 18 years, the agreement remains on paper. A senior forest officer said 496 hectares of mangroves in Kannur district still remained in private hands. Seventy-five per cent of mangrove tracts in the State is in Kannur. Mangrove forests would fall under the Coastal Regulatory Act 1(A) and no construction or development could be carried out in the area, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-cry-foul-at-mangrove-felling/article31753451.ece
05 June 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Corpn. goes slow on efficient online service||While several local bodies seem to be moving towards offering a more efficient system of online services, the Kochi Corporation continues to fumble. To ensure that services offered by local bodies are more transparent, clear, and accessible, the Local Self-Government Department has asked civic bodies to implement the Integrated Local Governance Management System (ILGMS), the open-source software developed by the Information Kerala Mission (IKM). As a pilot project, the software has been in use in Chemmaruthy panchayat in Thiruvananthapuram since May 20. Instead of the roughly 14 different modules currently in use in local bodies for birth, death and marriage registrations, tax payments or pensions, ILGMS offers a single window for all services and payments. Unlike the earlier system, documents can be submitted online for verification. With all files becoming web-based, updates on the status of files, officials handling them, and the reasons for delay can be made available to applicants online. Phased implementation “It is likely to be implemented in all local bodies in a phased manner. We have a mandate from the government to implement the system by July 31,” said Neelakantan D.S., Deputy Director (Technical), IKM. “Currently, the online modules are not integrated with the file system of the local bodies. Now, every application will get integrated with the file system. All birth, death and other data will be web-based. Certificates can also be issued across multiple languages now. This is technologically advanced, and there is process and service delivery improvement,” he added. Online services in 943 local bodies across the State is currently managed by IKM. Opposition councillors at the corporation have been campaigning for a switch to the IKM software instead of the current TCS-built system that is nearing a total collapse. “Even as other local bodies make the transition, a system that efficiently makes services available online to the public will not be used at the Kochi Corporation simply because we are sticking to the old TCS software,” said V.P. Chandran, secretary, LDF Parliamentary Party. “We have not ruled out the IKM system. But to make any changes to the existing system, we will have to start all over again with entering data collected over several decades. To make changes to the system, we will still need help from TCS since it was specifically designed for us,” said Mayor Soumini Jain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-goes-slow-on-efficient-online-service/article31753459.ece
05 June 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Low patronage may keep pvt. buses off road||Faced with a steep fall in income, fear is rife that the few private buses operating in Ernakulam are likely to keep off the road in the coming days. Around 50 private buses had resumed service in mid-May after the State government permitted their operation and enhanced ticket fare by 50%, to compensate for a cap of up to 30 passengers in a bus. “Bus operators are faced with two issues. There is not even minimal patronage for some trips, with the result that daily income is down to Rs. 3,000 or less, which is insufficient to meet even diesel expenses,” said K.B. Suneer, general secretary, Ernakulam District Private Bus Operators’ Association. “On the other hand, the police charge case against us if they find one or two passengers standing while travelling. We thus have to pay Rs. 5,000 as fine. Even the existing services will have to be suspended if the situation prevails,” he added. On its part, the KSRTC’s Ernakulam depot is operating 42 services on city, mofussil and inter-district routes. “Altogether, 45% of our buses are being run. This is apart from services operated from depots in suburban towns. “Most services have inadequate patronage, although they can carry passengers as per their seating capacity. The only restriction is that passengers must not stand and travel,” said Tajudeen Sahib, Ernakulam zonal traffic officer, KSRTC. Low-floor air-conditioned buses have not resumed service as a safety precaution, while non-AC low-floor buses are also not being run owing to their low fuel efficiency, it is learnt. Mr. Sahib exhorted commuters to wear face mask and use hand sanitiser frequently while travelling. He also requested them to adhere to directions given by the bus crew. “It has come to our notice that several passengers discard masks once they board buses. The KSRTC’s Ernakulam zone operated as many as 1,300 services to ferry people who arrived here in trains, flights, and on board ships. We also spared the services of 30 drivers to operate ambulances of the Health Department,” he said. Shramik trains Three Shramik Special trains operated from Ernakulam on Thursday, carrying migrant labourers bound for West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand. Many labourers turned up at the railway station, although their names did not figure in the list jointly prepared by the district administration, Labour and Health departments, and the police. They were turned back by the police. “Only labourers who were brought in buses arranged by the district administration and whose names figured in the list were allowed to travel. They were also medically screened,” said a Railway official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/low-patronage-may-keep-pvt-buses-off-road/article31753461.ece
05 June 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Delay in payment of housing aid puts beneficiaries in a fix||Several beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) in Kochi are awaiting payments to complete house construction just as the monsoon sets in, exacerbating their worries. Payments worth Rs. 6 crore are pending for around 450 beneficiaries who had applied for funds before the lockdown. Officials in the Kochi Corporation are anticipating that in around two weeks, the civic body will have to pay at least 1,411 beneficiaries who are at different stages of construction and have resumed work after the announcement of the lockdown. A beneficiary at Palluruthy who did not want to be named received her second instalment in January, after a four-month delay, but has not been paid since then. If the third instalment had been given when she had applied for it in February, the construction could have been completed before the monsoon, she said. The family had initially rented a place when their house was pulled down for reconstruction. Not able to pay the rent, they had to move into a shed on the construction site which was proving to be difficult with water seeping in when it rains, she said. “We are now trying to avail a loan and complete some work to move in before the rain gets more regular. We had expected that PMAY would be a big help, but the delay in payment has made the scheme more of a hassle. With no salary during the lockdown, we are unable to pay for school textbooks, let alone pay for the house construction,” said the mother of two who used to work at a tutorial centre before the lockdown. Though the corporation council had decided to avail of a bank loan of Rs. 35 crore in December last year, the bank has not released the amount yet, said Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar. The amount was approved, and the civic body is in the process of providing a deposit of Rs. 3.5 crore to the bank, he said. The deposit amount would be taken from unused funds left over from the JNNURM scheme. The Centre and State governments are also yet to provide their share of Rs. 46 crore. Of that amount, Rs. 5.5 crore was expected soon, he said. Of the 8,266 applications, work has begun on 4,286 houses, and the construction of 2,285 houses has been completed. The most recent list of 1,344 applicants is yet to be approved by the State government. An additional Rs. 53 crore will be required to pay the civic body’s share for the new beneficiaries, putting the corporation in a fix.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/delay-in-payment-of-housing-aid-puts-beneficiaries-in-a-fix/article31753466.ece

Over and above the Kochi Corporation’s expenditure of nearly Rs. 7 crore every year on cleaning and desilting drains and canals, the district administration’s Operation Breakthrough in two phases has taken up projects worth Rs. 20 crore, mostly to do with clearing canals. While the corporation handles the Thevara-Perandoor canal, Seena Thodu, and small drains in each division, Karanakodam Thodu, Koyithara canal, and Changadampokku Thodu are covered by Operation Breakthrough. Additionally, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has taken up work of connecting Karanakodam Thodu and Changadampokku Thodu near the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium metro station. Work on Mullassery canal will be taken up as part of Operation Breakthrough, but only after rain, as it is likely to take up to three months. Clearing the canal could have avoided waterlogging in the KSRTC bus station area. But cleaning and desilting appear to be a hasty fix to waterlogging issues. “There are several sewage pipes, even from large establishments, that are directly connected to drains and canals. Garbage, including bottles and cement bags clogging small drains, are dumped into the canals,” said P.M. Harris, chairperson of the corporation works standing committee. The issue of encroachments too has to be dealt with. “There are walls that have been constructed almost on canals. The corporation, district administration, and other departments should coordinate to get them cleared in the long term,” he said. “We are spending crores of rupees every year on cleaning and desilting. But cleaning itself will not resolve waterlogging in the long run. Even Operation Breakthrough has no permanent solution,” Mr. Harris added. According to an engineer associated with corporation projects, if the issue of waste and sewage finding itself in canals did not persist, desilting might be necessary only once in two years. Mr. Harris said besides desilting, regular maintenance had been added to agreements with contractors this year. However, former Mayor K.J. Sohan said it was the responsibility of the corporation to manage canals. “The civic body should be strengthened rather than handing over canals to other agencies,” he said, pointing to the situation on M.G. Road where pavements readied by the metro agencies were being pulled apart.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crores-spent-but-citys-canal-system-in-tatters/article31753457.ece

Amidst the mounting pressure from the Congress to fall in line on the Kottayam district panchayat issue, a defiant KC(M) faction led by Jose K. Mani has further upped the ante by asking the coalition to execute the seat-sharing agreement in various local bodies. As part of it, a leadership meeting of the party, convened here the other day, demanded the UDF State leadership to help take over the presidential post due to it in various local bodies. Upholding the party’s commitment towards adhering to the seat-sharing deals worked out by the coalition, the meeting noted that it had already surrendered the presidential posts in the Changanassery municipality and the Kanjirappally block panchayat in accordance with existing agreements. The move is widely regarded as a response to the Congress, which publicly demanded the Mani faction to hand over the president’s post in the Kottayam district panchayat to the P.J. Joseph faction. At a meeting of the District Congress Committee, the party leadership had acknowledged the claims by the Joseph faction over the post and asserted its role as a leading partner in the coalition to implement the deal. Sharp reaction The DCC’s statement in turn drew a sharp reaction from the Jose faction, which warned against any attempt to wrest the post through intimidation. At the same time, a reconciliation talk convened by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala in Thiruvananthapuram too broke down with both sides sticking to their respective stances. The failure in reaching a consensus, despite interventions by senior UDF leaders, including P.K. Kunhalikutty and Oommen Chandy, has put the UDF further on the back foot. “Acknowledging the post-sharing agreement as claimed by the Joseph faction is indeed a clear indication that the UDF and the Congress are keen on keeping them on board. The rival faction, which of late showed defiance after making some concessions, appears to be weighing all options. In any case, the coalition is running out of time as the local body elections are fast approaching,” said a senior Congress leader. Meanwhile, the election to the post of president in Changanassery municipality is slated to be held on June 12. The election follows the resignation of Lalichan Kunniparambal from the post in March this year. Sajan Francis, a Joseph loyalist, is expected to contest as the UDF candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seat-sharing-mani-faction-ups-the-ante-udf-in-a-spot/article31753549.ece
05 June 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Lime shell business stares at an uncertain future||The shorelines of Vembanad Lake are dotted with intermittent white mountains these days. A closer look, however, reveals that these are just clamshells deposited in layer upon layer. The calcium-rich resource, of great demand both locally and in other States, does not have many takers with its business almost hitting a deadend during the current lockdown. Experts attribute the crisis to the arrival of cheaper alternatives and an emerging black market. The fall in demand has left members of 13 cooperative societies engaged in procurement and marketing of shells a distressed lot. Nearly 8,000 people across the lake basin are directly dependent on the black clam sector. The average annual production of clams in Vembanad stands at 32,000 tonnes. The white lime shells are the fossils of black clams, which contribute over 70% of the fishery wealth in the brackish water system. According to P.K. Surendran, president, Muhamma Lime Shell Collectors Cooperative Society, the annual business volume of the material has come down from over 40,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes over time. Soil neutraliser “Called ‘neettukakka’, these shells were of great demand as a soil neutraliser across the acidic paddy fields of Kuttanad while poultry feed makers in Namakkal used its as a calcium supplement. The subsidised distribution of dolomite, however, has curtailed the local demand while the poultry feed makers are increasingly replacing the shells with cheap lime stones from Andhra Pradesh,” he said. Vinoop Chellappan, secretary, Vechoor Lime shell Cooperative Society near Vaikom, observed: “Of the 1,200-odd members we have, now just 63 are still into clam collection for a living. Most of these societies are now heavily dependent on government grants to meet even their routine expenses,” he said. Mr. Chellappan pointed out the proliferation of black market units that sell the resource at a much lesser price without meeting the royalty norms as another major factor behind the sharp fall in business. Jojo T.D., project coordinator of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment which has made major interventions in the sector, said that finding alternative markets locally for these shells is the key to reviving the sector. “Clam collectors are faced with a unique situation of fall in production and demand and official intervention is required to address this situation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lime-shell-business-stares-at-an-uncertain-future/article31753555.ece

Trains such as Jan Shatabdi Express running within the State resumed services from June 1. But on the first day the Kannur–Thiruvananthapuram Jan Shatabdi started its journey from Kozhikode, thereby leaving passengers stranded at the Kannur railway station in pre-dawn rain. After a public uproar, the State government has now asked the Railways to start the train from the original destination. “Now, the situation is more awkward as many who booked the tickets before June 1 had cancelled their tickets and rebooked their tickets from Kozhikode. Now, these passengers may have to book their tickets again to board from Kannur and also cancel the tickets booked from Kozhikode,” C.E. Chakkunny, chairman, Confederation of All-India Rail Users’ Association, said. He said that the flip-flop attitude of the State government was giving a harrowing time to the rail passengers travelling within the State. “Based on the demand of the government, the Railways cancelled important halts of the Jan Shatabdi Expresses. “There is no logic in temporarily removing the halts at the regular stations when State-owned KSRTC is plying inter-district services,” Mr. Chakkunny said. Railway officials are confused over the volte face of the State government on removing the regular halts - whether it is at Thalassery, Vadakara, Aluva, Cherthala, Mavelikkara, Kayamkulam, and Varkala Sivagiri of the four Janshatabdi trains running via Alappuzha and Kottayam routes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/frequent-revision-of-train-halts-putting-passengers-to-hardship/article31753445.ece
05 June 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Steps to reduce rush at MCH||Minister for Labour and Excise T.P. Ramakrishnan has called for strengthening primary and secondary level healthcare institutions in Kozhikode district to avoid a possible rush to the Government Medical College Hospital here in the wake of a likely spurt in communicable diseases with the onset of southwest monsoon. Chairing a review meeting here on Thursday, he said that enough medicines should be stocked at the taluk hospitals and family health centres and only those who were in need of critical care should approach the medical college hospital. The support of private hospitals too should be sought to . The Minister pointed out that the highest number of communicable diseases were being reported during the monsoon months and people might like to approach the medical college hospital for any disease. However, a large number of people reaching the medical college hospital at the time of COVID-19 pandemic would be dangerous. Mr. Ramakrishnan directed the officials to ensure that enough number of doctors were on duty at Covid care centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-reduce-rush-at-mch/article31753448.ece

Three persons from Kasaragod, Pallikkal Rahim, H.V. Shafeeque and A. Abdul Safwan, were arrested in connection with the incident.

The incident took place on Wednesday night. The shutter of the fish stall was partly damaged in the attack. Cement blocks kept in front of the shop for displaying fish too were vandalised. Though closed circuit television (CCTV) camera visuals were collected from various spots, the police are yet to identify the suspects. According to the police, the man had earlier invited the wrath of many villagers for not allegedly complying with physical-distancing protocol even after giving samples for COVID-19 lab test. After his hospitalisation, about 100 persons had been asked to go into home quarantine. Subsequently, six grama panchayats and three wards of the Vadakara municipality had been declared as containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-into-attack-on-fish-stall-of-patient/article31753454.ece

05 June 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||DDMA starts removing sand from Pampa||The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by the District Collector, has initiated the clearing of the huge deposits of sand and debris left by the disastrous deluge of August 2018 at Pampa in the foothills of Sabarimala. District Collector P.B. Noohu, accompanied by Thiruvalla Subcollector Vinay Goyal and other revenue officials, reached Pampa on Thursday morning and supervised the sand removal work that began by invoking Section 34(d) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. According to the Collector, the action was to avert chances of floods at Pampa and surrounding areas. The DDMA decision to remove the sand using the State Disaster Response Fund came after the Kannur-based Kerala Clays and Ceramic Products Limited (KCCPL) backtracked from the task entrusted to it on Thursday following objections raised by the Forest Department. Panel formed A committee chaired by Dr. Goyal has been constituted to monitor the progress of work on a day-to-day basis. Seven earth movers have been pressed into service for loading the sand in trucks. A total of 29 trucks will be used to shift the sand to a site near the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot at Pampa. Dr. Goyal told The Hindu that the Irrigation Department had assessed the quantum of sand accumulated along the 2.23-km river stretch between Valiyanavattom and Pampa-Triveni at 1.23 lakh cubic metres. A team of officials attached to the Revenue and Irrigation departments are camping at Pampa to monitor the sand collection and transportation. Dr. Goyal said the DDMA decision was to start the work at 6 a.m. and continue till 7 p.m. so that it could be completed in the next 10 days. The debris of buildings destroyed in the deluge and heaps of tattered plastic bags used for constructing a temporary protection wall along the left bank too have to be removed from the river course. The DDMA decision was against the backdrop of the heavy monsoon forecast, the Collector said. Govt. move flayed Meanwhile, Thomas P. Thomas, academic-turned environmentalist, said the undue haste shown by the district administration for removing the sand, bypassing even the mandatory clearance required for the same from the Union Ministry of Forests, Environment and Climate Change, under the cover of disaster management was highly suspicious. Had the administration been so sincere in taking precautions against floods, it could have cleared the sand deposits in a proper and systematic manner in the past two years, without incurring such huge revenue loss to the public exchequer, he alleged. CESS finding A team of experts from the Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS) in Thiruvananthapuram had found the sand accumulated in the deluge in Pampa of construction grade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ddma-starts-removing-sand-from-pampa/article31753484.ece

05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Five more cases in capital||The State capital reported five more cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the total number of people being treated in the district to 66. While all of the five were imported cases, four of the patients had come from abroad. Three among them, a 59-year old man hailing from Alappuzha, a 39-year old woman from Vithura and a 39-year old man from Muttathara, had arrived in the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport in special flights from Kuwait. An 18-year old girl who hails from Pallithura was diagnosed with the infection after arriving at the Kannur International Airport from Tajikistan. Symptoms A 24-year old Kulathoor native who had come from Mumbai has also been found to be suffering from the disease. Her father had died due to COVID-19 in Mumbai, official sources said. Prevented from proceeding for his home district, the Alappuzha native had been admitted to the Neyyattinkara General Hospital soon after his journey from Kuwait after he displayed various symptoms including diarrhoea. The district administration quarantined 767 people on the day as a result of which the total number of people quarantined has gone up to 12,680. Forty-two people were hospitalised with various symptoms. District Collector Navjot Khosa, who is also the chairperson of the District Disaster Management Authority, has issued an order that makes it mandatory for people who want to be quarantined in any residential facility or dwelling unit, which has been notified by the government, to inform the local self government concerned in advance, following which the latter must verify its suitability. The medical officer must also ensure that there is proper provision for room quarantine and that there were no children aged below 10 years and people aged above 65 years, pregnant women and other persons who are immuno-compromised in the same facility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/five-more-cases-in-capital/article31753494.ece
05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Malayali medicos seek repatriation||The northern Russian city of Arkhangelsk, located 1,200 km from Moscow, has been a much-sought-after destination for medical studies for aspirants from Kerala. But for the past few weeks, the hundreds of Malayali students at the Northern State Medical University there have been going through an uncertain phase, in waiting for flights back home even as their visa expiry date looms large. In this university, there are around 400 students from Kerala, with thousands more in Moscow and in the smaller countries which were part of the former Soviet Union. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, most of them had reserved tickets to come back home for the vacation in July. Visa renewal With flights getting cancelled, and the visa renewal date approaching on July 31, they have been trying to get into the repatriation flights to India. Till now, only a few have been lucky. “I managed to reach Kerala with 50 others in a Vande Bharat flight, but around 350 from my university are still waiting for their turn. Since there has been a spurt in COVID-19 cases in the region, all of them want to get home at the earliest and have registered with the Indian embassy and NoRKA. As there are a large number of students, they have been choosing a few at random from various colleges for the repatriation flights,” says Rizwan, a student. The Kerala Association of Guardians for Assistance to Indian Students in Erstwhile Soviet Union (KAGASS), formed back in 1991 to sort out the issues faced by Malayali students after the dissolution of Soviet Union, had last week written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to take steps to bring them back. Online classes “Though two flights have come from Russia, only around 60 students have managed to get back till now. The final year students are staying back, as they have clinical practice training, but the rest of them prefer to attend online classes from Kerala. Since their visa renewal dates are approaching, they should be given preference in these flights,” says Lalu Joseph, general secretary of KAGASS. Flights from Moscow With the number of cases in Russia shooting up, there has been some level of concern among the students. The flights being from Moscow, a major hotspot, is another cause of tension. “My son, who is a second year medical student, has been trying for tickets for some days, but has been unable to get into the first two repatriation flights. Now, the next phase is only expected later this month,” says Anilkumar, a parent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/malayali-medicos-seek-repatriation/article31753489.ece
05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Barton Hill students bag top laurel for ‘bamboo car’||The students of Government Engineering College, Barton Hill, here have bagged the Circular Economy Award at Shell Eco-marathon Asia competition to become the first team from India to bag the prestigious laurel. Team Pravega, a group of 15 mechanical engineering students led by final-year student Abhinav P. Sekhar, was chosen for the recognition for their innovative idea of incorporating bamboo as a building material for vehicles. The marathon is aimed at evolving designs for ultra fuel-efficient vehicles in various categories. The same team had participated in the regional-level contest of the marathon last year in the prototype IC engine category with 180km/l mileage and made it to the top 120 teams at the Asia level. Their core concept is the use of bamboo composite for vehicle body and bamboo for structural parts, making the car an eco-friendly one. While the on-track event scheduled to be held in Malaysia was called off amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the off-track awards were decided on the basis of the work of the teams that made it to the final round. Team Pravega was in the process of upgrading their vehicle to a battery-powered one. The winning team will receive a cash award of $3,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/barton-hill-students-bag-top-laurel-for-bamboo-car/article31753502.ece
05 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||e-classes yet to be streamlined||Viji (name changed), a teacher in a government school in the coastal belt, was on Thursday set to visit a student to see if arrangements could be made for the child to view the online classes of the State government. Viji said one in three students in her school did not have access to facilities for the classes. She had arranged for them to view recorded content on WhatsApp on the phones of their neighbours or relatives. Her worry though was about a permanent solution. The ‘trial’ factor Parents and students were anxious about missing out on the online classes. Not many knew that the first two weeks were a trial. The Principal of a city school felt the classes had been launched without requisite preparation. “The government is asking us to report the number of students who do not have access to the facilities. But teachers have been having problems getting through to all students. One wonders if the government has not been a tad hasty.” Results of a preliminary data collection were available with the government but local self-government institutions did not get time to make preparations, the Principal alleged. However, the Principal of another school said there was need for exact data for arrangements to be put in place. Sponsors could also be handed over the data if it were at hand. Teachers said a KITE order put the responsibility for making arrangements for the classes on them. The telecast should have not gone ahead if the facilities were not in place. Tamil medium students Students had been expressing doubts if they would even get to study in the next class. The quick start to the online classes had put to rest any such apprehensions, the Principal of a boys’ school said. A teacher of a high school said they were reaching out to Tamil medium students too through a daily wage teacher. Students of other education boards were also shifting to online mode. Soft loans General Education Secretary A. Shajahan said facilities existing in schools as part of the High-tech School project, in libraries, model anganwadis, and Akshaya centres would be used for students' benefit. Public sector units and local bodies had also agreed to sponsor equipment. The KSFE was providing soft loans to Kudumbashree members for equipment purchase. The services of tribal extension workers would be tapped for arranging facilities in tribal areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-classes-yet-to-be-streamlined/article31753492.ece
05 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Priest’s body interred||Bringing an end to the uncertainty which lasted three days, the body of the 77-year-old priest who died of COVID-19 was buried on Thursday at a cemetery at Malamugal, near Nettayam, around 500 metres from another one where local residents thwarted the district authorities’ efforts to conduct the final rites a day ago. Family’s consent The administration had to back off from its efforts to bury the priest’s body on Wednesday after people gathered in the area to protest the move with many claiming that the cemetery was subject of a land dispute. The family of the deceased then conveyed their willingness to cremate the body at Shanti Kavadam in Thycaud. Church stance However, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church insisted that the body of the priest be buried in accordance with its custom and proposed to conduct the final rites at another cemetery that came under the St. Thomas Orthodox Church in Kumarapuram. A protest erupted in the area for the second consecutive day as the Corporation authorities dug the pit for burial. However, the district administration went ahead with its decision to bury the priest in the cemetery after ensuring there were no houses within a radius of 100 metres. Metropolitan Gabriel Mar Gregorios of the Thiruvananthapuram diocese led the final prayers, following which the body was buried in a 12-foot-deep pit in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/priests-body-interred/article31753497.ece
05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Railways reconvert ‘isolation’ coaches||As many as 97 coaches modified into COVID-19 isolation units in the State have been reconverted into passenger coaches. This is as per a directive of the Railway Board since it is no more needed for isolation facilities. The 97 coaches are among 473 coaches converted into isolation units in April, spending Rs. 35,000 a coach. “The reconverted coaches are being used as Shramik Specials for the return of migrant workers from Kerala. They have come in handy as 10 Shramik Specials are being operated daily from the State,” Divisional Railway Manager Shirish Kumar Sinha told The Hindu . Of the 97 reconverted units, 65 belong to the Thiruvananthapuram railway division and 32 to Palakkad. The reconversion was done in the coaching depots at Nagercoil, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochuveli and Ernakulam in the Thiruvananthapuram division and Mangaluru in the Palakkad division. Thirty-one isolation units which had been lying at Shoranur Junction for weeks were taken to Mangaluru for reconversion recently. The works were completed on Thursday and one was taken for periodic overhauling, a spokesman of the Palakkad division said. Isolation units were set up in eight of the nine cabins in a coach. The sleepers removed from the first cabin to convert it into a paramedical area was restored. The middle sleepers removed from eight cabins were again fixed. One of the toilets converted into a bathroom has been replaced and curtains removed. Other facilities such as three-peg coat hooks had been retained. 1,520 beds A total of 1,520 beds were available in the isolation units readied by the mechanical wing. For the cash-strapped Railways, the Rs. 33,95,000 spent for converting the coaches into isolation units was a drain as the units could not be used for isolation. “The reconversion is not as expensive as conversion,” Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railways-reconvert-isolation-coaches/article31753486.ece
05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State’s past encounters with locusts||As Kerala keeps a sharp lookout for locust swarms ravaging farmlands elsewhere in the country, documents indicate that these ravenous pests have, albeit on rare occasions, gifted nightmares to farmers at least in parts of the State. The official report of the second budget session of the fourth Cochin Legislative Council held on August 4, 1936 offers the nugget titled ‘Outbreak of locust pest in Nemmara Firkah.’ The matter was raised in the council by R. Viswanathan Chettiar and he who wanted to know if there was an outbreak in the paddy fields in Nemmara and, if so, what steps had the government taken to contain it. Outbreak confirmed K. Krishna Warriar, who replied for the government, confirmed that there indeed was an outbreak “in Vrischigam last.” “The Agricultural Inspector and the Entomologist were ordered to carry out the control measures. The methods were demonstrated in the infected fields and the ryots in the adjoining fields were advised to carry out similar measures,” Mr. Krishna Warriar is quoted as saying in the council proceedings. Assembly records Kerala Assembly documents for November 1983 and July 1997 also mention locust attacks in Udumbanchola taluk and Kizhakke Mattukada, near Kattappana. In the first instance, cardamom crop came under attack, and in the second, pepper, cardamom, coffee, rubber and banana. That said, agriculture experts feel that the villains in many of the reported ‘invasions’ in Kerala were probably coffee locusts ( Aularches miliaris ) rather than the desert locust (a species of short-horned grasshopper of the family Acrididae) that now menaces many Indian States. Major attack However, in 1954 Kerala did face the desert locust and it was documented. That year the monsoon had been weak and wind patterns were favourable to locust movement. In a new report urging the Agriculture Department to keep close tabs on the national-level scenario, Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) has recalled this particular instance. “This was documented as the major attack in Kerala. Sightings of locust and their occurrence as swarms, however, are entirely different things. There is also the case of mistaken identity. Attacks by coffee locusts are often confused as that by desert locusts,” said Madhu Subra, Director of Research, KAU. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), which has been closely monitoring the locust attacks in other States, believes that Kerala would be spared an invasion as the monsoon winds would act as a deterrent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-past-encounters-with-locusts/article31753482.ece
05 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Lockdown no hurdle for these dragonfly enthusiasts||No virus, no lockdown, no pandemic can deter nature lovers from pursuing their passion. Dragonfly enthusiasts of Kerala proved it by organising ‘Lockdown Odonata Watch’ to record 95 rare and endemic species. Dragonflies thrive in waterbodies and emerge one by one when summer showers wet the parched lands after the dry months of March and April. ‘Odonutters’ So in May, the ‘odonutters’ (serious dragonfly watchers) would rush to wetlands and forested streams, eager to welcome the newborns. But, things took a turn for the worse this year for odonutters with the lockdown coming into force. For them, “Lockdown Odonata Watch” was a perfect opportunity to look for flying jewels in their own backyards. Organised by the Society For Odonate Studies (SOS), the exercise was conducted through the Dragonflies of Kerala Facebook forum, the social media arm of SOS. Its members were requested to share photographs or check-lists of odonata from their neighbourhoods with details. A total of 95 species were recorded, including many rare and endemic species from the 14 districts. Of them, 20 are endemic.

Bhagyalakshmi to earn the employed status, but the amount she made every month was not enough. Having a post-graduate degree in humanities, Ms. Bhagyalakshmi, a mother, chose to be auto-rickshaw driver in her free time to support her family. Even as she continues with her job at RTA office, she finds driving her auto more remunerative. And the YSR Vahan Mitra scheme which provides an annual cash incentive of Rs. 10,000 to auto, taxi and cab drivers who own their vehicles helped her. Bhagyalakshmi, in her late twenties, was the lone beneficiary chosen from the district to interact with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy from the District Collector’s office via video link as he launched the second phase of YSR Vahana Mitra scheme on Thursday. “Initially, I used to run a small marriage bureau, but never earned enough to make a decent living. As a computer operator at the RTO office, I do not make enough to meet family’s needs. I have a child to look after and my husband works at a petrol filling station. I make Rs. 500 a day by driving auto in my free time. And the Vahana Mitra scheme is a big help for all drivers like us,” Ms. Bhagyalakshmi told The Hindu after her interaction with the Chief Minister. An elated Bhagyalakshmi urged Mr. Jagan Mohan Rreddy to arrange for institutional loans for auto drivers so that a majority of them could buy their own vehicles. Four of the 30 women auto drivers from the district, all beneficiaries of Vahana Mitra, were present in the video conference, along with some of their male counterparts.  Rs. 12.56 crore disbursed Hindupur MP Gorantla Madhav, Kalyandurg MLA K.V. Ushasri Charan and YSRCP leader Samanthakamani handed over a cheque for Rs. 10,000 and a certificate to each beneficiary in the presence of Collector Gandham Chandrudu.

05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||A.P., TS agree to share DPRs of new projects on the Krishna||A meeting of the Krishna river management board here on Thursday ended with another agreement between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh that they will submit the detailed project reports (DPRs) of irrigation projects taken up by them on Krishna after obtaining permission of their respective State governments. The meeting was held amidst charges and counter charges by the two State governments over construction of irrigation projects by both of them on Krishna without the prior approval of an apex council to settle river water disputes between the two States. The agreement to furnish DPRs for appraisal and technical clearance by KRMB and Central Water Commission and sanction by an apex council headed by Union Minister for Water Resources was reached at such meetings on several occasions in the past but they were not submitted so far. At today's meeting again both the States were directed to submit DPRs and they agreed to it with due permission from their respective governments. The meeting, under the chairmanship of K. Paramesham, on Thursday was held in the backdrop of Telangana government complaining to KRMB on May 12 that AP accorded administrative sanction for a new pumping scheme to draw additional three tmc ft water from Srisailam reservoir in contravention of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Since any such project can be taken up only with the prior approval of the apex council, the board was requested to prevent AP government from taking further action. Two days later, AP government complained to KRMB that Telangana went ahead with execution of Palamuru - Rangareddy, Dindi, Bhaktha Ramdas and Thummilla lift irrigation schemes and a water grid project taken up under Mission Bhagiratha without any appraisal by the board and approval of apex council. Telangana was also blamed for enhancing the scope of Kalwakurthi and Nettempadu lift irrigation schemes and Srisailam left bank canal. It was also decided at today's meeting that the ratio of water sharing between AP and Telangana will be in the ratio of 66:34 like last year till finalisation of decision regarding usage of water in minor irrigation sources and diversion of Godavari water. The power generated from common hydel project at Srisailam will be shared in the ratio of 50:50 in the current water year which commenced four days ago. The surplus water used by the two States in the last water year when the dams had surplus due to flooding would be compensated in the ratio of 50:50 till finalisation of the issue by a committee. A committee will also make field visit to account for losses in Nagarjunasagar left canal and the Central Water Commission will decide the issue of accounting for 20% withdrawals made towards domestic water supply. The contention of Telangana government to account carry over part of its share in Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar projects as part of allocation in previous water year was left for further discussion after getting the views of AP government. The issue of sharing water diverted from Godavari to Krishna basin was left to the Central government. The Principal Irrigation Secretaries of Telangana and AP Rajat Kumar and Adityanath Das and senior irrigation officials of two States took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-agree-to-share-dprs-of-new-irrigation-projects/article31753407.ece

They say that the norms should be strictly adhered to along the NH passing through Visakhapatnam, Bhogapuram, Srikakulam, Itchapuram stretch where the six-lane works have been under way. “Same is the situation on the Raipur-Vizianagaram-Visakhapatnam stretch where many trees have been uprooted in the last three years. The NHAI is shirking its responsibility to develop greenery after completion of the works. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has observed that the NHAI has been lax in this regard,” said Green Bank chairman G. Pushpanatham on the eve of World Environmental Day on Thursday. He alleged that despite several directions to the NHAI, the Green Highways Mission guidelines were not being followed. Meanwhile, fingers are being pointed to the lack of coordination between the NHAI and the Forest Department when it comes to undertaking plantation drives after the construction of highways. Hardly any such drive was undertaken to replenish the greenery in the event of uprooting of trees. “Vehicular pollution is causing harm to the environment and development greenery is only solution. Unfortunately, the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board is not taking the issue seriously. The government must issue a directive to ensure adequate greenery along the highways,” said Mr. Pushpanatham. Meanwhile, the Social Forestry Department has expressed its displeasure over the violation of norms associated with plantation drive. “The NHAI authorities depend on private contractors for development of greenery along the highways and the later ignore the technical specifications pertaining to selection of trees. Only certain plant species can survive along the highways,” said a senior officer of Forest Department on the condition of anonymity. NHAI responds However, NHAI General Manager-cum-Project Director P. Sivasankar refuted the allegations. “Nearly 3,000 saplings have been planted between the strech of Ranasthalam of Srikakulam district and Anandapuram of Visakhapatnam district. It needs three years for the growth of the plants to be seen. We are trying to develop greenery simultaneously while constructing the six-lane highway,” he told the The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nhai-ignoring-greenery-development-along-highways/article31753600.ece

Girisha said around Rs. 20 crore had been earmarked for developing the tank and the works would be executed in two phases. “Steps will be taken to protect the local biodiversity,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vinayaka-sagar-to-get-a-facelift-at-rs-1136-cr/article31753607.ece

05 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Hotels, resorts will reopen on June 8’||After a prolonged lockdown necessitated by the rapid spread of coronavirus, the hospitality sector, one of the worst-hit segments, is trying to revive activities. “Hotels and restaurants across the State will reopen on June 8 but in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols,” Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao announced at a press conference here on Thursday. Now that attempts are being made to gradually resume operations, the tourism sector plans to re-start the boating activity very soon. The Minister said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will inaugurate nine command control rooms set up to operate the boating activity, next week, paving the way for resumption of the recreational facility. Stakeholders’ meeting The department called for a stakeholders’ meeting, attended by Special Chief Secretary (Tourism) Rajat Bhargav and Managing Director of the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) Praveen Kumar, who explained to them about the significance of scrupulously following the COVID guidelines put in place by the Central government while operating their units. Most big hotels, restaurants and resorts in the State are located in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Kakinada, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram and all of them will open the doors to the public on June 8.  “After Gujarat, our State has the longest coastline in the country, giving us scope to explore tourism opportunities at our beautiful beaches, rivers, dense forest lands and temples,” said the Minister, adding that people concerned should not lose sight of the protocol at any point. Bhimili Utsav Speaking about the series of festivals and other initiatives taken up by the department last year, the Minister pointed to the Bhimili Utsav held in Visakhapatnam in November, Visakha Utsav in December, Araku Utsav in February, Flamingo Festival in Nellore, Gandikota Utsav in Kadapa district, Suryalanka Beach Festival in Guntur district, Horsley Hills Adventures in Chittoor district, Lepakshi Festival in Anantapur and other beach festivals. “We also participated in tourism summits, both national and international, in Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi, Greater Noida and international events like travel marts and tourism expos in Dubai and Japan,” he said. He said construction of five-star and seven-star hotels was being planned at tourist spots and added that the government was eager to put the State on the international tourism map.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hotels-resorts-will-reopen-on-june-8/article31753049.ece
05 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Rampant corruption in housing programme’||Ahead of the distribution of house site pattas, the TDP has launched a diatribe against the YSRCP government, accusing it of turning it into a big scam and resorting to forcible collections. It was only on Wednesday that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy directed officials to clear the Rs. 1,323 crore housing dues to the poor. TDP national president N. Chadrababu Naidu, in a series of tweets on Thursday, accused the YSRCP leaders of “luring and looting” the poor. “The YSRCP leaders have fixed Rs. 30,000, Rs. 60,000 and Rs. 1.50 lakh as rates for sanction of houses. The rate varies, depending upon the distance and the village,” Mr. Naidu alleged. “With this, the YSRCP goes down in history as the only party that has resorted to corruption even in the welfare programmes,” he said. “A fact-finding committee has unearthed Rs. 400 crore fraud in the ‘aava’ (low-lying) lands. Lands not worth Rs. 7 lakh per acre are being bought by the government for Rs. 45 lakh to Rs. 70 lakh, and the margin amounts are going into the pockets of the YCP leaders. Land acquisition for house sites has turned into a massive scam,” Mr. Naidu alleged. The TDP government had sanctioned 29.52 lakh houses and completed 9.1 lakh units. House- warming ceremony was performed in three phases for 8 lakh houses. Another 20.41 lakh houses were in various stages of completion, he said, and claimed that ‘mass house-warming’ programme had become a model for the country. “The government is not allotting the completed houses to the beneficiaries out of spite. The houses have been converted into quarantine centres,” he alleged. “Also, during the TDP rule, house sites were given to 4.02 lakh people. Pattas were given in Visakhapatnam and other parts of north coastal Andhra and also Rayalaseema. All these benefits have been stopped. This is reflective of the YCP’s unchecked political harassment at every step,” Mr. Naidu alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rampant-corruption-in-housing-programme/article31753614.ece
05 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State’s economy in a shambles: Yanamala||Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and TDP Polit Bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Thursday alleged that the State’s economy has suffered a downturn during the one-year rule of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said Mr. Jagan does not have basic understanding of how a State or a country’s economy works. The State government could not sustain the double-digit growth rate of 11.02% achieved during TDP rule. Now it has fallen to 8%, and Andhra Pradesh, which used to be in the third position in the country with regard to contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has slipped to the ninth place due to “the self-destructive and debilitating economic policies” of the YSRCP, he said. The previous government succeeded in increasing the per capita income from Rs. 93,000 to Rs. 1.64 lakh.  ‘Debt burden on rise’ The average loans taken during the previous government were Rs. 24,000 per year, but the present government has taken loans amounting Rs. 80,000 crore in just a year, he pointed out. AP emerged as a favourite destination for national and international investors during TDP rule but the its image took a beating after the YSRCP came to power. Highest priority was given to crippling of systems and institutions, he alleged. How the State could get income when YSRCP leaders were exploiting and plundering all natural resources from sand to minerals, he asked. The police machinery was weakened and subjugated to protect the ruling party’s interests. Orders and judgments of the courts were not being adhered to. Government money was being distributed to YSRCP activists by giving them volunteer posts, the TDP leader alleged.. The ruling party’s intention was to hijack elections by using money and muscle power, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-economy-in-a-shambles-yanamala/article31753616.ece

Chandrababu Naidu of using Dalits as mere vote bank, and said he had gained political mileage at their cost. At a press conference, Mr. Suresh said the former Chief Minister used derogatory language against the Dalits and owed an apology to the community. He alleged that Mr. Naidu’s single-point agenda was to create hurdles in the implementation of the welfare schemes. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has spent over Rs. 6,000 crore to empower and educate the Dalit community through various welfare programmes in the last one year. This is in contrast to TDP rule when Dalits were insulted and betrayed and the SC Sub-Plan funds were diverted by the Naidu government for self-gain,” the Minister said. ‘Give useful tips’ Mr. Suresh said Mr. Naidu’s five-year rule was all about self-publicising, jugglery of numbers and diversion of funds. Referring to Dr. Sudhakar’s issue, the Minister said Mr. Naidu was trying to give it a caste colour. “If Mr. Naidu is concerned about people, he should give useful suggestions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-playing-dalit-card-for-political-gain-alleges-minister/article31753617.ece

He stated that the farmers’ demands were genuine as they had given their valuable lands under the pooling scheme. But the Chief Minister was least bothered about their plight, he alleged. People too were demanding that the capital be retained in Amaravati, Mr. Lakshminarayana added.

05 June 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Complaints of patients being fleeced for coronavirus tests are exaggerated’||Complaints by several people that private hospitals are charging Rs. 10,000 from each person to conduct COVID-19 tests seem to be exaggerated, sources in the Health Department said. There were reports that many people in the city who were going to private hospitals for unrelated ailments were being forced to undergo COVID-19 tests and shell out large sums of money. However, sources in the Health Department refuted the reports. “Chances of private hospitals fleecing patients are remote, as COVID-19 test is not mandatory for asymptomatic patients going to private hospitals for other treatments,” they said. COVID-19 testing has to be done either at the Virology Lab of King George Hospital (KGH) or at the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), which is being done free of cost in Andhra Pradesh. A few private hospitals have been authorised by the government to collect samples and send them to KGH or GHCCD for confirmation. “There is a possibility of pulmonologists or ENT specialists at private hospitals charging around Rs. 2,500 for drawing the sample. Complaints that the doctors are charging Rs. 10,000 for the COVID-19 test seem to be exaggerated,” said a senior official, while adding that he did not rule out the possibility of patients being exploited. A man had taken his mother to ESI Hospital for the COVID-19 test, and the sample was drawn but they were not charged any fee. The special kits for drawing the samples are supplied by the Health Department and the samples are sent to the Virology Lab at KGH, according to the source. “The public should visit the KGH or GHCCD for COVID tests, as the medical staff have gained considerable experience in testing and the results would be accurate,” opined a government doctor who did not want to be quoted. Meanwhile, social activist and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma, in a letter to Special Chief Secretary (Health) K.S. Jawahar Reddy, said that a patient complained to him that a private hospital charged Rs. 10,000 for a COVID-19 test, as a prerequisite for performing a surgical procedure on him. The patient, who was suffering from a kidney ailment, was referred by ESI Hospital to a private hospital for a surgical procedure. The doctors allegedly wanted to do a COVID-19 test before performing the surgery to ensure that the patient was not already infected. “The private hospital in question had charged only Rs. 5,000, and not Rs. 10,000 as alleged, for consumables like PPE equipment to be worn by the doctor for treating asymptomatic patients who need to undergo other treatments. The PPE equipment has to be purchased and the doctor cannot risk his/her life for treating such cases,” Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, Principal of Andhra Medical College who conducted a probe into the allegations, told The Hindu on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/complaints-of-patients-being-fleeced-for-coronavirus-tests-are-exaggerated/article31753635.ece
05 June 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Polluting industries become a cause of worry for Vizagites||The City of Destiny has lost some of its allure over the years, feel denizens who have grown up in the city. Known for its beaches, mountains and Buddhist heritage sites, Visakhapatnam still holds sway in the country’s tourist map, but residents say the skyrocketing pollution has taken an incalculable toll on their quality of life. Recurring industrial accidents and high pollution levels had earned Vizag the dubious tag of a ‘critically polluted city’ from the Central Pollution Control Board in 2009 itself. “North Andhra, particularly Vizag and its surroundings, has become a destination for clusters of chemical manufacturing units, many of which handle highly hazardous substances. Such industries are moving to these parts from the West, as a result of lax regulation by bodies such as APPCB and the Inspectorate of Factories,” social activist and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma told The Hindu . “During the last few years, around 40 serious accidents have taken place, resulting in both workers and others losing their lives. Unregulated chemical manufacturing industries belching out toxic pollutants have adversely affected the health, both short-term and long-term, of people living near the units. It is a pity that authorities rarely learn their lessons, resulting in the recurrence of such ghastly accidents as the one that occurred on May 7 at LG Polymers,” Mr. Sarma said. Safety concerns The National Green Tribunal, which took up a case suo moto against LG Polymers after a gas leak at its plant in the city on May 7 left 12 people dead and over 500 hospitalised, held the view that the South Korean company had absolute liability for the accident. The incident raised serious safety concerns even as the State Government launched an exercise to conduct a safety audit of 86 hazardous industries, most of which are located in the city limits. “The pitiable part is that despite so many fatal incidents at regular intervals, beginning with the vapour cloud explosion at HPCL Visakh Refinery that claimed over 60 lives in 1997, the findings of the reports have neither found a place in public domain nor has any action initiated against the officials responsible for safety lapses,” an official said. As the rest of the world marks World Environment Day on June 5, noted risk analyst Sagar Dhara said a Damocles’ sword is hanging over the people of the city of Vizag due to the presence of several industries without specifying the risk perceptions and conveying to the people in the neighbourhood about the vulnerability of the industry in the event of any accident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/polluting-industries-become-a-cause-of-worry-for-vizagites/article31753645.ece
05 June 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Short voyage gives hope of big catch ahead for fishermen||The short voyage undertaken by a few boats that returned to the shore on Thursday has raised the hopes of a rich harvest post ban period among the fishermen of North Andhra. A few dozen mechanised boats and beach landing crafts returned with a good catch of brown prawn. Some captured miscellaneous fish like vanjiram, gulivendula, ribbon fish, senku, small lizard and goat fish. “We got a good catch of brown shrimp but it fetched with head-on only Rs. 350 per kg. We expect it to go up further once seafood exporters come forward to buy from us after completion of long voyages of a week or two,” Vasupalli Raju, whose two boats returned after a short voyage, told The Hindu .  The new fishing season was launched from midnight of Tuesday after holding Gangamma Jatara though the permission to venture into sea was given from midnight of Monday. Pre-monsoon showers generally ensure a big catch for fishermen. “Generally, boats which go on day fishing to Bheemili or nearby areas or up to Kalingapatnam on a 12-hour voyage return with a good catch. The real results will be known after a long voyage for at least a week or so,” Laxman Rao, Assistant Director of Fisheries, clarified. Unprepared The annual fishing ban, an initiative by the Government of India for conservation by facilitating breeding, began as scheduled from April 15 to June 15 in the entire east coast. It was prematurely ended on May 31 springing a big surprise to many. The ice plants here were not prepared to supply ice for refrigeration of fish on-board the boat. The boats neither could complete annual overhauling due to shortage of money and time. Enough boat crew were not available as many migrated back to their native places due to COVID-19 pandemic, said Dolphin Boat Owners’ Welfare Association president Ch. Satyanarayana Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/short-voyage-gives-hope-of-big-catch-ahead-for-fishermen/article31753625.ece

Dr. D. Raghunadha Rao, former Director of HBCH&RC, recalled the contribution of the hospital towards providing better medical care to cancer patients in the last six years. The biggest initiative was cancer screening and prevention programme for mother-daughter pairs, wherein mothers were screened for cervical and breast cancer and daughters were given Human Papillomma Virus (HPV) vaccination to protect them against cervical cancer. The cancer care services were expanded recently to include a new outpatient department (OPD) with six rooms, empanelment for YSR Aarogyasri scheme and many PSUs like Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited. Comprehensive care Dr. Umesh Mahanshetty, Director of HBCH&RC, said that the construction of the main hospital building was expected to be completed in the next few months, which would then help achieve the institute’s goal of providing comprehensive cancer care under one roof. Around 15,000 cancer patients from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Bangladesh would benefit upon the full-fledged commissioning of the hospital, officials said. The plan was to develop smaller peripheral cancer centres based on ‘hub and spoke model’ for prevention, screening and affordable high-quality cancer treatment at the community level. Dr. Mahanshetty said that a pilot ECHO project was launched for providing online training to nurses in cancer screening and prevention, in collaboration with ICMR – NICPR, New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/homi-bhabha-cancer-hospital-celebrates-sixth-anniversary/article31753630.ece

The staff will wash their face, hands and legs after every one hour and maintain personal hygiene,” Visakha Hotel Merchants Association president C.S.N. Raju and general secretary B. Nagaraju told the media here on Thursday. They said that many of the staff had left for their homes before the lockdown and were yet to return. The hotels said that while they would reduce their occupancy by 50%, there would be no increase in prices. They said that high power tariff was being collected in the name of a ‘minimum demand’ charge. Some of the hotels, being run from rented accommodation, were facing a severe financial crisis and they were not in a position to pay the rent for the lockdown period. The association leaders appealed to the building owners to settle the issue amicably with the hoteliers, lodges, sweet shops, bakeries and parlours so that neither party was badly affected. They were not in a position to pay the rent for the lockdown period (March 22 to June 30) and for six months from the date of reopening, they should be allowed to pay 50% rent, they said. Former president of the association, Talluri Satyanarayana, said that no benefit was given to the hotel industry though they suffered huge losses due to the lockdown. He said that the government should extend the benefits given to MSMEs to hotels as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hotels-to-receive-guests-from-june-8/article31753632.ece
05 June 2020||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||CITU to stage protest against LG Polymers today||The Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) will hold a peaceful demonstration on June 5 in protest against the ‘indifference’ of LG Polymers to the deaths caused by a gas leak at its plant in the city on May 7. CITU will be supported in its protest by people’s organisations across the country, as well as some outfits in other countries, the organisation’s State president Ch. Narasinga Rao said on Thursday. Addressing a press meet, Mr. Narasinga Rao said that a human chain will be formed by the victims and representatives of CITU and people’s organisations at 10 a.m. from Simhachalam junction to Vepagunta. Protests would also be held in Gujarat, and also in South Korea, Singapore, and Nepal. Mr. Narasinga Rao demanded that the government announce compensation to Venkayamma and Y. Kanakaraju, who died later in hospital reportedly from the after-effects of inhaling the styrene monomer vapour. The CITU leader said that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had given two interim judgments on the incident. First, it ordered the company management to deposit Rs. 50 crore for the damage caused by it. It then appointed another committee to come up with suggestions on preventing accidents. ‘Many violations’ The LG Polymers plant was seized by the government on the interim orders of the High Court. The committees appointed by the NGT and the High Court found fault with the company management for its negligence. The committees had pointed out, among other things, that the LG plant was being operated without environmental clearance for the past 18 years. He said that the clearance given to the company by the APPCB in 2017 was the responsibility of the then State Government. He alleged that in the name of Ease of Doing Business, the Centre and State Governments were failing to strictly implement environmental laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/citu-to-stage-protest-against-lg-polymers-today/article31753641.ece
05 June 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Styrene leak: Directorate of Factories faults LG Polymers||In a report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the Directorate of Factories has faulted the management of LG Polymers India for the leakage of styrene monomer (SM) vapour on May 7 that killed 12 persons and hospitalised over 500 in the city. “The management has failed to understand and manage the impact of changes in the storage of styrene monomer due to the lockdown,” the Directorate of Factories said in its report. The Government of Andhra Pradesh had announced resumption of industrial operations from May 4, and the management of LG Polymers proposed to resume activity from May 7. “When the top layer of SM is more vulnerable to polymerisation in the tank, samples had been taken only from the bottom of the tank. Even after detecting a sudden rise in polymer content in SM at the bottom, no attempts were made to understand the condition at the top of the tank,” the report said. The Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) constituted by the NGT too had stated in its report that there was no temperature measuring apparatus at the middle and top levels of the tank. The Directorate of Factories also pointed out that there was no mechanism to monitor the level of dissolved oxygen in the tank, as a result of which TBC, a polymerisation inhibitor, could not be added. This was a vital safety requirement. No attempts were made for putting the SM in circulation in the tank, it said. The NGT, in its order on June 1, had stated that the unit was operating without prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). The NGT order also stated that issuance of the statutory Consent for Establishment (CFE) and Consent for Operation (CFO) by the A.P. Pollution Control Board for expansion of the company lacked clarity. The root cause Subsequently, the PCB withdrew the consent given to the company and issued the ‘stop production’ order on May 7. The company, in a letter on May 11, had said that the plant would be kept under shutdown till necessary approvals were obtained. The NGT report also said that the root cause appeared to be lack of experience of LG Polymers India and its Korean holding company, LG Chem, in monitoring and maintaining full tanks of styrene, which were kept idle for a long period without operation. This led to rise in temperature, which had gone unnoticed, causing auto polymerisation and creation of vapour that leaked out through the goose neck and dip hatch. Mincing no words, the NGT order held the managing director of the unit, the certified safety officer, and the safety and production departments accountable for the lapses. It also highlighted the role of issuing safety certificate to the factory, as periodic inspection was the job of the Department of Industries, Factories and Boilers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/styrene-leak-directorate-of-factories-faults-lg-polymers/article31753381.ece

Satyanarayana and two others at Komallapudi on June 3. Police initially suspected that old enmity might have been the reason behind the attack, but are now suspecting that political rivalry could have been the trigger. According to Butchayyapeta police station Sub-Inspector D. Venkanna, Mr. Satyanarayana along with G. Naganna Dora and G. Naveen were walking home when a group of unidentified miscreants in an auto-rickshaw hit them with the vehicle and then attacked them with knives.

Rokandla Karnaker, farther of Vennala who is a student of Sri Chaitanya Residential School, Hyderabad, says the authorities are reluctant to open hostels for the students thanks to the threat of COVID-19 spread. Moreover, there are no hotels for parents to stay in Hyderabad, he added.

05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||How are doctors becoming vulnerable, HC asks govt.||How did 37 doctors working in different government hospitals in the State contract coronavirus despite the government supplying them PPE kits and other safety gear? Posing this question while hearing a batch of PIL pleas on COVID-19 situation and the way government was handling it, Telangana High Court asked the government to explain how the doctors were becoming vulnerable to the virus. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy asked Advocate General B.S. Prasad how so many doctors tested positive for the virus despite the government’s claims that it was providing all safety gear to the doctors attending on coronavirus patients. The bench said that earlier the government had filed affidavits that PPE kits, N95 masks, gloves and goggles were being supplied to all the doctors and para-medical staff attending on and treating persons affected by COVID-19. Lawyer Chikkudu Prabhakar, representing one of the petitioners professor P.L. Vishweshwar Rao, told the bench that the government failed to provide safety gear to doctors and other staff exposing them to the risk of contracting the virus. They were testing positive since the government was often tomtomming that they were doing everything to keep the doctors safe, failed in supplying with the required tools and gear to them. On one hand the government was depriving doctors of safety gear and on the other hand no serious efforts were being made to trace the primary contacts of persons testing positive for the virus, he contended. The AG requested the bench to adjourn the matter to present more detailed information on the matter. The bench posted all the pleas to Monday for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/how-are-doctors-becoming-vulnerable-hc-asks-govt/article31753388.ece
05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Realty behind banyan trees on fire?||Trees speak on the Chevella highway. Each of the banyan trees between Moinabad and Manneguda via Chevella has a tale to tell. Some with their trunks hollowed out and burnt, others hacked, still others with their branches mutilated by fire. A few more by their non-existence, they all do not need words to speak. While the Forest department, which is entrusted with the responsibility to protect them, claims that they all had been victims of a ground fire three years ago, evidence on the ground speaks otherwise. Deliberate attempts to obliterate existence of the trees were evident wherever the tree stumps were covered with grass, so as to make them invisible. Three such attempts where burnt tree stumps were covered with dried stalks and hay were found by The Hindu which inspected the area close to Mirjaguda village. Two more spots at the same location showed hollow ground where a banyan had previously existed. Quite a few banyans lay collapsed to ground, unable to stand the weight after their stems were partially hollowed out and burnt. Scores of the species are on their way to similar fate, their stems burned to varied extents. At least 25 such trees were enumerated by the The Hindu on the Chevella road. Some trees were found with dried twigs carefully stacked near the base, probably for setting afire at nightfall. Typically, several trees had the hollowed and burnt portions facing away from the road, giving them the appearance of false normal. Also, trees lining the plotted layouts were found to be all right, while those lining the farm lands were burnt. Enquiries with farmers got a stock reply, that the trees caught fire when cigarettes thrown by callous passers-by landed on the dry grass. “I noticed the banyan trees burning five years ago too. During summer, dry grass catches fire easily, and extends to the trees. Also, farmers set the crop stubble on fire,” says Rakesh, a local. He, however, had no explanation why the phenomenon started only recently, while the trees were 80 to 90 years old. Srinivas, watchman at an eucalyptus plantation near Mirjaguda, has a different version. “Farmers started burning the trees deliberately, using hay and kerosene, after the land prices began spiralling. Having a banyan blocking the view reduces the land prices,” he says. Also, the planned expansion of the national highway between Hyderabad and Bijapur, which would have given them a better price for the land, was hampered by the environmental activists who had campaigned against the move to remove the trees from there. “This highway, no doubt, needs to be expanded. But the banyans could be saved by translocation. I urged the department to allow me to translocate them free of cost. Several persons came forward to adopt them too. But the tree protection committee needs to take a call on that,” P.Uday Krishna, an environmentalist from Vata Foundation, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/realty-behind-banyan-trees-on-fire/article31753399.ece
05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Private bus operators await guidelines for resuming inter-State services||This lockdown has been a rough ride for private bus operators. With little or no clarity as to when inter-State operations are likely to resume, and with pending tax payments and salaries to staff, bus owners are a worried about the massive loss in revenues. Private bus operators told The Hindu that there are thousands whose livelihoods are dependent on resumption of bus services. A vast majority of them are in dire straits due to the lockdown. “There are around 2,500 private buses in Telangana. Each bus provides livelihood to as many as 10 people. These include drivers, helpers, electricians and mechanics, among others. With the lockdown a huge number do not have any means of livelihood,” said Khursheed Ali from the Hyderabad and Secunderabad Bus Owners Association. Mr. Khurshid said that while operations remain suspended, associations are yet to receive clear instructions or guidelines on what measures are to be taken upon resumption of services. “We are ready to comply with social distancing norms and sanitisation of vehicles. But the problem is that there is no word from the government on this thus far,” he said. What has associations worried about are payments under the Motor Vehicle Tax which are made quarterly. Exemptions have been sought, and a petition has been filed in the courts of law. “Some states, like Kerala, have given a partial concession on payments. We are waiting for a counter to be filed and the hearing is posted for the coming Monday,” Mr. Khursheed said. On Thursday, a delegation of private bus owners met Transport Department Principal Secretary Sunil Sharma in connection with their concerns and submitted a representation. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr Sharma said: “We are examining this. We are also examining as to when inter-State services can be resumed.” Throwing light on the current scenario, chief operating officer of the online transport aggregator Abhibus Rohit Sharma said that there are around 1,000 private bus operators in South India. With the lockdown over the past couple of months, a conservative estimation of losses would be up to Rs. 12 crore per day, given an occupancy of up to 90%. He also observed that there has not been an increase in bus fares. Underscoring manpower as the biggest challenge which the industry has been facing in these circumstances, and touching upon the changes the industry could see, he said: “What I am hearing is that there is a need to go leaner, push for automation and cut costs with less dependency on manpower.” Other than drivers, several other roles or processes could be replaced by automation. Mr. Sharma said that operators are ‘more than keen’ to have the basic checks and balances — such as sanitisation — in place, and portended that standard operating procedures as seen in aviation sector could be encouraged within the bus industry. The fluid pick-up and drops could be a thing of the past, with more specific and structured processes replacing them, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/private-bus-operators-await-guidelines-for-resuming-inter-state-services/article31753428.ece

At NIMS, four more resident doctors and one professor from cardiology department were detected with COVID-19. Four resident doctors and three staff members from the same department were detected with the disease on Wednesday, taking the total number of infected to 12. NIMS Resident Doctors Association (RDA) president Dr G Srinivas said that those who tested positive are undergoing treatment in the institute. The cluster might increase as more doctors from the cardiology department are feared to have contracted the infectious disease. The source is not known yet.

Till date, two junior doctors, one senior resident doctor, one associate professor and a lab technician from the hospital tested positive. After spike in cases among doctors who worked in non-COVID hospitals, doctors at Gandhi Hospital said that there are high chances that some among them too are infected, but asymptomatic. The first cluster of cases among doctors in the State was detected among the professionals who attended to patients in Osmania General Hospital and hospitals affiliated to it. Till date, a total of 24 of them tested positive. Of them, 15 are house surgeons and post-graduate students who stay in Osmania Medical College (OMC) hostel in Koti.

The woman filed a habeas corpus petition requesting the court to direct the government to present him before it and declare attempts of officials to hide whereabouts of her husband as illegal. A bench headed by Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan directed the government to furnish details over the points raised by the petitioner. Along with the woman, 10 other members of her family including her husband, in-laws, tested positive for COVID-19 in the last week of April. Her husband’s elder brother was the first to contract the virus. Eventually, the woman and her husband and the in-laws contracted the virus. Not informed While her husband’s brother recuperated, her father-in-law died on April 29 while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital. His body was cremated as per the medical protocols. The woman, however, claimed that authorities failed to inform the condition of her husband. She maintained that only after she tweeted to IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao about her husband’s condition on May 1 did the authorities announce that her husband died and his body was cremated by the GHMC. As per the rules, the authorities should have video recorded the entire process of transporting and cremating the body. But they had not released any such video till now, the housewife contended. The woman said action of the officials raised several suspicions in the minds of the family members and hence approached the HC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/woman-files-habeas-corpus-petition-seeking-finality-about-husbands-death/article31753389.ece
05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Quarantine on rotation basis for 50% of frontline workers||Jolted by the possibility that large number of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals at Telangana government hospitals might contract COVID-19 leading to staff crunch, Health department officials are taking series of steps to avoid the crisis. One among them is to keep half the work force under quarantine for seven days on rotation basis. After cases were detected among junior doctors who worked in government hospitals, it was published in these columns that the hospital managements would face shortage of doctors and nurses if more cases are detected. A contingency plan was not communicated to the hospital administration until two days ago. The impending crisis demands urgent attention as 33 doctors in the government facility worked in non-COVID Hospitals. A total of 24 doctors from Osmania General Hospital and hospitals affiliated to it and nine from Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) tested positive for coronavirus. As the virus is spreading in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits exponentially, doctors in non-COVID hospitals might attend to patients who have COVID-19 without either of them knowing about the infection status of the patients. It was learnt that Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy held a meeting with heads of government hospitals on the issue on Wednesday. He issued orders to superintendents and principals of government hospitals and colleges in GHMC limits on Thursday about precautions to be taken. He directed them to divide faculty, post-graduate students, para-medical and outsourcing staff involved in patient care into two batches. While one batch will be under quarantine for seven days, the other batch will attend patients, and vice versa. “If any staff member develops symptoms, he or she should be immediately isolated and tested. If found positive for coronavirus, they should be sent for treatment and a replacement should come from the quarantine pool of staff,” Dr Reddy said. He has also directed them to ensure that the institution head should make available adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), masks. A senior Resident Medical Officer (RMO) should monitor the supply. “There should not be any scope for complaints of non-availability of PPEs and masks,” the senior official directed the hospital heads. Similar instructions were issued to heads of hospitals under purview of Telangana Vaidhya Vidhana Parishad (TVVP).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/quarantine-on-rotation-basis-for-50-of-frontline-workers/article31753387.ece

05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Telangana has stopped screening domestic passengers||Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is noting details of each and every passenger arriving by bus, train or plane even before they travel, on a website. On arrival, they are sent to institutional or home quarantine. Testing for COVID-19 is being taken up extensively and the results decide on the extent of quarantine at home, institution or whether to be sent to the designated health centres. Delhi government too has notified that passengers arriving by rains, buses or planes should go for a one-week mandatory quarantine. However, the situation here is different. While international visitors at airport are being sent for mandatory institutional quarantine in the designated hotels, domestic passengers are being checked for temperatures with thermal screeners and allowed to go. “Only those found symptomatic among the domestic arrivals or departures will be handed over to the health authorities concerned as per the government orders and till date there is no such case,” informed airport sources, when asked. Interestingly, at the Secunderabad railway station, TS medical and health department officials have been camping, taking down details of every passenger coming through the special trains from New Delhi and Bengaluru from mid-May onwards and stamping ‘home quarantine’ on the hands. However, the practice has been dispensed with once the railways started running more special trains from different parts of the country June 1 onwards! “We are only screening the boarding passengers for temperature checks. There has been no sign of the TS health officials for last couple of days; so there is no surveillance of the passengers arriving here,” informed senior railway officials, on condition of anonymity. An estimated 80,000 passengers have arrived in Secunderabad and Hyderabad (Nampally) stations from Monday onwards already and it could cross one lakh by Friday morning, they added. Sources in the State Health department confirmed that they have stopped screening, taking down details of passengers at Secunderabad Railway Station from June 1. “It was discontinued after relaxations on other services were implemented,” sources said.

Rama Rao said Telangana government had used it to the maximum extent in analysing the cases and distribution of ration to the poor and migrants. Mr. Rama Rao, who addressed the World Economic Forum (WEF) Regional Action Group for the South Asia meeting virtually, said technology has helped citizens and the governments overcome problems during the crisis situation. The Minister highlighted that technology helped the State government communicate with the Union government and also interact with the officers and public representatives at the district and mandal level. He said that drones were used to spray disinfectants and this helped in preventing the spread of the virus to a great deal in rural areas. Drones helped police officials in crowd management during the lockdown. Explaining how technology helped in ration distribution in such distress times when nothing was moving, he said that usage of technology has not only solved problems but has created new opportunities in the State.

In the backdrop of the pandemic-induced gloomy scenario, the Archery Association of India (AAI) in association with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) recently introduced an online training programme for coaches to enhance their domain knowledge and upgrade their skills during the lockdown period. Taking a cue from the online initiative, various sports associations have started motivating their members to make optimum use of the online platform to reinvigorate their skills and get ready for resuming their sporting pursuits after the end of the lockdown. The district has emerged as a major training hub for archery over the years with the active support of the Bhadrachalam Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) and the government agencies concerned. The Telangana Archery Association trained several budding archers mainly from the tribal areas helping them to excel in the traditional game at the State and national level in the past. Training facilities Several coaches of the five archery training facilities in the old undivided Khammam district are keenly following the online training sessions being conducted by the AAI and SAI through a videoconferencing app, said noted archery instructor and retired sports officer, ITDA, P. Shankaraiah. The course content of the online training programme encompasses an array of sports-related topics, including the fundamentals of archery, equipment, rules and training besides the sports psychology, he noted.

Mr. Rao along with former Minister Agam Chandrashekhar, MLC Ramulu Naik, Congress leaders Erla Komuraiah, Makhan Singh Thakur and others visited Godavarikhani on Thursday and consoled the members of the bereaved families.

But, the government had failed to follow the AP government example, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vhr-flays-ministers/article31753413.ece
05 June 2020||SANGAREDDY/HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Cong. leaders prevented from going to Manjeera||Congress leaders who planned a visit Manjeera dam, to expose the step-motherly attitude of the ruling TRS towards Sangareddy district and southern Telangana, were arrested and shifted to BDL Banur police station on Thursday. Congress MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy had planned a visit to Manjeera dam with Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and others. The Manjeera dam had dried up long back and people in the district headquarters have been suffering due to lack of water. Many borewells have also dried up in the district headquarters town. The water level at Singur has fallen drastically and was only 0.569 tmcft on Thursday. In 2017, about 15 tmcft water from Singur was diverted to Mid Maniar Dam in Karimnagar district to save standing crops there by drying up the reservoir. The result was that both Singur and Manjeera got dried up and since then have not received sufficient water. To expose the government, the Congress had planned the visit to Manjeera and the opposition leaders were arrested at Outer Ring Road (ORR) exit point and shifted to Banur police station. Expressing displeasure over their arrest, the TPCC president alleged that IPS officers were behaving like the private army of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. “The ruling TRS has been taking the law into its hands. I am a Lok Sabha member and Jayaprakash Reddy is a local MLA. Whose permission we have to take to visit Manjeera? Why is the CM objecting our visit?” asked Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy. He also wondered when there was nothing wrong in TRS leaders attending Kondapochammasagar inauguration, what was wrong in Congress leaders visiting Manjeera. Several Congress leaders including District Congress Committee (DCC) president Nirmala Jayaprakash Reddy and others were arrested at the district headquarters in the wee hours and were released by evening. Tension prevailed at Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy’s residence in Hyderabad where police were stationed in an apparent move to restrict him from moving out of the house. However, he along with Mr. Jagga Reddy and Gudur Narayan Reddy boarded the bus and left for Manjeera. After they were released from the police station, Mr. Reddy said it was time for people to speak up against the illegal arrests or else there would be none left to question the police arrests if everyone keeps silence now. Mr. Reddy reminded that KCR had announced in the Assembly and outside that the Manjeera project would be filled up with Godavari water. “Today, the Manjeera project is bone dry. The groundwater has also reached very low levels in Andhole, Narayankhed, Zaheerabad, Patancheru , Narsapur, Medak and Sangareddy. All these constituencies do not have irrigation or even drinking water now. Borewells are being dug up to 1,200 feet to get water,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-leaders-prevented-from-going-to-manjeera/article31753417.ece

This follows the killing of two people in Assam within a week in May. “We have written to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and brought to his notice that the State does not have a specific penal statue to deal with mob lynching as an offence,” said Debajit Barman, secretary-general of North East Legal Organization (NELO). The Chief Minister, he added, was also requested to take the issue up with utmost urgency toward curbing the social menace at the earliest. A mob had lynched 23-year-old Debasish Gogoi on May 29 in eastern Assam’s Jorhat district after a two-wheeler he was on had skid and hit two women in the Gabharu Parbat Tea Estate close to the border with Nagaland. Thrashed to death A similar incident happened on May 23 after a bicycle-borne vegetable vendor named Sanatan Deka allegedly grazed a vehicle at Monahkuchi village near Kamrup district’s Hajo, about 35 km northwest of Guwahati. Five men thrashed him to death. Mob-lynching cases have been increasing day by day, the NELO said. The first such case that caused social outrage was that of 16-year-old Jhankar Saikia who was lynched by auto-rickshaw operators at Diphu in 2013. He was killed following a quarrel over Rs. 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/group-seeks-law-against-mob-lynching-in-assam/article31753339.ece

Mandal to suspend an IAS officer who has been charged with raping a woman, and to launch a high-level inquiry into the allegations. The Chhattisgarh police had on Wednesday registered a case against the 2007 batch IAS officer, who is the former Collector of Janjgir-Champa, on charges of raping a woman on the collectorate premises after threatening to remove her husband from government service. Janak Prasad Pathak allegedly raped the woman on May 15, when he held the office of Collector. He also repeatedly sent her obscene messages and threats on the mobile phone, the woman told the Janjgir police. He was appointed director of land records last week. The government, in exercise of powers conferred by Sub-rule (3) of Rule 3 of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, has passed an order suspending him with immediate effect. Prima facie, his conduct “has been found to be unbecoming of an officer and is violate of rule 3 of AIS (Conduct) Rules, 1968,” said the order issued by the General Administration Department.

05 June 2020||Mumbai,||Campaign seeks healthy air even after lockdown ends||A 12-year-old climate activist’s campaign seeking healthy air after the lockdown will use the World Environment Day platform on Friday to amplify its demand that the government ensure that particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels in cities remain at 60 micrograms per cubic metre. PM 2.5 particles are fine pollutants that invade the smallest of airways. The safe limit of PM 2.5 is 0-60. The campaign, #SaalBhar60, unveiled by Haridwar-based Ridhima Pandey, will have celebrities, activists and citizens holding placards demanding ‘Clean Air for All’ and sharing images on social media by tagging various people in government and other agencies who can bring about this change. The campaign demands that the government put in place measures to ensure that the PM 2.5 levels in cities is 60 micrograms per cubic metre, which is the safe limit for 24 hours as prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This will ensure a safe and healthy environment as well as boost the fight against COVID-19, after the lockdown. Mumbai is listed as one of the 122 non-attainment cities (that do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards) under the CPCB’s National Clean Air Programme and has been asked to reduce air pollution by 20-30%. While Mumbai witnessed clean air and blue skies in the lockdown period, it was ironic that it came at the cost of a pandemic, and that citizens couldn’t actually be outdoors to enjoy or breathe freely, said Shikha Kumar, campaigns manager, Jhatkaa.org, which unveiled #SaalBhar60, a pan-India digital campaign, in association with multiple organisations. “The idea for it was to culminate on June 5, celebrated as World Environment Day,” she said. Ms. Kumar said the images received from people across India will be compiled on their website and a poster collage will be created. “This collage will be sent to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan as well as the environment ministers of all States,” she said. According to data by Urban Emissions (India), an independent research group on air pollution, Mumbai witnessed a major dip in PM 2.5, nitrogen dioxide as well as PM 10 levels during the lockdown period. “On May 20, Mumbai recorded its AQI as 28, which is the cleanest air the city saw so far this year. Once everything is back to normal, it is not possible to simply abandon cars and shut industries to achieve clean air. However, good and healthy air quality can be achieved with stricter policies and its stringent implementation, which is what Mumbai needs,” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder of Waatavaran Foundation, which is supporting this campaign. Sarath Guttikunda, director of Urban Emissions, #SaalBhar60 is achievable. “It is hard work but very much possible. We need to clean every source of transport, industry, waste, cooking, heating, lighting and roads,” he said. Sumaira Abdulali, convenor of Awaaz Foundation and member of the Maharashtra Clean Air Collective, which is a part of the campaign, said the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Mumbai has left the city in gloom and despair. “It is only the clean air and reduced noise that has brought some respite. We need a strong public movement and collectively demand that Mumbai needs to set its priorities in terms of reducing emissions and paving the way for cleaner and greener transport,” Ms. Abdulali said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/campaign-seeks-healthy-air-even-after-lockdown-ends/article31753344.ece

After the lockdown was announced in March, she could not visit a doctor and it was only after receiving her sonography report on May 18 that she learnt she was pregnant. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, permits termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks, beyond which the courts have to decide. She said it would be extremely difficult for her to carry the pregnancy to its full term, because she would not be able to raise the child as an unmarried single parent without sufficient financial and mental support. She said it would not be possible for her to get married in future because of the “social stigma” attached to being an unwed mother. The petition also said she is mentally not ready to be a mother. On May 29, the court directed the Civil Hospital, Ratnagiri, to constitute a medical board of qualified doctors to give an opinion under the MTP Act on whether undergoing the procedure posed any health risks to the woman. The board recommended, “Continuation of pregnancy would lead to grave injury to the her mental health... It is advisable to terminate the pregnancy.” The court allowed the woman to terminate the pregnancy by observing, “We are of the view that if the petitioner is compelled to continue with her pregnancy, the same will involve a risk of grave physical and mental injury to her.”  We are of the view that if the petitioner is compelled to continue with her pregnancy, the same will involve a risk of grave physical and mental injury to her Division Bench Bombay High Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-allows-unmarried-woman-to-terminate-23-week-pregnancy/article31753350.ece
05 June 2020||Pune,||Row over PMC’s move to scrap tie-up with PFI||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) decision to revoke its tie-up with social outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) to bury COVID-19 victims from the minority community, has evoked sharp condemnations from the PFI’s Pune unit and Muslim and Ambedkarite outfits. The PFI, which has facilitated the final rites of 107 people irrespective of their religion, said it was shocked by Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad’s order to this effect on Tuesday. The PMC’s order came after former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis opposed the PFI’s association with the PMC, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and other civic bodies in the State. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, in a tweet, had accused the PFI of being an “anti-national” organisation, alluding to its alleged involvement in the anti-CAA riots in New Delhi. Razi Khan of the PFI’s Pune unit said, “We have so far facilitated the burial of 200 bodies across six districts, including Pune, Aurangabad, Nanded, Parbhani and Malegaon. In some instances, we even took the responsibility of carrying the body of Hindu people to the crematorium. Religion-based politics should not be permitted to thrive anywhere, and especially not at the time of a pandemic.” Sources said it was BJP leader and Mayor Murlidhar Mohol who urged Mr. Gaikwad to scrap the tie-up. “The PMC, which is dominated by the BJP, had no objection when we volunteered to help with cremation of COVID-19 victims. Now it appears the Mayor was pressurised by Mr. Fadnavis to scrap the civic body’s association with us,” said another PFI member. Mr. Khan said that on the day the directive was issued, the PFI had helped bury five bodies of Muslims and Christians despite the heavy rain. Anjum Inamdar, founder of the Mulnivasi Muslim Manch, asked, “How is it that Mr. Fadnavis did not object to Pragya Singh Thakur, despite having been indicted in the Malegaon blasts, being elected MP?” Mr. Inamdar’s organisation, along with the PFI, had been tasked by the PMC to facilitate the burial of minority community members who died of the virus. “There have been several cases where relatives have flatly refused to perform the last rites or even take the body to the ambulance. We have even helped perform the last rites of those who did not die of COVID-19,” Mr. Inamdar said. He said last week, the son of a senior citizen from Maharshi Nagar did not get any help from neighbours and relatives to bury his father. “The body lay there for five hours before someone called us. We have never questioned the religion of a person while performing these services. It is condemnable of Mr. Fadnavis to play politics at such a time,” he said. Rahul Dambale, who heads the Ambedkarite Republican Yuva Morcha, said it was unfortunate that Mr. Gaikwad and the PMC had succumbed to pressure from Mr. Fadnavis. “The PFI and the Mulnivasi Muslim Manch have been performing yeoman service in helping to bury these orphan dead bodies. Who will take this responsibility? We strongly condemn the PMC’s directive and urge that it should be taken back,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/row-over-pmcs-move-to-scrap-tie-up-with-pfi/article31753349.ece
05 June 2020||Washington,||Trump trying to divide America, says Mattis||Former Pentagon chief Jim Mattis issued a stinging rebuke of his erstwhile boss Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing the president of trying to “divide” America and failing to provide “mature leadership” as the country reels from days of protests. Mr. Mattis, who resigned in December 2018 over Mr. Trump’s ordering of a full troop withdrawal from Syria, also voiced support for the demonstrators whose anti-racism rallies have roiled the country. “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try,” Mattis wrote in a blistering statement posted online by The Atlantic. “Instead, he tries to divide us,” added the retired Marine Corps General . “We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership,” he stated. Mr. Mattis described himself as “angry and appalled” after witnessing events of the last week. Mr. Mattis wrote that the protesters’ call for equal justice was a “wholesome and unifying demand.” He slammed the decision to use force to clear peaceful protesters from near the White House on Monday to allow Mr. Trump to pose for photographs at a damaged church, calling it an “abuse of executive authority.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-trying-to-divide-america-says-mattis/article31753037.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||India vows $15 mn to vaccine alliance||As India pledged $15 million to Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country stood with the world in these challenging times. He was addressing the virtual Global Vaccine Summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Addressing heads of state, Ministers, business leaders, U.N. agencies and civil society of over 50 countries, Mr. Modi said: “India’s civilisation teaches to see the world as one family and that during this pandemic it had tried to live up to this teaching,” a government statement read. He said India had shared its stocks of medicines with over 120 countries, set up a common response strategy in its immediate neighbourhood and provided specific help to countries in need while protecting its own population, the statement said. “The Prime Minister said the COVID-19 pandemic, in some ways, has exposed the limitations of global cooperation and that for the first time in recent history, the human kind faces a clear common enemy.” Symbol of solidarity He said Gavi was not just a global alliance but also a symbol of international solidarity. He said India understood the importance of immunisation since it has a huge population and limited health facilities. The country had added six vaccines to its National Immunisation Programme to expand protection, he said. The vaccine supply chain had been digitised and an electronic intelligence network had been developed to monitor the integrity of the cold chain, he said. “The Prime Minister said India is also the world’s foremost producer of vaccines and that it is fortunate to contribute to the immunisation of about 60% of the world’s children. Mr. Modi said India recognises and values the work of Gavi...,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-vows-15-mn-to-vaccine-alliance/article31753029.ece
05 June 2020||Seoul,||North Korea lashes out at U.S., says China eclipses it||North Korea lashed out at both Seoul and Washington on Thursday, threatening to scrap key parts of agreements with South Korea and comparing the United States to a setting sun being eclipsed by China. The attack on the U.S. comes as President Donald Trump is in an increasingly bitter standoff with China, blaming it for the spread of the COVID-19 and threatening action over its weakening of Hong Kong’s autonomy. And it follows Trump’s sputtering efforts to court the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and get North Korea to give up its nuclear arms. Unrest in U.S. In a statement carried by state media, North Korea also highlighted the unrest that has been consuming the U.S. over the death of George Floyd in police custody. “Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House,” said the statement published by Rodong Sinmun , North Korea’s main state-run newspaper. “This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.” The statement, from an arm of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, excoriated Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, for criticising the Communist Party of China during a televised interview Sunday. In the interview, Mr. Pompeo accused the Chinese party of being “intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values.” Mr. Pompeo also said that the U.S. could work with its allies around the world, including South Korea, to “ensure that the next century remains a Western one modelled on the freedoms that we have here in the U.S.” The statement carried by Rodong Sinmun said Mr. Pompeo’s remarks showed that “he is nervous over the plight of the U.S. on the downhill side” in relation to an ascendant China. “Pompeo, who has been engrossed in espionage and plot-breeding against other countries, has become too ignorant to discern where the sun rises and where it sets,” the statement read. North Korea also fumed over another development: the recent release of anti-North Korean leaflets by defectors from the North, who used balloons to send them across the inter-Korean border. North Korea has long bristled at this propaganda tactic, as well as radio broadcasts from defectors in the South that depict Mr. Kim as a cretinous dictator toying with nuclear weapons. In another statement carried on Thursday by Rodong Sinmun , Kim Yo Jong, Mr. Kim’s sister and his de facto spokeswoman, assailed the propaganda campaign. “What matters is that those human scum hardly worth their value as human beings had the temerity of faulting our supreme leadership and citing ‘nuclear issue,’”she said. If South Korea does not stop the leaflets, she said, North Korea could scrap an agreement between Kim Jong-un and South Korea’s President, Moon Jae-in, to operate a joint liaison office and cease all hostile military acts along the border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/north-korea-lashes-out-at-us-says-china-eclipses-it/article31753034.ece
05 June 2020||Beijing,||China to allow foreign flights||China said on Thursday foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country over virus fears would be allowed to resume limited flights, apparently deescalating a row with Washington following U.S. plans to ban Chinese carriers. The latest spat was rooted in the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) deciding to impose a limit on foreign airlines based on their activity as of March 12. Because U.S. carriers had suspended all flights by that date their cap was set at zero, while Chinese carriers’ flights to the U.S. continued. On Wednesday the U.S. said it would block Chinese passenger flights from June 16, raising concerns of another front being opened up in the economic titans’ standoff. But the CAAC on Thursday said all foreign airlines not listed in the March 12 schedule would now be able to operate one international route into China each week. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian expressed regret over the U.S. decision, adding that the CAAC is making “solemn representations” over the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-to-allow-foreign-flights/article31753027.ece
05 June 2020||Beijing,||Guard in China primary school stabs 39 children||A knife-wielding attacker wounded 37 students and two adults at a primary school in southern China on Thursday, officials said, with local media identifying a security guard as the perpetrator. All the victims, including teaching staff, were sent to hospital but were not in a life-threatening condition, authorities in Cangwu County, Guangxi region, said. The incident at the Wangfu Central Primary School happened at 8:30 a.m. when children would normally arrive for class. The attacker, reportedly aged around 50, was “under control”, the government said. “37 students suffered mild injuries and two adults suffered more severe injuries. All of them were sent to a hospital for treatment, and none of their lives are in danger,” it said. Schools in the region had only reopened in May after being closed for months due to the coronavirus outbreak. A number of schools in China have been hit by attacks in recent years, forcing authorities to step up security amid calls for more research into the root causes of such acts. In November, a man climbed a kindergarten wall in southwest Yunnan province and sprayed people with a corrosive liquid, wounding 51 of them, mostly students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/guard-in-china-primary-school-stabs-39-children/article31753030.ece
05 June 2020||Rawalpindi,||Pakistan couple arrested for killing 7-year-old maid||A Pakistan couple have been arrested for allegedly murdering their seven-year-old maid after she was blamed for letting a pet bird escape, police said, the latest case of violence against child domestic workers in the country. Hassan Siddiqui and his wife employed Zohra Bibi at their home in a middle-class suburb of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, to care for their son of a similar same age. “The poor girl was subjected to torture by Siddiqui and his wife, who accused her of freeing one of their four pet Macao parrots,” investigating officer Mukhtar Ahmad told AFP on Thursday. “Siddiqui kicked her in the lower abdomen, which proved fatal.” Some 8.5 million people — including many children — are employed as domestic workers in Pakistan, according to the International Labour Organization. It is illegal to employ anyone under the age of 15. Zohra was taken to hospital by the couple on Sunday, but died the following day. The incident was reported to the police by staff at the hospital. The young girl’s body was handed over to her parents, who live in Muzaffargarh, more than 500 km away from where she was working. Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari confirmed the arrests in a tweet and said the Ministry was in touch with the police. “Violence and physical torture against children will not be tolerated,” city police chief Muhammad Ahsan Younus added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-couple-arrested-for-killing-7-year-old-maid/article31753035.ece

The U.N. rights office chronicled long-standing concerns about state-backed and vigilante violence that it says has worsened in the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has particularly drawn domestic and international condemnation for a deadly crackdown on drug offenders and users. It said many of the human rights concerns “have become more acute in recent years” and have continued even amid COVID-19 outbreaks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/end-violent-drug-war-in-philippines/article31753038.ece

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||A chill in U.S.-China relations||A slew of recent announcements on China by U.S. President Donald Trump is a clear indication that the competition between the U.S. and China is likely to sharpen in the post-COVID world. On May 29, the Trump administration said it would revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status under U.S. law. The administration also passed an order limiting the entry of certain Chinese graduate students and researchers who may have ties to the People’s Liberation Army. The U.S. President has also ordered financial regulators to closely examine Chinese firms listed in U.S. stock markets, and warned those that do not comply with U.S. laws could be delisted. Complicit in China’s rise Americans have had a strange fascination for China ever since the early 1900s when Protestant missionaries decided that it was God’s work to bring salvation to the Chinese. Books like The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck and Red Star Over China by Edgar Snow in the 1930s romanticised the country. Even after the Chinese communists seized power, the Americans hoped to cohabit with Mao Zedong in a world under U.S. hegemony. The Chinese allowed them to believe this and extracted their price. U.S. President Richard Nixon gave China the international acceptability it craved in return for being admitted to Mao’s presence in 1972; President Jimmy Carter terminated diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to normalise relations with China in 1978; President George H.W. Bush washed away the sins of Tiananmen in 1989 for ephemeral geopolitical gain; and Bill Clinton, who as a presidential candidate had criticised Bush for indulging the Chinese, proceeded as President to usher the country into the World Trade Organization at the expense of American business. All American administrations since the 1960s have been complicit in China’s rise in the unrealised hope that it will become a ‘responsible stakeholder’ under Pax Americana. Disguising its real purpose The Chinese are hard-nosed and unsentimental about the U.S. They have always pursued America with a selfish purpose, albeit couched in high principle. They have spoken words that the Americans wanted to hear — anti-Soviet rhetoric during the Cold War and market principles thereafter — to disguise their real purpose of thwarting U.S. hegemony. Ever since Cold Warrior John Foster Dulles spoke in 1958 of weaning China and other “satellites” away from the Soviets through regime change, known as “peaceful evolution”, every Chinese leader from Chairman Mao to President Xi Jinping has been clear-eyed that the U.S. represents an existential threat to the continued supremacy of the communist regime. Mao put it best, when he told high-ranking leaders in November 1959, that the “U.S. is attempting to carry out its aggression and expansion with a much more deceptive tactic… In other words, it wants to keep its order and change our system.” (Memoirs, Chinese leader Bo Yibo). The collapse of the Soviet Union only reinforced this view and strengthened China’s resolve to resist by creating its own parallel universe. China is building an alternate trading system (the Belt and Road Initiative); a multilateral banking system under its control (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank); its own global positioning system (BeiDou); digital payment platforms (WeChat Pay and Alipay); a world-class digital network (Huawei 5G); cutting-edge technological processes in sunrise industries; and a modern military force. It is doing this under the noses of the Americans and some of it with the financial and technological resources of the West. Voices of caution have been few and far between, among them political scientist John Mearsheimer, who wrote in 2005 that the rise of China would not be peaceful at all, but the world chose to believe General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Hu Jintao’s assurances about “peaceful rise”. When satellite evidence showed that China was building military installations in the South China Sea, China’s Southeast Asian neighbours and the U.S. preferred to believe assurances to the contrary given by Mr. Xi on the lawns of the White House in 2015. It is only under Mr. Trump that the Americans are finally acknowledging the uneasy fact that the Chinese are not graven in their image. He has called China out on trade practices. He has called China out on 5G. It was Mr. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy document that, perhaps for the first time, clubbed China along with Russia as a challenge to American power, influence and interests. His recent China-specific restrictions on trade and legal migration are, possibly, only the beginning of a serious re-adjustment. A full-spectrum debate on China is now raging across the U.S. Former White House Chief of Staff Steve Bannon declared that the U.S. is already at war with China. Others like diplomat Richard Haass and former president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, warn that a new Cold War will be a mistake. Scholar Julian Gewirtz, in his brilliant essay, ‘The Chinese Reassessment of Interdependence’, talks about a similar process under way in Beijing. Both sides are acutely aware how closely their economies are tied together: from farm to factory, the U.S. is heavily dependent on supply chains in China and the Chinese have been unable to break free of the dollar. If Mr. Trump’s wish is to disentangle China’s supply chains, Mr. Xi is equally determined to escape from the U.S. ‘chokehold’ on technology. To what extent the de-coupling is possible is yet to be determined, but one thing is inevitable, India will become part of the collateral damage. The Hong Kong question Will Hong Kong become a game-changer in the post-COVID world? China’s decision to enact the new national security law for Hong Kong has been condemned in unison by the U.S. and its Western allies as an assault on human freedoms. Why is this significant? The points of divergence, even dispute, between them have so far been in the material realm. With Hong Kong, the U.S.-China rivalry may, possibly, be entering the ideological domain. For some time now there are reports about Chinese interference in the internal affairs of democracies. Countries in the West have tackled this individually, always mindful of not jeopardising their trade with China. Hong Kong may be different. It is not only a bastion for Western capitalism in the East, but more importantly the torch-bearer of Western democratic ideals. Think of it as a sort of Statue of Liberty; it holds aloft the torch of freedom and democracy for all those who pass through Hong Kong en route to China. This is an assault on beliefs, so to speak. This comes on the back of not unreasonable demands that China should come clean on its errors of omission in the early days of COVID-19, when greater transparency and quicker action might have prevented, or at least mitigated, the pandemic. In the months ahead, more information may become public, from sources inside China itself, about the shortcomings of the regime, that will further fuel a debate on the superiority of the Chinese Model as an alternative to democracy. Will this form the ideological underpinning for the birth of a new Cold War? That will depend on who wins in Washington in November; on whether profit will again trump politics in Europe; and on how skilfully the Wolf Warriors of China can manipulate global public opinion. The lines are beginning to be drawn between the Americans on the one side and China on the other. A binary choice is likely to test to the limit India’s capacity to maintain strategic and decisional autonomy.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Are social media platforms the arbiters of truth?||In the midst of the massive protests that have erupted in the U.S. following the death of an African-American man in police custody, social media platform Twitter decided to do something it had avoided for several years: call out some of President Donald Trump’s tweets as incorrect information and as against its policies. This prompted Mr. Trump to warn social media platforms of stricter controls via an Executive Order. It also prompted another social media giant, Facebook, to state that they did not want to take similar action since they did not want to be ‘arbiters of truth’. These developments bring into focus the level of involvement the social media giants have in the dissemination of the public discourse, and raise questions on how these platforms should regulate content. Mishi Choudhary and Rishab Bailey discuss these issues in a conversation moderated by P.J. George . Edited excerpts:  Twitter and Facebook go to great extents to avoid the ‘arbiter of truth’ label. But they apply their terms of use selectively on erring users. Even on Mr. Trump, Twitter did not act on his tweets for a long time. In this sense, are they not arbiters of truth already?  Mishi Choudhary (MC):I think truth is an accident on these platforms. They are actually creators of engagement, who wish to usurp all human attention. Their entire business model feeds on that. But inevitably the question will rise about whether you are for truth or against it. I think the action which prompted this entire brouhaha is Mr. Dorsey [Twitter CEO Jack] giving what I would call ‘ice in wintertime’. Saying that we’re going to look for more facts on a problematic tweet is only a label telling people who want junk food, “hey, come here, eat spinach.” But what most platforms want to say is what Mr. Zuckerberg [Facebook CEO Mark] has said; that they really don’t care. And that all they are here for is to serve their business model, which is based on the reactions on the post. If they are forced to take responsibility for something, they just want to bow out and tell us that they are private platforms that [have their] own rules and regulations and community guidelines. That is why society has to decide what it wants to do, now that information distribution is by people who don’t care, and who prioritise engagement over truth. Rishab Bailey (RB):This behaviour as “arbiters of truth” arises out of four factors. First, the Communications Decency Act in the U.S., empowers intermediaries to make decisions regarding content, which is seen as avoiding government intervention and, therefore, protecting speech. Second, these entities are typically seen as private platforms that have the right to choose the content. Third, the user-platform relationship is governed by contracts that give platforms a great deal of power in deciding what they will permit. Fourth, there are practical considerations. Often decisions need to be made in real time, such as when illegal or harmful content, including terrorist attacks or suicide attempts are being streamed. Also, the sheer volume of content being exchanged on these platforms makes it difficult or impractical for external decision making. Facebook and Twitter have a say over the self-expression of billions of people. Never before in history has so much control rested with so few people, and that too private entities. Has their clout grown too much?  RB:The power of the big technology companies can be problematic in a variety of ways. In the media business, for example, the advertising market is moving towards specific platforms. So, it is important to regulate online platforms. However, it is important to do this without hurting the benefits that the Internet has brought us, whether in promoting civil liberties or in enhancing efficiency. While there is clearly a problem with the way platforms handle content moderation and how they self-regulate, having the government involved in censorship is also far from ideal. This can lead to over-censorship or politically-motivated censorship, particularly in a country with a relatively low rule of law standard as India. We’ve seen, for example, how even a relatively independent body such as the CBFC [Central Board of Film Certification] has performed in India. The primary issue appears to be a lack of transparency, accountability in decision making, and allegations of bias and discrimination. These problems are exacerbated by the monopoly that many platforms enjoy, and there has to be broader thinking on the structural problems with the digital economy. But censorship is a different issue and it is important not to try a one-size-fits-all approach, like the generic regulations in the Indian government’s intermediary guidelines of December 2018. It makes better sense to regulate procedural aspects, like the German law that requires social media companies with over two million registered users in Germany to put in place processes to receive user complaints and disable access to manifestly illegal content. Companies are also required to improve their transparency mechanisms and make public disclosures of how they handle complaints. The law fines companies not for failing to remove content, but for not having robust grievance redressal mechanisms. So we need to look at targeted or proportionate measures that clarify what intermediaries are required to do from a procedural perspective, with an aim to make them more transparent and accountable to users. This can be done through supervised self-regulation or even co-regulatory processes. Here, it is important to understand how experiments such as Facebook’s Oversight Board will work. MC:We all just want to tweak and fix the current system itself, whether it is the liability issues under Section 79 of the Information Technology act in India, or the counterpart DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] and Section 230 in the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in the U.S. All of us are now discussing whether it will be antitrust, or if something would be broken up, or if it could be regulation of some kind. I want to say that the companies recognise that something must change. They know that the jig is up, and that the period of unregulated behaviour is over. They know that denial is no longer going to work. And that is why they are also in negotiation mode. Everyone now knows that it is not just innovation, but it’s also harmful. And I do not think there are simple answers such as saying we want self-regulation, or that we don’t want self-regulation. That’s why Facebook has appointed an oversight board; because there has to be something more than just self-regulatory behaviour. But if you try to introduce a government into the picture, it is going to be mostly political censorship. It is also going to start a process of self-censoring, because there is fear. I don’t have a simple answer, but I don’t think anybody does. And that’s what it leads us to this Executive Order from Trump. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in the U.S. has been credited with having spurred innovation in the technological sphere. Do you think taking it away will throttle innovation? MC:Despite the fact that a vast majority of Facebook’s users are now outside the United States, the discussion is still concentrated on Section 230 and what that did in the United States for the platform companies. Now, there is definitely the feeling that the companies have gone too far to the other side, and that they are not really innovating, but are mostly acquiring new products or just squishing out smaller products. At the time Section 230 was enacted, we needed such a thing. But today we live in a very different world where surveillance is the only economy or only business model that the Internet knows. People are addicted to free data. People are addicted to free services in return for free spying by the commercial platform companies. This isn’t the age we lived in at that time when Section 230 was enacted. Something has to shift, and everybody recognises it. But nobody quite knows where they want to land. In India, the similar Section 79 of the IT Act has been continuously challenged since its enactment. We start with the Avinash Bajaj case where the industry realised you can’t have any e-commerce if you’re going to go keep arresting CEOs of companies. With Section 79, the vision is the same: that we want the platform companies to do new things, and to come and have new, innovative ideas in India, and we will have to protect them some way or the other. But we only get to talk about the larger players like a Facebook or a Google who can afford litigation teams. But the smaller players cannot. Police harass platform companies all the time and the smaller trial courts are filled with such cases. So, I will say it is much more complicated. RB:Before answering the question, I think it is important to keep in mind that there are differences in the intermediary liability frameworks in India and in the U.S. Section 230 of the CDA does two things. It first recognises that all intermediaries are not publishers, and second, it explicitly sets up a self-regulating system for intermediaries. In India, on the other hand, the law is primarily brought in to extend the common law of distributor’s liability to the Internet. So the idea just clarifies that intermediaries are not to be liable for illegal third party content, if they don’t actively participate in the commission of the offence, or if they take down content once they have actual knowledge of this. Now, the original version of Section 79, when it was enacted in 2000, had language under which an intermediary basically had to show that it took all relevant measures to prevent illegal content from being exchanged. This led to the CEO of Baazi.com being arrested because users had exchanged an obscene clip online. The provision was changed in 2008, and now intermediaries just have to show that they carried out due diligence under the guidelines laid down by the government. These guidelines lay down self-regulatory frameworks that companies are required to adhere to. There is however, no specific requirement to censor content and so the decision broadly remains with the intermediary on how to enforce its terms. So changing these provisions by removing or significantly diluting safe harbour provisions will certainly have a negative effect on the digital ecosystem, both in terms of innovation and, importantly, in terms of civil liberties protections. It has been broadly accepted by academic literature on courts in India and abroad, that holding an intermediary responsible for third party content could lead to a chilling effect on free speech. I mean, as Mishi mentioned, smaller platforms in particular could face significant harassment if protections were removed. You will then have to move to a system where companies are incentivised to over-censor.  Truth is an accident on these platforms. They are actually creators of engagement, who wish to usurp all human attention Mishi Choudhary, Legal researcher||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/are-social-media-platforms-the-arbiters-of-truth/article31753025.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Swiss cheese and defence reforms||The Swiss cheese model is associated with accident investigation in an organisation or a system. A system consists of multiple domains or layers, each having some shortcomings. These layers are visualised in the model as slices of Swiss cheese, with the holes in them being the imperfections. Normally, weaknesses get nullified, other than when, at some point, the holes in every slice align to let a hazard pass through and cause an accident. Three slices in defence set-up When applied to a nation’s defence preparedness, the Swiss cheese model, in its simplest form, works the reverse way. The slices represent the major constituents in a nation’s war-making potential, while the holes are pathways through which the domains interact. At the macro level, there are only three slices with holes in each. These must align to ensure that a nation’s defence posture is in tune with its political objectives; any mismatch may turn out to be detrimental to the nation’s aatma samman (self-respect) when the balloon goes up. In these days of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, a clinical analysis is necessary to obviate any missteps that may prove costly a few years or decades down the line. In the Indian defence set-up, the three slices are: one, the policymaking apparatus comprising the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and Ministry of Defence (MoD); two, the defence research and development (R&D) establishment and domestic manufacturing industry; and three, the three services. When the MoD alone existed, a certain relationship between the three layers saw India prosecute four major wars since independence. The holes in the three slices were aligned to different degrees and hence the results were varied in each conflict; that the system required an overhaul would be an understatement. With technology progressing exponentially, a single service prosecution of war was no longer tenable, because the advent of smart munitions, computer processing, networking capabilities and the skyrocketing cost of equipment brought in the concept of parallel warfare. Synergised application of tools of national power became an imperative. Thus, it became essential for militaries to be joint to apply violence in an economical way — economical in terms of time, casualties, costs incurred, and political gains achieved. The setting up of the DMA and the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to achieve synergy are the most fundamental changes; as further modifications and tweaking take place in the way the services prepare to go to war, it is imperative that the transformation be thought through with clinical analysis, without any external, emotional, political or rhetorical pressure. Access to the right equipment India’s security managers have to factor in the increasingly belligerent posture of the country’s two adversaries. Terrorist activities have not reduced in Jammu and Kashmir, ongoing incidents along the northern border with China do not foretell a peaceful future, and the China-Pakistan nexus can only be expected to get stronger and portentous. Such a security environment demands that capability accretion of the three services proceed unhindered. To elaborate, the Indian Air Force at a minimum requires 300 fighters to bolster its squadron strength; the Army needs guns of all types; and the Navy wants ships, helicopters, etc. The requirements are worth billions of dollars but with COVID-19-induced cuts in defence spending, and their diversion to the social sector, getting all of them is a joint mirage. Enter the well-meaning government diktat for buying indigenous only, but for that, in-house R&D and manufacturing entities have to play ball. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited can, at best, produce just eight Tejas fighters per year presently; the Army has had to import rifles due to the failure of the Defence Research and Development Organisation to produce them; and the Navy has earnest hopes that the hull designs that its internal R&D makes get the vital innards for going to war. So, the Swiss cheese slice representing indigenous R&D and a manufacturing supply chain that ensures quality war-fighting equipment, at the right time and in required quantities, is still some years away. Wars cannot be fought and won on well-meaning policy intentions and nationalist rhetoric; wars are won when war fighters have access to the right equipment to prosecute them. Creating theatre commands The forthcoming reform of creating theatre commands is the most talked about result of jointness expected from the Swiss cheese slice in which lie the DMA and a restructured MoD. Doing so would be a shake-up of huge proportions as it strikes at the very foundation of the war-fighting structure of the services. The three-year deadline spoken about by the CDS must take into account the not-so-comfortable state of assets of each service which would need to be carved up for each theatre. The Chinese announced their ‘theaterisation’ concept in 2015; it is still work in progress. The U.S. had a bruising debate for decades before the Goldwater-Nichols Act came into force in 1986. Turf wars are not a patent of any one nation. New relationships take time to smooth out, and in the arena of defence policymaking, which is where the DMA and MoD lie, the element of time has a value of its own: any ramming through, just to meet a publicly declared timeline, could result in creating a not-so-optimal war-fighting organisation to our detriment. So, the three services that constitute the third Swiss cheese slice have to contend with the other two slices being in a state of flux for some time to come. It’s a no-brainer that this disruption requires level-headed non-parochial handling. The political, civil and military leadership must have their feet firmly on ground to ensure that the holes in their Swiss cheese continue to stay aligned; impractical timelines and pressures of public pronouncements must not be the drivers in such a fundamental overhaul of our defence apparatus. To paraphrase Deng Xiaoping, shun publicity and build capability first. Manmohan Bahadur is Additional Director General, Centre for Air Power Studies.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Embracing alternative protein||On World Environment Day (June 5), the usual routine is to call for the protection of ‘Nature’ — but nature isn’t defenceless. The emerging concept of planetary health characterises impacts of human-caused disruptions of Earth’s ecological systems. COVID-19 is showing us that our lives and livelihoods are intricately intertwined with these systems — and when we inflict tremendous harms on the planet, the consequences can be catastrophic. We don’t think of the pandemic as an ecological disaster, but COVID-29 didn’t happen in a vacuum. It is a direct consequence of anthropogenic impacts on the planet. In these anthropogenic impacts, pandemics and climate change find common causes. Nowhere is this link clearer than in the food system, and particularly in our reliance on animals for protein. Hazards of factory farming Large-scale, industrial animal agriculture for meat, eggs, and dairy — also called factory farming — creates and exacerbates planetary health risks at every scale. Scientists at the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization estimate that it is “one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems.” Our need for animal protein uses vast tracts of land and quantities of water to raise those animals, to graze them, and to grow crops to feed them. It contributes more to climate change than emissions from the entire transportation sector. Wild and farmed seafood production also causes significant environmental degradation, species loss, and habitat destruction. Of course, as the names suggest, animals are also the sources of viral outbreaks of swine flu and avian flu. With regular outbreaks of these zoonotic diseases, COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last planetary health crisis caused by the close contact between humans, animals and microbes. Expert voices ranging from the Food and Land Use Coalition, to the World Health Organization, to the EAT-Lancet Commission have all identified that diversifying protein sources away from animals is a hugely neglected intervention for human and planetary health. But with rising demand for meat, eggs, and dairy, a chorus of ‘chickpeas over chicken’ may not be enough. All over the world, companies in the exciting ‘alternative protein’ sector are making upgraded versions of meat, eggs, and dairy from plant or crop ingredients, or directly from animal cells. These foods satisfy consumers and producers without taking away their choice, because they taste the same, are used in exactly the same way, but are vastly better for planetary health. Countries like Singapore and Canada are already making alternative protein a central piece of their food security story, with an emphasis on research, entrepreneurship, and self-sufficiency. Factory farming in India is still a small industry compared to the U.S., Brazil, or China, though it is increasingly being seen as an employment and income generator in a country with water scarcity and diminishing land holdings. We think that’s a mistake — it is imposing a 20th century industrial model. Instead, we need to build upon our strengths in agriculture and in manufacturing to create a new food system that works for farmers and is robust to systemic shocks. COVID-19 has underscored that we can scarcely afford the consequences of an inefficient protein supply. Why not completely rethink our way of producing food, and create a 21st century economy delivering plentiful, safe, and nutritious protein? Food security and agricultural income are among our nation’s major challenges in the coming years. We should turn this crisis into an opportunity by stimulating research and entrepreneurship in alternative proteins. India was never a leader in landlines — we leapfrogged that model and built a mobile telecommunications industry that is among the cheapest and most competitive on earth. We have a similar opportunity to set aside the liabilities of industrial animal agriculture and create a smarter alternative protein industry supplying us and the rest of the world.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Skyrocketing tensions||The U.S. government’s decision to bar passenger planes from China from June 16 is but another instance of rising tensions between the two countries. A trade war which President Donald Trump launched in 2018 is yet to be resolved fully. In recent months, Mr. Trump and other officials in the administration had attacked China over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. has also decided to end Hong Kong’s special trade status in protest against Beijing’s move to introduce a new national security law for the Special Administrative Region. Repeated targeting of China by Washington and Beijing’s retaliatory moves make it look like the world’s largest and second largest economies have entered into a new cold war. Administration officials say the decision on flights is in response to China’s refusal to allow U.S. airlines to resume flights to the country. China had introduced restrictions on international flights in March, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of those curbs are still in place. Disputes such as this could be resolved through talks and cooperation. China has already sent signals of de-escalation, allowing foreign airlines to resume flights on a limited scale starting June 8. Whether or not Mr. Trump has a rethink, the larger problem is the U.S.’s overall approach towards China, which has taken an increasingly hostile turn in the last four years. From trade and technology to the pandemic and Hong Kong, the battle lines have been drawn — China, which the Pentagon called “a revisionist power” in 2018, is the main rival of Washington, a position which the Soviet Union held during the Cold War. Ties between China and the U.S. are still not as bad as they were between the Soviet Union and the U.S. Beijing and Washington are still economically and financially entangled. The world is not divided into two ideological blocs, as it had been during the Cold War. The possibility of a military confrontation is very low. But the era of cooperation, peaceful trade and pragmatism that had defined the U.S.-China partnership since President Richard Nixon’s reset in the 1970s seems to have made way for an aggressive leadership contest and deepening mutual mistrust. And with Mr. Trump desperately looking for an enemy to blame for the misfortunes that fell on America in an election year that has been battered by the pandemic and the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, tensions with China are expected to skyrocket in the coming months. Washington wanted an enemy and it found it in China. Unless the leaders of both countries change their course and rebuild the lost mutual confidence, a new kind of cold war would be forced upon the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/skyrocketing-tensions/article31753007.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Killing Gajah||An outpouring of grief has followed the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala, the treacherous use of a food bomb causing widespread revulsion and anger. Scores of elephants are killed every year in India as their paths cross those of humans, but the image of a mortally wounded animal standing impassively in a river in Palakkad as life ebbed out of it will remain imprinted on the mind. Whether the booby-trapped pineapple that took its life was intended for elephants or other animals matters little, because such traps litter the troubled landscapes that surround forests across the country. The tragic fate that befell this creature, however, is a ghastly reminder of the rising conflicts between humans and animals that are only destined to grow as commercial pressures eat into already diminished habitat. The perpetrators may be prosecuted for the elephant’s death, but that can do little to mitigate the larger issue of lost ranges and blocked corridors for these wandering giants. India has thousands of elephants — just under 30,000 according to available counts — but no strong science-imbued policy that encourages soft landscapes and migrating passages that will reduce conflict. Ironically, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar invoked Indian culture to deplore what happened in Kerala, but it is the lack of a scientific culture and the readiness to spare forested lands from commercial exploitation that is eviscerating nature. Even during the lockdown in April, the Ministry convened video conference meetings of the National Board for Wildlife and the Expert Appraisal Committee to clear disruptive projects in protected areas. Shrinking ranges and feeding grounds for elephants cause serious worry, because the animals look for soft landscapes adjoining forests such as coffee, tea and cardamom estates, and in the absence of these, wander into food-rich farms falling in their movement pathways. Research in Karnataka showed that 60% of elephant distribution was encountered outside protected areas. In Kerala, such movement along human-dominated landscapes routinely produces conflict. Unsurprisingly, politicians of many hues in the State were opposed to the Madhav Gadgil Committee Report calling for the entire Western Ghats to be classified as ecologically sensitive and spared of destructive development. With such fundamental philosophical disagreement, and a vision of verdant landscapes as nothing more than a resource to be exploited for minerals and cash crops, elephants and other creatures have little chance of escaping deadly conflict. A sensible course open to conservation-minded governments is to end all intrusion into the 5% of protected habitat in India, and draw up better compensation schemes for farmers who lose crops to animals. A culture shift to protect, rather than prospect, would genuinely enrich people and save biodiversity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/killing-gajah/article31753008.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||From dull black ink to a tiny blue tick||“Balu sir!” and “Hari sir!” were common refrains at The Hindu ’s Chennai reporting section those days. The two senior colleagues, who were office aides in the department and took turns in alternating shifts, effectively ran the section. From reminding us to sign in the attendance register (yes, we used to physically sign in a thick, leather-bound ledger everyday before punching became a thing!), to filing the previous day’s edition of the paper, using strings that held them firmly to a huge cardboard — as if it were one giant book of news — to keeping track of our night shift cycles to handing over the press releases marked to us by the city editor, we relied on them for several of our daily tasks. When it was time to change the film in the fax machine, we needed their help more than ever. Few of us had the dexterity for replacing that cylindrical roll to get the machine to start beeping and spewing messages in dull black ink again. We got a variety of fax messages. Organisers of religious discourses sent us announcements via fax, with a request for inclusion in our daily engagements’ column on page 4. Private engineering colleges that competed with each other in seeking publicity — whether a Rotaract club inauguration or a tree-planting drive on campus — sent us invitations via fax, requesting coverage for what they thought was compelling content for a daily. More importantly, political parties and government departments commonly used fax to send official announcements, information and speeches of politicians. Some of my senior colleagues who had covered Tamil Nadu’s two main Dravidian parties for decades could tell from the sound of the machine and the duration of the beep, what the fax message was about. “Must be Karunanidhi’s clarification to Delhi”, or, “This is Jayalalithaa’s announcement — all her special announcements are released late, close to our deadline,” I can remember them say, as they walked towards the fax machine kept at a desk near our side of the large reporting section. They were usually spot on. They would begin reading the pages as they walked back to their desks, to translate and file the report that would, at times, even displace the story slotted for the front page. Seal of confirmation Hearing about these announcements was one thing, but actually seeing them in those glossy sheets twirled in the fax machine was like getting a seal of confirmation. It was now “authentic” news. A decade and a half later, reporters are having to look elsewhere, for political leaders’ statements and confirmations. Whether it is U.S. President Donald Trump who recently threatened White House protesters with ‘vicious dogs’ and ‘ominous weapons’, or Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent phone call with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, offering support to combat COVID-19, Twitter is where we get the updates first. Given that these are “official” handles, with a little blue tick beside them indicating they are verified accounts, we treat the tweets — ranging from the mundane to cordial and dramatic to appalling — as the official word, credible enough to report. We even cite these tweets in our news copy, with those hashtags intact, at times quietly wondering why some leaders couldn’t tweet less.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/from-dull-black-ink-to-a-tiny-blue-tick/article31753020.ece

But while reiterating his other pledge to withdraw all U.S. ground and support forces from Cambodia by the last day of this month Mr. Nixon said that he would continue to send air missions into Cambodia “to interfere [with] enemy troops and materials” after the July 1 deadline. Mr. Nixon did not, however, say whether or not these U.S. air missions would also support South Vietnamese ground operations (in Cambodia) which he said Saigon was free to continue after the U.S. itself had pulled out.

05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘India runs risk of rating downgrades’||To deal with the current economic crisis, India has to find the right balance between leaning towards a high fiscal deficit and ensuring financial stability, newly appointed CII president Uday Kotak said on Thursday. “For substantive economic recovery to kick in, government spending would be crucial. However, with an increasing fiscal deficit and mounting government debt, the economy runs the risk of rating downgrades which has consequences,” Mr. Kotak said during a video conference. Following Moody’s downgrading India’s rating recently, Mr. Kotak said any further downgrade will make India susceptible to flight of capital and leave its currency vulnerable. CII believes that the economic pain and the losses will have to be borne by three entities: individuals and businesses, the government and the financial system. “Perhaps, the government will have to take on a disproportionate share of this pain in order to ensure long-term survival of businesses and a financial system strong enough to support the recovery in the real sector,” Mr. Kotak said. Mr. Kotak said it was reasonable to presume that Indian economy would witness a contraction in FY21. However, the question is how deeply negative the growth is likely to be. On relaxations in labour laws in various States, Mr. Kotak said that change is needed to get investments back and there is also a need to ensure that a social security framework is created for ensuring fairness to the workers. Asked about the Supreme Court rapping RBI over non-waiver of interest on loans for the moratorium period, Mr. Kotak reasoned that banks are intermediaries between depositors and borrowers. “We cannot have a one sided contract where we allow moratoriums on interest to the borrowing side and, of course, banks have a fundamental obligation to pay principal and interest to the depositors. It cannot be an unequal game.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-runs-risk-of-rating-downgrades/article31752995.ece
05 June 2020||Chennai,||ALL unveils trucks built on modular platform||Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd. (ALL) on Thursday rolled out AVTR, a new range of trucks on the modular platform using the i-Gen6 BS-VI technology. “The launch marks a significant milestone in the company’s history and will define our future course as we set out to achieve our vision to be among the top 10 players in the commercial vehicle player creating reliable and differentiated product,” said Dheeraj Hinduja, chairman, Ashok Leyland, said through a video call. While terming the new products as a game changer, he said: “AVTR will take our customers to the next level of trucking and they will reap the benefits of modularity. “In line with our decision, the new range will not only provide reliability and quality, but will allow us to take our products to many international markets around us. This will allow us to demonstrate the global competitiveness of Made in India product across all parameters,” he said. Asserting that the last 18 months were challenging for the industry, he said, “based on our current assessment, the next few quarters will continue to test our resilience. Well, it is going to be the new normal. We have decided to power on and launch these new products. Today’s launch is a testimony to adaptability and readiness to take on the future in our own turf.” Mentioning that he had seen many downturns in the past, he said “we are leaving no stone unturned to re-look at our business model.” The Hinduja Group company had invested Rs. 500 crore in the new modular platform and tested the vehicles on different terrains. The range will be produced at Ennore, Hosur and Pantnagar facilities. Multiple options The modular platform is a first-of-its-kind in the Indian CV industry with multiple options on a single platform for the entire range of rigid trucks, tippers and tractors in the 18.5 to 55-tonne category. This would enable customers to configure vehicles that are best-suited to their applications and business needs, said N. Saravanan, chief technology officer (CTO), Ashok Leyland. “These trucks are designed by our customers and developed by us. With this launch, we have achieved the dual challenge of meeting the BS VI norms and development of a whole new platform, in one swift move. This gives us an edge not only in India but globally with its potential to switch between right hand drive and left hand drive,” said Vipin Sondhi, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland. To a question, Mr. Sondhi said currently only medium and heavy commercial vehicles were being produced using modular platform and it could be extended to buses in the future. Over the next 12-18 months, ALL plans to add 400 to 500 touchpoints across India. Earlier, we used to be where the customers used to buy the vehicles and then moved to places where they operated. Now, we have moved to wherever the customers are. Our endeavour is to have at least one touch point every 50 km across India, said Anuj Kathuria, chief operating officer, ALL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/all-unveils-trucks-built-on-modular-platform/article31753001.ece
05 June 2020||Mumbai,||Bad loans to rise sharply, PSBs stare at 6th year of loss: ICRA||With debt servicing capacity of borrowers coming under strain as the country enters a period of possible economic recession, bad loans of Indian banks are expected rise sharply this fiscal, which could lead to yet another year of loss for public sector banks (PSBs), ratings agency ICRA said in a report.  ICRA estimated gross non-performing assets to rise to 11.3-11.6% by March 2021 from an estimated level of 8.6% for March 2020, with fresh gross slippage of 5-5.5% of standard advances in FY21.  The agency said uncertainty on the asset quality of banks remains high with almost 30-40% of the loan book across various banks under the repayment moratorium.  “While the lockdown has impacted the debt servicing ability of borrowers, the extent of revival in economic activities as the restrictions are eased will drive the final impact on asset quality of banks,” ICRA said, adding even if 10-20% of these borrowers were to default, the slippage rate for banks could rise to 3-8% of advances. It added that credit provisions will continue to exceed operating profits for PSBs during FY21, translating to the sixth consecutive year of loss.   PSBs will need estimated capital infusion of Rs. 45,000 crore to Rs. 82,500 crore against an earlier estimated Rs. 10,000 crore to Rs. 20,000 crore even under a scenario of low credit growth of 3-4% for FY21, ICRA said. The Centre had expected PSBs to raise capital from the markets and hence possibly did not budget for any capital infusion for FY21. “The RBI moratorium was extended... till August 31, 2020; we expect the asset quality stress to reflect only in Q3 and Q4 of FY21 results,” said Anil Gupta, sector head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ratings.

05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Adani’s high bids delaying airports takeover?||The staggeringly high bids quoted last year by Adani Enterprises for six AAI airports has possibly now resulted in it dilly-dallying in taking over their possession, aviation analysts say. Adani Enterprises has sought six more months to take possession of three airports for which it signed a concession agreement with Airports Authority of India (AAI) in February 2020, it is reliably learnt. It has invoked force majeure clause and requested for postponement of the payment deadline for asset transfer fees worth Rs. 1,000 crore due to AAI. Last year, the Union Cabinet gave its nod for awarding three out of six airports to Adani Enterprises after it emerged as the highest bidder for all six airports. Its bids were called “aggressive” by then AAI Chairman, Guruprasad Mohaptra, and were 30% to 600% higher than the second highest bidder for different airports. The airports awarded to it include Ahmedabad, Mangaluruand Lucknow. “The per passenger fee, which was the criteria for selecting the winning bidder, quoted by Adani Enterprises was ambitious and put pressure on how it would make the acquisition profitable. Even before COVID-19 there were concerns over how it would garner non-aeronautical revenue, which is a substantial amount of total revenue. These sources of revenue, such as retail parks, aerocity, take material time to develop. And, now with travel demand taking a hit due to the pandemic this task has become much more challenging,” said an industry insider. He added, “I am not surprised by their reluctance. It was always a time of when they would make it known. The long gap between awarding of the concession this February after the transaction was closed last year was an early sign of this.” The latest development also casts a doubt over the second round of airport privatisation for which six more airports have been identified, unless the government revisits the bidding parameters. “In the long term, the airport business is resilient and attractive but a black swan event of this kind will dent long term valuations. Hence, biddings whether in the near term or even later, should attract global bidders, but at lower valuations as compared to those last year. That is a compromise the government will have to make to secure cash for AAI and for deepening and widening the reach of airport infrastructure in the country. It could also revisit the bidding criteria by considering replacing per passenger fee to be paid by the concessionaire to AAI with an upfront premium amount, as more common globally, to bring more cash on the table for AAI,” said Sidharath Kapur, who served as the CEO of Adani Group’s airports business briefly last year and the former executive director, GMR Airports Limited.

According to market participants, Bank Nifty options contract prices were not getting updated properly leading to confusion among investors. Further, there were sudden and sharp swings in the premiums that were being quoted for the contracts, which made trading in the instrument very difficult. Bank Nifty is the only sectoral index-based derivative contract that sees a significant amount of trading. It is the most popular index derivatives instrument after Nifty contracts. Incidentally, the Bank Nifty fell 2.63% on Thursday even as the benchmark Nifty lost a marginal 0.32% to close at 10,029.10. Meanwhile, the NSE confirmed brokers got in touch with the bourse, but did not elaborate any further on the cause of the problem. “A few members reached out to us and we are examining it,” said an NSE spokesperson. Brokers, on their part, said that they sent alerts to their clients to trade cautiously in Bank Nifty contracts since there was no clarity on the reason for the glitch and the time it would take to resolve the issue. In the last few months, there have been instances where technical glitches have led to issues such as prices not getting updated and client margins not being reflected properly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/technical-glitch-hits-trading-in-bank-nifty/article31752991.ece

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Most MSMEs to shed staff to revive: survey||Over 70% of MSMEs who responded to a survey by the All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO) intend to reduce headcount across the board. AIMO received 46,525 responses from MSMEs, corporate CEOs, the self-employed, experts and individuals. About 49% of the survey’s respondents were from MSMEs and 7% were corporate CEOs. “The most striking aspect of the survey was that 72% of MSME respondents and 42% of corporate respondents said they would definitely reduce headcount to get their business back on track. In fact, only less than 20% of all categories said they would continue with the same headcount,” said K.E. Raghunathan, immediate past president, AIMO. The extent of the job loss will be clearer by the end of August 2020, as most respondents were in the process of gauging how many of their labourers will return and the optimum employee strength required to sustain their business in the near future, the survey said. Issues likely to be faced during the unlocking period are forecasting demand, collection of pending dues, raw materials along with present interest burden and salary issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/most-msmes-to-shed-staff-to-revive-survey/article31752997.ece

He said despite various interventions, including promising MSMEs that payments by the Centre and its undertakings will be made within 45 days of delivery of goods or services, a satisfactory solution to the problem had been elusive. “We are thinking of various ways on how MSMEs can get their money. One attempt is to make the bigger firms declare whether they have paid MSMEs or not and make the same binding for them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/big-firms-may-have-to-inform-on-msme-dues/article31753004.ece
05 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||Usha’s long wait could end||For the 36-year-old N. Usha, arguably one of the best-ever women boxers from India with two silver medals in the Worlds and a gold in the Asian championship, the long wait for recognition could end as the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has recommended her for the Dhyan Chand Award. Winning the award would give her a “lot of satisfaction,” says Usha. “I felt bad at missing the Arjuna Award when I was at the peak of my career. So, this time around, I am really hopeful,” said Usha in a chat with The Hindu . Usha, mentored by Andhra Pradesh’s well-known boxing coach I. Venkateswara Rao, is also a six-time National champion. “As my father N.V. Ramana was a sub-junior National boxer, my interest was quite natural in the sport. But, it was a lot of hard work as the kind of facilities which exist now were not there then,” said the NIS-qualified coach, who was with the Indian senior women’s team for a long time and is now Indian Railways’ women’s team coach. Biggest disappointment “When I look back, the biggest disappointment was missing the 2012 London Olympics because of a knee surgery and neck injury. That was the most frustrating phase,” said Usha, a senior officer in East Coast Railway. She wants at least a couple of her trainees — she regularly coaches the State boxers when she is in Visakhapatnam — to make it to the Olympics. “Yes, I want to see my girls achieve what I failed to do,” said Usha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ushas-long-wait-could-end/article31753369.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Have battled depression: Uthappa||Robin Uthappa, a key member of the 2007 World T20-winning Indian team, revealed that he battled clinical depression and suicidal thoughts for nearly two years during his career, a phase when the game was perhaps the only thing that kept him from “jumping off a balcony”. “I remember around 2009 to 2011, it was constant and I would deal with that on a daily basis. “There were times where I wasn’t even thinking about cricket, it was probably the farthest thing in my mind,” he said during a Royal Rajasthan Foundation’s live session Mind, Body and Soul.  “I was thinking about how I would survive this day and move on to the next, what’s happening to my life and in which direction am I heading. Cricket kept my mind off these thoughts but it became really difficult on non-match days and during the off-season. “Some days, I would just be sitting there and would think to myself on the count of three, I’m going to run and jump off from the balcony but something held me back,” he recalled. No regrets Uthappa said he had no regrets about how he dealt with the lows of his life.  I remember around 2009 to 2011, it was constant and I would deal with that on a daily basis||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/have-battled-depression-uthappa/article31753136.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||We need to be smart in how we invest in programmes, says Bates||New Zealand all-rounder Suzie Bates feels cricket will have to take a hard look at its programmes, planning and investments as the world comes to terms with a new normal amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Some of ICC’s new guidelines, including social distancing and ban on use of saliva, Bates feels may be difficult to enforce. However, the no-saliva rule is of less concern to women than men “since it would affect the red ball more than white ball,” she says. Back to the nets The 32-year-old Bates, who resumes indoor nets next week — New Zealand is set to declare coronavirus officially ‘eliminated’ on June 15 — is also “trying to be positive and planning as if the 2021 World Cup will go ahead as scheduled.” “We are going to have to be smarter with how we invest in both men’s and women’s programmes and consider reducing domestic and international travel,” Bates told The Hindu in an exclusive interaction from Dunedin. More tournament-style play to reduce travel and scheduling of international series in one city might be the way forward. Most existing sports business models are not sustainable in the changed scenario and reassessment at the grassroot and professional levels were required, she said. Bates, the World No. 2 and batswoman with most T20I runs ever — man or woman — and part of the New Zealand basketball side at the Beijing Olympics, is also hopeful the quadrennial Games will happen next year. “I hope, for the sake of athletes and sports in general, that it happens and that all athletes who have qualified can gain the Olympic experience. Even if there are fewer fans in Tokyo, the televised global event is vital for inspiring future Olympians,” she said. Grateful The pandemic has also taught her to be grateful. “I have always appreciated my lifestyle as a professional cricketer, but I will never take for granted the freedom to travel and play cricket around the world again,” said ICC’s two-time women’s ODI Player-of-the-Year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-need-to-be-smart-in-how-we-invest-in-programmes-says-bates/article31753307.ece
05 June 2020||Bengaluru,||Uthappa, Shreyas, Aaron and Mathias resume training||Cricketers Robin Uthappa, Varun Aaron, Shreyas Gopal and David Mathias resumed training, at the Karnataka Institute of Cricket (KIOC) here. The four were joined by young talent in their return to cricket action after the long coronavirus-inflicted layoff. Fast bowler Mathias was thrilled to hit the nets. “It feels great to be back, especially so when you have high-quality cricketers like Robin, Shreyas and Varun to train with,” he said. Mathias stated that he is making a conscious effort to avoid using saliva — banned by the ICC, as it increases the risk of transmitting the coronavirus — to shine the ball. “Avoiding saliva will soon become a habit for us pacers. The ball does not do much in the air or off the pitch, but we will find a way to cope with it,” he said. Mathias explained that bowlers used their own ball. “Batting is safe, as we use our gloves when we pick up the ball and pass it back to the bowler. We also use headbands to ensure that we do not inadvertently touch our face,” he said. Temperature checks, sanitising, frequent disinfectant use and other precautionary measures were in place at the academy. Players did not wear masks while training — a trend seen in most exerting sporting activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/uthappa-shreyas-aaron-and-mathias-resume-training/article31753145.ece
05 June 2020||Kochi,||Blasters may play at Kozhikode||They have been mulling over it for the last couple of years and with representatives of Kerala Blasters FC (KBFC) meeting Kozhikode Municipal Corporation officials on Wednesday, there is a good chance that a few of the Kochi team’s Indian Super League (ISL) matches in the coming season or next could be played in the State’s northern district. But there is also a worry, in some quarters, whether this is the start of a KBFC move to slowly shift its home base from Kochi to Kozhikode. “They are not shifting altogether, they just want to play some matches in Kozhikode’s Corporation Stadium. Anyway, there is another meeting on June 10,” said P. Haridas, secretary, Kozhikode District Football Association, on Thursday.  “In Wednesday’s discussion, they had asked for chairs in the stadium, a VIP section to be set up, to upgrade the floodlights and to relay the turf in the stadium which is currently a bit hard.” The thin turnout for the Blasters home games in Kochi in the second half of the season the two previous years could be the reason for the management’s plan to move a few games to Kozhikode. Gokulam’s take Incidentally, the Corporation Stadium is also home to I-League club Gokulam Kerala FC and while the club is okay with Blasters playing one or two matches in Kozhikode, it has clearly indicated that it would not be happy if the Kochi club plans to make the stadium its home ground. “We heard last season that they were interested in playing one or two matches here. We even welcomed that. “But if they are choosing this as their home ground, I think it is not professional or ethical because we, a similar club, have developed the stadium and established it as our home ground,” said V.C. Praveen, president, Gokulam Kerala FC. Calls and messages to Blasters owner Nikhil Bhardwaj went unanswered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blasters-may-play-at-kozhikode/article31753431.ece
05 June 2020||Kochi,||Look before you leap, says KFA secretary to Blasters||If Kerala Blasters FC does move out of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here, its ISL home for the last six years, it will be tough to come back to Kochi, feels Kerala Football Association general secretary P. Anilkumar. “What will happen if tomorrow someone else takes over the Kochi stadium for cricket or something else, the Blasters may not be able to come back. You can’t say, keep all your stadiums for our home matches, that aspect has to be considered too before they take any final decision,” he said. “But we will support whatever decision they take.” Even a hint that Blasters could move out of Kochi in a year or two should raise the excitement level in cricket circles here. If that happens, the Nehru Stadium could embrace big-time cricket all over again. But Sreejith V. Nair, the Kerala Cricket Association secretary, is not in a hurry to make his move though the association has taken the Nehru Stadium on a 30-year lease from the GCDA, the guardian of the stadium. “I think they are leaving Kochi, isn’t it,” asked Sreejith. “But now, without any assurance from the authorities, we are not keen to take up the Nehru Stadium. We had spent nearly Rs. 14 crore and brought international cricket there. After that, without any consideration, we were shifted from there whenever football came and we were forced to go to Thiruvananthapuram.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/look-before-you-leap-says-kfa-secretary-to-blasters/article31753432.ece
05 June 2020||CHENNAI,||Government mulls opening Nehru Stadium||Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) is seriously contemplating reopening the Nehru Stadium athletics track next week. The Hindu has reliably learnt that SDAT has been in consultations with officials of the Tamil Nadu Government to prepare the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document in the wake of COVID-19. In fact, national and international sportspersons have been eager to get back to their turfs rather than doing fitness at their homes. Eager to start Top Indian paddler G. Sathiyan is eager to start training but is of the opinion that the SDAT should also allow private centres, such as the Raman High Performance TT Centre where he trains under S. Raman, to open. “We will follow the social distancing and all necessary safety protocols,” Sathiyan said. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Sharath Kamal concurred and said for a skill-based sport like table tennis it was important to get back to playing. Tennis player Prajnesh Gunneswaran felt it was about time they got back on court. “We are aware of the situation but at the same time, this is our livelihood. We need some clarity on how we to training safely, especially after the sports ministry has given permission. Not training for long periods can also cause injuries,” he said. While SDAT is yet to allow private centres to open, quite a few badminton facilities across the city have reportedly opened. A reputed coach said: “When they are asked how, the academy/centre shows the Government Order (GO) which says: ‘Sports Complex and stadia will be permitted to open without spectators.’” In fact, the first GO by the State government, said elite sportspersons “should obtain permission from the concerned District Collector/Commissioner, Greater Corporation (Chennai) to train with their independent coaches.” There is now a need for SDAT to come out with clear directives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/government-mulls-opening-nehru-stadium/article31753197.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Still a fragile situation: Naubert||World sport is slowly coming back to life, starting with the German football league. Even though it was the first major event to get back on the field after the COVID-19 outbreak, the rest of the world may not be able to use the Bundesliga’s blueprint — with different situations and rules in place in different countries. “Germany was hit hard by the coronavirus, but the death rate was not very high. We tried to bring football back and get back to normal general life,” said Peer Naubert, Head of Marketing of Bundesliga, in an interaction about the ‘new normal’ in sport, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). “The measures by the German government were right, and the national health system was strong. Everyone played their part in the restart, and we are going match by match. It is still a fragile situation,” conceded Naubert. JSW Sports CEO Mustafa Ghouse said it was important to be in constant touch with the athletes and calm them down. “The athletes have pent-up energy. We have to ensure that they don’t overexert on return. Since there are not too many high-level competitions till the end of the year, we can plan on slowly increasing their training load,” he said. With so many football leagues reviving around the world, Ghouse said there would be enough examples for the ISL to follow when it starts in October. Touching on the economic situation, IOA president Narinder Batra said cricket and football left only 5 to 7% of the sponsorship money to be shared by about 58 disciplines, and that the government had assured support for main sports until the Commonwealth and Asian Games in 2022. Pointing out that the world economy had taken a huge hit during the lockdown, Ghouse said, “We are mentally prepared for the tough road.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/still-a-fragile-situation-naubert/article31753305.ece
05 June 2020||Coimbatore,||Players and coaches face precarious situation, says TNBA president||Having witnessed the fallout of the COVID-19 outbreak over the last few months, the Tamil Nadu Badminton Association (TNBA) feels a strict, inclusive approach is the only way forward. “As a sportsman, I can understand that the sports community is more self-restrained and disciplined than most others in society, but the settings are far from ideal,” said TNBA president Anbumani Ramadoss. Practical difficulties “A badminton player sweats a lot more, changes T-shirts often, uses washrooms, and moves in and around the court. The nature of the game makes it all but impossible to adhere to the norms if not implemented properly.” However, he pointed out that the TNBA has laid out a thorough Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). “If we turn a blind eye to the practical difficulties in setting up a secure environment for players to train, then all efforts may become counter-productive.” But his major worry is bringing back the animal spirit in players and overcoming the financial losses incurred by all stakeholders. “Barring a few academies, more than 1,000 centres that operate with local coaches inside Tamil Nadu face a precarious situation. The majority of these coaches may not return to work,” Ramadoss said. “Also, the players have a frail mentality, with uncertainty over tournament and practice schedule. The time lost to establish themselves, especially the age-group players, is burdensome. I am afraid many upcoming players will drop out,” he added. Big blow He said for the State, heavily dependent on the number of players, it is a big blow. “We have come as far as having arguably the best junior strength in India with the likes of Sankar Muthusamy, Ritvik Sanjeevi and Siddhanth Gupta. Now, with everything going for a toss, our State will suffer more than Telangana or Karnataka.” Ramadoss, also the Badminton Association of India treasurer, said smaller rented centres have suffered a 50-60% loss in revenue. “You have a situation where it could come to a halt. I have started hearing voices of concern on jobless coaches. We have to compensate them if they are to stay afloat.” And, the TNBA is working on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/players-and-coaches-face-precarious-situation-says-tnba-president/article31753196.ece

05 June 2020||MUMBAI,||Basu Chatterjee: The quintessential family man||Filmmaker-screenwriter Basu Chatterjee could well be called the quintessential family man of Hindi cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. His debut film, Sara Akash , set in a joint family in Agra, was about a young, incompatible couple, forced into an arranged marriage, trying to adjust to domesticity and gradually getting to discover each other. The 1969 film — along with Mrinal Sen’s Bhuvan Shome and Mani Kaul’s Uski Roti from the same year — is regarded as having ushered in the New Wave movement in Indian cinema. Kaul, Kumar Shahani and Basu Bhattacharya continued to remain Chatterjee’s creative comrades and friends, though he himself opted to embrace what has since been called the middle-of-the road cinema. He, along with Hrishikesh Mukherjee, became the torchbearer of light-hearted, entertaining, middle class family dramas that offered a parallel narrative to the mainstream Angry Young Man movies on the one hand and the radical, path-breaking, artistic and experimental concerns of the New Wave. That journey started with Piya Ka Ghar (1972), where newly married Malti (Jaya Bachchan), used to the expanse of her village home, finds it disconcerting to have no privacy with her husband Ram (Anil Dhawan) in the matchbox flat which houses all the members of the family together. Family and the skein of relationships within its folds remained a lifelong concern for Chatterjee. Be it Priyatama (1977), about a young couple on the verge of divorce, or Khatta Meetha (1978) that looked at the hell that breaks loose when two widowed people decide to get married much to the consternation of their kids. There were the Perreira-Braganza families of Baton Baton Mein (1979) that came to define Bandra households, while Apne Paraye (1981) looked at the fissures within a family that can lead to its eventual disintegration. Anil Dhawan, who played the lead, alongside Jaya Bachchan, in Piya Ka Ghar , says it feels fresh even today. “Till date, I get calls when someone watches it,” he says. The reason it has held so well is because it’s real, a part of the lived experiences of the audience, and holds a mirror to their lives. “There’s nothing fake about it. Filmmakers show us dreams; he showed us our reality — our homes, our food, the bags we hold while catching a bus for going to office,” he says. Chatterjee’s storytelling, like that of Mukherjee’s, was straightforward, unadorned and uncomplicated, even if the emotions dealt with would have been complex. “His content was like a fresh breeze even though his cinematic grammar remained simple and basic,” says actor-director M. K. Raina, who worked with him in Ek Ruka Hua Faisla (1986), an Indian adaptation of Sidney Lumet’s Twelve Angry Men . A singular aspect about Chatterjee’s films was how much they were pivoted around women — educated, intelligent and independent, negotiating personal or relationship conundrums, questioning but not quite pushing the envelope, eventually coming back to the conventional family fold than straying far away from it. Like Vidya Sinha in Rajnigandha (1974), caught between two polar opposite men in her life, played by Dinesh Thakur, and Amol Palekar in his Hindi film debut. The film turned out to be a sleeper hit and led to two more successes from the Chatterjee-Palekar duo — Chhoti Si Baat (1976) and Chitchor (1976). Even his foray into television, in the heydays of Doordarshan, was marked with the iconic series Rajani , which made Priya Tendulkar instantly popular as the crusader taking on the inefficient government offices and systems. Having been a journalist and cartoonist, he picked his stories with care. The popular Doordarshan series Byomkesh Bakshi (re-telecast during the lockdown) was based on Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay’s works centred on the iconic detective. Chatterjee’s films were about long-term associations, be it with Vidya Sinha or Amol Palekar or Deven Verma or Asrani or Rajesh Roshan, Rakesh Roshan, Amit Khanna or Yogesh. In a matter of two months during this pandemic we have had three of these team members pass on in quick succession — Ranjit Chowdhry, Yogesh, and now, the captain of the ship, Basu Chatterjee. The consolation is that films, and the families in them, will live on in our collective memories and shared nostalgia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/basu-chatterjee-the-quintessential-family-man/article31753127.ece

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Summer with the Goldies||It was a quest for a gold medal that got my twin, Rani, and I to work during the summer holidays. Our mission was to raise money for a school charity project. Pa’s idea was that we earn money by doing chores for the people at the senior citizen’s home in our neighbourhood. At Happy Home, they don’t use the word ‘old’; they call them Goldies; gold in experience and age! Sister Rosie runs Happy Home, assisted by a staff of two dozen. When we went there with some freshly baked cookies, Sister Rosie was talking with Mrs. Charumathi and Mr. Dhaliwal. We played with Floppy, Mrs. Charumathi’s Labrador, till Sister Rosie gave us Happy Helper forms to fill. Sister Rosie’s instructions were crystal clear: “No chewing gums! No running and no feeding Floppy.” Getting set Sister Rosie would have spent more time with us if Mad Malini, a doctor who worked in our parents’ clinic, hadn’t come in. She was followed by Mr. Som who is always greedy for sweets. Mad Malini scowled when she spotted me. She stared at the tin of cookies on Sister Rosie’s table. “Have you been baking?” “Yes. Rayu got a new recipe for chocolate cinnamon cookies from…” “Keep the cookies from Mr. Som’s sight. If he falls ill and comes to the clinic, both of you will be in trouble,” barked Mad Malini. It was unfair to give Mad Malini a cookie while Mr. Som was deprived of one. When Rani and I ignored Mad Malini, she turned her attention to Sister Rosie. “These kids are pranksters. You shouldn’t let them make anything for the Goldies.” Sister Rosie chuckled and walked out with Mad Malini and Mr. Som. Mrs. Charumathi and Floppy had fallen asleep. Mr. Dhaliwal was seated on a wheelchair, lost in his own world. He never spoke to anyone. From feeding to bathing, he needed help with everything. I looked at the Happy Helper form. Like the school test, I wrote all the answers I knew first. But against ‘Siblings if any’ I put, “Yes, we have many saplings in our garden. Mango, coconut, chickoo, banana.” Rani corrected me. ““The form says ‘Sibling’ not ‘sapling’. That means you have to write my name.” I made the correction and we handed over our forms to Sister Rosie. “I have already informed all the Goldies about your school charity project. I don’t want to hear any complaints from the staff or the residents. Do you understand?” asked Sister Rosie. Mr. Dhaliwal was the only one who burped in agreement. Rani and I looked at each other and giggled.        To be continued   Mad Malini scowled when she spotted me. She stared at the tin of cookies on the table.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/summer-with-the-goldies/article31753660.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Psyche’s trials come to an end||Story so far: Princess Psyche’s beauty made Aphrodite, the Godess of Love, jealous. She told her son Eros to make Psyche fall in love with a horrible monster. Instead, Eros fell in love with Psyche and married her. But he never showed himself. Roused by her jealous sisters’ comments, Psyche held a candle over the sleeping Eros. When she saw him, she grew so excited and a drop of grease fell on him, and woke him up. Angry with her, he flew away.  Though she waited for many days, Eros didn’t come back. So, Psyche went in search of him. She prayed to Aphrodite to re-unite her with her husband but the goddess wanted to punish her, so she asked the girl to complete three tasks to prove she was indeed the right wife for Eros. First task First, Aphrodite took her to a small hillock of wheat, poppy seeds, millets and other grains. “Separate these grains by end of day,” Aphrodite ordered. Psyche was in despair. How on earth was she to do that? A group of ants came to help and soon, each seed was in its own mound. Enraged, Aphrodite told Psyche to sleep on the floor without any food, hoping that lack of food and hard work would take away her beauty. The next day’s task was to fill a bottle of water from the Estige. The waters of the river flowed down a mountain with great force, and the surrounding rocks were both steep and slippery. A passing eagle took pity on Psyche and filled her bottle. For the final task, Aphrodite gave Psyche a beautiful box and told her to go to Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, and ask for a bit of her beauty. Psyche wept because she knew she could not accomplish this. Suddenly a voice whispered in her ear: “Carry some money for Charon, the boatman. Take some bread for Cereberus, the three-headed dog. Do not eat anything, not even a seed. And, finally, do not open the box.” Reassured that someone was looking after her, Psyche set out. She crossed the Styx by paying Charon and fed Cereberus and finally offered the box to Persephone. Deadly sleep When it was given back to her, she set out on her return. Just as she reached Aphrodite’s palace, her curiosity overcame her. She opened the box and a foul black cloud rushed out and put her to sleep. By this time, the other gods were feeling sorry for Psyche. They sent Hermes to tell Eros how his wife was suffering. Eros found Psyche lying in a swoon and brought her to her to a conscious state. Jupiter convinced Aphrodite to let Eros and Psyche stay married and offered Psyche ambrosia to make her immortal. Now that Psyche was a goddess, Aphrodite forgot her jealousy and welcomed her son’s wife.  She asked the girl to complete three tasks to prove she was indeed the right wife for Eros.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/psyches-trials-come-to-an-end/article31753666.ece

Or is there a party?” asked Murli curiously as he gulped down the milk. Granny smiled, “You tell me what the occasion is,” teased granny. Rama grabbed granny’s hand, “Come on granny, don’t create so much suspense. Our school bus will arrive now.” Murli said, “Obviously, we will be thinking about this the whole day and then you will scold me for scoring low marks in math.” Rama laughed, “Now, bhaiya has found another excuse for his poor marks.” Mom walked into the room and said, “There’s your school bus. Run.” Granny finished her breakfast and went into her room. Dad walked into granny’s room. “Oh wow! So many flowers, mom!” he exclaimed. He looked around the room. A whole variety of flowers decorated every corner of the room. Granny continued with the floral decorations. “Any special occasion?” “Can you guess?” Dad said, “I am getting late for work.” Mom came up behind him and whispered, “Have we forgotten a special day?” “Why don’t you ask her?” said Dad. The four of them puzzled over this the whole day. Dolled up When Rama and Murli returned from school, they found granny in the garden. She was instructing the gardener as to where to plant the saplings of rose, marigold, and dahlia. The entire house was decorated with colourful flowers. They were on the table, in the crystal bowl on the dining table, strings of marigold on the windows — there was an absolute riot of colours and fragrances. “Granny, you have worked magic on the entire house. It looks like fairy land,” said Rama as she hugged granny. “And you are my darling fairy,” said granny. She gave her a white gajra (garland), “and there’s one for your mom too.” After lunch, the kids helped their granny in the garden. Later, they helped her make more garlands.  On the way back from work, dad picked up a bouquet and a box of sweets. He thought this was the best way to be prepared for whatever lay ahead. He still could not remember what the occasion was. When he got home, the decorations made him feel more guilty. At the dinner table, everyone was quiet, except granny who was excited and happy. Plans revealed  Finally Dad said, “Mom, we are really sorry. We cannot remember what day this is.” Mom said, “Now please tell us.” “I have given so many hints yet nobody wished me Fools’ Day, ” said granny, annoyed. “Fools’ Day?” asked Rama in surprise. “Yes. Yesterday, Bunty told me that today was Fools’ Day ,” said granny. Everyone burst out laughing as they realised what granny meant. Murli said, “Granny you made fools out of all us on April Fools’ Day.” Dad told granny about April Fool’s Day and what people do on that day. “So, you see it has nothing to do with phool , the Hindi word for flowers, as you thought,” he said, wiping the tears from his eyes. Now, it was granny’s turn to laugh. “From now on I will celebrate April 1 as Flowers Day.” Rama hugged granny, “We also enjoyed this Fools’ Day.”  When Rama and Murli returned from school, they found granny in the garden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/grannys-flowery-surprise/article31753683.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||One and done||You know who I envy? My friends who are only children. Who aren’t weighed down by an annoying, uncool, pesky brother or sister. Who don’t have to fight over the last slice of pizza with someone. Who don’t have to argue over who gets to control the remote when watching television. Who don’t have to hide in the bathroom when they need some alone time. I am also jealous of my friends who do have a brother or sister but were lucky enough to be born second in line. If you’re going to have a sibling, isn’t it better to be the younger one? Unless you’re royalty or something, because then you’ll never be King or Queen and get to knight people or order someone you like sent to the dungeons. Though I guess that doesn’t happen too much these days. Not cool If you think being the first born is amazing, here are five reasons why it isn’t. 1. ‘We expected better from you’ is something second borns NEVER have to hear. Parents, teachers and all other collective boring grownups like to dump their collective expectations on the shoulder of the first born. So, we’re expected to be super well-behaved, mature, responsible and careful at all times. This means that if your younger cousins are throwing water balloons at people from the terrace, you’re meant to stop them, not join in. 2. ‘He/She’s younger than you. Let it go.’ No matter how awful a thing your younger brother has done to you, you have to forgive him. Whether they threw a badminton racket at you and broke your front teeth, cut some of your hair off when you were sleeping or taught the dog to pee on your side of the bed. It’s always ‘Okay, okay. He’s still young, he’ll get better as he grows older.’ It’s been nine years, and there’s still NO improvement in the pesky bother. I mean brother. Same thing really. 3. ‘You should set a good example’ This almost always follows the ‘He’s younger than you, let it go.’ As though whatever awful thing your sibling has just done is YOUR fault. Of course, if they do something amazing, it’s because they learned that from your parents, not from you. You just can’t win this game, peeps. 4. ‘He’s only following you everywhere because you’re his hero.’ Yeah, but he’s my arch nemesis. I don’t want him hanging around me all the time. Plus, he’s just following me so he can be a snoop and a snitch and gather dirt that he can blackmail me with. 5. ‘It can’t have hurt that much. He’s so small!’ Oh really? Have you ever had him sit on your stomach and jump up and down till you agree to watch what he wants to watch? I didn’t think so! Let’s arrange that and see if you think it still can’t hurt ‘that much’. I will admit one thing though, all our fighting and yelling sure does help pass the time during this lockdown.  I am jealous of my friends who do have a sibling or were lucky enough to be born second in line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/one-and-done/article31753688.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Seasons in the snow||Movie: March of the Penguins  Genre: French feature length documentary (2005)  Two cinematographers — Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison spent a whole year in cold, chilly Antarctica filming emperor penguins in their natural habitat. They brought out some amazing footage of the life of these penguins and their demanding, and often, dangerous, journey to their breeding grounds. Emperor penguins are important members of the Antarctic ecosystem. At the end of the Antarctic summer, this breeding ground is only a few 100m from the open water where the penguins feed. But, as the seasons turn, and the end of winter approaches, the sea is 100km away. Team work The female penguin lays only one egg, and both parents need to take care of the chick for it to survive the harsh climate. It is a tough fight to keep the chick alive, fed, and away from the harsh natural elements. With spring approaching, hunting becomes easier as the ice melts and the sea comes closer.  Happy feet  This French-made documentary won numerous awards, including an Oscar, and became one of the highest-grossing documentaries in movie history. The American version of “March of the Penguins” featured a straightforward narration by the Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman. However, the French version of the film, titled “La Marche de l’empereur”, used the voices of human actors to make it appear as if the penguins were speaking. At the 78th Academy Awards, on March 5, 2006, “March of the Penguins” won an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Its success sparked a mini-penguin craze, leading to the release of “Happy Feet” in November 2006.  This French-made documentary won numerous awards, including an Oscar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/seasons-in-the-snow/article31753701.ece

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Marvel at the mighty earth||June 5 is World Environment Day – a day to reflect on what we can do for Planet Earth. This year’s observance is themed around biodiversity. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life that can be found on Earth – from plants and animals to fungi and bacteria – and the ecosystems that house and support them. There are around eight million species on the planet and they exist in an intricate balance with each other. Humans are dependent on nature for water, food, clothing, shelter, medicines, energy and more. As we use and consume more resources, we increasingly put pressure on our fragile ecosystems. Development, urbanisation and pollution are wreaking havoc on the planet. Nature is struggling to keep up with man. We need to listen to the message it is sending us and help rebuild it. Brimming with life In an effort to protect biologically rich and deeply threatened places, 36 regions have been identified as biodiversity hotpots, i.e. regions that together support more than half of the world’s plant species and nearly 43% of bird, mammal, reptile and amphibian species as endemic ones, which means they are found nowhere else on Earth. Four biodiversity hotpots include parts of India – the Himalayas, the Indo-Burma region, the Western Ghats, and Sundaland. Some iconic species that you will find in these regions include the Asian elephant, the tiger, the white-bellied heron, the South Asian river dolphin, the pygmy loris, and so on. India is the only country in the world with native populations of both tigers and lions.  Under threat  Over the years, factors such as habitat loss, overfishing, overhunting and climate change have caused extinction and biodiversity loss. Since many of these species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, they must be protected. If they are lost, they are gone forever. This World Environment Day, take it upon yourself to discover more about how the future of Earth’s many beautiful and precious life forms can be conserved. It’s time to celebrate biodiversity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/marvel-at-the-mighty-earth/article31753695.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||All in a book||Thesaurus? Is that a cousin of Allosaurus? Far from it. The thesaurus is a book that gives us synonyms. These are words that have similar meanings. We had discussed synonyms in the previous issue. A thesaurus is something like a dictionary. But, a dictionary gives you the meanings of words, and a thesaurus gives you words that have a similar meaning. For example, if you want to know words that are similar in meaning to ‘great’, you refer to the thesaurus and you would find words like ‘expert’, ‘good’, ‘skilful’, ‘veteran’, ‘majestic’, ‘magnanimous’ and so on. A thesaurus also gives you words that have an opposite or somewhat opposite meaning. These are called ‘antonyms’. For example, antonyms for ‘great’ are ‘unskilled’, ‘amateur,’ ‘insignificant,’ ‘unseasoned’ and so on. A thesaurus comes in handy when you are composing a letter, a story, an essay, a poem or any other kind of literary work. When you are struggling for a word that you want to reflect exactly what you want to say, the thesaurus could be a life-saver.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/all-in-a-book/article31753689.ece

When a car is in motion, the wind speed on the roof of the car is more than in the lower part of the windscreen. The pressure on the top is less while at the bottom of the windscreen is more. So, when rain falls on the high pressure zone it will automatically flow to the low pressure zone. It is relative motion.  What is Coronavirus?  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause fever, respiratory problems, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms too. The 2019 novel coronavirus is one of seven members of this family known to infect humans, and the third in the past three decades to jump from animals to humans. Since emerging in China in December, the coronavirus has caused a global health emergency, and the World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article31753655.ece

These were so delicious that all the villagers thronged to his place for their supply of fruits and vegetables. The greedy king of Liberty heard this and wanted to acquire the land from the farmer. He summoned the farmer to his kingdom. The farmer was asked a lot of questions about how he could provide the villagers with so much vegetables. The farmer was scared to tell the jealous king the reality. So, the king told his courtiers to check the farmer’s house secretly while he was asleep. When the courtiers went to the farmer’s house, they found a magic drum. This was reported to the king. The king arranged to call the farmer to the kingdom along with his drum. The farmer arrived and was asked about the drum. He in turn chose not to tell the king anything as he realised the king’s intentions. The king’s curiosity grew and he himself tried the magic drum, but in vain. The farmer then explained to the king that the drum was magical and would grant wishes only when one was polite and humble. He did a lot of hard work in managing the crops and prayed to the magic drum to give him a good harvest with which he could provide for all the villagers, which was when his wish was granted.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Versatile Vijayakumar||Starting as a child artiste in films, he grew up to become a hero. Later in his career he donned more mature roles and got busy in both silver and small screens. It was more destiny, which led him down various paths, according to senior actor Vijayakumar. He looks back at the milestones and turning points in his life in a free-wheeling conversation. May be you should begin at the beginning...   (Laughs) You are right. I started as a child artiste in Sri Valli directed by T.R. Ramanna where Sivaji Ganesan and Padmini did the main roles. I was Bala Murugan. That was way back in 1961. As hero, I acted in about 50 films, till say, Kaali , in which I shared the screen space with the protagonist. I went away to the U.S. and was away from arc lights for a while, until Mani Ratnam offered me the role in Agni Natchatiram . I wondered whether I should do a father’s role but he convinced me. Mani Ratnam believed that the role would be talked about. A few others felt the same way. I took the plunge and you know the rest. It was a super hit and I had started my next round, playing character roles, which has continued. Till date I would have done some 750 films in all the South Indian languages, and one in Hindi too. In that case, you would have acted with the heroes in those regional languages...  Of course. I acted with MGR ( Indru Pol Endrum Vaazhga ), with the late thespian Sivaji Ganesan in Deepam and with Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in many movies. Well, except Sivakarthigeyan, I have acted with all the young heroes. Same is the case with other languages. How did the small screen entry happen?  The credit goes to Ramya Krishnan. She wanted me to do a role in her television serial ‘Thangam.’ I politely refused because I didn’t have the time. But she wouldn’t take no for an answer and was prepared to adjust the shooting time. I agreed and I must admit that the serial, which was a super hit opened new doors for me. I went on to do ‘Vamsam’ and ‘Nandini’ and now ‘Raasaathi.’ So what do you like the best — hero roles, supporting roles or the serials?  Well, it’s all the same as far as acting is concerned. Right now serials have a wide reach. But, how can I ignore the meaty characters, which won me accolades, in Nattamai , Natpukkaga , Kizhakku Seemaiyile , Cheran Pandian and of course Anthimantharai . I narrowly missed the national award in the last mentioned, I was told. For cinema, shooting is at a more relaxed pace, whereas for serials, it is work on all the days of the week. Now, the Lockdown has kept everyone indoors. You are a close friend of both Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. What do you like in both of them?  Rajinikanth is a quiet person, who recedes to the background after finsihsing his work. Kamal likes to discuss the scene, etc. I am also dear to all the top heroes like Ajith, Vijay, Surya, Karthi and so on. You know all the political leaders of Tamil Nadu?  Yes, I played a role in Aringar Anna’s first foreign trip — to Singapore. I went to see him off at the airport. I admire Kamarajar, who was absolutely selfless. I have made it a point to meet and garland every Chief Minister, when they come to power, be it MGR, Madam Jayalalithaa and others. You were producer and actor. But you did not venture into direction. Why?  I produced Nenjangal , in which Sivaji Ganesan, Lakshmi, Manjula and myself acted. The film was directed by Major (Sunderarajan). I did Kai Kodukum Kai , starring Rajnikanth, Revathi and Sowcar Janaki, directed by Mahendran. But this film I did not produce as such, but was in charge of production. After these two productions, I went back to acting. Direction is a big job and it is not as if I don’t know the art of directing a movie. After acting in 750 films under the baton of at least 500 directors, I do have the experience to go behind the camera but have preferred not to get involved in it. About your son Arun Vijay?  He is going on the right path and I am happy for him. My daughters — Vanitha, Preetha and Sridevi — were all talented but their acting careers did not take off. Arun is doing well and I’m waiting to see him scale new heights.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||In Kelubabu's masterclass||"Growing up, even when my father was at home, I felt he wasn’t actually with us. We were constantly competing with his art for attention. It wasn't easy getting past hordes of disciples, admirers and organisers to reach him. But my perception changed when I once fell severely ill. I found baba always at my bedside, running his fingers through my hair or massaging my legs,” says Ratikant Mohapatra in an emotion-choked voice. With an extended lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 and dance academies across the world launching virtual classes to continue training, it is also a good time to look back at gurus who defined art education. Kelucharan Mohapatra was certainly one of them. Though a Odissi legend, his influence on the wider dance world has been profound. His many influences blended seamlessly in his vision for Odissi. He was a Patachitra artiste, could play the tabla and mardala, worked in Annapurna Theatre (where he learnt about sets and acting) and traced his artistic roots to gotipua, a ritualistic dance form of Odisha. Kelubabu (as he was fondly referred as) took the dance form from temple precincts to global platforms by bringing about a radical shift in Odissi’s structure and technique. He conveyed the richness and sensuality of his distinct style with a slight stretch and curve of the arms, gentle moves, statuesque poses, a supple and twisting spine and an intensely expressive face. Though tradition was his leitmotif, there was also a stirring display of imagination. Whether he was dancing, teaching or ideating, the body or mind never experienced a dull moment. “As disciples, we were awe-struck by his improvisational skills, with his compositions taking on a new shape every time they were taught or performed. There was so much to observe and assimilate. He was a generous guru, who shared every little nuance with the students and watched with delight when they performed. Most of the star Odissi dancers such as Sanjukta Panigrahi, Sonal Mansingh, Kumkum Mohanty, Madhavi Mudgal and Protima Bedi trained under him in the gurukul paddhati . I often felt lost and let down about not getting preferential treatment, but over the years, I realised how his approach has helped me find my own space in the world of dance,” says Ratikant, who now heads Srjan, the school of dance founded by Kelucharan Mohapatra in 1993 at Bhubaneshwar. Enriching the repertoire With his insatiable curiosity to learn and explore, Guru Kelucharan kept adding to the dance form, enriching its repertoire. In 1990, he underwent a bypass surgery, which was performed by eminent cardiac surgeon Dr. Devi Shetty. During his visits to the hospital and his stay there, the veteran artiste would ask the doctor several questions to understand the human anatomy. Post-surgery, armed with enough scientific information on body dynamics, he brought about changes in Odissi's movement vocabulary. He especially came up with the ardha-chauka posture to minimise strain on the knee and hip and for equal distribution of the body weight. Kelubabu had 5,200 direct disciples. Whenever Ratikant travels with the Srjan troupe for performances and workshops, he meets people who invariably mention some member of their family having been trained by his father. “When it came to his art, he enjoyed moving with the times, incorporating contemporary sensibilities into its presentation. But personally, he preferred to remain a simple man from a small town called Raghurajpur. I feel his dance derived its soul from his simplicity and warmth. As artistes, we could get carried away by praise, sometimes even allowing it to get to our head. But not him. I have put up baba’s pictures all over Srjan to keep reminding us what it takes to leave one’s footprints.” Recalling one of the most heart-warming incidents, Ratikant says, “Among the people who came to pay respects to baba the day he passed away were two rickshawallahas. One kept flowers at his feet. The other placed two beedis and a matchbox. When I asked him why, he said baba used to travel in his rickshaw when working in Cuttack. ‘He was one of my most trusted friends with whom I could share my worries and woes. He would often buy me beedis and has helped me on several occasions. I have come from Cuttack to pay tributes to this kind soul’. That day, I realised the true meaning of art being a way of life.” For guru Kelucharan, teaching was a continuous process. His house always echoed with the sound of music and footsteps. “A taskmaster, he insisted on studying the Natyasastra, gaining knowledge of music and instruments, reading ancient texts, knowing the folk forms and fine arts and understanding the culture of the region to find newer dimensions of the art. Everything was about dance for him. The hardships of his early days as a daily wage labourer, watering and carrying sand for the maintenance of betel groves, made him work unceasingly when he was finally able to pursue his passion — Odissi. “He wanted to pass on the art to as many since his dream was to see Odissi become popular around the world. He would often tell me, ‘Hundreds of my students are dancing today and I feel as if I am dancing through them. Only when nobody can take my dance forward will I experience sadness’,” says Ratikant.  I have gained deeper insights into the dance form by being a part of my father’s creative journey||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/in-kelubabus-masterclass/article31752969.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||He started at the top and stayed there||Someone asked Lord Beaconsfield from whom he was descended. He replied, “Sir, I am an ancestor, not a descendant.” While all great men are, in one sense, the product of their times and inherit the accumulated discipline of ages through their preceptors, they are in another and more valid sense, individual luminaries in their own right, and commence rather than continue a tradition. Palghat Mani Aiyar, like the late Tiger Varadachariar and Veena Dhanammal, was one such artiste to whom a period of study was merely a technical .preliminary for the expression of an inherent creativity. Mastery and control over an instrument is one aspect of an art. It provides the grammatical background of it. But in the hands of a genius, it recedes into the background and in fact, is taken for granted, and becomes nothing more than a medium for the display of a vast treasury of musical wealth. Mani Aiyar was a prodigy. He was born with a mridangam in his mind. But unlike other prodigies he did not descend into mediocrity with the passing of the years, but grew from strength to strength, so that by the time he was an adolescent, he was not a promising youngster but an acknowledged master. He did not rise to the top. He started at the top and stayed there. He had his early training under Chathapuram Subba Aiyar, who was well-known to the listeners of my generation as an unassuming and competent exponent, who often accompanied Palghat Rama Bhagavathar and Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar. Later, he learnt the subtler aspects of the art under Tanjore Vaidyanatha Aiyar,who was an excellent teacher and a great artiste, besides being a bon vivant and a fine raconteur of musical jokes. I listened to Mani Aiyar’s playing for the first time in 1928, when he accompanied Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, to whom, more than to anyone else, is due the honour of having brought him to the notice of the discerning public. It was the occasion of the inauguration of the Music Academy, as a side-show of the Congress session which was held in Madras that year. I saw a short, thin, darkish boy, just emerging into his teens, beside whom the instrument loomed large, accompanying the veteran vocalist with quiet confidence, and Chembai leading him proudly, somewhat like the owner of the horse that has won the Derby. From then onwards Mani Aiyar never looked back. He soon reached a stage of having to reject more offers than accepting them, so greatly was he in demand. Indeed, he became a kind of yardstick by which to test the eminence of an artiste. It was a sought-after praise of an artiste to say that he was accompanied by Mani Aiyar himself. And the best tribute that one could pay to a mridangam vidwan was to say, “After Mani Aiyar, he is the best.” As Mathew Arnold said of Shakespeare, “Others abide our question, thou art free.” During his early years of thrusting prominence, some of the senior artiste, including the great Dakshinamurthy Pillai, jealously put him to the test. But Pillai was too genuine an artiste to succumb to jealousy, or denigrate a deserved distinction, and after one performance blessed him in his characteristic way: “Very good, very good, may God (Andavan) bless him.” And several years later, Mani Aiyar paid his own tribute to Pillai, during a concert by Alathur Brothers in which he was being accompanied on the ganjira by Dakshinarnurthy’s son Swaminatha Pillai, by intervening during a ‘tani’ and saying, “He is good, but is about one-fourth of his great father.” On another occasion, the late Nayana Pillai tried to confront him by marking the “tala” with his fingers concealed in his upper cloth. Mani Aiyar was undaunted and intervening said, “What is this esoteric Gayatri Japam? Kindly mark the tala openly.” This incident was mentioned to me by my friend C. K. Venkatanarasimhan, who was Mani Aiyar’s closest friend amongst rasikas. Much can be said in praise of Mani Aiyar, but what was it that marked him off from the rest of his profession and endowed him with exclusive excellence? Firstly, it was the “musical” quality of his playing. He realised that the mridangam was not a mere percussion instrument, but one which was tuned to the particular sruti in which the artiste was singing, and that unless it was played so as to bring out its melodic fidelity and affinity to the sruti, it was just a manual belabouring of dead leather. This was particularly pertinent, when the artiste lingered on the upper shadja, and the resonance of the mridangam (from the right side) lent the voice a support which enhanced its excellence when it was truly in tune, and masked its deficiency or weakness in volume when it was not. Secondly. Mani Aiyar was ever conscious of being an accompanist and never tried to dominate the show by diverting attention to himself. In this he did not always succeed. The audience were unconsciously attracted to him and were drawn by the magnet-pull of his artistry, in spite of themselves. In this, sometimes even the main artiste joined (like the late Ariyakkudi) by saying 'Aaha' at frequent intervals. I have with me several recordings, to prove this point. Further, he followed the tempo of the musician with genuine faithfulness and never played in a faster time measure, as some of the obstreperous youngsters of the present generation do. He was a ‘pakka vadyam’ when he accompanied an artiste, but was a ‘pukkaa vadyam’ when he played the ‘tani.’ But even here he showed an admirable reticence, which only a great artiste can accomplish. In one of his infrequent speeches (he loved to play but hated to speak) he said “a tani should not be very long. About ten minutes should be sufficient for it.” And although his skill in combining the various jatis or in manipulating the concluding ‘tirmanam’ were unsurpassed. He preferred to bring out the music of the mridangam rather than the mathematical intricacies of it. In this he was more akin to the late Alaganambi Pillai than to Dakshimamurthy. Thirdly, he was responsible for introducing several new phrases in the mridangam. The original Tanjore style was comparatively uncomplicated and relied mainly on the four-unit measure or the ‘chatusrajati,’ which is without doubt, the basic phrase in song as well as in tala. But Mani Aiyar borrowed some of the phrases from the ‘Chendai’ of Kerala which has several distinct phrases of its own. The phrase ‘Taka dimi taka’ is one such and Mani Aiyar made full use of it. Indeed, in his occasional moods of exuberance, he even over-did the Chendai phrases! This apart from his own building up of the orthodox phrases, which he elaborated in his own way. He gave a new expansiveness and a new dimension to the art of the mridangam. He was a musician first and a mridangam player only next. So much so that he developed a peculiar style of following the song instead of merely giving tala support to it. This created a controversy amongst some of his colleagues who felt that the mridangam had a language of its own, and was intended to support the songs and not reproduce it on the instrument. But those who have heard him accompany a song like ‘Endaro Mahanubhavulu’ or ‘Sri Venugopala’ may be pardoned for enthusing over it, although it is a dangerous deviation in the hands of lesser artistes. Another controversy for which he was responsible was his refusal to play before a microphone. He genuinely felt that the mike had ruined the need for voice culture, distorted the natural voice, made a whisper into a thunder and altogether made the inferior acceptable. Those of my generation, who have heard the great musicians of the past sing in higher srutis can well understand his view on this matter. But no individual can swim against the current of history, and the mike has come to stay; and has enabled large audiences, instead of merely handful of elites, to listen to a concert; a point which has an economic more than even a musical significance. Besides, all the musicians of the present day have attuned (or shall I say low-tuned) themselves to the mike and they find it difficult to give a mikeless concert once in a while. I am inclined to feel that Mani Aiyar’s refusal to play in a mike-ridden concert may perhaps have been due to his understandable reluctance to play for all and sundry, but this is only my personal view and a conjecture and not evidenced. The mridangam has an independent and honoured place in Carnatic music, where the tala and the song go together, and where, in the singing of a Pallavi for instance, it is integral to the music. Connoisseurs of music are not always knowledgeable in following the nuances of the mridangam. They have a general understanding of the tala (which they usually mark off with their hands but in constant fear of missing it) but not much expertise in following the permutations and combinations and the arithmetic involved in them. Several years ago, when I put up a budget for a zamindari which was then under the Court of Wards, I left the expenditure of the music college intact. The member in charge ordered: “The vocal, veena and violin classes may continue but the mridangam class may be abolished It is only a drum and may be played by one of the college servants when required.” I then showed him Sir C. V. Raman’s article on the mridangam which described the exactitude of its tonal excellence and to say that he was astonished will be an understatement. Most musical enthusiasts are only slightly more learned. They like it without precisely knowing why. But it is a great instrument, with musical more than percussion qualities, and a great artist like Mani Aiyar made it sing. Let me conclude by recalling two tributes paid to him by two eminent artistes. The first was by Tanjore Vaidyanatha Aiyar (his own guru), who accompanied T. R. Mahalingam at a concert during the heyday of the latter's youthful glory. At the end of the concert he told me: “I wish Mani had played in this concert.” Another was by Tiger Varadachariar. He told me “During ordinary times Mani has ten fingers. When he plays, he has fifty fingers. If he had a tail, he will be Nandikesvara.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||A revival story||A Patasala in Pazhur, founded by Ramachandra Iyer, the then Collector of Karur, a century ago, has been revived after a decline. He had set up a trust and endowed a few houses, and lands in Pazhur, Sirugamani and nearby villages to run the institution, which produced hundreds of scholars. For almost half a century, it was one of the best in the State. Angarai V Krishna Ganapadigal served there as a teacher for 45 years and shaped several eminent Vedic scholars. Dwindling income led to a decline in the 1980s and the Kamakoti Pitam stepped in to bring things back on rail. It is now being run as sastra patasala and the boys completing ganantha padam are sent to Pazhur for nyayam, sastram and kavyam studies. The properties have been appropriately restored and the monthly expenditure is supplemented by over Rs. 1 lakh. honouring the noble intention of the late founder. Thirty-year old R. Neelakantha Sastri has played a significant role in getting the Patasala up on its feet. He quit a lucrative job in Chennai and moved to Pazhur to serve at the Patasala. Right from his childhood, Neelakantha Sastri had an inclination towards Vedic education and Sastras. At the age of seven, he was enrolled in the renowned Raja Veda Kavya Patasala in Kumbakonam. After completing eight years of study there he came under the tutelage of Sri Mullaivasal Krishnamurthy Sastrigal for Sanskrit and Devadatta Govinda Patil to study sastras for five years. It was during his three-year (2015-18) Sastras teaching stint in Chennai, when he felt the urge to move to a location away from the distractions of the city. His wife too supported him in his decision and the two moved to Pazhur with their two young daughters in mid-2018. He completely involved himself in the revival of the Patasala on a Gurukulam model. Students get individual attention, progress according to their capacity. The students are completely at ease and are found engaged in lively debates among themselves and the teacher on matters of subject. Under the care of Neelakantha Sastrigal, the premises now has a gosala. A library with about 1,500 books has been set up. A full time teacher, Manikanta Ganapadigal, has joined the faculty, apart from Subramanya Ganapadigal, who comes in as a guest faculty and a subject matter expert. The number of students has increased from seven to 16. Technology is used well to impart education here. An OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for Sanskrit has created an offline corpus that includes over 3,000 books. An online Vaidika group keeps exchanging notes on Sastra. Virtual education could be the next goal.  Mahaswami’s visit Lauding the benevolence of Ramachandra Iyer, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, who visited the Pazhur patasala on Founder’s Day — December 3, 1942 — exhorted the villagers to continue the good deed. “It will not be wise to let the Dharma of Ramachandra Iyer dissipate. Make the best use of the institution,” said the Acharya, who went on to speak on philosophy and sastra. During his Vijaya Yatra recently, Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati, who halted at the Tiruvanaikkaval Math, visited the Pazhur patasala and blessed the inmates. Although the late Ramachandra Iyer’s cause has been given a new lease of life with the funds he had earmarked in his last will, a huge outlay is required to restore the building and other properties. Besides the plan is to allocate funds for medical and religious activities. Jayaraman, auditor in Tiruchi (94433 76766), in charge of the Tiruvanaikkaval Math and Veda Patasala also administers the Pazhur Veda Patasala.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||He wielded his 3D power with telling effect||“Icha Sakti, Gnana Sakti, Kriya Sakti Swaroopini...”  Mother Goddess is hailed thus in‘Sri Lalitha Sahasranama.’ She is the desire, which is the cause of an action, also the intellect, which gives it shape and finally the energy, which is essential to execute it. One without the other two attributes would amount to nothing. Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, 68th head of Sri Kamakoti Pitam, referred to with affection and reverence as Mahaswami, was an epitome of Trisakti. From the mundane to the Herculean, he not only conceived the ideas but supplied the blueprint and was fulcrum in their execution. From the day he assumed the mantle as Pitadipati of Moolamnaya Sarvagna Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, established by Sri Adi Sankara, Mahaswami’s heart, intellect and action synchronised towards a single goal — boost Sanatana Dharma, spread hope among its practitioners and nurture Advaita, much as Adi Sankara himself had done millennia before him. “The name came later, given by the invaders, but the faith had remained here for centuries,” he said regarding Hinduism. Mahaswami exuded the three powers — to think, give shape and execute — which propelled him from one milestone to another. His mission started when he turned 20. He did not wait for a day longer than necessary to take charge of the Math and its administration. Indirectly, he had taken charge of the lives of millions — denizens of Bharat, for whom Dharma was a way of life. He stepped out of the secure ambience of the Math to reach out to them, instil courage and cheer. Until his last days, his slogan was the welfare of mankind — health and wealth earned the right way and utilised for fellow beings — human and other species. The century that he spent on this earth was to din these basic principles, which governed one’s life. Mahaswami did not merely preach. He was a living model himself — adhering to the code, laid down by sastras. Austerity and self-denial added fuel to the fire of his Thapas, which was his strength. The long distances that he walked, the astonishing fasting regimen, minimal rest, elaborate pujas, ceaseless interaction with throngs of devotees, issuing guidelines for the countless projects he had initiated — the steely resolve with which he performed all these activities simply did not match the frail figure or the morsels he took as food. The initiatives he launched were sparked by the flame of mission burning within. Thought took shape and flowed into action with effortless ease. Such was his Trisakti, not only have they all survived but are flourishing. From the Pidi Arisi Thittam to taking care of village temples, he chartered a course for each — simple and effective. He was not an IIM alumnus but knew the key aspects of management. He chose the right people to hand over the task and gave them the roadmap. There was no room for doubts. What was daunting in the beginning was accomplished, of course with his blessings and grace. When he wished to promote the singing of Tiruppavai-Tiruvembavai during the month of Margazhi, he organised conferences. But at a lower level, he roped in young children by arranging competitions. In one stroke, he had given a boost to Tamil bhakti movement. To propagate Rama Nama Likita Japa, he awarded silver coins to those who turned in notebooks filled with the deity’s name. The writing of Sriramajayam or Rama is firmly entrenched in many households. His Gurubhakti  Mahaswami’s Gurubhakti was unsurpassed. He made Sankara Jayanti celebration a grand affair, creating an awareness among the followers. If Adi Sankara established Advaita Pitams to place the philosophy on a high pedestal, this Sankara installed marble statues of Bhagavadpadal and his primary disciples across the country. But for his uncanny perception, the Adishtanam of the 58th Acharya, Atma Bodendra Saraswati, would not have come to light. The Aradhana of predecessors is important in the Math calendar, thanks to the impeccable way in which Mahaswami conducted them. When land was donated by a devotee at Satara, his dream of a granite temple for Nataraja on the lines of Chidambaram was fulfilled. Those involved in the construction of the Sankara Stupi — an engineering marvel — at the Prayag confluence would vouch for the power of his mind, which dictated their actions. He was one of the earliest environmentalists, co-existence being his mantra. Poortha dharmam that he initiated found followers marching with tools to dig ponds and wells. “Preserve and create water bodies not only for us but for cattle and other animals because the planet also belongs to them,” he advised. His simplicity and shunning of comforts stemmed from his respect for Nature. Gosamrakshanam and Veda-rakshanam were the two arms of Sanatana Dharma, whose heartbeat was in the Village. Here life revolved round the temple and its activities. Farming, Vedic learning and worship went hand in hand with the entire population participating. Each supported the other and the community thrived. In his long span of life, the Sage had witnessed a sea-change in the milieu. Migration to the City and beyond the shores was already causing damage to the precious fabric. Mahaswami did not fail to take that into account, his reach aiming at the semi-urban and urban populations, repeatedly urging them not to forget the roots, which was the Vedas. Apart from the numerous patasalas, schemes were started, to take care of retired Vaidikas on the one hand and encourage students and teachers on the other. His Trisakti worked like a laser beam accomplishing tasks with precision and perfection, the executors, mere tools. It continues to do so long after he removed himself from the earth. It will empower all those, who meditate on him and try to follow his principles.  The initiatives he launched were sparked by the flame of mission burning within. Thought took shape and flowed into action with effortless ease.

05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||UAA classic uploaded||It has now become routine to find theatre artistes uploading short films and skits for the benefit of their fans and drama lovers. A slew of such productions was featured recently in these columns and enthused by the response they are now totally involved in the novel venture, keeping the digital platform replete with more creations. Amidst all these activities, veteran Y.Gee. Mahendra has uploaded UAA’s classic comedy ‘Andha 7 Aatkal’ on his Abbalam channel, to drive away the Lockdown blues. “Yes, the title was inspired by the Bhagyaraj superhit film but the similarity ends there,” guffaws YGM. The highlight is that he has donned seven roles appearing in quick succession on the stage. “Here, my idol Sivaji Ganesan was the inspiration. He did nine roles in cinema and I tried a modest seven,” he says. Released in four parts, the first part of the play was available on May 23. Now the full play is available. “Not many of this generation would be familiar with ‘Andha 7...’ because it is not easy to repeat now. Staged over 200 times in the 1980s, it is something close to my heart. Hence I decided to give it as a treat to those who have not seen it. Those who have of course can sit back and chuckle in anticipation,” says YGM. Written by Aparajithan and directed by YGM, the play is different in its approach with a young Mahendra appearing first as a nimble fingered thief just released from jail. Another is a strict officer and in comes the thief as an imposter. Every time it is a surprise to find him in a new garb, the dwarf outdoing all of them. On the whole, it is a laugh riot caused by situations moved in that direction to fully exploit the timing of YGM’s humour and his team members, including the ever-green Suppini, to whom the channel’s name owes its origin. YGM is planning to upload more plays, the next on the list likely to be ‘Kadhalikka Naeramundu.’ T.V. Varadharajen with his short film ‘Appavaikkanom,’ T.V. Radhakrishnan with ‘Corona Maama’ and Kalaivaani Digital Media with ‘Meena’ are among the others, presenting productions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/uaa-classic-uploaded/article31752942.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Her voice was as sweet as her bow||T. Rukmini remains the rarest of rare gems in the field of Carnatic music. With her rich knowledge and experience, she was a pioneering violinist. If her guru R. R. Kesavamoorthy ushered her into the world of Carnatic music, tutelage under maestros Lalgudi G Jayaraman (violin) and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer (vocal) made her talent blossom. All of 16 at that point of time, she went on to become one of the finest artistes of the century. Rukmini served the field for more than 65 years, sharing the stage as accompanist with five generations of artistes. She also presented solo concerts. Rukmini’s music was aesthetics personified. Be it a simple and sweet Ritigowla or a tongue-twister of a Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi with assorted mathematical calculations, her response to the primary artiste was most admirable. It appealed to both the rasikas and scholars. Rukmini was the only violinist to have matched Mali’s (flute) brilliance when she was barely 16. There was dignity and poise in her playing, which was devoid of any unnecessary phrase. Even as a young artiste, she was much in demand to accompany stalwarts such as Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, T. K. Rangachari, Voleti Venkateswarlu, Ramnad Krishnan, D.K. Pattammal, D.K. Jayaraman, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Veena Balachander, M.D. Ramanathan, M.L. Vasanthakumari, M.S. Subbulakshmi and so on. With T.R. Subramanyam (TRS) she engaged in exciting exchanges while her fitting responses to the Sikkil Sisters during the kalpanaswara spells or ragamalika renditions were both interesting and educative. Sought-after combination The DKJ-Rukmini combo needs special mention. It was a much-awaited experience, which the audience relished. She was affectionately called Ruks by the DKJ family. They travelled the world extensively on concert tours. Rukmini also provided vocal support for the Bharatanatyam performances of Padmalochana Nagarajan and Vyjayanthimala Bali in India and abroad. Rukmini served the Sri Thiagaraja Sangeetha Vidwath Samajam (Mylapore) as vice-president for six years. Other than the State and Central Government recognitions (Kalaimamani and Sangeet Natak Akademi), she was adorned by awards such as Sangita Kala Acharya and Sangeetha Choodamani. She was the only artiste to have an ‘A’ grade in both violin and vocal for a long period of time, apart from being a top rank artiste of All India Radio in violin. Apart from composing varnams and thillanas, she also set tune to several songs of Subramanya Bharati, Dasar Padams Tiruppavai and other Pasurams. Her vocal prowess found her singing with Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna. A student of Rukmini had a lot to imbibe. A patient teacher, she extended maternal affection towards all her disciples. On stage, she was most encouraging. She put me at ease whenever I sat beside her to accompany. If the presence of stalwarts made me nervous because of which I erred, she would step in to erase the tension in one gentle reassuring stroke. She was such a dedicated teacher, her blessings will continue to guide her students.  A patient and affectionate teacher, she was most encouraging when her young disciples played along with her on stage||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/her-voice-was-as-sweet-as-her-bow/article31752963.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Festive instrument||During one of our visits to Jaipur, we made a trip to the marble city of India — Kishangarh, popularly known as Madanganj-Kishangarh. The Kishangarh style of painting, which is famous for depicting singer and poet Bani Thani, had its origins here. As one of our hobbies is painting, we were fascinated by this beautiful art. It portrays elegant and graceful women with characteristic features — sloping foreheads, long curved eyes, chiselled lips, sharp pointed nose and chin. Curled locks near the ear is also one of the specialities of this painting. The Radha-Krishna love is one of the central themes, apart from court scenes and portraits of kings, nawabs and saints. We also witnessed the popular Chari dance and came to know that the musical instrument Bankia is played during the performance of this folk dance. Bankia resembles the trumpet and belongs to the category of aerophones. It is also played during weddings, ceremonial processions, religious ceremonies and festive occasions in Rajasthan and neighbouring regions. It is performed mostly by the bhopas, the priest-singers of the folk deities and the Dhadhi community. Powerful sound The Bankia is a natural trumpet, a valveless instrument. It is made of bronze and has two parts, the bugle is like a tube and a bell that is in the shape of a saucer with an integrated mouth piece through which air is blown. It is a simple bugle that produces a powerful sound. Chari Dance is performed in a group by women belonging to the Gujjar and Saini communities of North Rajasthan. The women, who are colourfully dressed and adorned with jewels such as armlets, bangdi, gajra, hansli, karli, kanka, mogri, navr, punchi and timniya, hold the Chari pots, usually made of brass or clay, on their heads. Chari is also referred as Charu means metallic water pot. Usually the Chari is lit with fire and the fire is set with the usual lamp oil or with cotton seeds immersed in oil. The dancers, without touching it, perform graceful movements and fast twirls to the tunes of the Bankia and rhythms of the dholak. The Chari dance is performed at weddings and on the birth of a child, particularly a male child, apart from other celebrations and festivals. This dance is said to depict the ritual of collecting water. Rajasthan being an arid region, women walk miles daily with their charis to collect water. Among the other instruments that accompany the Chari are the nagada, dholak, harmonium, dhol and bankia. The men stand in a corner and play these instruments with the women dancing at the centre. Bankia is also part of the Kachi Ghodi folk dance which is performed by men on dummy horses. It is performed during the annual elephant festival, held just before Holi in Jaipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/festive-instrument/article31752974.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Support in their twilight years||Veda Pata Nidhi Trust, which observes both the Jayanti and Aradhana of Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, has to be content with puja indoors at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, thanks to the extended Lockdown. Veda gosham and puja ritual will, however, be streamed live on the Trust’s Facebook page and website, 6.30 p.m. today, Friday. Started at the suggestion of Mahaswami in 1983, soon after his Jayanti celebrations, the Trust is dedicated to Vedic pundits in two categories — those who are 60 and above and those who are 80 and above. An amount is sent to each family as pension. The trust identifies indigent Vedic pundits in South India, who have learnt the moolam of at least one Veda Shaka. It was Annathurai Iyengar, a lawyer who was Mahaswami’s trusted lieutenant, who spearheaded the execution of the scheme. The late T.S. Santhanam, Chairman of the TVS group of companies, was the founder and the late Nani A. Palkhivala was the first chairman of the Trust. K. Parasaran, former Solicitor General is the present Chairman. In the past 37 years, the trust has provided over 13,000 honorariums. On the demise of the pensioner, the Trust extends financial aid to the family to perform the last rites and rituals during the 13 days, which are mandatory to a follower of Sanatana Dharma. The amount has recently been raised to Rs. 15,000. “Mahaperiyava laid great emphasis on Antyeshti samskaras and exhorted people to do them with faith. The Veda Pata Nidhi Trust is trying to fufill that,” says Sarabeswaran. “Although the Trust is supporting the pundits, public contribution would enable us to do better,” he adds. Cheque/DD/PO drawn in favour of Veda Pata Nidhi Trust may be sent to the Secretary, Veda Pata Nidhi Trust, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 18-22, East Mada Street, Mylapore, Chennai 600004.

Uday Bawalkar, a dhrupad exponent. The sessions will be through Zoom. Links of the sessions will be sent to participants through WhatsApp or email after they register online for the workshop. Last date is June 7. Disciple of Zia Fariduddin Dagar and Zia Mohiuddin Dagar, Pt. Bawalkar, besides performing concerts, regularly conducts lecture-demonstrations and workshops in an effort to popularise dhrupad gayaki. Hailing from Ujjain, he began his training in classical music with khayal but soon decided to pursue dhrupad and joined the Dhrupad Kendra in Bhopal at the age of 15. One of the oldest forms of Hindustani music, over the years, with dwindling practitioners and listeners, dhrupad had been losing its place in the classical music firmament. Along with other prominent vocalists of the form, Pt. Bawalkar has been trying to demystify this ancient music without distorting its intrinsic features and reaching out to larger audiences across the world. He teaches dhrupad at his Swarkul in Pune and is also associated with ITC Sangeet Research Academy in Kolkata. Through programmes and interactive sessions, he has been drawing listeners to experience dhrupad’s meditative quality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/online-dhrupad-workshop/article31752939.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||DKP’s brother passes away||D.K. Nagarajan, elder brother of D.K. Jayaraman, younger to D.K. Ranganathan and D.K. Pattammal, passed away on June 1. He was born on July 16, 1924 as the third son of Dhamal Krishnaswami Dikshitar and Rajamma. The late Nagarajan was also a vocalist and presented concerts with sister Pattammal. It is his voice, heard along with DKP, in the the song “Thaayin Maikkodi Vaanil Uyarndhu” ( Thyaga Bhoomi , 1939). In the late 1930s and 40s, he also accompanied D. K. Jayaraman in concerts. Moving to the U.S., he took up teaching there and performed many concerts, in one of which he sang to the accompaniment of Sandhya Srinath on the violin and nephew J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam. Excerpts from an interview with the late Nagarajan published in this supplement in March 2018: “When our father suggested that Pattammal should sing kutcheris, my eight athais objected vehemently, and said if she sang in public, no one would marry her. But Pattammal had sung before Paramacharya, and he had told father, ‘Your daughter has Saraswathi kataksham. Nobody can stop her from becoming a famous musician.’ So, father ignored the objections of his sisters.” “Seated on the swing in our Kanchipuram house, Ranganathan anna, our eldest brother, would review Pattammma’s singing. She valued his opinion very much,” says Nagarajan. When the family moved to Madras, they took up residence in Purasawalkam. When did Nagarajan start singing with DKP? “When I was five years old. Every month she had at least ten concerts. Once when I was around eight, DKP took me with her to Meignanapuram. We travelled in a irattai maattu vandi (bullock cart) from Tiruchendur to Meignanapuram. The shops in Meignanapuram closed only at 8.30 p.m. So, the kutcheri began at 9 p.m. and went on till 3 a.m.!” Did he not feel sleepy? “Father was playing the tambura, and I didn’t dare fall asleep.” When she had to leave for Iswaran’s house, Pattammal was distraught at the thought of being separated from her family, and so Ranganathan sent Nagarajan along with her to Pollachi, where Iswaran lived. “Her remuneration in those days was 500 rupees for a concert, and that soon increased to thousand.” For full article access https:// www.thehindu.com /entertainment/music/ nagarajan -recalls-his...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/dkps-brother-passes-away/article31752981.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Seven ways to train the mind||By developing a positive mindset, we can be happy, irrespective of external factors, according to Swami Mukundananda, whose book, 7 mindsets for success, happiness and fulfilment has generated a lot of response from people during the Lockdown. The book, published by Westland, seeks to change the way one thinks. Founder of Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog (J.K.Yog), a non-profit organisation based in Dallas, Texas, Swami Mukundananda, born in 1960, has been disseminating Vedic knowledge. An alumnus of IIT and IIM, he quit a promising professional career at the age of 23 to dedicate himself to spread the spiritual and holistic betterment techniques. “This book also commemorates J.K.Yog’s 10th year,” said Swami Mukundananda on phone in an interview, in which he shared his thoughts on several concepts. Excerpts: A mindset is the way one habitually thinks. It is an internal resource we all possess. If we can simply cultivate beneficial mindsets, they will open the doors to peace. 7 mindsets is to help those who face setbacks in life because of anger, greed, tension and anxiety. It will be of value at present, when the extended Lockdown is causing stress in terms of restricted movement and sluggish business. One can develop the ability to marshal one’s mental resources and discard negative emotions as useless baggage. Blending science with Vedic scriptures, and logic with spiritual insight, we can make use of the seven techniques of training the mind.” Now, what’s magical about seven? In 1956, George Miller, a cognitive psychologist from Princeton University, wrote what is now called famous as ‘Miller’s Law,’ according to which short-term working memory of an average person is limited to seven items. I chose seven mindsets, which incidentally cover the entire sequence of steps necessary for the mind. The seven steps are:  Positive thinking: Humans continue to believe that power, money and material possessions bring happiness. All of us do know the story of King Midas and the Golden Touch. The choice remains with us to be content.  Taking responsibility for emotions: What should one do to overcome negativity and adverse sentiments? There is no justification for harbouring negative thoughts. Our feelings are a choice we make. The responsibility to control our mind is our own. We are accountable for harbouring pleasant and miserable feelings. Understanding the thin line between stimulus (circumstances) and response (emotions) provides us with the lever to control our sentiments.  Inspiration: One can gain from being inspired by positive people and actions. History has so many examples. For instance, Soichiro Honda, the Japanese engineer and founder of the automotive components company Tokai Seiki, who faced so many hurdles, but went on to create the world’s first motorcycle.  Purity of Intention: One should be propelled towards the right things and focused in the right direction.  Acquiring knowledge: The purity of good intentions has to be backed by a mindset to acquire good knowledge. From the time of Copernicus and Galileo a divergence arose between science and spirituality has existed. Albert Einstein said, ‘Science has succeeded in denaturing the plutonium atom. But it cannot denature the evil in man’s heart.’ This is where spiritual science comes in.  Discipline and self-control: It is the battle between the mind and the intellect. The latter is rational and looks for value, does not get distracted by immediate gratification of the mind. But senses can rebel like children yearning for immediate joy. The Vedas talk of two classified happiness — Shreya and Preya . Shreya as the immediate bitter that turns into nectar, like physical exercise; and Preya as nectar, which becomes poison with over-indulgence. Choose the beneficial path and try ignoring the so called ‘pleasant’ one.  Growing in the face of problems : The final mindset is to develop the ability to face problems in life. Be it at school or work, one cannot run away from reality. Facing challenges leads to growth. Your prayer should not ask for a life without obstacles, but a path to face the obstacles that provide lessons. Like the wise man who said, “I prayed to God for strength, and he gave me difficulties to overcome and become strong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/seven-ways-to-train-the-mind/article31752985.ece

It was an animated debate on the progress of Patasalas, quality of students, examinations, etc. Veda Rakshana Trust was presenting the progress report to the Acharya and discussion was on the way forward, demands, expectations, etc. Even an uninitiated onlooker like yours truly could sense the sincerity with which the Trustees were fulfilling their responsibilities. They were the current custodians of a system, put in place by Mahaswami to make sure that the land resonated with Vedic chants, whatever might be the lifestyle changes in the years to come. Veda Rakshana Nidhi Trust (VRNT) was started in 1963, when Mahaswami had camped at Tiruvanaikkaval. The Trust has a list of Veda Patasalas, located in villages and semi urban areas, requiring financial assistance. There are 200 Patasalas under the Trust, which imparts Vedic education in Gurukula system. Pundits are encouraged to start Patasalas in rare Sakhas.“It is uthamam (supreme) if Vedic knowledge is handed down through generations — grandfather-father-son. VRNT introduced the Hereditary Niyama Adhyayana Scheme (HNY) under which 137 Vidyartis are undergoing Vedic education,” explains R. Sankaran, Executive Trustee. The Trust conducts Veda Sadas at the Kanchi Math on Anusham, Avittam and Uthiradam star days. The Trust supports Vidyartis with a grant. “The courses, methodology, exam pattern — Mahaswami drew up a foolproof plan, which is followed,” says Sankaran. It takes six to eight years to complete the course. Certificates are awarded after tests, conducted by a panel of highly qualified scholars. The amount given varies depending upon the proficiency of the candidate. Also teachers are recognised with cash awards. Outstanding candidates receive special awards. “The certificate given by Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam is highly valued, recognised by several institutions including the TTD,” informs Sankaran. The Trust, located at No 64/31, Subramanian Street, West Mambalam, Chennai - 600 033, has many schemes for donors. “A sum of Rs. 60,000 is needed to run a patasala. Support from philanthropists will be invaluable in keeping the Vedic flame alive, the best way one could serve Periyava,” says Sankaran.

05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Virus patient dies, kin allege hospitals refused admission||The family of a 68-year-old COVID-19 positive man alleged that he died on Thursday morning after failed attempts to admit him at various city hospitals, including the government-run Lok Nayak Hospital. “My dad is having high fever. We need to shift him to hospital. I am standing outside LNJP Delhi & they are not taking him in. He is having corona, high fever and breathing problem. He won’t survive without help. Pls help [sic],” tweeted his daughter Amarpreeton Thursday morning. About an hour later at 9 a.m., she tweeted: “He is no more. The govt failed us [sic].” The Lok Nayak Hospital spokesperson said the man was declared “brought dead” at the hospital. “He died as soon as he was brought in. There was no time for admission. It will be treated as brought dead,” the hospital spokesperson said. Mandeep Singh, the deceased’s son-in-law, said they had on Thursday contacted Max Hospital Saket, Moolchand Hospital in Lajpat Nagar, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and Apollo Hospital in Sarita Vihar, but in vain. “Max said there were no COVID-19 beds while Moolchand said they do not treat such patients but the government website shows it. In Ganga Ram Hospital and Apollo, no one answered calls,” Mr. Singh alleged. An official from Max Hospital said all the COVID-9 beds were full on Thursday at Saket hospital. A Sir Ganga Ram Hospital official “denied all the allegations”. His family members said five days ago, when he had fever, they had tested him at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “On Monday, we found a checked out a link which showed that he was COVID-19 positive but the hospital didn’t inform us. We tried calling them but no one answered. No officials came to thehouse where he was staying to put him on quarantine and no sticker was pasted outside the house,” said Mr. Singh. He added that the family kept trying to admit him in different hospitals from Monday to Wednesday but they said no beds were available. “The hospitals told us to not even bring the patient as we won’t be allowed,” he said. “When we contacted Max Hospital on Monday, we were told to deposit Rs. 5 lakh so that we can take him to the hospital. They said the expenses would be around Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 lakh...,” Mr. Singh said. “This morning, he had breathlessness and we contacted around four hospitals, but they said beds were full. Then we called the government helpline number, 1031, and they asked us to take him to Lok Nayak Hospital. His son took him to the hospital. However, the hospital denied admission and asked him to take the patient to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. By this time, his father had fainted and was rushed inside the hospital. All this while, the hospital authorities never came forward. He died soon after they gave him oxygen,” Mr. Singh said. “The hospital wishes to clarify that the patient was not refused admission and was examined by doctors upon being brought in… When false claims are made and publicised on the Net, it hurts their morale,” Medical Director of Lok Nayak Hospital said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/virus-patient-dies-kin-allege-hospitals-refused-admission/article31753302.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Two fresh chargesheets filed by police in Delhi riots murder cases||Delhi Police on Thursday filed two chargesheets before a local court in connection with alleged murder cases during the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February. While one of the chargesheets was related to the murder of four Muslim youths, including two brothers, the other one was Dilbar Negi murder case. Negi was killed during riots in New Mustafabad and based on eyewitnesses accounts and technical evidences, 12 accused were arrested in the case. The Crime Branch of Delhi Police filed both the chargesheets before Metropolitan Magistrate Richa Parihar who has put up the matters for further hearing on June 18. The chargesheets were filed under Sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. The offences entail a maximum punishment of death sentence. On February 27, four bodies were recovered from north-east Delhi’s Johripur drain, of which two were of brothers Amir Ali (31) and Hashim (19), the police said. The brothers were allegedly beaten to death by a mob when they were returning to their house on the night of February 26, the chargesheet said. WhatsApp trail During investigation, it was found that a WhatsApp group was created in the intervening night of February 25-26, during peak rioting, and two of its members have been arrested, the chargesheet said. The group had 125 members. While some of the members were only sending and receiving chats, few others were involved in “active rioting”, the police said. On the basis of eyewitness accounts and technical evidences, police arrested nine people for murdering Hashim, while eleven were arrested for killing Amir. The accused were identified as Rishabh, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit, Himanshu Thakur, Pankaj, Jatin and several others who all are named in the chargesheet with the specific role they played during riots and killing of Muslims. “Pankaj was the group admin. It was created to mobilise crowd to attack Muslims,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-fresh-chargesheets-filed-by-police-in-delhi-riots-murder-cases/article31753320.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: Safoora Zargar’s plea dismissed||A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed bail plea of Jamia Coordination Committee media coordinator Safoora Zargar in connection with north-east Delhi violence case. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana rejected the contention raised by Ms. Zargar, stating that she is only liable for her individual acts and the speeches delivered or the acts of the other members of the group cannot be read against her. Even if no direct violence is attributable to Ms. Zargar, she cannot shy away from her liability under the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the judge said. “When you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far and spread the fire,” the judge remarked adding, “The acts and inflammatory speeches of the co-conspirators are admissible u/s 10 of the Indian Evidence Act even against the applicant.” The court also directed the jail authorities to provide adequate medical aid to Ms. Zargar. In her bail application, Ms. Zargar had contended that from the material available on record, no act of whatsoever nature, is attributable to her which fomented or incited any violence. Her advocate also submitted that Ms. Zargar was “mischievously” arrested in the present case by the Special Cell of Delhi Police to illegally curtail her liberty upon her release on bail in another case. It was argued that registration of second FIR on the same facts is impermissible. Ms. Zargar was arrested on April 13. It was also pleaded that Ms. Zargar deserves to be on bail on humanitarian grounds as she was 21-week pregnant and suffering from Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder. Her condition became all the more vulnerable due to COVID-19 situation in jails, her counsel argued. On the other hand, Delhi Police “vehemently” opposed the bail application on the ground that there was enough material available on record to show that she was involved in Delhi riots and the prosecution has rightfully involved the provision of the UAPA. While not delving into the merits of the case at this stage, the court said, “the statement recorded...coupled with the WhatsApp chat available on record, it can be safely inferred that there is prima facie, evidence to show that there was a conspiracy to at least blockade the roads”. It said any activity which has a tendency to create a disorder or disturbance of law and order to such an extent that the entire city is brought to its knees and the entire government machinery is brought to a grinding halt, such activity would obviously be treated as an unlawful activity within the meaning of Section 2(o) of the UAPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-riots-safoora-zargars-plea-dismissed/article31753309.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Not an iota of truth in police’s claim, asserts Umar Khalid||Reacting to his name featuring in a chargesheet filed by the Delhi police on the north- east Delhi riots, accusing him of being a part of a larger conspiracy that organised the riots and protests, former JNU student and activist Umar Khalid said that there was not an iota of truth in the police’s claim. Mr. Khalid said that he had not read the chargesheet so could not comment on the entirety of it but was making his comment from what he had gathered from media reports. Looking at the way the entire investigation of the riots has unfolded, Mr. Khalid observed that the government has used the lockdown as an opportunity to crackdown on people who disagree with them. “It does not come as a surprise, for it has been a consistent pattern, which has emerged over the last six years. People, who have been critical of the establishment, are being implicated in false and fabricated cases and are jailed,” Mr. Khalid said. Targeted hunting He added that whether it is individuals like Harsh Mander or organisations like United Against Hate that feature in the chargesheet, all of them have worked extensively on issues like communal harmony, secularism and justice for communal violence victims. “It is an upside down world that we are living in, in which these organisations and individuals that have worked for communal harmony are being implicated in communal violence cases,” said Mr. Khalid. Speaking about the future of the anti CAA-NRC-NRP movement, he said that it depends on a lot of factors due to the crisis that has emerged due to the pandemic like hunger and joblessness. He hoped that the government backtracks on its divisive agenda in its response to a nation that has thrown up so many issues. In the light of activists getting arrested, he feels that over the last six years, there have been many witch-hunts against them but that has not stopped people from stepping up and voicing their opinion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/not-an-iota-of-truth-in-polices-claim-asserts-umar-khalid/article31753317.ece

In May, the government had ordered all private hospitals with 50 or more beds to set aside 20% of their bed strength for COVID-19 patients. “There are a few private hospitals that are facing difficulties in reserving beds for COVID-19 patients. Those private hospitals that are facing difficulties in following the mixed system will be completely converted into COVID designated hospitals. They have time till tomorrow,” Mr. Sisodia said in a video address. He added that the cases are increasing in Delhi and the government’s focus is on saving lives. “Asymptomatic patients do not have to be scared and rush to the hospital. Home isolation is a very good option for patients with no or very mild symptoms,” he added. “We have to save the lives of people of Delhi. We have to ensure that if anyone in Delhi needs a hospital, then beds will be available to them,” Mr. Sisodia said. Health Minister Satyendar Jain, who was also present during the address, said the government was ensuring that moderate and severe category people get immediate healthcare. He added that there were three dedicated private hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and three more were declared on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/some-pvt-hospitals-to-be-fully-tuned-into-covid-19-facilities/article31753304.ece
05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||For kin of officers who died of COVID-19, other worries pile up||Assistant SI Shesh Mani Pandey died due to COVID-19 on May 30 and on Wednesday, his wife and younger son tested positive for the virus. According to his elder son, the pitiable condition of LNJP Hospital has added to their miseries. Mr. Pandey was posted at the fingerprint bureau of the Crime Branch.  The Hindu spoke to families of three such policemen who died of COVID-19 and they shared their stories in the aftermath. Pandey’s 32-year-old elder son said his mother and brother’s test results were received on Wednesday and the department officials suggested to take her to Lok Nayak Hospital. But the condition he saw made him decide to shift his mother to a facility in Paharganj. “My mother complained of chest pain on Wednesday and I took her to Lok Nayak Hospital emergency. We were waiting outside when an officer asked us to enter from the rear side. My mother was made to sit. Later, someone told us that she was sitting next to a body,” he said, adding that he had to stay at a distance from his mother. He said no social distancing was being practised in the hospital and “there was so much chaos that no one knew where to go and whom to meet”. He then shifted his mother and brother to a Delhi Police facility in Paharganj, “which is much better than the hospital”. Mr. Krishna said the police department has been helpful. In Sonipat, late Constable Amit Kumar’s wife Pooja found out that she is pregnant with her second child on the 13th day of his death. Amit had died on May 5 after he was allegedly denied admission by hospitals and care centres. Ms. Pooja and her 3-year-old son had tested positive. However, later they tested negative and returned home. “ Thodi si khushi hui. Ki bacchon ke sahaare jeevan kat jaega [Felt a little happy, thinking I’ll be able to live with the help of my children],” she cried. Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava had offered a job in the force to Ms. Pooja but she said she is a contractual teacher in a civic body school. “Since 2011, I am on contract. I have taken exams to become a permanent teacher also. I just want to request the Delhi government if they can make me a permanent teacher so I am able to give my children a dignified life,” she added. ASI Vikram, who was posted in Sultanpuri police station, also died of COVID-19 on May 31. His son complained that no official has contacted them after the day the last rites were performed.  My mother complained of chest pain when I took her to Lok Nayak Hospital emergency... an officer asked us to enter from the rear side. My mother was made to sit.

05 June 2020||GURUGRAM,||Kin of deceased accuse authorities of inaction||Four days after a resident of Dhani Phogat in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri was found dead, bleeding from the mouth, inside the washroom of a quarantine centre, his family on Thursday alleged that the district administration and the State government had not initiated any action. In what was a case of gross medical negligence, they demanded that a case be registered. The family also gave a complaint to the police on June 2, but a case has not been registered so far. Superintendent of Police, Balwant Singh Rana said the allegations in the matter pertained to not providing ventilator support to the patient leading to his death and it was not a cognisable offence. He said the matter did not pertain to the police. The complaint said the patient had difficulty in breathing and his condition deteriorated in the early hours of June 1, but he was not provided any medical aid. He was also not referred to a hospital with better medical facilities and thus died, said the complaint. The patient had gone to Civil Hospital on May 29 for a COVID-19 examination after he showed symptoms and was sent to an isolation centre at MLR College. He tested positive for the virus two days later, and was shifted to the quarantine centre on the first floor of the same building. He was found dead in the washroom by another inmate, Sandeep Sharma, a few hours later. Mr. Sharma recorded the incident on a phone and also called for help. “He had cough and difficulty in breathing since he was shifted to my room on May 31 evening,” said Mr. Sharma. He said the nurses tried to revive him, but to no avail. Mr. Sharma alleged the doctor reached almost one-and-a-half hours after the incident. He also alleged lack of hygiene and proper care and poor quality food for the patients.  Deputy Commissioner Shiv Prasad said that an autopsy was ordered after the death committee report remained inconclusive on the cause of death and the family made allegations of medical negligence. He said further action would be taken after the cause of death was ascertained. Mr. Prasad said facilities would be improved at the centre. Director-General Health Services Suraj Bhan Kamboj said the district’s Chief Medical Officer was transferred for dereliction of duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kin-of-deceased-accuse-authorities-of-inaction/article31753295.ece
05 June 2020||June 05 2020 00:00 IST,||Giddiness part of routine now, says AIIMS nurse on Day 4 of protest||Nurses on COVID-19 duty at AIIMS here can’t take a break, drink water or go to the washroom for hours on end once they put on the PPE. Giddiness, exhaustion, weight loss, menstrual hygiene issues, and high-stress levels are just some of the problems that nurses pointed out because of working for six hours at a stretch. These nurses, with support from the AIIMS Nurses Union, have been protesting for the past four days demanding a reduction in time to four hours. “Working for six hours affects menstrual hygiene as they have to wear the same sanitary pad. We end up spending more than seven hours wearing the PPE as donning and doffing it takes time and we have to wait for our turn to do it in a particular area. Giddiness has become a part of our routine now. Four staff have fainted during my duty,” a nurse working on COVID-19 duty at AIIMS Trauma Center told The Hindu .  Director holds meeting AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said they had a nearly three-hour-long meeting with the union on Thursday. “We told them that they can take a break in between and go to the washroom and drink or eat something and come back and finish the rest of their shift wearing a new PPE. Initially, they agreed to it, but later they changed their stance and said they do not agree to it,” Mr. Guleria said. He added that nowhere in the country healthcare workers were doing only four-hour shifts. Meanwhile, Fameer C.K., general secretary of the union said the hospital was “complicating” the matter. “Currently we work in four six-hour shifts in a day. Now the hospital is asking us to do a 12-hour night shift with breaks. Which is not acceptable,” Mr. Fameer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/giddiness-part-of-routine-now-says-aiims-nurse-on-day-4-of-protest/article31753300.ece
05 June 2020||New Delhi,||‘Separate inquiry into JMI violence not needed’||The Delhi Police on Thursday informed the Delhi High Court that there is no need of separate inquiry into the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) last year as it was already carrying out a “comprehensive investigation” to establish the role of all involved in the incidents. The Crime Branch, in an affidavit, also asked the court to rejected a bunch of pleas seeking constitution of fact-finding committee to find out if the students were being indiscriminately arrested and were not provided medical aid. “...there has not been any indiscriminate arrest of students and all were provided with medical help. The clamour created by the petitioners is nothing but propagation of falsehood,” the affidavit said. It stated that from the electronic evidence — both videos and photographs — and also from the recorded statements, it was “clear that in the garb of students’ agitation, what happened in facts appears to be a well-planned and orchestrated attempt by some persons with local support [who were not students] to intentionally perpetrate violence in the area”. “...the said incident was not a sporadic incident but a well-planned incident, as the rioters were well armed with stones, lathis, petrol bombs, tubelights, etc., that clearly manifest that the intention of the mob was to disrupt law and order situation in the area,” the Crime Branch said. The response of the Crime Branch came on a plea seeking action against police in the violence case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/separate-inquiry-into-jmi-violence-not-needed/article31753310.ece
05 June 2020||GHAZIABAD,||Cycle manufacturer lays off nearly 700 employees||Shiv Kumar Dwivedi reached his office, the Ghaziabad-based Atlas Cycles manufacturing unit, like any other working day and with his lunchbox in tow. But the gates of the company where he had worked for three decades were firmly shut. Curious, he queried with the security guard. “He pointed his finger towards a notice on the wall. The notice read that due to unavailability of funds to keep the factory running, the management has decided to close it. We repeatedly asked him to call someone from the management as we wanted to talk face to face but we were asked to go back home,” recounted Dwivedi. After getting no satisfactory reply from the management, the workers staged a protest at the main gate but Ghaziabad Police dispersed them and threatened to book them for violating lockdown rules, said another worker, who wished not to be named. In the lurch Around 700 workers were laid off without any notice period from the factory, located in Site IV of Sahibabad. “At least they [management] should have given us prior notice and some time to get another job,” said Hemant Kumar, another worker. Workers are hopeful that Atlas Cycles workers Union will talk to the owners and request them to resume operations. Mahesh Kumar, general secretary of the union, said that there are around 1,000 workers including temporary and permanent employees. “We have written a letter to the Labour Commissioner of Ghaziabad and requested him to call for a meeting of management and workers, who were laid off to resolve the issue. The way workers were laid off is unethical and violated labour laws,” said Mr. Mahesh. Even after repeated attempts, there was no response from the Atlas cycles management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cycle-manufacturer-lays-off-nearly-700-employees/article31753318.ece

05 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Govt. move to hike VAT on fuel counterproductive’||The Delhi Petrol Dealers Association (DPDA) on Thursday said that the Delhi government’s decision to increase Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel, although taken with a good intention to increase revenue, is proving to be counterproductive as Delhi is losing both sales and revenue. The association has requested the government to consider reducing VAT on petroleum products and give relief to the petrol dealers and the public at large. The association also said that Delhi’s petrol pump dealers have lost 79% of diesel sales in May on a year-on-year comparison despite the lockdown restrictions being eased as the State increased VAT on both diesel and petrol to a historic high. DPDA chief Anil Bijlani said, “The primary reason for minimal recovery in diesel sales is the rate difference of around Rs. 7/litre with neighbouring States, resulting in Delhi losing its sales and revenue to the adjoining States.” He said that vehicles bringing in essential commodities to Delhi were fuelling from Delhi till May 5 but after the increase in VAT, they were fuelling from neighbouring States. The association said that Delhi, as a State, can garner maximum VAT revenue by increasing sales if the Delhi government reverts the hike and reduces the VAT rates and keep it lower than the neighbouring States by at least Rs. 2/litre. The reduction in rates, it said, would also bring relief to the people of Delhi.

While the institute said all measures have been put in place to protect its staff, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said Delhi needs to ramp up testing coupled with aggressive surveillance, contact tracing and stringent containment and perimeter control activities. The Minister chaired a high-level meeting to review the preparedness for prevention and control of COVID-19 along with L-G Anil Baijal, Health Minister Satyendra Jain and other officials. “As all districts in Delhi are now affected by COVID-19, the rising cases, high positivity rates and low testing levels in many places here are worrisome,” said Mr. Vardhan. He added that the high rate of infection in the healthcare workers was also a serious issue, which needs to be attended to on priority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-needs-to-ramp-up-testing-says-vardhan/article31753296.ece
