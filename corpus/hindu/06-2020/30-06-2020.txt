30 June 2020||New Delhi,||MHA unveils rules for Unlock 2||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) late on Monday announced fresh guidelines for Unlock 2. The restrictions will, however, be strictly enforced in containment zones till July 31. Metro rail services, schools, colleges, gymnasiums, auditoriums, bars, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, assembly halls and similar places will continue to remain shut across the country. All large congregations, including religious, social, political, sports and academic, continue to remain prohibited. Also late on Monday, the Prime Minister’s Office tweeted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on Tuesday at 4 p.m. Curbs since March The lockdown, first imposed in March, has been relaxed considerably over the past two months even though the total number of COVID-19 cases has surged past 5.6 lakh and more than 16,000 deaths have been reported. Hours before the guidelines were issued by the MHA, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu extended the lockdown till July 31 without any more relaxations, joining West Bengal and Manipur. The dates for reopening prohibited activities will be decided separately, the guidelines issued by the MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 said. In a significant relaxation, the MHA said: “Shops depending upon their area, can have more than five persons at a time.” However, the customers have to maintain adequate physical distance. Domestic flights and passenger trains are already allowed in a limited manner. Their operations will be further expanded in a calibrated manner. Night curfew timings have been relaxed and now shall be in force from 10.00 p.m. to 5.00 a.m. “Further, relaxations in night curfew have been given for seamless operation of industrial units in multiple shifts, movement of persons and goods on National and State Highways, loading and unloading of cargo and movement of persons to their destinations after disembarking from buses, trains and airplanes,” the MHA said. Training to resume Training institutions of the Central and State Governments will be allowed to function from July 15 and the standard operating procedure (SOP) in this regard will be issued by the Department of Personnel and Training. “After extensive consultation with States and UTs, it has been decided that schools, colleges and coaching institutions will remain closed till July 31,” said the MHA. International air travel has been permitted in a limited manner under the Vande Bharat mission and “further opening up will take place in a calibrated manner,” the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mha-unveils-rules-for-unlock-2/article31949661.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Separatist leader Geelani quits Hurriyat Conference||Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani, 90, on Monday decided to quit the conglomerate, without divulging his future course of action. “I have decided to distance myself from the Hurriyat given the current situation [in the amalgamate],” an ailing Mr. Geelani said in an audio message. He said all the constituents of his faction of the Hurriyat had been informed, in a detailed letter, about the decision. Mostly under house arrest since 2013 at his Srinagar residence, Mr. Geelani, a crowd-puller, was associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami but left it to float his own political organisation, the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat. He also split from the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq faction of the Hurriyat over the approaches adopted to resolve the Kashmir problem. Mr. Geelani, known for his hardline ideology, advocated accession of J&K to Pakistan. He, however, did not clarify if he had resigned from the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat. In the past two years, his health had deteriorated significantly, a family member said. “No one outside the family is allowed to see him.” Sources said Mr. Geelani’s resignation was due to the internal feud in the Hurriyat. It is likely to pave the way for a new leadership in the Hurriyat, which faced a massive clampdown in the run-up to the abrogation of J&K’s special status last year. Mr. Geelani had opposed the move and asked the Centre to work on a political resolution through dialogue with the Hurriyat and Pakistan. BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav also tweeted about Mr. Geelani’s resignation. BJP leader Aijaz Hussian said, “Other Hurriyat leaders should call it a day and realise their mistakes. India is the only way forward for all those who believed otherwise”. Senior party leader Avinash Rai Khana described the resignation of Mr. Geelani as “a biggest benefit of the removal of Article 370”. There has been no reaction from the other constituents of the Hurriyat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/separatist-leader-geelani-quits-hurriyat-conference/article31949665.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,||Govt. tells medical staff to be prepared for the long haul||As Karnataka reported over 1,000 COVID-19 cases for the second consecutive day on Monday, the State government has asked medical and paramedical staff to be mentally prepared for the long haul. It has asked them to be ready to deal with the pandemic for the next six months. With cases expected to increase further in July and August, the government has also planned to impose “more stringent measures”, including the closure of public parks, after July 5. Already, the government has decided to impose lockdowns on all Sundays in the coming month. Briefing the government’s decisions after a meeting at the Secretariat, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, who is also in charge of handling COVID-19 for Bengaluru, said, “The medical fraternity should be mentally prepared to continue this work for the next six months”. A decision had been taken to hike salaries of medical and paramedical staff who directly deal with patients wearing PPE kits, he added. However, Mr. Ashok said that there was no need to panic as the numbers were still below other metros in the country and measures were being put in place to brace for the situation. In order to avoid panic and help the government keep tabs, testing centres and private hospitals have been directed to upload the results first on ICMR and BBMP portals, instead of directly informing people about them testing positive, he said. Based on the report, BBMP ward health officials would visit houses of reported cases and make arrangements to shift people to hospitals concerned or care centres. “The testing centres should not make calls directly to the people,” he said. All public hospitals have been told to appoint public relations officers to handle phone calls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-tells-medical-staff-to-be-prepared-for-the-long-haul/article31949698.ece
30 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||ReSTART: Govt. releases Rs. 513 cr. to bail out MSMEs||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday released the second tranche of nearly Rs. 513 crore as part the ReSTART package aiming at reviving the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) that are facing crisis owing to the lockdown. Under the scheme, the government had announced a Rs. 1,100-crore package that included the payment of all sanctioned and outstanding incentives to the MSMEs in the State. In the first phase, Rs. 450 crore was released in May. Releasing the second instalment, Mr. Jagan said 97,428 MSMEs in the State were providing employment to around 10 lakh people. “The vagaries of the market triggered by the pandemic and closure during the lockdown pushed the MSMEs to the verge of bankruptcy. The government has launched the ReSTART scheme to bail them out,” Mr. Jagan said. The previous TDP government owed approximately Rs. 800 crore to MSMEs towards subsidies. The YSRCP government has cleared the dues, he added. Apart from payment of all the sanctioned and pending incentive, the government has also waived fixed power bills for three months, amounting to Rs. 188 crore. Besides, working capital loans are being provided in the range between Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh at 6% to 8% rate of interest. A six-month moratorium has been announced on loan repayment and the dues could be cleared within three years. In another significant move, the government has decided to procure about 360 types of goods and other materials from the MSMEs. A bail-out package is being planned for spinning mills which are steeped in losses. “The government is contemplating to appoint Joint Collectors exclusively for taking care of the requirements of MSMEs,” said Mr. Jagan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/restart-govt-releases-rs-513-cr-to-bail-out-msmes/article31949592.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Clarify curbs on 3,500 Tablighis, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Union government to clarify if the blacklisting of 3,500 foreign nationals from 35 countries in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat gathering amid the lockdown, was a blanket directive or care was taken to hear and decide the merits of each case individually. Only a press note “What we have here on record is a press note. It does not say notices were issued, orders were passed and action was taken on a case-to-case basis. We do not see any individual orders here. Please take instructions on the stand of the Union of India,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The court ordered the government to respond on July 2, the next date of hearing. Four writ petitions, including one by a Thai national, who is seven months pregnant, have challenged the Centre's decision of April 2, by which 960 foreigners were blacklisted and another subsequent decision on June 4, by which over 2,500 foreign nationals were blacklisted for 10 years from travelling to India. “No order has been passed, no notice has been issued. No individual order was given to any single person in any individual case,” senior advocate C.U. Singh, appearing for one of the petitioners, submitted. “There should be an order first, then only action will follow,” Justice Khanwilkar turned to address the Solicitor General. “In barely 50 words, the impugned decision as reflected in the press release dated April 2, 2020, has arbitrarily first forfeited the personal liberty of more than 960 foreign nationals, belonging to 35 countries, presently in India, having entered on valid tourist visas, by merely alleging their involvement in ‘Tablighi Jamaat Activities’ despite the guidelines of the Respondent No.1 (MHA (the Ministry of Home Affairs)) placing no bar on attending religious congregations or visiting religious places,” the petitioners said. The decision by its very unilateral nature, infringed the principle of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem [hear the other side] by blacklisting foreigners present in India without first granting an opportunity of being heard, or notice of any form, and hence, depriving the aggrieved foreign nationals of their right of locomotion and travelling back to the country of their citizenship, the Thai woman’s plea said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/clarify-curbs-on-3500-tablighis-says-sc/article31949659.ece
30 June 2020||Madurai,||HC initiates contempt proceedings against 3 policemen in Sattankulam||Taking a serious view of police personnel attached to the Sattankulam station not cooperating with the Judicial Magistrate, Kovilpatti, in connection with the inquiry into the alleged custodial torture and deaths of traders P. Jayaraj and J. Benicks, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday initiated suo motu criminal contempt proceedings against two senior police officers and a constable. Separately, in view of the non-cooperation by the police during the hearing of the case, the court also directed the Thoothukudi Collector to depute Revenue Department officials to take control of the Sattankulam police station for the purpose of preserving clue materials in the case. Taking cognisance of the e-mail received from the Judicial Magistrate, a Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi initiated suo motu criminal contempt proceedings against Additional Superintendent of Police D. Kumar, Deputy Superintendent of Police C. Prathapan and police constable Maharajan, and directed them to appear before it on Tuesday. The Bench also recommended transfers for all the three. “We are of the view that unless the State government intervenes immediately to transfer the Additional Superintendent of Police, the Deputy Superintendent of Police and other policemen in Sattankulam police station, it will be very difficult for [conducting] a free and fair investigation and inquiry,” the court observed. The policemen at the Sattankulam station had not provided the records sought by the Judicial Magistrate. Constable Maharajan allegedly made a disparaging remark to the magistrate in Tamil, implying that the latter “cannot do anything”. The court observed that the district police administration was doing everything possible to prevent the magistrate from going ahead with the inquiry. The Principal District Judge, Thoothukudi, who is closely monitoring the progress of the case, had also informed the court about the non-cooperation by the police. The court was informed that the Additional SP and the DSP had made themselves available at the police station at the time of the inquiry, and in their very presence, other policemen were taking videos of the magisterial proceedings. The court directed Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian to appear in person, and the Range Deputy Inspector General of Police and the Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police to accompany the Additional Advocate General on Tuesday. Further, the court directed the Assistant Director of the Mobile Forensic Science Laboratory, Thoothukudi, to immediately go to the Sattankulam police station to collect the clue materials and assist the Judicial Magistrate, Kovilpatti. If necessary, a team of forensic science experts from the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Tirunelveli, may also be requisitioned. When Mr. Chellapandian submitted the State's government’s decision to transfer the case to the CBI, the court made it clear that to transfer or not to transfer the case to the CBI was a policy decision of the government, and such a transfer was governed by the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. However, with certain procedural formalities remaining, the court passed a few directions. The Registrar Judicial of the High Court Bench was directed to take photocopies of the preliminary post-mortem certificates, certify them and keep them in safe custody. The originals shall be handed over to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who, in turn, shall hand over the same to the investigating officer of the CBI. The post-mortem doctors were awaiting the chemical analysis, histopathological examination and microbiological examination reports. The dean of the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital shall send a copy of the final opinion to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall hand over the same to the CBI. A copy shall be sent to the court in a sealed cover, the HC said. The Director of the Tamil Nadu Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Chennai, was directed to give top priority to the examination of the materials sent by the post-mortem doctors. The Judicial Magistrate of Kovilpatti shall hand over a copy of his report to the court and the original to the CBI. The case diaries shall also be handed over to the CBI, the court said. Responding to a query on the importance of addressing the psychological needs of police personnel and their families, the State government informed the court that a scheme called the Police Wellbeing Programme was launched in collaboration with NIMHANS, Bengaluru, and a sum of Rs. 10 crore was allocated for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-initiates-contempt-proceedings-against-3-policemen-in-sattankulam/article31949760.ece

30 June 2020||New Delhi,||More trains, flights likely soon||Announcing guidelines for Unlock 2 late on Monday, the Union Home Ministry said the operations of domestic flights and passenger trains which are already allowed in a limited manner will be further expanded in a calibrated manner. International air travel has been permitted in a limited manner under the Vande Bharat mission and “further opening up will take place in a calibrated manner,” the government said.

The Ministry said that States and Union Territories, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain activities outside the Containment zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary. “However, there shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods. No separate permission/ approval/ e-permit will be required for such movements,” the MHA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-trains-flights-likely-soon/article31949762.ece

30 June 2020||Srinagar,||Chenab Valley terror-free: govt||The J&K police on Monday termed the Chenab Valley in Jammu region a militancy-free zone after the killing of three militants in an encounter at Anantnag in south Kashmir. “The three trapped terrorists were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the encounter site in Khulchohar area of Anantnag. One of the terrorists is Masood Ahmad Bhat, a resident of the Chenab Valley’s Doda, and worked as ‘district commander’ of the Hizbul Mujahideen. The other two unidentified terrorists were associated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),” a police spokesman said. 46 killed in June Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said Doda was terrorist-free now. “So far, 46 terrorists have been killed in June which is highest in a single month in several years,” the IGP said. Director General of Police (DGP), J&K, Dilbagh Singh described the killing of Bhat a significant development. “Bhat had shifted his area of operation from the Chenab valley to the Kashmir valley. With his killing, all the militants operating from Doda have been wiped out and the district is now totally militancy free,” DGP Singh said. Around 114 militants have been killed in stepped up operations in the Kashmir valley so far this year. DNA samples collected The police said arms and ammunition were recovered from the site of Monday’s encounter. The bodies of the terrorists were sent to Handwara for the last rites. “A medico-legal formality was conducted, including the collection of their DNA. In case any family claims the killed terrorists as their kin, they can come forward for their identification and participation in last rites at Handwara,” the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chenab-valley-terror-free-govt/article31949617.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. adds 11 more COVID labs||The Centre has inducted 11 more COVID-19 testing labs, taking the total number of diagnostic labs to 1,047. These include 760 in the government sector and 287 private labs, said the Union Health Ministry on Monday. Currently, there are 567 real-time PCR-based testing labs (government: 362, private: 205), 393 TrueNat-based testing labs (govt.: 366, private: 27) and 87 CBNAAT-based testing labs (govt: 32, private: 55). The total number of samples tested is rising and had touched 83,98,362. On Sunday, 1,70,560 samples were tested, according to data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A senior ICMR official said the council has also released “guidelines for the storage of respiratory specimens collected for COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR platforms in government laboratories,” aimed at ensuring safety and quality control. Various purposes The Council noted that in the ongoing laboratory testing for COVID-19 diagnosis, clinical specimens or a subset of the clinical specimens may need to be retained for various purposes such as performing additional tests, for quality control purposes or use as control materials to assess newer diagnostic tests. In addition, a laboratory may need to store specimens for projects aimed at studying genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across regions and over time. “These guidelines have noted that all such samples stored for the long term must be appropriately labelled indicating laboratory identifiers, date of sample collection and must be stored at -80 degrees Celsius in properly functioning deep freezers. A proper inventory [preferably electronic] of stored samples should be essentially maintained,” said a senior ICMR official. The guidelines are also vital because with the surge in testing across the country, the total number of tested samples has gone up, he added. As per the guidelines, if the number of samples tested positive at a laboratory is considerably large and the laboratory is unable to retain all positive samples beyond 30 days, a minimum 10% of positives detected at the laboratory in a month or 40-50 positives preferably with equal numbers of high, moderate and low viral load should be stored for a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-adds-11-more-covid-labs/article31949630.ece
30 June 2020||New Delhi,||Will free grains scheme stay?||The government remains tight-lipped on the possible extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part of the first relief package during the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme ends on June 30. The scheme, announced for a three-month period, covered 80 crore ration card holders. Each household was provided 5 kg of foodgrains (rice or wheat) and 1 kg of pulses (only channa ) free of cost. Meeting targets Already, 21 States — both BJP-ruled and Opposition-led governments — have appealed to the Centre to extend the scheme for another three months till September. According to the latest information provided by the Union Food and Public Distribution Ministry, 116.02 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been lifted under the scheme. In April, 93% of the grains allotted to the States was distributed targeting 74.05 crore beneficiaries. In May, the distribution stood at 91% reaching 72.99 crore beneficiaries and in June, 71% of the allocation went to 56.81 crore beneficiaries. Union Food Minister Ramvilas Paswan declined to comment on the possible extension of the scheme. Senior officials at the Ministry said the decision lay with the Prime Minister’s Office. The States that have demanded an extension include the BJP-led Gujarat, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar (BJP is an alliance partner) and Assam. An official statement from the Union Ministry said the Food Corporation of India had “sufficient stock of foodgrains”. According to the Food Corporation of India, there was a stock of 266.29 lakh tonnes of rice and 550.31 lakh tonnes of wheat as on June 28. This is excluding the ongoing purchase of wheat and paddy stocks that have not yet reached the godowns. Each month, only about 55 lakh tonnes is required for distribution to ration card holders. Reetika Khera, Associate Professor of Economics, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and researcher on food security, said that with the beginning of the monsoon, there was a real danger of foodgrains rotting. “Remember these buffer stocks are maintained precisely for such emergencies. The stocks are far in excess of norms, not all of it being stored safely. With the monsoon upon us, there is a danger that some of it may rot,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-free-grains-scheme-stay/article31949645.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,||Tamil Nadu extends lockdown till July 31||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday extended the COVID-19 lockdown across the State by another month till July 31. The “complete lockdown” in Chennai, and parts of the adjoining districts of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu, and Madurai city and its adjoining areas, will be in place till July 5. Thereafter, the restrictions in these areas will revert to the pre-June 19 levels. Across the State, the “complete lockdown” on Sundays will continue, with July 5, 12, 19 and 26 set for a total shutdown. However, the government relaxed restrictions to allow resumption of business activities in most parts of the State from July 1. Interestingly, the decision came just hours after the panel of medical and public health experts said it had not recommended an extension of the lockdown strategy. A senior official from the panel had told The Hindu : “We cannot go on with the lockdown forever. The government is not keen to go for extending lockdown beyond July 31. Of course, there would be some restrictions for large gatherings, recreation and religious gatherings.” No buses till July 15 Intra-district bus operations by government and private operators will be suspended between July 1 and 15. While the government exempted e-passes for private vehicles for intra-district movement, the e-pass system for inter-State and inter-district movement will continue. Easing of curbs In a significant easing, shops selling fish, meat and eggs can resume sales with certain conditions after obtaining permission from local bodies. The State government also relaxed restrictions (excluding areas presently under complete lockdown) to allow functioning of IT, ITES, private companies, export units, showrooms, textile shops, restaurants, tea shops, groceries, provision stores, rental vehicles, autorickshaws and salons from July 6 with certain conditions. From July 1, in areas other than those under Greater Chennai City Police, (from July 6, in case of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu, Madurai and neighbouring areas presently under complete lockdown), a whole range of places have been allowed to be open for the general public. Worship Worship would be allowed in small temples in rural areas, small mosques and churches with certain restrictions. Industrial and export units will be allowed to operate with 100% staff as will the IT and ITES sectors. In case of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu, Madurai and neighbouring areas presently under complete lockdown, the easing with come in from July 6. Shops Showrooms and large shops can function with 50% staff. While restaurants, provision and grocery stores and tea shops can function between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m, “TASMAC outlets and other shops can function between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.,” the government order said. Restaurants can serve customers subject to 50% of seating capacity, as also tea shops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tamil-nadu-extends-lockdown-till-july-31/article31949993.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||CA aspirants can opt out of July exams: SC||In a relief for lakhs of Chartered Accountancy (CA) aspirants, the Supreme Court on Monday said students could opt out of their July exams without running the risk of being marked as having failed in the papers they missed due to COVID-19. Though allowing the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to conduct the exams in July-August, a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said students should have an option to change their exam centres “till the end”. The Bench directed the ICAI to file a draft notification for approval on July 2, the next date of hearing. The students’ choice of exam centres should not be frozen but left open-ended, it said. “The situation due to the pandemic is not static but dynamic. An exam centre may suddenly fall within a containment zone,” Justice Khanwilkar, heading a three-judge Vacation Bench, remarked orally. Students could mail the ICAI their reason in connection with COVID-19 before opting out. This could be done any time before or during the exams. “If any student is unable to attend any exam, it will be deemed that he opted out. Exams for the papers students were unable to take would be deemed as cancelled. This has to be done considering the situation now... A situation may arise that a student’s family member is tested positive, you [ICAI] cannot force him to appear for the exams and infect other students,” Justice Khanwilkar observed. When students appeared again for the same papers in November, it would be considered as if they were taking their July exams. If the papers they missed out were part of a group, the students would have to take the exam for all the papers in the group. For example, if four papers comprised a group and the student was unable to take the exams for two, he or she would have to appear for all four. In the alternative, the student could opt to say that he had failed in the exams he missed out and write only those papers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ca-aspirants-can-opt-out-of-july-exams-sc/article31949639.ece
30 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Centre to revive Narayana Guru spiritual circuit plan||Exactly a month after dropping the Rs. 69.7-crore Sree Narayana Guru spiritual circuit, the Centre has decided to revive it. “The Ministry of Tourism has considered the revival of the Sivagiri Sree Narayana Guru Ashram-Aruvipuram-Kunnumpara Sree Subrahmania-Chembazhanthi Sree Narayana Gurukulam spiritual circuit,” Rajesh Kumar Sahu, Deputy Secretary, Swadesh Darshan Division, conveyed to Rani George, Secretary, Tourism, in a communication on Monday. However, the Ministry will not revive the Rs. 85.23-crore spiritual circuit linking 133 places of worship in the State that was dropped along with the Sree Narayana Guru circuit. The two projects had been approved under Swadesh Darshan, aimed at the development of theme-based tourist circuits, launched by the Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15. ‘Reconsider decision’ The move to revive the Sree Narayana Guru spiritual circuit comes in the wake of protests from various quarters. Besides the ruling LDF and the Opposition UDF, the Sree Narayana Dharma Sanghom and those involved in promoting the ideals of the Guru had demanded that the Centre reconsider the decision. Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran, welcoming the decision, said the pressure exerted by the government, joint agitations, and the united stand taken by all concerned had yielded results. “The decision of the Ministry to hand over the execution of the project to the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) should be reversed,” Mr. Surendran said. Kerala Tourism should be entrusted with the execution of the project. He appealed to the Tourism Ministry to revive the spiritual circuit linking 133 places of worship in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-to-revive-narayana-guru-spiritual-circuit-plan/article31949585.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Revenue from fuel used for welfare work, says Pradhan||Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday reacted sharply to Opposition Congress’s attack on the Union government for continuously raising fuel prices despite falling global rates stating that the revenue collected was being used for welfare activities. He referred to recent reports on the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) having allegedly received funds from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF), the Chinese embassy in India and fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi to make his point. “Unlike Congress’s legacy of transferring money into the accounts of middlemen, ‘National Daamad’, ‘The Family’ and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, Modi ji’s DBT is about putting money in the hands of the poor, farmers, migrant workforce and women,” tweeted Mr. Pradhan as the Congress spoke repeatedly against fuel prices hike, 18 times in as many days. ‘Rs. 65,000 cr. transferred’ “ I once again reiterate to Madam Sonia Gandhi ji that Modi ji has transferred more than Rs. 65,000 crore to 42 crore people in the last 3 months,” added Mr. Pradhan. In an interview to The Hindu on May 25, Mr. Pradhan made it clear that a cut in fuel prices was not on the anvil despite plunging global prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revenue-from-fuel-used-for-welfare-work-says-pradhan/article31949603.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, Bhutan sign pact for first joint hydel project||India and Bhutan took a major step forward for the construction of the 600 MW Kholongchhu project, their first hydropower joint venture project in Bhutan’s less developed eastern region of Trashiyangtse. The project’s “Concession agreement,” which was signed in the presence via video-conference of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in Delhi, and Bhutan’s Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji and Economic Affairs Minister Loknath Sharma in Thimphu, marks a shift as it is the first time an India-Bhutan hydropower project will be constructed as a 50:50 joint venture, not as a government-to-government agreement. Speaking at the ceremony, both Foreign Ministers called the agreement a “milestone” in the India-Bhutan partnership, under which four hydropower projects have been built in the last 30 years totalling a capacity of 2,100 MW, and another two are under construction. The Kholongchhu project is one of four additional projects agreed to in 2008, as a part of India’s commitment to help Bhutan create a total 10,000 MW of installed capacity by 2020. ‘Mutually beneficial’ “[The] hydro power sector has been the most visible symbol of the mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation between our two countries,” said Mr. Jaishankar at the signing ceremony between the JV Partners Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), a Himachal Pradesh PSU, and the Bhutanese Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC). “I congratulate both the JV partners for this remarkable feat and hope that they will leave no stone unturned in expeditiously completing the project,” he said. Signed in 2014 The inter-governmental agreement for the Kholongchhu project was signed after prolonged negotiations on the structure of the joint venture, in April 2014, and the foundation stone was laid when Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Thimphu a few months later. However, progress on preparing the site ground to a halt in December 2016 over India’s new power tariff guidelines (on Cross Border Trade of Electricity - CBTE), until the government amended its guidelines after negotiations with the Bhutan government. During Monday’s ceremony, the Bhutanese Foreign Minister said the delay had “some benefits” as many issues on the ground were ironed out during the period.  According to the agreement finalised, the construction for the Kholongchhu Hydro Electric Power (HEP) project will begin soon, and be completed in the second half of 2025.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-bhutan-sign-pact-for-first-joint-hydel-project/article31949608.ece
30 June 2020||Srinagar,||Does Geelani’s resignation mark waning of separatism?||The unexpected resignation of 90-year-old Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani from the conglomerate of separatist groups on Monday, left the already squeezed Kashmiri separatists in a state of shock and Pakistan in a corner. Mr. Geelani, suffering from multiple ailments and tended by two sons at his Srinagar residence, has been the face of hard-line separatism for many decades now. A close associate of Mr. Geelani, who refused to be named, said his resignation is aimed at both Pakistan and the redundant leadership around him. His resignation comes at a time when the separatists’ constituency is raising questions over the Hurriyat’s response to the Centre’s decision to revoke J&K’s special status last year. It remains to be seen if Mr. Geelani will also resign from his own party, the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat. Many see Mr. Geelani's move as his last bid to play “the politics of deathbed” and “fulfill his wish to die a martyr, who never compromised”. From contesting Assembly elections in 1970s to issuing boycott calls against the same after 1990s, Mr. Geelani steered Kashmir’s separatist movement and his ideas influenced both the people on the streets and the fast-growing militant cadre then. However, neither age nor health nor recent political events favour him anymore. Meanwhile, his resignation has paved the way for his old friend Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai to emerge as new ‘old-guard’ leader. Besides, it could also see the rise of younger leaders like Masrat Alam. The timing of Mr. Geelani’s decision is also significant. It comes at a time when the Centre’s hardball politics managed to end the separatist politics, if not the sentiment, in one stroke on August 5, 2019, and succeeded in putting a pressure on them, not to rally people against the decision to revoke J&K’s special status. His resignation may give a sense of defeat to his own supporters and a boost to the mainstream parties to make inroads into separatist constituencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/does-geelanis-resignation-mark-waning-of-separatism/article31949613.ece
30 June 2020||Mumbai,||As cases surge, Maharashtra extends lockdown till July 31||The Maharashtra government on Monday extended its lockdown till July 31, without providing any further relaxations in urban areas amid mounting cases of COVID-19 in the State. Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta issued the new guidelines a day after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he would not be lifting restrictions after June 30. According to the new rules, private offices can operate with up to 10% staff strength or 10 people, whichever is more. For State government employees, the ratio is 15% or 15 people, whichever is higher. The State government suggested that work from home be followed as far as possible. The order said wearing face covers or masks, maintaining physical distancing, restricted gatherings, and other measures shall continue to prevail in the State. No new loosening of curbs has been announced and relaxations granted earlier under Mission Begin Again will resume. All essential and non-essential shops will function as per relaxations issued on May 31 and June 4, and can be “in operation as per the policy of respective municipal corporation”. There will be specific restrictions in urban areas, especially under municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Area (MMR), and cities such as Pune, Nagpur, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola and Amravati. No inter-district travel The order clearly prohibited inter-district movement of people as well as long-distance travelling without any emergency. Inter-district movement of people in the MMR (Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Ambernath, Badlapur) will be permitted only for essential activities and attending office. In the rest of the State, intra-district bus services will be allowed to run with 50% capacity, while inter-district movement will continue to be regulated. All non-essential markets, market areas and shops, except malls and market complexes, will remain open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the order said. Liquor shops will continue to operate and provide home delivery wherever permitted. E-commerce activities for essential and as non-essential items, including home delivery services, will continue. CM backs police Meanwhile, Mr. Thackeray came out in support of the Mumbai police, which have prohibited people from moving beyond a 2-km radius of their house for non-essential work. Mr. Thackeray said people should avoid crowding without reason.

30 June 2020||RIMULI (ODISHA),||Stay or leave? Odisha’s returned migrant workers ponder grim options||After pondering for a fortnight in quarantined isolation at an institutional facility and then spending another week at home, Jagadish Naik, a first generation migrant worker from Keonjhar in Odisha, is thinking of returning to his factory job in Chennai. Mr. Naik was forced to turn breadwinner at the age of 18 for his family, which gets to till their land once in three years on a rotation basis. His big joint family owns less than one acre of land at Badanai village in Keonjhar’s Champua block and all its members cannot afford to depend on the small patch of land for their survival. Mr. Naik had resolved not to return to his previous job at a sanitiser production company in Chennai, especially after a harrowing time during the nationwide lockdown. But his resolve melted in a week. Nowhere to go Pratap Chatamba, a 24-year-old youth from the Ho tribe, who worked as a security guard in the same Chennai-based company and has been Mr. Naik’s co-traveller, also did not have a happy experience to share. Mr. Chatamba kept calling his friends from the quarantine centre in the Government High School here, seeking information on job opportunities as well as help for a smooth return to his life at home. To his dismay, he, like others, found no one at the quarantine centre’s gate to take them back to their village, despite being in possession of COVID-19 negative certificates. “My father is immobile and whatever little land we have is locked in a joint family dispute. Before migrating to Chennai, I had tried to find a job in Keonjhar but everyone shut their door on me. Now, I don’t know where my next month’s income will come from,” Mr. Chatamba said he had to ask himself as he walked back home from the quarantine centre. These two young tribal youth had to migrate from a district that accounts for close to 25% of India’s iron ore production. Early this year, there were record online bids for 20 iron and manganese ore mines, mostly in Keonjhar, with companies like JSW Steel, ArcelorMittal, and Jindal Steel and Power, offering higher than the average sale price for the ore, even though the metal market is experiencing a downturn. Mineral-rich district “A conservative estimate shows Keonjhar district has alone produced iron worth Rs. 2,65,000 crore in the past two decades. Not just iron ore, the district is rich in other minerals such as manganese and dolomite,” said Kiran Sankar Sahu, a lead member of the Keonjhar Citizen Forum. More than 50,000 natives of Keonjhar have registered with district administration to return. As of now, around 11, 000 have returned. Mr. Naik sees a much bleaker future ahead. People who were already living on the edge cannot move out to sell forest produce and fuel wood to make a living. Vegetable growers find their harvest remains unsold. MGNREGA wages raised Keonjhar District Collector Ashish Thakare says his district has become the first in the country to raise minimum wages provided by the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme by 45%, from Rs. 207 to Rs. 298. “We have been able to create 1 lakh man-days of work per day,” said Mr. Thakare, while listing out a number of livelihood interventions, from reviving cultivation of millets in mining-affected areas to doubling farmers’ income through agriculture production clusters, and from promoting agro-horticulture-forestry- based livelihoods to tussar sericulture. But not unsurprisingly, Mr. Chatamba is not inclined to work under the MGNREGA scheme. “The programme does not assure constant employment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stay-or-leave-odishas-returned-migrant-workers-ponder-grim-options/article31949633.ece
30 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Jose K. Mani barred from attending UDF meetings||The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Monday said the Jose K. Mani faction in the Kerala Congress (M) had lost the right to continue in the coalition. At a hastily convened press conference, UDF convener Benny Behanan, MP, said Jose K. Mani had repeatedly ignored the ultimatum demanding that his group vacate the presidentship of the Kottayam district panchayat in favour of a nominee of the side led by party chairman P.J. Joseph. (The Joseph faction had threatened to move a no-confidence motion against the president if Mr. Mani did not accommodate his demand. He had earlier blamed the Mani camp for the loss of the Pala seat to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) among other grievances.) Mr. Behanan said Mr. Mani had accorded no value for the UDF decision. He had publicly denied it. Mr. Mani was not entitled to attend coalition meetings until further directives. UDF leaders would meet again on Wednesday to decide on Mr. Mani’s future in the alliance. Mr Behanan pointedly desisted from stating that Mr Mani was not part of the UDF any more. However, the UDF has disinvited Mr. Mani from the top conference. Partners in loop Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy were present at the meeting that preceded Mr. Behanan’s pronouncement. A party insider said the leaders had talked to other alliance partners, including the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leadership, on the phone. ‘K.M. Mani wronged’ Mr. Behanan’s words prompted scores of Mani loyalists to flock to the KC(M) State committee office in Kottayam. They swamped the premises and shouted slogans in support of party founder K.M. Mani. Stephen K. George, a Mani backer, said the party headquarters remained firmly in the control of the group. Mr. Mani later arrived at the office to a rousing reception. Flanked by loyalist Roshy Augustine, MLA, Mr. Mani reminded journalists of the political legacy of his father, one of the founding members of the UDF. The current UDF leadership had done Mani’s memory wrong, Mr. Mani said, portraying himself as a victim of injustice. Some persons had arm-twisted the Congress leadership into taking the flawed decision. By some accounts, there was mounting concern in the UDF whether alienating Mr. Mani permanently would mar the coalition’s prospects in the upcoming local body elections in Central Travancore where both factions of the KC(M) have significant influence. Moreover, there were also reports that not everybody in the top Congress leadership was on the same page regarding the decision to put Mr. Mani on notice. At least one leader had asked how the UDF could ask the faction, which is part of the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre, to stay away from coalition meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jose-k-mani-barred-from-attending-udf-meetings/article31949589.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||T.N. custodial deaths highlight need for police reforms: CHRI||The alleged torture and killing of a father and son, both traders, in custody in Tamil Nadu last week points to a broken criminal justice system, and highlights the need for police reforms and the ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT), the Executive Committee (India) of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) said in a statement issued on Monday. The committee, which is chaired by former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, said the alleged custodial killings of P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks in Thoothukudi underlined the urgent need for a strong law in fulfilment of legal obligations. The two were arrested for allegedly keeping their shops open past the permitted hours during the COVID-19 lockdown. Need to ratify UNCAT India remained among a handful of countries yet to ratify the UNCAT, the statement said. The National Human Rights Commission had said custodial violence and torture were “rampant” in the country, it noted. Citing the National Campaign Against Torture’s June 26 report that said 1,731 people had died in custody in 2019, it stated, “Given the reality and the circumstances of the recent deaths, we urge the government of India to bring a draft law on torture before Parliament as a top priority and announce its commitment to the UNCAT.” The Centre, particularly the Home Ministry, should engage with the UNCAT, which India signed in 1997. “India has since pledged several times to ratify it, including as recently as 2018. Despite two official Bills which lapsed, a private member’s Bill and a report by the Law Commission, the issue has not been a priority of the Central government. We wish to point out that India is among the few countries that have not ratified the CAT — 170 have, including Pakistan and China. India is among 25 other nations which have not ratified.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tn-custodial-deaths-highlight-need-for-police-reforms-chri/article31949641.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,||Cong. leaders to be booked for violation of COVID-19 norms||The police will file cases against Congress leaders who violated social distancing norms while taking out a cycle rally and staged a protest here on Monday against the Centre for hike in fuel prices, said Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Chetan Singh Rathore, DCP (Central), told The Hindu that the police will file a report to the judicial magistrate on violations of social distancing and other norms. “The report is being prepared and will likely be submitted to a judicial magistrate on Tuesday,” he said. The report, which will be a case made out by the police with evidence for the allegations, will be submitted under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC) and the magistrate will conduct an inquiry and initiate trial there on. The city police will make a case for violation of Section 51 (1) (b) of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, for “refusing to comply with directions by competent authority during a disaster” and Section 188 of Indian Penal Code for “disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant.” If the organisers of Monday’s protest are convicted by the judicial magistrate under these sections, they may face a prison term up to one year. Senior leaders, including KPCC president-designate D.K. Shivakumar, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah, Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge, and several legislators and party workers participated in the cycle rally and staged a protest. The leaders said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pursuing “anti-people” and “anti-farmer” policies by frequently increasing fuel prices. Asked about names of leaders to be included in the case, the Home Minister said: “You will come to know names of leaders... It will be in the public domain.” Despite denying permission, the Congress leaders staged a protest and an FIR would be filed under the State Disaster Management Act, he said. Delegation to Governor Later in the day, a Congress delegation led by Mr. Shivakumar called on Governor Vajubhai Vala and submitted a memorandum to President of India Ram Nath Kovind, through the Governor, seeking roll back of the prices of petrol and diesel by the Centre. “The repeated and unjust increase in fuel prices by hiking excise duty over the last three months of lockdown has inflicted pain and suffering on the people,” the Congress said and demanded immediate rollback of the prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-leaders-to-be-booked-for-violation-of-covid-19-norms/article31949576.ece
30 June 2020||Hyderabad,||Telangana to ramp up COVID-19 tests||Faced with a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, the Telangana government has decided to intensify testing from Tuesday. Health Minister Eatala Rajender said there had been a spike in the number of cases ever since lockdown restrictions were lifted and the increase was observed mainly in some parts of the west and south Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao held a detailed review meeting on tackling the spread of the virus with senior officials on Sunday, and the State Cabinet would meet in the next four to five days to take a decision on the future course of action. “The Chief Minister stressed the need for strict measures to check the spread of the virus. Reimposing lockdown is a big decision and the Cabinet will meet soon in this regard,” he said. The Chief Minister was in favour of strict enforcement of restrictions in the containment zones and it was, therefore, decided to intensify tests in the GHMC limits in general and containment zones in particular. The government had, therefore, set up special centres for coronavirus and it was decided to collect swab samples on a large scale from Tuesday, he said, adding that people diagnosed with symptoms would be provided treatment through home or institutional quarantine based on the advice of doctors. He said the number of persons tested every day had increased to 4,000 from 1,500 and the tests were being conducted in line with the guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research. The government had kept 17,081 beds ready in different hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients. Of these, around 10,000 would be equipped with oxygen supply line, which was essential in the treatment of the virus-affected people within a week. More than 3,500 beds had already been equipped with oxygen supply systems and establishing supply lines for the nearly 6,500 remaining beds would be completed in the next four to five days. This was in addition to recruitment of 4,700 doctors and nursing staff and these new recruits would be deployed at all the designated treatment centres within a day or two. The government had initiated several confidence building measures to ensure that people did not panic. However, apprehensions were being raised due to “irresponsible” posts on social media complaining about the absence of facilities at the government hospitals and indifference displayed by medical personnel in treating patients. The Minister pointed out that several health department employees (258), police personnel (185) and some elected representatives had also tested positive for the disease. Only a head nurse working at a government hospital succumbed to the virus while two others died due to co-morbid conditions. All others were treated and cured of the virus. “It is not proper to cast aspersions on the government as nobody can question the commitment of the government and Chief Minister in taking steps necessary to check the spread of the virus,” he asserted. The Minister said the fatality rate of 1.7% in the State which was almost half of the national average of more than 3% was indicative of the steps that had been taken to check the spread of the virus. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said the government had put in place necessary mechanisms to ensure that tests were conducted wherever required and the people, on their part, should take adequate care duly following the guidelines to ensure that they stayed safe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/telangana-to-ramp-up-covid-19-tests/article31949582.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,||Tamil Nadu extends lockdown till July 31||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday evening extended the COVID-19 lockdown across the State by another month till July 31. The “complete lockdown” in Chennai, and parts of the adjoining districts of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu, and Madurai city and its adjoining areas, will be in place till July 5. Thereafter, the restrictions in these areas will revert to the pre-June 19 levels. Across the State, the “complete lockdown” on Sundays will continue, with July 5, 12, 19 and 26 set for a total shutdown. However, the government relaxed certain restrictions to allow resumption of business activities in most parts of the State from July 1. Interestingly, the government’s decision came just hours after the panel of medical and public health experts said it had not recommended an extension of the lockdown strategy. A senior official from the panel had told The Hindu : “We cannot go on with the lockdown forever. The government is not keen to go for extending lockdown beyond July 31. Of course, there would be some restrictions for large gatherings, recreation and religious gatherings.” No buses till July 15 Intra-district bus operations by government and private operators will be suspended between July 1 and 15. While the government exempted e-passes for private vehicles for intra-district movement, the e-pass system for inter-State and inter-district movement will continue. In a significant easing, shops selling fish, meat and eggs can resume sales with certain conditions . The State government also relaxed restrictions (excluding areas presently under complete lockdown) to allow functioning of IT, ITES, private companies, export units, showrooms, textile shops, restaurants, tea shops, groceries, provision stores, rental vehicles, autorickshaws and salons from July 6 with certain conditions. From July 1, in areas other than those under Greater Chennai City Police, worship would be allowed in small temples in rural areas, small mosques and churches with certain restrictions. Showrooms and large shops can function with 50% staff. While restaurants, provision and grocery stores can function between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m, “TASMAC outlets and other shops can function between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.,” the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tn-extends-lockdown-till-july-31/article31949709.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Fuel price hike is extortion: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday accused the Centre of setting a “new example of forced extortion” by raising fuel prices 22 times and asked it to immediately roll back the increase, as part of the party’s online campaign against the regular increases. Ms. Gandhi charged the government with “profiteering” at the expense of people instead of helping them during the present crisis. “After the March 25 lockdown, the Modi government has raised the prices of petrol and diesel 22 times. The price of diesel has gone up by Rs. 11 a litre and that of petrol by Rs. 9.12 a litre. The Modi government has made provision for collecting lakhs of crores by raising excise duty in the last three months... when the international crude oil prices are continuously falling,” she said in a video message. ‘Double blow’ Taking part in the ‘Speak Up Against Fuel Hike’, she said the common people were finding it very difficult with the double blow of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuous rise in fuel prices. Since 2014, the government raised excise duty 12 times and garnered an additional revenue of nearly Rs. 18 lakh crore, she said. “The government has set a new example of extortion from people through this unjustified increase,” she said. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi and its general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the campaign and urged people to demand a rollback. Party leader Ahmed Patel said: “This government knows there are no elections for the next four years, so they are going on increasing. Just before elections, they will adopt some tactic and may offer some of the money collected now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fuel-price-hike-is-extortion-sonia/article31949605.ece

Additionally, telecom operators and Internet service providers will be asked to block access and use of these applications on their networks. The Ministry said it was invoking its power under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. “... in view of the emergent nature of threats, [the government] has decided to block 59 apps ... in view of information available [that] they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,” the government said. Meity said there had been “a strong chorus” in the public space to take strict action against such applications. Besides citizens, it received exhaustive recommendation for blocking these malicious apps from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre and the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry of Electronics and IT said it received many complaints about misuse of mobile apps for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers that have locations outside India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tiktok-among-59-apps-banned-by-the-centre/article31949596.ece
30 June 2020||New Delhi,||Yechury slams postal ballot move||CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, in a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, has slammed the Commission’s recent decision to provide the option of postal ballots to voters aged 65 and above. Mr. Yechuri said the move would put a large number of voters out of physical verifiability matrix and give the ruling government an advantage. He demanded that the Election Commission immediately call various political parties for consultations to review the decision. Mr. Yechury accused the EC of taking unilateral decisions “bypassing the established practice of consulting political parties”. On June 19, the Law Ministry amended the Conduct of the Elections Rules, allowing those aged 65 years and above to opt for postal ballots. The amended rules also provide “COVID-19 suspect or affected persons” with the same option.  The changes, Mr. Yechury said, raised a question on the transparency and integrity of the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yechury-slams-postal-ballot-move/article31949606.ece

Narayanan has made a ‘damning conclusion’ about the violent face-off between Chinese and Indian troops at Galwan Valley, terming it a result of a failure to analyse intelligence and asked what is the government’s answer to Mr. Narayanan. Referring to Mr. Narayan’s opinion piece in The Hindu , Mr. Chidamabaram on Twitter said, “Former NSA Mr. M.K. Narayanan has reached damning conclusions on the current India/China face-off that I understand as serious charges against the government”. “There are crucial charges on failure to gather imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and signal intelligence (SIGINT) and analyse them,” the former Union Minister added. “It is axiomatic that leaders make better decisions when they have better information...,” Mr. Narayanan observed in his piece. “I wonder if the Prime Minister, External Affairs Minister and NSA have read the article. If they have, what is their answer,” asked Mr. Chidamabaram, who also headed the Home Ministry between November 2008 and July 2012.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chidambaram-cites-ex-nsa-on-intel-lapse/article31949618.ece

An advisory to this effect was issued over the weekend. “For the students in terminal semester/final year of the General Degree courses at the UG/PG level, 80% weightage should be considered on the basis of the best aggregate percentage obtained by the candidate in any of the previous semesters’/years’ results (e.g. last five semesters in UG and last three semesters in PG) and 20% on internal assessment during the current semester/year,” the State government announced. Professional courses A similar method is also to be adopted for professional courses, with 20% weightage being given on the basis of assignment-based evaluation.“For the intermediate semesters/years, all students shall be promoted to the next semester/year,” the advisory said. Colleges have been asked to declare results by July 31. Students have also been given the option of appearing in a formal examination, but for that they will have to wait until the situation returns to normal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-charts-out-assessment-plan-for-colleges/article31949620.ece

30 June 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||LDF may wait and watch||The simmering differences of opinion between the Kerala Congress(M) faction led by Jose K. Mani and the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) are likely to bolster the prospects of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the run-up to the local body elections. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has expressed its willingness to engage any party, including a UDF ally, on condition that it should quit the front. However, the CPI has not been so warm in welcoming any party to the LDF and has made its annoyance explicit. If the Mani faction shifts its allegiance to the LDF or resolves to fight the local body elections on its own, it would offer a major political advantage to the front, especially in Central Travancore and some of its strongholds in north Kerala where settler farmers are a force to reckon with. UDF prospects The rift may seriously impair the UDF prospects in these regions and have rumblings elsewhere. Accommodating KC(M) factions of Mr. Mani and P.J. Joseph, without rocking the boat, is a tall order for the UDF. The LDF would firm up its position only after a clear picture emerges. Though the LDF was on the warpath against the late K.M. Mani on the bar bribery case, the issue remains a closed chapter and mending bridges is no more a tough proposition. If Mr. Mani decides to contest the local body polls alone, the LDF may have a strategic understanding and it may graduate into a full-fledged alliance in the Assembly elections. BJP stakes The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit does not seem to have much stakes in the emerging scenario. Though it is keen on enhancing its presence in the local bodies, the Mani faction is unlikely to opt for an understanding with the BJP, especially when it has better fortunes on holding hands with the LDF. The BJP, while trying to retain the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena in its fold, may have little time to lure Mr. Mani’s faction to the National Democratic Alliance, especially when it is facing allegations from its allies that the NDA has become moribund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ldf-may-wait-and-watch/article31949590.ece
30 June 2020||Hyderabad,||Film producer sets his dogs free on police||YSRCP leader and noted film producer Prasad V. Potluri alias PVP on Sunday evening set his five ferocious dogs on a team of Banjara Hills police when they went to arrest him in a trespass case. The incident took place 6.30 p.m. when a team led by Detective Inspector Ravi Kumar went to PVP's residence at Road No. 82 in Jubilee Hills to take him into custody, after serving notice. The Maharshi producer refused to surrender, and in turn let loose his dogs on the officers. Last week, the Banjara Hills police registered a case against PVP for trespassing and threatening his neighbour Vikram Kailas as his house’s outer elevation was blocking PVP’s bungalow’s view. Later in the evening, Sub-Inspector D. Harish Reddy, who was part of the above team, lodged a complaint with Jubilee Hills police stating that when he and other officers tried to enter the accused’s house, the main gate was locked from inside. “When we tried to enter the house, PVP set his five ferocious dogs on us, as a result of which we left the place,” he said. Based on his complaint, a case under Section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty.) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against PVP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/film-producer-sets-his-dogs-on-police/article31949950.ece

Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Thrissur and Nagercoil, the key stations falling under the Thiruvananthapuram Railway Division, have been identified for installing the cameras, a top railway official said. Already, the State’s premier railway station, Thiruvananthapuram central, has the modern metal detector thermal imaging camera, and the Palakkad junction is tipped to get one. The surveillance cameras will come in handy for the railways, health authorities and the law enforcers once the train operations commence in full swing, it has been pointed out. Big role In the next level of containment strategy, it will have a big role in screening the commuters and to curb the spread of virus. The railways has entrusted the zonal railways with procuring the AI-based COVID surveillance cameras. RailTel, the telecom arm of the Indian Railways, has already floated bids to purchase 800 surveillance cameras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-cameras-for-key-rail-stations-in-kerala/article31949586.ece

In October 2019, on a visit to France for the Second India-France ministerial level annual defence dialogue, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took formal delivery of the first Rafale jet built for the Indian Air Force (IAF) at the Dassault Aviation’s final assembly facility in Merignac. The Defence Ministry had stated that during the dialogue, the French side agreed to consider India’s request for 8-10 Meteor missiles to be given by 2020 with the first four aircraft. While the IAF is particularly keen on accelerating the delivery of these missiles, given the ongoing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there is still no clarity on how many of these would be delivered along with the first batch of aircraft. India has contracted 36 Rafale multi-role fighter jets from France in fly-away condition with 13 India Specific Enhancements (ISE) under a €7.87 billion Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) signed in September 2016. As per the IGA, deliveries begin 36 months from the signing of the contract and would be completed in 67 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-rafale-fighter-jets-to-land-in-india-by-july-end/article31949597.ece

30 June 2020||Mumbai,||Plasma therapy trial centre opened in Nagpur||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday launched Project Platina, claimed to be the world’s largest convalescent plasma therapy trial-cum-treatment centre for COVID-19 patients, at Nagpur’s government medical college. Mr. Thackeray on Sunday had said that Maharashtra was using plasma therapy effectively to cure patients affected with COVID-19 and had even appealed to the recovered patients to donate their plasma for the treatment of others. “Convalescent plasma therapy is emerging as one of the most important methods in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients, in the absence of definite treatment or drugs. This is the world’s largest trial-cum-treatment project, which will benefit 500 lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Maharashtra,” said Mr. Thackeray, who inaugurated the centre via videoconferencing. He also inaugurated four other services such as plasma donation, plasma bank, plasma trial, and emergency authorisation at the college. The trial will be carried out in 17 medical colleges under the State Medical Education Department and four medical colleges under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The CM has approved Rs. 16.65 crore for this project from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The project reached the inaugural stage in around 21 days. All critical patients will receive two doses of 200 ml of convalescent plasma. The plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients contains antibodies thereby fighting infection and helping critically ill patients recover. “The entire plasma therapy treatment will be free of cost to all the patients of Maharashtra admitted to the above centre. The donors are available in large numbers and have no weakness whatsoever after plasma donation as red blood cell count returns to the patients,” he said. The CM said the Platina trial will be the world’s largest trial and hence will give robust data on role of convalescent plasma in treatment of COVID-19 patients, thereby helping governments to issue guidelines in the management of the pandemic. “This trial will help formulate definite treatment guidelines for the entire country in managing serious COVID-19 patients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plasma-therapy-trial-centre-opened-in-nagpur/article31949625.ece

However, there has been no progress since,which officials described as a wait-and-watch situation. A similar consensus agreed between the Corps Commanders on June 6 was breached following the clash at the Galwan Valley that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a Colonel. India’s consistent demand has been the restoration of the status quo ante of pre-May 5 positions and de-induction of forces built up by China along the LAC. Satellite images and reports have since emerged showing a further build-up of defensive positions by China at the Galwan area, Pangong Tso and the Depsang plains in the last few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-commanders-to-hold-talks/article31949598.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||An ideal incarnation||In the Ramayana, we get an introduction to Rama’s qualities, right at the beginning. Valmiki asks Narada who is the gunvaan who has 16 auspicious qualities, and Narada replies that he can think of only one person, namely Rama. In the Vishnu Sahasranama, of the 32 names which praise Rama, the first 16 reveal to us His story, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. Rama avatara is a poorna avatara. Avataras like Vamana or Narasimha were of a short duration, ending as soon as the purpose of the avatara was fulfilled. But as Rama, He did not end His avatara upon killing Ravana. He stayed on in the Earth for a long time after the killing of Ravana. His decision to be born to Dasaratha and Kausalya was itself due to His kindness. Spending ten months in the cramped space of a mother’s womb was something the Supreme One need not have opted for. But He did it to save people. Throughout the Ramayana, one finds evidence of His superior qualities. That is why Rama avatara is a complete avatara. Dasaratha wants to crown Rama as Yuvaraja, because he (Dasaratha) is ageing. Kamban has a beautiful description of how Dasaratha notices his old age. He sees himself in the mirror one day, and notices grey hairs near his ears. Kamban says that Ravana’s sins took the form of Dasaratha’s grey hairs! It was on account of his age that Dasaratha is keen to confirm Rama as the next ruler. It is because of this decision that Kaikeyi becomes envious and wants Rama banished. And it is because Rama goes to the forest that Sita is carried off and Ravana is eventually killed. So Kamban sees Dasaratha’s grey hairs as Ravana’s sins! Dasaratha extols Rama’s qualities to the assembly summoned by him when he decides to make Rama the next king.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-ideal-incarnation/article31949634.ece

30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. extends UPHC timings||Following the rise in the number of COVID-19 positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to keep all urban primary health centres (UPHCs) open in the evening. At present, these hospitals are open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. But most hospitals are open only until noon. “At least 140 UPHCs will remain open in the evening. Residents will be able to visit the facilities late in the evening. Our plan is to ensure continuous operations of centres to treat patients during the pandemic,” said an official. Most of the 26 lakh residents in low-income neighbourhoods depend on Corporation hospitals for treatment of a wide range of illnesses. Doctors at the Corporation said the manpower should be increased to keep the UPHCs open in the evening. Most doctors were reluctant to work in such conditions. Former councillor V. Sukumar Babu said people had requested the Corporation to provide services 24×7 during the pandemic. “Private hospitals are not accepting fever cases. So, residents demand the Corporation to post additional doctors and keep hospitals open round the clock. Each of the 200 wards should have one hospital open all the time during the pandemic. The Corporation is the only hope of residents during the pandemic. But doctors should get proper protection,” said Mr. Sukumar Babu. App soon The Corporation has planned to develop an app to regulate home isolation of COVID-19 positive cases in the city. At present, the civic body has deployed FOCUS volunteers to help and monitor residents on home isolation. “Currently, the response from residents is in the form of a register. The app will facilitate proper regulation of persons on home isolation. Data on the type of assistance required by residents will be monitored using the app,” said an official. The Corporation has decided to stop sending messages warning residents not to violate home isolation or home quarantine. At least 20,000 messages were sent every day to residents who were found to come out of houses during home quarantine and home isolation. But many residents complained that they received messages without them violating the quarantine norms. “There was panic. So we have planned not to sent messages to residents,” said an official. Meanwhile, a number of Corporation officials were transferred on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-extends-uphc-timings/article31949766.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Terrace is their pathway to health||Every morning, 42-year-old Muralidharan Parthasarathy would meticulously follow a strict fitness regimen and run for at least an hour. But COVID-19 changed everything. After trying a couple of workouts and even running inside the house, he finally discovered joy and comfort in running on the terrace. “Everyday, I try to run for 4-6 km; though it is different from going for a run outside, it still feels refreshing,” he says. Healthy lifestyle Regular walkers and runners in the city have now taken to the terrace to practice a healthy lifestyle during the lockdown. Since most households put out clothes to dry on the terrace, it comes as a hindrance while walking or running. To avert that issue, some say they draw an alphabet or a number on the floor of the terrace and run or walk along that path and many others, just run or walk around the perimeter of the terrace. Similarly Sridhar Rajamohan, a 32-year-old working professional in the city, runs for 7 km in his terrace every day to keep himself fit and his diabetes under control. “I take an L-shaped path to run every evening. Initially, I found it a tad bit inconvenient and restricted but now, with time, I have gotten used to it. I see many of my neighbours too walking in the terrace post lockdown,” he says. Forty-four-year-old working professional T.S. Pradeep Kumar has drawn the shape of 8 and walks along that pattern. “This is to ensure there is consistency and speed while walking the 4 km. I listen to music and speak to my friends during this time. I find it a great stress-buster,” he adds. P. Shrilekha, a 39-year-old homemaker says, she too has adopted ‘8-shaped’ walking and looks forward to the time after finishing her chores. “It is a time that I have for myself and it helps me destress after a long day. After going to the terrace, we have also been able to meet our neighbours and speak to them while walking. Of course we keep physical distancing in mind as well,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/terrace-is-their-pathway-to-health/article31949784.ece

S. Alagiri demanded on Monday. In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said there will be a possibility of getting justice even if the CBI investigates the case only if cases are filed against the others involved in the incident — the judicial magistrate who remanded the father and son and the doctor who gave a fitness certificate, for failing to do their duty properly and for not adhering to the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. Mr. Alagiri said there was a fear that the investigation into this case too would end up being an eyewash just like the investigation into the killing of 13 protesters against Sterlite at Thoothukudi. “For the last two years, not even a single case has been filed against any of the accused. The CBI investigation is happening at a very slow pace to protect the accused,” he said. He also accused the Tamil Nadu government of trying to help the accused escape from the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/register-murder-case-constitute-sit-to-probe-deaths-of-jayaraj-benicks-alagiri/article31950085.ece

The Corporation official said as per the direction of the Director of Telecommunication, the mobile numbers of the quarantined persons were recorded for geofencing and if at all any person who had been quarantined violated the movement of more than 500 metres, the mobile number would be flagged for quarantine violation and a warning message sent for first violation. In case of any violation, the civic official can file a police complaint, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nearly-160-lakh-quarantined/article31949770.ece

Pointing out that the CCTV footage proved that Jayaraj and his son Benicks did not bear any bodily injuries when they were taken away from the shop, Mr. Stalin wanted to know whether he should remind the Chief Minister about the need to arrest the accused under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (Murder).

30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry’s minor port upgradation plan gets EAC nod||A proposal of the Puducherry government to upgrade the minor port at Uppalam under the Sagarmala scheme has been recommended for environmental and CRZ clearance by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The Port Department of the Puducherry Government had applied for Environmental and CRZ clearance to undertake capital dredging and construction of a barrier between the drainage channel and navigation channel as part of the first phase of work. Until 2006, the minor port was handling various cargo such as fertilisers, iron scrap, carbon black feed oil, wheat, molasses, cement sugar and other cargo. Financial constraints After 2006 due to financial constraints, the port and its navigation channel could not be maintained properly, the department said in its application. The department also wanted to dispose of dredged sediments “having sand fractions on the northern side of the shoreline for beach stabilisation, clay type sediments offshore in open sea and construction of a pile supported bridge cum walkway across the drainage channel to prevent solid waste disposal into the port waters.” It also said that it does not propose to handle coal or any other dirty cargo. Dredging the channel will also help fishermen as it will allow them to get sufficient draft to bring their boats at all times into the fishing harbour that shares a common entrance with the commercial minor port. “This proposal would generate funds for the Government of Puducherry in terms of lease rent and lead to productive use of space,” it said. Recommending the Environmental and CRZ clearances, the EAC also stipulated a number of conditions including compliance and continuous monitoring of marine ecology and marine biodiversity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherrys-minor-port-upgradation-plan-gets-eac-nod/article31949787.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Transit air passengers can get e-pass on arrival||Air passengers, who just have a transit at Chennai airport, can the e-pass at the counters at the arrival hall. Of the nearly 3,500-4,000 passengers who land in Chennai, for hundreds it is just a transit point. Many of these passengers are worried if they have to get an e-pass from the State government and had been raising this issue on social media by tagging the authorities concerned. “Passengers need not be anxious about this. The State government has put up several counters for issuing e-pass. They can get the transit e-pass from one of these counters after arriving here,” an official of the State government said. Similarly, many passengers have a transit period for several hours and they wonder where they should stay. S. Balakumar, a resident of the city, said his brother planned to travel from Ahmedabad to Madurai via Chennai and had a 12-hour transit stay at Chennai airport. “We don’t know where he can stay; if he is allowed to be in the terminal itself we will be happy. But, what happens if he is not?” he asked. Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said passengers who had a stopover of six hours or more, can stay in a hotel. “The passengers can pay and stay in one of the designated hotels permitted by the State government.

30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘T.N. requested fewer Vande Bharat Mission flights’||The Centre on Monday told the Madras High Court that fewer international flights were being operated to airports in Tamil Nadu under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM), aimed at evacuating Indians stranded abroad due to the COVID-19 lockdown, because of a specific request made by the State government to restrict their numbers. Justices R. Subbiah and Krishnan Ramasamy were told by Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan that many Tamils were, however, flown to nearby destinations such as Bengaluru and Kochi, from where they could easily travel to their hometowns in Tamil Nadu, either by domestic flights or by road, after obtaining e-passes from the authorities concerned. The submission was made in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), represented by its senior counsel P. Wilson, who said that of the 47,514 repatriation requests received by the Ministry of External Affairs, with a specific plea to travel to Tamil Nadu, only 19,558 people had been repatriated, as on June 25. He claimed that over 158 flights would have to be operated for evacuating the rest of the 27,956 people to Tamil Nadu, and hence, it was not right on the part of the State government to have requested the Centre to operate only two flights a day to Chennai and one each to Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore, to facilitate observance of the protocol. On his part, Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal urged the court to grant him a day’s time to receive instructions from the State government on the Centre’s claim that it was the former which had requested that the number of VBM flights, being operated to various international airports in Tamil Nadu, be restricted, since it was also handling other chartered flights. State’s web portal He said that even before the Centre could come up with a standard operating procedure for repatriating Indians, the State government had set up the web portalwww.nonresidenttamil.orgto ascertain details of Tamils stranded abroad for making arrangements for their return. He also said that as on June 15, 61 flights from 17 countries had brought 9,625 Indians to the State. The judges adjourned the case to Tuesday for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-requested-fewer-vande-bharat-mission-flights/article31949793.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin urges govt. to cancel semester exams||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday urged the State government to cancel final semester and other examinations of all universities and declare all students ‘deemed to have passed’, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement in Chennai, he also made a strong case for the constitution of a committee of contagious disease experts to get a report on whether there was “community spread” of COVID-19 in the State. ‘Nothing but a claim’ He said that even though medical experts had recommended increased testing to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government had not released district-wise and hospital-wise details on testing. “The government announced that it conducted tests on 2.55 lakh people in the last 10 days. It is nothing but a claim,” he said. “Details about testing in airports, districts and hospitals should be released,” he said. Livelihood issues Pointing out that the lockdown had deprived people of their livelihoods, Mr. Stalin said that the government should give Rs. 5,000 to the poor and unorganised workers. “The government should consider the lockdown as a special case and reduce electricity tariff. It should also distribute masks through ration shops,” Mr. Stalin said. He said that it was the duty of the government to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. They should be given personal protective equipment, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-urges-govt-to-cancel-semester-exams/article31949794.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vedanta seeks CPCB nod for maintenance at Thoothukudi plant||Vedanta Ltd. has sought permission from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to take up maintenance work at the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi, which has been shut down for two years now. In a letter written to the Board, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Pankaj Kumar said due to the lack of maintenance, there was a risk to the factory. Load bearing structures, acid tanks, pipelines and ducts, molten metal handling equipment, cooling towers, boiler panels and conveyor systems required regular maintenance to prevent corrosion, he said. “We spend almost Rs. 200 crore annually on plant maintenance. A Local Monitoring Committee appointed by District Collector, Thoothukudi, earlier only permitted us to remove stored copper concentrate, rock phosphate, furnace oil, phospho gypsum and other such materials from the factory. However, our requests for care and maintenance of the facility have been continuously denied,” he pointed out. Moreover, due to the sudden shutdown of factories in light of the lockdown, there were multiple reports of industrial accidents across the country. They emphasized the point that chemical and metallurgical plants required regular maintenance. The absence of regular maintenance may lead to serious incidents affecting employees, the community and ecosystem, Mr. Kumar added. The company said the CPCB could first ascertain the plant’s condition by way of an inspection before issuing any orders. The plant had been shut down and sealed by the TNPCB in May 2018, which had been challenged by the company before the National Green Tribunal, which subsequently was heard by the Supreme Court by way of an SLP and civil appeal. The matter was brought back to the Madras High Court, which in turn heard it and reserved orders in January.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vedanta-seeks-cpcb-nod-for-maintenance-at-thoothukudi-plant/article31949779.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Udhayanidhi counters Minister’s claim that he travelled without e-pass||AIADMK leader and Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Monday alleged that the DMK’s youth wing secretary, Udhayanidhi Stalin, had recently travelled to Thoothukudi without obtaining an e-pass. Mr. Udhayanidhi had gone to Thoothukudi to meet the family of Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks, who had died due to alleged torture at the Sattankulam police station. However, Mr. Udhayanidhi countered the Minister’s claim, tweeting: “We responded to the police posted at all check-posts on main roads. Only after showing the e-pass, did they allow us to go further [sic].” He added that he considered this “an attempt by the State government to divert [people’s] attention to help the murderers (those responsible for the death of a father-son duo in police custody) escape”. ‘Danger to people’ Addressing reporters in Chennai, Mr. Jayakumar had said that though there was no problem with Mr. Udhayanidhi going to Thoothukudi, he had not obtained an e-pass. “He neither got permission from the [Greater Chennai] Corporation nor from the [Thoothukudi] Collector. If he has travelled without obtaining an e-pass, is it a legal or an illegal act,” Mr. Jayakumar asked. “Is this an individual issue? Won’t it lead to problems in [COVID-19] contact tracing and pose a danger to people? One should respect the law. You cannot take the law into your hands and say that you will go anywhere without getting an e-pass,” Mr. Jayakumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/udhayanidhi-counters-ministers-claim-that-he-travelled-without-e-pass/article31949795.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Aviation Ministry allows drone flights at night to attack locusts||The Ministry of Civil Aviation has accorded sanction to a proposal for flying engine-operated drones at night to target and destroy clusters of locusts across North-Western and Central States. In a first, permission was given to fly the drones, each weighing about 50 kg, to spray chemicals on the locusts swarming on huge trees in Rajasthan and Gujarat close to international borders. The drones — dual power (petrol & battery) based rotary wing Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) — were indigenously designed and developed by the Centre for Aerospace Research (CASR), Anna University, Chennai. They have 60% larger pesticide tank capacity and three times more flying endurance compared to other aerial vehicles, making it more effective in the mission to eradicate locusts that were posing a threat to crops, CARS Director K. Senthil Kumar told The Hindu on Monday. Target clusters Also equipped with thermal imaging systems, the drones would be airborne in the deserts of Barmer and Jaisalmer districts of Rajasthan from Monday onwards to zero in on and eliminate locust clusters. Centre for Aerospace Research had written to the Ministry of Civil Aviation seeking inclusion of the specially designed Remotely Piloted Aircraft System in the conditional exemption granted to Central government entities for COVID-19 and anti-Locust related operations. Explaining the salient features of the dual-power based rotor wing RPAS over the battery operated ones, Dr. Kumar said the number of take-offs, endurance, fuel capacity, engine service and battery life of the former was proven to be much better. On the safety front, the dual-power aerial vehicle would not crash even if the battery drained. Three drones were already deployed and efforts were on to make 15 more soon, he said. The model, first of its kind in the world, was environment friendly with minimum use of batteries and most suitable for field operations, to identify locust settlements in the field even during the night. The system would prove effective to control the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and especially the locust attack in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where food security of the nation was challenged. In a note Amber Dubey, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, said “Congratulations to the Agriculture Ministry for receiving the approvals for night operation of drones and use of engine-powered drones with all-up weight upto 50 kilogramme for anti-locust ops. This is the first such instance in India…Night operations are more effective since the locust are literally caught napping then. Good to see the growing use cases for drones in the agriculture sector.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aviation-ministry-allows-drone-flights-at-night-to-target-locusts/article31949775.ece

Sundaram said the three-year contract period was supposed to end on June 7. The tender process has been postponed because of the lockdown. “We have sought a hike of 30% in hire charges for the extension period to compensate the loss incurred. We are operating lorries at a lower rate because of competition during the previous tender in 2017. For instance, a 9,000 litre lorry trip is being operated for a rate of Rs. 369 instead of the previous rate of Rs. 420,” he said. Officials’ response Officials of the water board said about 5,700 trips were operated daily. The contract period was extended with the consent of lorry owners.

30 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Now, a single textbook for social studies||Class 10 students of State board schools in Tamil Nadu will have a single textbook for social studies from the current academic year. As part of the revised syllabus, the students previously had two volumes for social studies, comprising lessons in history, geography, civics and economics. In July last year, the State Council for Educational Research and Technology (SCERT) had started reviewing the textbooks with the revised curriculum. Teachers as well as faculty members from the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) were roped in to review and analyse the content as well as the way it was being taught in classrooms. “While the social studies syllabus was interesting, it was vast and many students struggled studying two textbooks for their board exams. The new single textbook has retained the topics, but has done away with some in-depth information as well as exercises which were given for a few lessons,” said C. Sridhar, a social studies teacher from Vellore. With SCERT choosing to review all textbooks with the new syllabus, a teacher said that they expected similar changes in other subjects as well. “Science too has too many lessons and we expect the content to be reduced, based on the review,” a government school teacher said. Except in Chennai, Chengalpettu, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts, which are currently under lockdown, the School Education Department said that free textbooks will be given directly to government schools whenever they are available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-a-single-textbook-for-social-studies/article31949790.ece

30 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Chaos at care centre led to death of patient: Madurai MP||Inaction and confusion in handling COVID-19 cases had resulted in the death of a COVID-19 patient, said Su. Venkatesan, MP, here on Monday. A 65-year-old patient from Palanganatham had jumped off the first floor of a COVID Care Centre in Tirupparankundram after reportedly complaining about lack of basic amenities on Sunday night. Later he died at Government Rajaji Hospital. “Despite many shortcomings having been pointed out, officials do not understand the gravity of the situation,” the MP said in a statement. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said that he had been flagging the need to drastically increase the number of testings in Madurai district since the beginning of June. “We are in such a pathetic situation only because of not increasing the testings,” he said. The MP recalled that he had impressed upon Special Monitoring Officer B. Chandra Mohan to keep 3,500 beds ready immediately as the district was poised for a 7.9% growth in number of COVID-19 cases. In a subsequent letter to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the MP had sought 4,500 beds in the district. “Instead of taking up the works on a war-footing, the plea was met with a lackadaisical attitude,” Mr. Venkatesan said, adding the number of positive patients in the district was rising by 200 every day. Ground reality The ground reality is that patients had to wait for hours together to get treatment and there was no proper guidance and chaos prevailed. For instance, lunch was prepared for 200 patients at the Covid Care Centre in Tirupparankundram on Sunday, but later in the evening an additional 600 patients were sent there without arranging additional manpower. “This led to lot of confusion and patients could not get access even to drinking water. It was under this situation that the man had attempted to end his life,” the MP said. Majority of the patients were in severe stress as they face much hardship, solely because of the irresponsibility of the administration. He wondered whether these hardships were discussed at the review meeting conducted by Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chaos-at-care-centre-led-to-death-of-patient-madurai-mp/article31950069.ece
30 June 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||GRH to expand convalescent plasma therapy trials||The Government Rajaji Hospital is looking to expand convalescent plasma therapy trials for the treatment of selected COVID-19 patients. Dean J. Sangumani said that till date, two recovered patients — a 39 year-old man and a 43 year-old man — had come forward to donate 500 ml of plasma each. A 72-year-old man had been the only recipient till date, he added. Explaining the process of plasma therapy, Dr. Sangumani said that certain willing and healthy individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are usually encouraged to come forward after 28 days of recovery and asked to undergo a complete medical check-up. The check-up will indicate viral markers which might point to the existence of other diseases. All processes are according to the norms specified in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, he said. After the routine tests are cleared, 500 ml of plasma will be collected and stored. “The plasma will have the required level of antibodies against the novel coronavirus. When a patient with moderate COVID-19 symptoms sees deterioration of health, we will then transfuse the plasma based on their condition in two doses and keep 100 ml for research purposes,” he said. He added that when the first such transfusion was done on June 7, the 72-year-old patient who had persistent shortness of breath was adjudged compatible to receive the therapy. “He responded well and recovered too,” he said. The Dean said that in order to expand their trials, doctors had been contacting patients who had recovered and asking them to donate plasma. “We have been trying to raise awareness and are hoping to get more people involved in the research. I have contacted 10 patients myself and more doctors, including Head of the Department of General Medicine M. Natarajan, are on the job too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grh-to-expand-convalescent-plasma-therapy-trials/article31950071.ece
30 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Hangs up his boots after an illustrious service||Senior Indian Police Service officer K.P. Shanmuga Rajeswaran, who took charge as Inspector General of Police (South Zone) immediately after Thoothukudi district saw a major unrest due to Sterlite issue in 2018 June is retiring on Tuesday after two years of eventful tenure that saw many challenges across the zone. However, as he quits, Thoothukudi is again facing another turmoil after a father and son died under judicial custody in Sattankulam. “We had a series of people-friendly policing, resulting in effective grievance redressal,” he said. He oversaw bandobust for sensitive events in the two years. Thevar Jayanthi and Immanuel Sekaran death anniversary passed off peacefully for two consecutive years. “Even the Vinayaka Chathurthi event at Shencottah that witnessed some untoward incident in the past, passed off smoothly last year. It was peaceful in sensitive pockets of Kanniyakumari district too,” he added. However, Mr. Rajeswaran said the incident-free bandobust provided for Tamirabarani Pushkaram was very satisfying given that 35 lakh people from all over the world visited Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts for the festival. Despite having grown up in ranks, Mr. Rajeswaran always remained a foot soldier who would rush to any distant corner of the zone. “It helped me take the right decision by gauging the ground situation. Visits throw up opportunities to assess the problem first-hand,” he added. Stating that policing has changed a lot in his 31 years of career, he says the department has seen a lot of technological advancements in communication, mobility and gadgets. “Social media has been the biggest change and challenge in the recent times, which could make minor issues snowball into a crisis,” he said. But it also helps the police to keep a watch on people. Mr. Rajeswaran said more educated youngsters were joining the force and added that community policing would help in having a touch with the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hangs-up-his-boots-after-an-illustrious-service/article31950089.ece

30 June 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||A delaying tactic’||The State government’s decision to hand over the probe to the CBI was a tactic to delay the investigation, said TNCC president K.S. Alagiri in Thoothukudi on Monday. He was here to console the family members of Jayaraj and Benicks. On behalf of the Congress party, he handed over a cheque for Rs. 10 lakh to them. He told journalists that if they had violated COVID-19 lockdown norms and kept the shop open, the police could have registered a case, imposed fine or even issued summons. There were so many methods to handle violations which were not followed by the Sattankulam police. When opposition parties and allies of the Congress wanted the government to order a CBI probe, the CM had said that he would seek the permission of the High Court as the matter was taken up suo motu by the court. Now, after a week, he had announced a CBI investigation, which is nothing but a delaying tactic, Mr. Alagiri said The evidence must be preserved immediately as they were with the custody of Sattankulam police, the TNCC president said. There were also two more complaints of police harassment and torture in southern districts in which the victims had died. The government should not term them politically motivated, but look into them, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-delaying-tactic/article31950078.ece

30 June 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||More than 2,200 NIT-T students demand cancellation of end semester examinations||A section of students from National Institute of Technology (NIT-T), who were unable to take part in online classes, has petitioned the college seeking cancellation of the upcoming end semester examinations. The institution, meanwhile, maintained that those who were unable to take the online examinations may attempt them when the college reopens. In a petition submitted on May 30, 2,213 students from various departments of NIT-T said they would be unable to write the end semester examinations scheduled for first, second and third-year students in July. They cited reasons such as conduct of minimal to no online classes, varying course structures, mental health and erratic internet connectivity. A second-year student, requesting anonymity, said when the students were asked to leave the campus around March 15, they left in haste and were unable to pick up their course books. Some even left behind their laptops. “We were told that we would have to return after the 14-day lockdown and so we left behind all our things. Now, most of us are unable to access our coursework,” the student said. “We are unable to study since our laptops are in college. How will we attend the exams?” he asked.  Although the college permitted students to travel to Tiruchi to pick up the study material, it wasimpossible to travel with lockdown restrictions in place in various parts of the country, another student added. “Not everyone is emotionally stable in the current crisis - a lot of students are negatively impacted and worried as their internships got rescinded due to the COVID-19. This further impacts the placement and higher education scenarios, which are already uncertain because of the pandemic. Exams, in this case, will only add to our stress levels and increase our mental agonies,” the letter signed by the students said. As it was a national institute, students came from a wide range of economic and social backgrounds, another student said. “For example, some are economic pillars for their family, some are worried about their family being stuck, and being unsafe in a different State/country, some have family members who are quarantined, etc. Forcing us to write the exams during this period is unreasonable,” she said. Response Although the students claimed that they received no response from the college, NIT-T Director Mini Shaji Thomas, in a letter addressed to parents and students, which is available on the college website, said: “If your wards have any issues with the online assessments, they will get a chance to write it on campus whenever the college reopens, as mentioned in our announcement. So they don’t have to worry if they miss this chance.” The final assessment was only of 30% weightage for two-hour duration and it would be largely an open book test. “For internal assessment of 70% weightage, we have allowed for flexibility by giving credit for group work, group projects, seminars, quizzes as suggested by some of you,” she said. Ms. Thomas also informed the students that the online classes for next semester would start from August 25 and asked them to make necessary arrangements by then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-than-2200-nit-t-students-demand-cancellation-of-end-semester-examinations/article31950132.ece

Vinay said works were under way to provide oxygen lines for taluk hospitals in Melur, Tirupparankundram and Usilampatti. He said currently 350 beds with oxygen supply are available at COVID-19 speciality wing of the GRH and 150 beds at the old GRH building. The Thoppur facility has 22 beds with oxygen supply, said a source from the hospital. A GRH doctor said oxygen supply was vital for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with comorbidities. “Every day, 10% to 15% of patients require oxygen support at GRH. Some days, around 20% of patients require oxygen support. Hence, as a preparatory measure, we are providing additional pipelines,” said Dr. Sangumani. K. Senthil, treatment coordinator for COVID-19 at GRH, said a liquified oxygen plant would be set up at Thoppur hospital. Currently, asymptomatic patients and those below 50 years without any comorbidities were being treated at this COVID-19 Care Centre. “But we are ramping up other facilities at the hospital to treat mild and moderate cases,” he said. Dr. Sangumani said they were planning to increase the oxygen storage capacity at GRH.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/additional-oxygen-pipelines-on-the-way/article31950070.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||In Tiruchi, no takers for tables, only takeaways||It is almost three weeks since the State government granted permission for resumption of dining services. But most restaurants in Tiruchi are still confining their business to takeaways due to shortage of labour and poor patronage. When the Central and State governments clamped total lockdown on March 23 to stop the spread of infection, there was no blanket ban on restaurants. The State government allowed restaurants to continue with takeaways keeping in mind stranded travellers and those who regularly eat out. However, most of the restaurants, except a handful of eateries, closed all services after their chefs and other employees — nearly 30% of them were migrants — left for their homes. As part of its measures to ease lockdown restriction, the State government permitted hoteliers to resume dining services — with restrictions — from June 8. The decision was intended to bring relief to the hoteliers, but many are less than enthused. Barring a few restaurants at Central Bus Stand in Tiruchi, many have not resumed dining services. Contrary to expectations that they will begin offering dining services within a week or two, most of them are yet to resume full-fledged operations. Only mid-range and road side eateries are offering both parcel and dining services. Restaurants owners cite poor patronage, fear of contracting infection, shortage of labour and surge in number of positive cases as reasons for not resuming dining services. “It is really a testing time for us. We hardly get our regular customers. There is fear of contracting infection if they dine at restaurants. Hence, we have not resumed dining service,” says C. Sathish, Managing Partner, Ezham Suvai, Thillai Nagar. The volume of sale is just 30% of the usual transaction at his hotel. It is hardly sufficient to pay rent, salary, electricity bill and other overheads. Many restaurants have incurred heavy losses. According to industry sources, most of the restaurants offer only limited menus due to shortage of chefs and assistants. There is acute shortage of specialised chefs fortandooriand Chinese cuisine as they have not returned from their native places. A manager of a non-vegetarian restaurant at Chathiram Bus Stand says workers and specialists are available only for traditional south Indian varieties such asdosaandparotta. Hence, it is not advisable to offer continental andtandooricuisine as specialists have left for their native States, the hotelier points out. The restaurant owners are not prepared to take any chances with the available staff when it comes to both cuisines as they feel that they will not be able to meet the usual expectations of their customers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-tiruchi-no-takers-for-tables-only-takeaways/article31950131.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Experts were not for extending curbs||At a review meeting prior to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement on the extension of the intensified lockdown, a panel of medical and public health experts had advised against extending the shutdown. Though it had helped in controlling the spread of the disease, the lockdown, in itself, cannot be a solution, the panel said. The intensified shutdown was scheduled to end on June 30. “They say it (the lockdown) is a blunt instrument. It is not the best solution, but is needed sometimes. It should be imposed when needed. But the lockdown, in itself, is not a solution to the COVID-19 epidemic,” Dr. Prabhdeep Kaur, Scientist - E/Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Epidemiology, said while addressing the media following the panel’s meeting with the CM at the Secretariat. As for Chennai, the COVID-19 doubling time has increased due to the lockdown, and this had slowed down the transmission of the disease, she said. “But we cannot be under lockdown all the time,” she added. There were certain indicators, recommended by the World Health Organisation and others, which could be referred to while placing district-wise restrictions based on certain factors. The factors could be the doubling time or deaths or bed occupancy in a district (which should not exceed 70%), she explained. V. Ramasubramanian, an infectious diseases expert at Apollo Hospitals and a member of the panel, said the lockdown was a “very standard, broad weapon”. When asked whether the lockdown had helped control the spread of the disease, he said, “It is like killing a mosquito with a big axe. However, it was initially necessary to ensure that everyone knew and realised [the contagious nature of the disease]. The lockdown has definitely controlled [the spread of the virus], but we have to focus on other options. There is no point having a lockdown for another six months.” Senior epidemiologist P. Kuganantham, another member of the panel, said the committee had recommended that patients who test positive should be admitted to a hospital without delay. He noted that the COVID-19 death rate in Tamil Nadu was the lowest in the country. As for the lockdown, he said, “There were some benefits, but it cannot be extended due to socio-economic conditions.” Dr. Kaur said public transport should be restricted as case counts were rising in districts other than Chennai. Districts with “city population” such as Tiruchi, Madurai, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai were seeing an “upward trend”, she pointed out, adding that the doubling time in these districts had reduced, and hence, the techniques implemented in Chennai would have to be replicated in these regions too. As for Chennai, the doubling time had increased and the trend was favourable, she said. She said fever clinics, a “successful initiative” implemented in Chennai, should be replicated in other districts. Persons with symptoms such as fever, cold, cough, breathing difficulty, sore throat and loss of smell and taste should approach fever clinics. The focus should be on reducing the death rate and early detection of positive cases, Dr. Kaur said. When asked about the option of a rapid antigen test, she said it was “not necessary”. “RT-PCR testing is good. It is the best. Even in the case of a negative [result] in a rapid antigen test, the RT-PCR test is being done. Our RT-PCR capacity is sufficient,” she added. Dr. Ramasubramanian said, “Many are anxious about COVID-19. Over 80% of [cases of] this infection is quite mild. Even if you have minor symptoms, you have to isolate yourself. Even if the results don’t come in two or three days, the infection would spread [if the person fails to self-isolate]. Make sure you isolate yourself soon after you develop any symptoms.” The medical and public health experts would soon finalise a protocol for all private and government hospitals on the treatment to be given to COVID-19 patients. Dr. Ramasubramanian reiterated that people should not step out of their homes without wearing a mask. “Even for minor symptoms, isolate yourself, test yourself,” he added. Dr. Kuganantham said people who had come to Tamil Nadu from other States had contributed to the increase in fresh cases.  They say it (the lockdown) is a blunt instrument. It is not the best solution. It should be imposed when neededPrabhdeep KaurICMR-NIE||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/experts-were-not-for-extending-curbs/article31949789.ece

The court was informed that the Additional SP and the DSP had made themselves available at the police station at the time of the inquiry, and in their very presence, other policemen were taking videos of the magisterial proceedings. The court directed Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian to appear in person, and the Range Deputy Inspector General of Police and the Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police to accompany the Additional Advocate General on Tuesday. Further, the court directed the Assistant Director of the Mobile Forensic Science Laboratory, Thoothukudi, to immediately go to the Sattankulam police station to collect the clue materials and assist the Judicial Magistrate, Kovilpatti. If necessary, a team of forensic science experts from the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Tirunelveli, may also be requisitioned. When Mr. Chellapandian submitted the State's government’s decision to transfer the case to the CBI, the court made it clear that to transfer or not to transfer the case to the CBI was a policy decision of the government, and such a transfer was governed by the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. However, with certain procedural formalities remaining, the court passed a few directions. The Registrar Judicial of the High Court Bench was directed to take photocopies of the preliminary post-mortem certificates, certify them and keep them in safe custody. The originals shall be handed over to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who, in turn, shall hand over the same to the investigating officer of the CBI. Reports awaited The post-mortem doctors were awaiting the chemical analysis, histopathological examination and microbiological examination reports. The dean of the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital shall send a copy of the final opinion to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall hand over the same to the CBI. A copy shall be sent to the court in a sealed cover, the HC said. The Director of the Tamil Nadu Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Chennai, was directed to give top priority to the examination of the materials sent by the post-mortem doctors. The Judicial Magistrate of Kovilpatti shall hand over a copy of his report to the court and the original to the CBI. The case diaries shall also be handed over to the CBI, the court said. Responding to a query on the importance of addressing the psychological needs of police personnel and their families, the State government informed the court that a scheme called the Police Wellbeing Programme was launched in collaboration with NIMHANS, Bengaluru, and a sum of Rs. 10 crore was allocated for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/contempt-proceedings-against-3-policemen/article31949802.ece

He had adopted the ‘Sallekhana Vrata’ ritual as per Jain traditions for 49 days now. He had gradually reduced food intake and shifted to coconut water. For the last few days, he lived on water alone. His end came amid family and friends. His son Kuntinath performed the last rites in Shedbal village. Mr. Bhosge had participated in the freedom movement and had remained a Khadi activist all his life. He had met Mahatma Gandhi as a child of 10 years at Shedbal railway station. He has written several poems and biographies in Kannada. Death is celebrated in Jainism as Mrutyu Mahotsava and Sallekhana Vrata is sacred because it leads to this celebration, says Devendrappa Akki, Jain scholar. The Sallekhana ritual is usually taken up by monks known as munis. However, there is no bar on any Shravaka or a married person taking up the ritual. Mr. Bhosge has inspired many to live a life of simplicity and piety, Dr. Akki said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jain-scholar-passes-away/article31949924.ece

30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Precautions increased in public offices||The recent spike in COVID-19 positive cases in the city has also seen public offices increasing precautionary measures to prevent risk of infection among the public and staff. Some of them have been closed, following cases being reported there. With cases being reported from Vidhana Soudha, Vikasa Soudha and MS Building, they were fumigated and sanitised, and restrictions were imposed on the entry of the public. After an employee of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) tested positive, his office was sealed. HAL 2nd Stage head post office, Jayanagar head post office and Hebbal-Kempapura post office have been sealed. Similar was the case at several police stations, including the office of the Police Commissioner. Measures in place Several government offices that see huge footfall of citizens claim to have put in place precautionary measures to ensure safety of citizens and staff. At the BBMP head office, entry is restricted and all applications are to be put inside a box placed near the entrance gates. “This is to prevent entry of unauthorised persons. However, this has not worked, as many contractors have muscled their way inside the campus,” pointed out a senior BBMP official, who added that similar measures were taken in all the zonal offices as well. At the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) head office too, entry is restricted. An employee has been posted at the entrance to receive applications and complaints, which are later forwarded to the officials concerned. However, there is no restriction on entry of citizens in the sub-division offices, an official claimed. All visitors to the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) head office have to undergo thermal screening and use sanitisers before entering the premises. At the city’s many BengaluruOne centres, guidelines have been issued to the staff to ensure everyone wears a mask and practices social distancing. Prabhuling Kavalkatti, Director of Electronic Delivery of Citizen Services, Department of e-governance, said that every centre is provided with hand-held thermal scanners and sanitisers. “Centres coming under containment zones that have been sealed are closed,” he said. B.S. Chandrashekhar, Senior Superintendent (Bengaluru East), India Post, said that not all post offices have thermal scanners but sanitisers have been provided. “HAL 2nd stage head post office will be re-opened on July 1. Since all the 56 staff members are under home quarantine, staff from other post offices will be deputed to offer skeletal services,” he said. Fewer footfalls Many citizens visit the Nada Katcheris and offices of the Deputy Commissioner (Urban), Assistant Commissioners, and tahsildars. According to sources in the Deputy Commissioner’s office, the number of visitors had dropped after the initial spike. Visitors are allowed only after thermal screening. “The quasi-judicial hearings by the DC and AC have been reduced to a mere 10 a day. Earlier, over 70 cases were heard every day. Now, only litigants and advocates are allowed in the court hall,” the source said. At Nada Katcheris, Group D employees are deputed specifically to ensure that social distancing is maintained among those who have queued up to apply for various services. The public too, especially those with a higher risk of infection, are putting off visits to public offices due to the rising number of cases. Venkatraman, a senior citizen from Malleswaram, needed a family tree document from the Revenue Department. Knowing that he would be exposing himself to the risk of contracting the virus by visiting the revenue office (Nada Katcheri), he decided to approach a lawyer with relevant documents instead, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/precautions-increased-in-public-offices/article31949714.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘What will children do sitting idle at home all day?’||Asking what children could do sitting idle at home the whole day because of the COVID-19 restrictions, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday permitted parents and educational institutions to challenge the legality of the State government’s new order of June 27 permitting only a few sessions of online classes till an expert committee submits its report. What is the problem in allowing schools to offer education online with a rider that it is not mandatory, the court asked, when the advocates for the petitioners pointed out that restrictions have been imposed on schools to hold online classes as part of regular education while private players have been allowed to enjoy roaring business through the online teaching mode. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy made these observations while hearing a batch of PIL petitions, filed by parents of school-going children, and the petitions filed by some educational institutions questioning the June 15 order of the government prohibiting schools from conducting online classes. On June 27, the government issued an order permitting limited sessions of online classes after the High Court, during an earlier hearing, asked it to find a solution such as allowing limited hours of classes till the expert committee’s report is submitted. Though the government said that it had now modified its June 15 by allowing limited sessions of synchronised online classes based on the ‘Pragyata’ guideline for digital education released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Bench found that the ‘Pragyata’ guidelines were not an order enforcible by law and were only suggestions. Earlier, questioning the power of the State government to restrict schools from continuing education online during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the arrangement should be decided by each school and the parents of children, not by the government. It was also pointed out that the June 27 order strangely directed that online classes of 30 minutes for pre-primary students may be held once a week for interacting solely with parents and guiding them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/what-will-children-do-sitting-idle-at-home-all-day/article31949743.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Beware! HAM operators are watching you||As the number of COVID-19 positive cases increases, so does the number of people under home quarantine. A special task force has been constituted in Bengaluru to ensure that citizens under home quarantine follow the prescribed protocol. Among those who have volunteered to help the task force are 260-odd HAM (amateur) radio operators in the city. They work in shifts, coordinating with booth-level and ward-level squad members to keep a watch on the home quarantined people. While most of them are operating out of their homes, three static centres have been set up in the Vasanthapura, H.B.R. Layout and Jayanagar localities. “We had earlier set up high frequency and very high frequency stations at the State war room. But we have decided to cut down on our movement considering the high risk involved. We are all keeping a watch in our neighbourhoods, apart from providing back-up communication to the squad and task force,” said S. Sathyapal, director of the Indian Institute of HAMS. Gautam Shantappa, a HAM volunteer, said operators in Bengaluru had been volunteering since the end of March. “We coordinated the distribution of food and ration kits to migrant workers. We also helped with [the process of] sending 1.8 lakh migrant workers home. A few of us are volunteering at the railway station and the airport, and helping with the quarantining of travellers,” said B. N. Umesh, another HAM operator. But the challenges in monitoring the home quarantined are vastly different, said Dr. Sathyapal. “We sometimes have to deal with aggressive behaviour and negotiate with violators, though we are not trained for it. We immediately transmit messages to the senior officials if we are not able to tackle the situation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/beware-ham-operators-are-watching-you/article31949711.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SSLC students a model for adults: Minister||Hailing the students appearing for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination, S. Suresh Kumar, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, said they were a “model even for adults” as they were following all the COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks inside and outside the exam centres. Addressing reporters on Monday, he urged the parents of students to cooperate with the Education Department and follow social distancing outside the exam centres. On Monday, more than seven lakh students appeared for the science, music and political science SSLC papers in 2,871 centres across the State. Of the 7.91 lakh students enrolled for the exam — 7.9 lakh for science, 419 for political science, and two for music — 7.74 lakh appeared, taking the attendance to 97.93%. Last academic year, the attendance was 98.68%. Special arrangements were made for 491 students, who had illnesses other than COVID-19. However, the students who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those under home quarantine will have to appear for the supplementary exam. Transport arrangements A total of 3,215 buses and private vehicles were arranged to bring the students to the different exam centres, the Minister said. Citing examples, he said that in Belagavi, transport was arranged to bring 320 private students to an exam centre. Similarly, at Chipageri village in Sirsi, transport was arranged for 19 students who used to be dropped to the exam centres by their relatives. Of the 645 students from neighbouring States, 592 appeared for the exam. A total of 12,644 students belonging to families of migrant workers had enrolled, of whom 12,539 sat for the exam. Public health expert M.K. Sudarshan, who heads the COVID-19 expert committee, said enough care was taken to implement the SOP and other recommendations issued to the department by the committee. “The only thing we have suggested is to ensure that the students’ bags are arranged at a distance from one another and not kept together outside the exam halls,” he said. He added that a report would be submitted to the government after the exam concludes. Earlier, after an exam supervisor developed symptoms of something yet to be confirmed as COVID-19 at Navanagar in Bagalkot district, the department relieved all the other staff deputed there. The centre was sanitised and other staff posted on exam duty, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sslc-students-a-model-for-adults-minister/article31949741.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Patients in Bengaluru run from pillar to post for hospital beds||Cases of patients and their families running from pillar to post looking for hospital beds appears to be emerging, as the number of COVID-19 cases rise. A 42-year-old businessman, who runs a hardware store, tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, but was allegedly refused treatment in eight private hospitals before he was finally admitted in Prakriya Hospital on Saturday. Speaking to The Hindu , his wife said it was a nightmare running round several hospitals. “While a majority sent us back citing non-availability of beds, many private hospitals said they did not have a designated facility to treat COVID-19 patients. It was extremely exhausting. We left home at noon on Friday and returned home disappointed as none of the hospitals admitted my husband,” she said, adding that she was worried as her husband, who has blood pressure and diabetes, was feeling breathless. Many hospitals refused to even allow them inside after learning that her husband had tested positive. “Some even sprayed disinfectant on us,” she said. “On Saturday, a community leader called us and informed us that a bed was available in Prakriya Hospital. We immediately admitted him and he is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit,” she added. The experience has been equally harrowing for a 42-year-old garment worker, resident of Sunkadakatte in Bengaluru, who is awaiting results of his COVID-19 test. After experiencing breathlessness and high fever, his family called for an ambulance and they were refused beds in nine hospitals. “The ambulance took us to three hospitals who said they did not have beds. The ambulance staff later told us to make our own arrangements and said they could not ferry us to more hospitals. So, I arranged for a car and we went to both private and government hospitals who told us they were out of beds,” said a neighbour, who accompanied them to the hospital. He said the patient and three others travelled to hospitals in the city from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. The patient was finally admitted at a State-run government hospital in north Bengaluru. The family is still waiting for the COVID-19 result. Doctors at both government and private hospitals admitted that the beds were fast filling and they had to turn away patients. Many private hospitals pointed out that they had to turn away patients as they had still not set up the infrastructure to accommodate COVID-19 positive patients.

30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Enforcement of new curfew rules begins||Police and civic officials started enforcing the 8 p.m. curfew on Monday. In most areas, police were on patrol since evening asking shops to shut down at 8 p.m., even making announcements on public address systems mounted on Hoysalas. The government recently changed the night curfew deadline from 9 p.m. to 8 p.m. in view of rising number of COVID-19 cases in Karnataka, especially in the city. Police ensured that autorickshaws, cabs and other services were mostly off the roads before the deadline. Traffic police barricaded all flyovers in the city. This led to traffic jams for several kilometres on key arterial roads, like Mysuru Road, which took hours to be cleared. In residential areas, vehicles were being checked and motorists were asked the reason for being on the road. Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said enforcement of the new curfew deadline was successful. “Almost 85% of the city was shut down shortly after the deadline. We have decided not to book cases for two days to create awareness of the new norm. But going forward, we shall book cases and seize vehicles of motorists violating the curfew without a valid reason,” he said. The night curfew will be in force till 5 a.m. The State government has also announced reintroduction of lockdown on Sunday from July 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/enforcement-of-new-curfew-rules-begins/article31949712.ece

30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Decoupling India-China economies neither feasible nor desirable’||Indian and Chinese economies are closely intertwined and decoupling is neither feasible nor desirable despite huge trade deficit for India, said Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA). The India-China trade has been in favour of China and has built up into a huge deficit for India over the years. The Chinese advantage has been its manufacturing economy. The trade between India and China today amounts to 90 billion dollars. But, trade is hugely in favour of China with India facing a deficit of USD 63 billion, said R. Raju, president of KASSIA. A large number of Chinese companies in technology and other sectors have a presence in India like FOSUN International, VIVO Electronics, SAIC, MEDEA Alibaba, Tencent and Byte Dance, Paytm, Byju, Oyo, and Ola among others. “In 2018, it was estimated that about 700 Chinese companies were active in the market with USD 11-12 billion investment,” said Mr. Raju. Similarly, a large number of Indian companies are in China, including Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Arvindo Farma, Bharat Forge, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Sons, NIIT, Sundram Fasteners, among others. China is a large manufacturing economy on which many countries, including India, depend because of its cost advantage. “The economic relationship between India and China, and also the rest of the world is closely inter-twined and complex. But, the relationship is now looking frayed and the economies have been disengaging for whatever reasons. But, this may not be feasible,” added Mr. Raju. These are some of the critical issues that need to be addressed by both the Central and State governments, wherever relevant, so that industries can be back on track as quickly as possible, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decoupling-india-china-economies-neither-feasible-nor-desirable/article31949731.ece
30 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Banks disburse Rs. 2,724 cr. to 48,655 MSMEs in State||Various banks have together disbursed Rs. 2,724 crore to 48,655 individual micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Karnataka as on June 22, 2020. The disbursals are expected to reach Rs. 10,000 crore to Rs. 15,000 crore by October, said trade body KASSIA on Monday. Some 15 banks have participated in the initial disbursements that ranged between Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 4 crore. Around 45 lakh industrial units across the country are expected to be covered under the Centre’s Rs. 3 lakh crore MSME revival package. ‘Hugely inadequate’ However, KASSIA said the amount was “hugely inadequate” as Karnataka itself has over 6.5 lakh MSMEs, and across the country there are over 10 crore MSMEs. “There is a need for adequate working capital. The industry also needs finances at low cost, say at 4% to 6% interest on working capital with the least paperwork,” said R. Raju, president, KASSIA. Concessions sought The industry association called for concessions that can be made available for the entire financial year and beyond, if necessary. Citing data, KASSIA said that in spite of increased finance to the MSME sector, there is an addressable credit gap of Rs. 25.8 trillion, which can be profitably financed by the formal banking and financing institutions. Highlighting the challenge of raising funds, the trade body further said that of the Rs. 69.3 trillion debt demand, 84% is financed by informal sources. Formal resource account only for 16% (Rs. 10.9 trillion). Of this, the scheduled bank provide only Rs. 9.4 trillion.  Around 45 lakh industrial units across the country are expected to be covered under the Centre’s Rs. 3 lakh crore MSME revival package.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banks-disburse-rs-2724-cr-to-48655-msmes-in-state/article31949730.ece

Speaking to presspersons in Dharwad on Monday, Mr. Shettar said that the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the district was due to increased testing and random sampling. “Of the 447 people subjected to random sampling, 367 people have tested negative, while one tested positive. The results of 78 persons are waited,” he said. The Minister said that if there was community spread of the pandemic, then there would have been more number of positive cases from among those subjected to random sampling, which was not the case. More beds Considering the increase in the number of positive cases in the district, the Union government had asked the district administration to increase the number of beds available for treatment, set up required medical infrastructure and increase quarantine facilities. “The district administration is taking steps to made 6,000 beds available for COVID-19 patients and for quarantine facilities in hospitals and lodges. A total of 17 hospitals have been identified for setting up COVID Care Centres,” he said. On the declaration of Neo Natal Hospital as COVID Care Centre, Mr. Shettar clarified that it would be used as such only for treating children who test positive. He said that as of now there were enough beds available for treatment at KIMS Hospital in Hubballi and private hospitals would be used only if there was a steep rise in the number of positive patients.

30 June 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||SWR installs devices to monitor water level||In an initiative that will help monitor water levels at railway bridges built over rivers, particularly during monsoon, South Western Railway (SWR) has brought two major bridges under the Intelligent River Level Monitoring System. According to a press release, intelligent river level monitoring instruments have been installed at two major bridges in the Londa-Miraj section of Hubballi division. While bridge no. 44 between Gunji and Khanapur railway stations is built over the Malaprabha, bridge no. 184 between Kudachi and Ugar Khurd railway stations is built across the Krishna. According to railway authorities, these instruments will serve as a safe alternative to monitoring excess or sudden water flow or flash floods manually. These instruments help the railway staff monitor water level continuously as the device communicates and transmits the river level data to a centrally located server regularly. Another important feature of the new system is that the water level can be monitored from anywhere, any time through an Internetbrowser. In the newly installed system, the staff will also be able to receive SMS alerts based on various thresholds of regular level, danger level, and high flood level. And any alarming condition at the site is immediately communicated through SMS generated by the central server and sent to the phones of the officers concerned, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/swr-installs-devices-to-monitor-water-level/article31949747.ece

Yediyurappa on Monday asked private hospitals to dedicate 2,500 beds for COVID-19 patients in Bengaluru. However, hospital managements said they were ready to set aside only 2,000 beds. Out of the 2,000 beds to be set aside in private hospitals, managements said 1,000 will be for patients referred by public health authorities. The cost of treatment of these patients will be reimbursed by the government under the Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka (AB-ArK) scheme. The remaining 1,000 beds will be for patients who have to pay their own medical bills. R. Ravindra, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association, said that private hospital managements would provide 750 beds for COVID-19 patients on Tuesday. An additional 250 beds would be set aside for them by end of the week. Earlier during the day, the Chief Minister chaired a meeting with representatives of private hospitals and asked them to dedicate 2,500 beds for virus-infected patients by Tuesday. However, a private hospital management member said: “With 50% of our beds now reserved for COVID-19 patients, we are likely to run out of beds for non-COVID-19 patients. We have to ensure that patients who have other illnesses are not turned away due to shortage of beds in the coming days.” Meanwhile, a meeting with 11 private medical college managements will be held on Tuesday, and managements will be asked to dedicate 5,000 beds of the total available 10,000 in hospitals attached to colleges. Mr. Yediyurappa appealed to people not to panic as the number of cases in Bengaluru was less compared to other metropolitan cities in the country. He is expected to announce new restrictions and guidelines after the first week of July.

In a complaint addressed to the Deputy Commissioner of South East and the jurisdictional police station, the BMRCL Deputy Chief Engineer in charge of the work has alleged that representatives of NICE are obstructing metro work. “As progress of work in the said area is of prime importance to complete the metro project, it is requested to provide the necessary police assistance to continue with the work,” states the complaint. An official of the BMRCL said, “As per the rules, the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB), the agency acquiring land for metro projects in the city, has handed over the NICE land to the BMRCL. When our people had gone there to carry out the project work, people from NICE objected. On Reach 6 (R.V. Road to Bommasandra), the BMRCL has achieved good progress of metro work barring a small stretch of NICE land. For close to four years, the BMRCL has faced several hurdles in acquiring the NICE load, which has made an impact on completion of the project in several reaches coming under Phase II. We do not know why they are troubling us despite following all the rules.” Completion of the metro project on R.V. Road to Bommasandra stretch is crucial for the traffic choked areas around them that cater to the IT sector and other industrial areas. The BMRCL is building three intersection stations on the stretch at R.V. Road, Jayadeva and Silk Board, which will help people reach other reaches of metro. A few weeks ago, the BMRCL completed demolition of Jayadeva flyover to build a station and road-cum-metro rail flyover. BMRCL had identified close to four acres of NICE land out of which 6,400 square metres are needed to build a viaduct and tation in Electronics City. Acquisition was delayed for various reasons, including compensation. The matter had reached the Chief Minister. NICE denies allegations NICE refuted the claim made by the BMRCL. “We are surprised with the allegations made by the BMRCL. Issues pertaining to acquisition of NICE land for metro projects have been resolved. The court had directed them to acquire the land after issuing notifications. We want them to follow the due course of law,” said a spokesperson of NICE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-seeks-police-help-to-carry-out-namma-metro-work/article31949715.ece

District Collector A. Alexander on Monday directed authorities concerned to identify auditoriums, hostels and other facilities that could be converted into first-line treatment centres. A review meeting chaired by Mr. Alexander at the Collectorate decided to seek help from local bodies in identifying the buildings. The Collector directed to test cleaning staff employed at COVID-19 care centres and first-line treatment centres, officials with the Health Department, health workers and migrant workers for SARS-CoV-2 at regular intervals. It also decided to scale up the number of swab tests to 400 per day. For the purpose, 25 vehicles with cabin facilities will be arranged. Taxi service Officials said that special taxi services had been arranged at Cherthala, Alappuzha, Chengannur and Kayamkulam, the dropping points for people coming from abroad and other States.

Environmental activists had alleged that the Panamaram grama panchayat was carrying out sand mining in the river using 25 ferries under the guise of an order of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to remove sand and debris that had accumulated in the riverbed to avoid flooding during the monsoon. The team, led by K. Ajeesh, Deputy Collector, DDMA, visited five sites in Panamaram grama panchayat limits on Monday on the direction of Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla, and ordered a halt to all dredging activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dredging-in-kabani-halted/article31950001.ece
30 June 2020||KANNUR,KERALA||University claims isolating clot-busting enzyme||Researchers from the Inter-University Centre for Bioscience, Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology, Kannur University, claim to have isolated a clot-busting enzyme, 50Kilo Dalton, from a marine bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KU1, from the coast of Kannur. Clot busters are enzymes that are used for emergency treatment of ischemic strokes, heart attack or a massive pulmonary embolism. The new findings were carried in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules published by Elsevier. The study, which lasted for four years, was conducted by Swaroop S. Kumar under the guidance of associate professor A. Sabu and professor M. Haridas, Director of the Inter University Centre for Bioscience. Dr. Sabu said while there were many enzymes available in the market for clot-busting, the one reported from Kannur University had certain unique features that included little haemolytic property (resulting in very low bleeding on treatment) and less chances of bradykinin-induced neuro-inflammation. He said bradykinin was a product of blood coagulation system and was pro-inflammatory in character. (Bradykinin reduces blood-brain barrier, and hence, causes neuro-inflammation, which is a serious side-effect of the use of clot busters.) He claimed that lab experiments proved that the clot-busting enzyme busted bradykinin and, hence, would practically have no side effects. No other clot-buster had both these functions, he added. Dr. Sabu observed that cardiovascular disorders were on the rise worldwide due to alcohol abuse, obesity, hypertension, raised blood lipids, diabetes, and age-related risks. These aberrations may cause blood clots. Hence, use of fibrinolytic, a process that prevents blood clots from growing and becoming problematic, had become more frequent in hospitals and the utilisation of the new enzyme after required trials would improve the treatment strategy. The researchers are now in the process of filing a patent on a preparation with the enzyme as the major component for effective management of cardiovascular diseases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/university-claims-isolating-clot-busting-enzyme/article31950020.ece

The apartment was taken over a day after flat owners and locals resisted the move and staged a protest against the decision of the District Collector to take over the building. There are 48 flats which could accommodate 500 patients. At present, COVID-19 patients are being treated at Kannur Government Medical College Hospital, Anjarakandi COVID Treatment Centre, Kannur District Hospital and Thalassery General Hospital. However, more space was required to accommodate patients, said Tahsildar C.V. Prakashan. He said the flat had been taken over on a war footing. Water and electricity had been provided. There was a need to take over more buildings, he added. Sub collectors Asif K. Yousuf, S. Ilyakya, Assistant Collector R. Srilakshmi, District Law Officer N.V. Santosh Kumar and Dy.SP P.P.

30 June 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Corporation may finally get a functional e-governance system||After putting up with long queues at the civic body office and an arduous wait of several years, city residents might finally be able to access online services of the Kochi Corporation a few months from now. The matter of tasking Information Kerala Mission (IKM) with the implementation of the e-governance system at the corporation will come up at the council meeting on Tuesday. “Once the council’s approval has been obtained, IKM will be approached formally. The process of setting up the new modules could take around two months. Earlier this month, existing data had been secured with a backup,” said Corporation Secretary R. Rahul. There has been pressure from the government as well to implement the software immediately, since the absence of online services at the corporation has been sorely felt in the pandemic situation. The agenda placed before the council notes that essential services such as tax payments and obtaining birth, death and marriage certificates have not yet been made available online and such a system is necessary immediately. IKM, which is already providing such services in several other local bodies in the State, would be a feasible option. “Tax collection has become difficult in the COVID-19 situation and the corporation’s financial situation is miserable,” the agenda states. Though IKM had rolled out a new open-source software — the Integrated Local Governance Management System — it could take a few more months for it to be made available to urban local bodies, said Mr. Rahul. The corporation had spent about Rs. 5 crore on a custom-made e-governance system that TCS had been roped in to implement. But some modules never got off the ground and others like the birth, death and marriage modules have been facing glitches. The services of TCS are no longer available since their contract period had ended in 2018. Legacy data Years worth of legacy data that is currently on the TCS software system will have to be transferred if the council decides on migrating to the IKM software. “Current files are processed using legacy data. So the data will have to be transferred to the IKM software. How this is to be done is a challenge because TCS support is no longer available. Without help from TCS, a complete transfer might be difficult,” said S. Chithra, Executive Director, IKM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporation-may-finally-get-a-functional-e-governance-system/article31950008.ece
30 June 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Cleaning of city canals near-complete||The second phase of Operation Breakthrough, the district administration’s effort to mitigate waterlogging, is nearing completion while some issues remain unresolved. Work on cleaning the Karanakodam, Edapally, Changadampokku canals, besides the lakefront at Thevara and Chilavannoor, has been completed. Work to ensure smooth flow of water is ongoing at the Koyithara canal. Issues related to the 994 m-long Mullassery canal, however, remain unresolved. “The bed level of a 398 m stretch of the canal seems to have been raised after work under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was taken up. Slabs were laid on the bed and over the canal and these need to be removed. After the monsoon, the depth of the canal will be increased near the KSRTC bus stand,” said Baji Chandran, Executive Engineer, Minor Irrigation Department, who is in charge of the implementation of the second phase of Operation Breakthrough. Since the Mullassery canal crosses arterial roads like Chittoor Road and MG Road, these would have to be blocked and dug up for work on the canal, he said. The work could take a few months, considering small slabs and structures have been constructed over the canal in some places, and to avoid a hassle during the rains, it has been postponed, he added. Persistent waterlogging at the KSRTC bus stand and some parts of MG Road might see some respite only after the Mullassery canal work has been taken up, said K.V.P. Krishnakumar, councillor representing Ernakulam South. Pre-monsoon cleaning work taken up by the Kochi Corporation has been progressing, but has experienced a slight setback with shortage of labour, said Mayor Soumini Jain. While contractors could earlier deploy four or five teams at a time, the return of migrant workers to their home States has meant that only a limited number of workers are available, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cleaning-of-city-canals-near-complete/article31950014.ece
30 June 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Paid quarantine’ helps hotels weather crisis||The hospitality industry in Kerala has managed to weather the COVID-19-induced crisis in the tourism sector, primarily due to the increased demand for paid quarantine from Non-Resident Keralite (NoRK) returnees and seamen. “Barring KTDC [Kerala Tourism Development Corporation] properties, most star hotels in Ernakulam district were initially reluctant to host returnees from other States and countries. Over time, most of them, including over half a dozen five-star properties, have come forward to accommodate them. Over 100 hotels in the district are hosting them as of June 29, while more are enlisting with NoRKA authorities. Similar is the situation in other districts,” said a senior official of Kerala Tourism. They have thus averted retrenchment, unpaid leave, and slashing of salaries of employees beyond a limit. While most ordinary returnees opt for seven-day quarantine, hundreds of seamen who have returned to Kerala are undergoing 14-day quarantine, mainly in luxury hotels. On their part, hotels have slashed tariff, while serving three meals (mostly from a fixed menu, since there are curbs on buffets) and tea. All these have resulted in most hotels having more than average room occupancy during what is conventionally off-peak season in Kerala. People who come to Kerala on business trips and leave within a week, and hence need no mandatory quarantine, too have begun to trickle in due to relaxation of travel curbs. The only condition is that they must keep the hotel informed about their travel history, he added. Protocols adhered to Marketing manager of State-run KTDC G.S. Rajmohan said properties at different locales in the State could meet their operational expenses, thanks to hosting people in quarantine. “All our properties, except in Thekkady and Ponmudi, remain open. Guests are comfortable since COVID-19 protocol, as directed by the Health Department, is being adhered to. They include room delivery of food and complete sanitising of rooms after guests leave. The rooms are assigned to new guests only two or three days after the earlier occupant leaves, he said. Packages Most private luxury hotels are offering alluring packages to woo guests, including substantially slashed membership fee and the option to pay heavily discounted tariff now and choose a date of stay any time within a year. “The response is picking up. From nil enquires in April and May, the situation has improved much,” said employees in a premium hotel in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paid-quarantine-helps-hotels-weather-crisis/article31950016.ece

In an affidavit, the police pointed out that seven cases were registered for violating the government order and not following the COVID-19 protocol. It added that it was dangerous to play football in the COVID-19 situation and the turfs might turn into potential sites for the spread of the virus.

The government on Monday submitted that no employee of Sprinklr had any access to COVID-related data. The submission was made when public interest litigations filed by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and BJP State president K. Surendran challenging the contract came up for hearing. The government made the submission in response to a question by the court whether the agreement with the company still remained in force. Supreme Court lawyer and cyber law expert N.S. Nappinai, who appeared for the State government, submitted that Sprinklr had no access to the system.

30 June 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Mani terms it political injustice, Joseph calls it natural justice||Terming the decision of the United Democratic Front (UDF) to keep off his faction from the coalition as political injustice, Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani here on Monday accused the UDF of rejecting the politics espoused by K.M. Mani, its founder. Addressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, Mr. Mani said the KC(M) founder leader had been the pillar that held together the coalition for 38 years. The issue was not about holding a post in the Kottayam district panchayat. Instead, asking to step down in the name of a deal that never existed was a matter of injustice. “If this action is being initiated in the name of discipline, it should have been taken against P.J. Joseph [who heads the other faction] long ago. For, he was one who put this coalition in trouble on several occasions, including the Pala byelection. We raised this matter with the UDF but the coalition has never acted to assuage our concerns,” he said. While the party always tried to resolve the factional issues through discussions within the coalition, Mr. Joseph had never cooperated with it. He had also accused the UDF of being selective by highlighting only some agreements on some occasions. To decide on the future course of action, a meeting of the KC(M) steering committee will be held in Kottayam on Tuesday. “The meeting will bring about clarity on which direction we should be heading to from here on,” Mr. Mani said. Mr. Joseph, on the other hand, observed that the UDF’s move to ‘expel’ the Mani group was in line with the principle of natural justice. “Having agreed to hand over the post after eight months, they continued to hold on for another three months. Despite repeated requests and directives from the UDF, they kept setting new conditions for handing over the post and there was no way they could be allowed to continue,” Mr. Joseph said. Regarding the Pala by election, Mr. Joseph said he had only demanded to field a candidate “who was acceptable to all.” “Having contested the election by declaring K.M. Mani as their symbol, they are now accusing me of not allotting the party symbol,” Mr. Joseph said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mani-terms-it-political-injustice-joseph-calls-it-natural-justice/article31950038.ece

At the same time, eight persons who recovered from the disease were discharged from various hospitals here. According to officials, the test results of all 325 samples received during the day were negative. Of the 216 persons from the district who have contracted the virus, as many as 173 were tested positive in the first 28 days of June. Cured The persons who recovered from the disease were a 59-year-old Panchikkadu native who returned from Abu Dhabi, a 23-year-old Mundakkayam native who returned from Chennai, a 33-year-old TV Puram native who returned from Mumbai, a 28-year-old pregnant woman who landed from Saudi Arabia, a 55-year-old Malam native who returned from Abu Dhabi, a 61-year-old Koruthodu native who contracted the virus through local contact, a 53-year-old Chirakkadavu native who returned from Mumbai, and a 33-year-old Neendoor native who landed from Saudi Arabia. Containment zone Meanwhile, ward eight of the Pallikkathodu Panchayat in Kottayam, where a cluster of positive cases emerged last week, has been declared as a containment zone. Tracing contacts The health officials have embarked on a massive exercise to trace the contacts of all persons who have been tested positive, besides the source of virus infection. The incident came to light when a 70-year-old man here tested positive ahead of a cataract surgery at a private hospital at Thellakom. Following this, his 24-year-old daughter-in-law and four other members of the family too tested positive. Following this, as many as 35 staff members, including two doctors, of the hospital were directed to go in quarantine. Further, several other primary contacts of the family too were traced and put in isolation.  Results of all 325 samples received on the day were negative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-breather-for-kottayam/article31950109.ece

Panic calls from people living in Tavanur, Kalady, Edappal, Vattamkulam, Ponnani and Kumaranallur flooded the Health Department offices in the district on Monday. Both the doctors who tested positive during sentinel surveillance in the third week of this month had roaring practice at two private hospitals at Edappal. One is a paediatrician in his 40s and the other a physician in his 50s. Both had examined hundreds of patients belonging to the most vulnerable groups — infants and the aged.  Staff in quarantine More than half of the employees at the two Edappal hospitals have gone into quarantine. A Health official from Edappal said his mobile phone battery got drained from dozens of panic calls he took on Sunday and Monday. Apart from the two doctors, two bank employees and three nurses too were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the sentinel surveillance. The government, meanwhile, responded pro-actively to the situation by deciding to set up testing facility at private hospitals in the district. Addressing a meeting, Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel said on Monday that hospitals with good laboratory facilities would be identified soon. 1,500 to be tested About 1,500 people, including ASHA workers, police personnel, health volunteers, politicians and traders, would be tested soon. Mr. Jaleel said all employees of the two private hospitals at Edappal would be subjected to COVID-19 tests. Random tests on health workers across the district, including doctors, would follow. The Minister said that efforts were on to increase the testing capacity in the district. Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan, who represents Ponnani in the Assembly, asked people to exercise extreme vigil to prevent community spread. He said facilities at the mother and child hospital at Ponnani would be augmented. Triple lockdown was imposed in all panchayats in Ponnani taluk. Essential services have been exempted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/virus-detection-in-doctors-at-edappal-triggers-panic/article31950030.ece

In a statement issued here on Monday, association State secretary Thomaskutty Thevarumuriyil and district president Anil S. Uzhathil said the association was willing to buy the sand-silt mix for use in construction works under way as part of various government projects. Mr. Thomaskutty said the association was ready to pay Rs. 70 to Rs. 100 a cubic feet of sand as it would be of great help in addressing the prevailing scarcity for river sand for construction work. Revenue source The stakeholder departments should take a joint decision in this regard as it would also be a key source of revenue generation for the government, he said. The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by District Collector P.B. Noohu, started removing the sand deposits from Pampa and surrounding areas on June 4 to avoid chances of floods. 1.23 lakh cubic metres The Irrigation Department has assessed the quantum of sand accumulated along the 2.23-km river stretch between Valiyanavattom and Pampa-Triveni at 1.23 lakh cubic metres. Earlier, in September, 2018, a team of experts from the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) had assessed the sand accumulated in Pampa as construction grade. The sand scooped out from the Pampa is being dumped on the forestland at Chakkupalam, near the KSRTC bus depot at Pampa. So far, no decision had been taken on the disposal of this sand and any further delay would lead to its washing out into the river itself once the monsoon strengthened, the association leaders said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-contractors-evince-interest-in-pampa-sand/article31950113.ece

30 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Sero surveillance survey yields ‘unexpected’ results||Even as the government is preparing to do more sero surveillance studies in the containment zones in Malappuram district, it has been tight-lipped about the results of the first round of community surveillance studies across the State using rapid antibody kits. The State launched the studies using the rapid antibody kits it had procured from HLL on June 8 and in the first round handed over 10,000 kits to all districts. The survey was to find out if there is community transmission and to determine the proportion of the population which has had prior silent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus.  ‘Unexpected’ results? An expert committee which analysed the data from the first sero surveillance study in the community has already submitted its report. Despite the huge public interest in knowing whether the virus has been silently spreading the disease in the community, the report remains under wraps. However, information trickling in from the districts put the positivity (both IgM and IgG) rates “at much higher rates than had been anticipated.” As a senior adviser to the government put it, the results thrown up by this preliminary screening tests have certainly been “unexpected.” The authorities have now pointed to the unreliability of antibody tests. “More than the high positivity it was the population groups in which this was reported that surprised us. We expected a high positivity among those who returned from abroad but that was not so in this study. We are not convinced about the results because of the inherent issues with the test kits,” a senior health official said.  Screening tests However, epidemiologists point out that the study should not be trashed because antibody tests are just screening tests and the concept of screening tests is different. Epidemiological studies use a two-step technique to study diseases of low prevalence, of which, the screening test is just the first step. It has to be followed up with detailed epidemiological investigations in the community. Strengths, weaknesses “We chose to do the study with the antibody kits knowing fully well its strengths and weaknesses. In low prevalence disease settings, such a kit will throw up a lot of false positives. But it is possible to interpret the results epidemiologically and estimate false positivity and identify areas where we have to do focussed interventions,” a public health expert said. One could test among the family members of those who were IgG positive to see how far an asymptomatic person can spread the disease. Or the IgG positive samples could be re-tested with ICMR-approved ELISA kits. It might also be possible to get a realistic estimation of R0 (R nought) in Kerala using the sero survey results and factoring in the sensitivity and specificity of the test kit. The government should give out the survey results to Community Medicine departments in medical colleges to interpret the data from an epidemiological perspective.  Positivity rates are at much higher rates than anticipated, say Health officials||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sero-surveillance-survey-yields-unexpected-results/article31950033.ece

The district administration also began to act tough on commercial establishments that were found to violate physical distancing norms and other guidelines. The patients include a 41-year old Thoothukudi native and a 33-year old Tirunelveli native who came on a flight from Qatar on June 26, a 38-year old Nagapattinam native who came from Kuwait on June 26, and a 60-year old man, who hails from Nagaroor and returned from Muscat on June 25. While the three Tamil Nadu natives have been admitted to the COVID-19 first-line treatment centre in the Government Homeopathic Medical College, Iranimuttom, the other patient has been shifted to the Government MCH. Outlets closed Meanwhile, the City police and Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have begun to rein in outlets that were found to violate government guidelines. Thirteen shops were temporarily closed down after they failed to implement social distancing norms and thermal screening of customers. Following an inspection by Mayor K. Sreekumar, the Corporation closed down a garment textile and supermarket complex at the Ayurveda College junction that failed to ensure adequate measures despite being cautioned a day ago. Mr. Sreekumar also inspected the Peroorkada and Kumarichantha markets to ensure the protocol set by the local body to reduce crowding by halving the number of shops that operated were being complied with. While 107 people were booked for violating lockdown norms, the police also registered petty cases against 297 people for failing to wear masks outdoor. The police also initiated legal action against 15 motorists who were found to have violated the night curfew between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Sunday night. The Thiruvananthapuram Rural police have stepped up surveillance in coastal areas including Pozhiyoor and places close to the inter-State border on account of the spike in COVID-19 cases in Kanyakumari district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-positive-cases-in-capital/article31950054.ece

Shiyas, 35, of Chirakkal sustained serious injuries after he was allegedly hacked by Shaji, 37, of Chirakkal in the clash that took place around 9.30 p.m. on Sunday. The incident is believed to be part of an ongoing feud among the gangs led by the duo in the region. Following the incident, Shiyas was admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital, while Shaji, who also sustained minor injuries, was hospitalised in the Chirayinkeezhu taluk hospital. Soon after the clash, a car that belonged to Shaji’s associate Shine and was parked on the former’s house compound was set ablaze by unidentified persons. Based on two complaints submitted by the gangs, the police recorded the arrests of Shaji, his associates Shine, Kumar, Ajayan, and Shiyas and his friend Kochi Shaji, all hailing from the same locality. According to Attingal Dy.SP. S.Y.

The coastal areas, till now, have not had a proper institutional quarantine facility, with the closest to the coast being a facility in the Attipra ward. On Monday, the Beema Maheen Hospital near Beemapally was turned into an institutional quarantine facility with around 30 rooms. The hospital building, which had remained closed for sometime, was cleaned up and re-painted for the purpose. Another building in Kazhakuttam is also being prepared to be a quarantine centre. In Kunjalumoodu, the Chelsa hospital building, which had also remained closed, is being readied for quarantining purposes. All these buildings are expected to be ready within two days. The city Corporation authorities have over the past few weeks been receiving requests from people’s representatives in the coastal areas on the need for more institutional quarantine centres in these regions. “A lot of people are returning from abroad in these areas. Many houses do not have enough space for home quarantine, or rooms with bath-attached facilities. The coastal ward councillors have been requesting for the opening of institutional quarantine centres due to this. ,” said an official of the city Corporation’s health wing. Fluctuated The number of people lodged in the city’s institutional quarantine centres, now numbering to 43, has fluctuated since the beginning. While the numbers had gone up to more than 700 at one point, it later came down to less than half of that when the option for home quarantine was announced. But with increase in arrivals from abroad in recent weeks, the numbers have gone up again, to match those in the initial days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/more-quarantine-centres-coming-up-in-coastal-areas/article31950055.ece

30 June 2020||Thrissur,KERALA||Engineering students develop robot for patient care||Students of IES College of Engineering, Chittilappily, have developed a robot which can assist doctors and medical staff in patient care. The robotic nurse, Azimo Altra Robo, developed by a team of eight second year Electrical and Electronics Engineering students, can minimize the contact with the patients, which will reduce risk of medical professionals at the time of pandemics like COVID-19. It can be remotely controlled by the doctor or an operator. The robot in hospitals helps to reduce human contact with patients having contagious diseases. It can perform simple tasks like taking vital signs such as heartbeat, blood pressure and Electro Cardio Graph (ECG) and report them to the physician concerned. So the doctor can keep a real-time tab on the patient. The doctor can also have a video session with the patient concerning any doubts, explained the students. The robot can deliver medicines too. Thus it makes medical procedures safer and less costly for patients. Such robots can be used at the time of emergency scenario, when there is a dire need of efficient nurses in the field. It has a self-dispensing sanitizer, they added. The students – Sreejesh Raveendran, Arjun Nandakumar, K.V. Fazil, Akhil Johny, Mohammed Althaf, Mohammed Iqbal, Belgin Benny, and A.G. Abijith – planned the robot as part of their final-year project. But considering the pandemic emergency situation, they developed it and gave it to the Government Medical College Hospital, Thrissur. The robot may also be used in other fields like the chemical industry to minimize the human contact with toxic chemicals and hazardous materials. The AZIMA Altra Robo was developed at a cost of Rs. 60,000 with the support of college authorities. The students have dedicated their invention to Lini Puthussery, the ‘hero’ nurse who sacrificed her life during the Nipah prevention mission. It was handed over to the Medical College Principal, M.A. Andrews.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/engineering-students-develop-robot-for-patient-care/article31949998.ece

The 29-year-old arrived from Thane by train on June 22 and was sent home with quarantine advisory. On reaching his rented house at Pattalam in Fort Kochi, he found it closed. He allegedly had a run-in with the houseowner, who has been sent into quarantine now. He then withdrew money from a Canara Bank branch in Fort Kochi, and had a haircut from a barber shop at Mattancherry, followed by a shower in a public toilet across the Dutch Palace in Mattancherry. Both the facilities and the shop from where he bought a soap now remain closed. “We have sent the barber and the first customer to use the facility after him into quarantine while the successive customers are being tracked,” said Mattancherry police sources. The staff at Canara Bank have also been quarantined. The man is then learnt to have contacted an autorickshaw driver, his acquaintance from Palluruthy. They bought liquor from an outlet at Thoppumpady, and consumed it inside the autorickshaw. The driver is now in quarantine. ‘Created ruckus’ Later, the man reportedly returned to Pattalam area and created a ruckus, following which the public alerted Fort Kochi police. “We received the call around 9 p.m. and when we reached he was in an intoxicated state and in no mood to cooperate. So, I had to overpower him,” said the sub inspector, who went into quarantine after the incident. A driver and two other police personnel have also been sent into quarantine though they had no direct contact with the man. There was some delay in the arrival of an ambulance and the man was placed in institutional quarantine at Edakochi around 11.30 p.m. The police registered a case against him invoking the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance. The swab test of the sub inspector has not yet been conducted as he is yet to show symptoms of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/concern-as-man-who-violated-quarantine-norms-tests-positive/article31950011.ece

30 June 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||172 repatriated Discom employees relieved||The Southern Power Distribution Company Limited of Andhra Pradesh (APSPDCL) has relieved 172 of its engineering employees from Kurnool and Anantapur districts for repatriation to Northern Power Distribution Company Limited of Telangana (TSNPDCL) with headquarters in Warangal. This would have some impact on the maintenance and operation of the distribution system, said relieved Executive Engineers Sampath Kumar, Chandramohan, and Nagendra. At a media conference here on Monday, they demanded immediate restoration of their posts and alleged that in place of 69 engineering staff members repatriated from Telangana NPDCL to APEPDCL, equal number were not sent from the latter and only 10 of them were sent and the rest 59 were sent from Kurnool and Anantapur districts without their consent. While 113 of the employees were repatriated earlier, 59 of them got their relieving orders on Saturday night. The operation and maintenance work in both the districts has become a Herculean task for the SPDCL. D.S. Varakumar, Superintending Engineer of the SPDCL, Anantapur, told The Hindu that they were managing the show with difficulty till new persons were brought in those places. Each Executive Engineer, who is supposed to look after one section, was being burdened with two additional ones. Currently the number of vacant posts in Anantapur district are four EEs, 20 DEEs, 45 AEEs, one Senior Accounts Officer, four Assistant Accounts Officers and one personnel officer. “Unless the dispute over the repatriation of employees between the two States is settled, the situation is likely to be like this,” said Mr. Varakumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/172-repatriated-discom-employees-relieved/article31950142.ece

Taking out a rally from the party office to Revenue Divisional Office(RDO) here, Dr. Sailajanath said that at a time when the international crude oil prices were very low, the Union government was increasing the domestic petrol and diesel prices to fleece the public. The fuel prices in India were one of the highest in the world and should be brought down to match the international crude prices, Dr. Sailajanath opined. He termed the criticism of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as political opportunism to say that Andhra Pradesh showed no development in the past six years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apcc-chief-seeks-rollback-of-fuel-prices/article31950141.ece
30 June 2020||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sale of Chinese goods takes a hit in the City of Destiny||The war-like situation at the Indo-China border has impacted the sale of Chinese goods such as toys, electronic items and electrical goods in the market. Traders in the city, attribute it to the strong sentiment among the general public against Chinese products. Social media posts Posts by netizens are flooding social media asking Indians to stop buying Chinese products to cripple its economy. They say that China earns crores of rupees through apps such as Zoom, Tik Tok and Shareit that have become increasingly popular in India. Consumers should preferably use Indian products or those of any other country except China, they say. “We have already deleted Chinese apps, now it is your turn to show your patriotism and to avenge the killing of our jawans,” the social media posts say. Most of the traders justify the public mood, but some wonder whether the Government of India can ensure assured supply of similar products of Indian-make or from other countries at same prices. They opine that the high taxation in India places these products out of the reach of the common man. ‘Hostile moves’ “A simple thing like a door sensor, which is made available at as low as Rs. 30 by Chinese manufacturers, is sold at 10 to 20 times that cost by Indian manufacturers. But, for the Chinese electronic toys like battery-operated cars and bikes, the lower middle class children would have been deprived of enjoying these simple toys,” a trader dealing in Chinese goods told The Hindu on condition of anonymity. “No country, including China, can afford to go for war at this juncture in view of the economic crisis due to COVID-19. China fears transfer of investments to India as the US and most of the European countries have turned against it accusing it of mishandling the pandemic. China has befriended our neighbours such as Sri Lanka and Nepal to hold out threats to India from all sides. The public outrage and Indian citizens boycotting Chinese goods will send a strong message to the Chinese government,” avers V. Sreemannarayana Murthy, an assistant professor in the Centre for SAARC Studies, Andhra University.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sale-of-chinese-goods-takes-a-hit-in-the-city-of-destiny/article31950180.ece
30 June 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tally in Chittoor nearing 1,400-mark||With COVID-19 positive cases increase manifold in June, the number of red zones is on the rise all over Chittoor district, which is inching towards the 1,400-mark, with the outbreak of 50 new cases by Monday afternoon. The district had so far reported six deaths. The spread, which remained confined to Srikalahasti, Tirupati and Nagari Assembly Constituencies in April, has now spared just two of the 66 mandals. On Sunday, the remote Tamballapalle mandal, which remained untouched by the virus, recorded new cases. Special teams Nine new cases were reported in the industrial belt of Sri City spread over Satyavedu and Varadaiahpalem mandals, in addition to the 33 cases last week. In Chittoor municipal corporation limits, five new cases emerged on Monday, taking the number of active red zones to 35, in addition to 20 more in the surrounding mandals. Poor response “After strict surveillance, we are able to remove five red zones under the corporation limits. With steady increase in the cases, the red zones are also mounting in the corporation. Special teams are being formed to monitor public movement in the areas,” Deputy SP (Chittoor) K. Eeshwar Reddy said. Madanapalle police sub-division has 28 active red zones, a majority of which were formed in June alone. Deputy SP A. Ravi Manohar Achari said that the virus had spread fast all over Madanapalle region. “Despite police surveillance, there is poor response from the public to COVID-19 guidelines. In view of public safety, we are enforcing the guidelines to a large extent,” Mr. Achari said. While the virus is raging in the eastern and parts of western mandals, Palamaner sub-division could see some respite in the cases in June. V. Kota mandal, which witnessed close to 50 cases in May and April, all linked to Koyambedu market, is now “comfortable” with just a couple of active cases. Kuppam which remained COVID-19 free till the second week of June, now has 10 active cases. Despite growing number of cases in Puttur sub-division, with 62 red zones, and over 200 cases, observance of the COVID-19 guidelines in Puttur, Nagalapuram, Satyavedu, Nagari and Karveti Nagaram is considerably disappointing, particularly the social distance norm at public places. Crowding at shops Meat shops continue to lure a large number of people, hardly following the guidelines. Deputy SP D. Muraliddhar said police teams had been posted at all vital junctions in the sub-division from Satyavedu to S.R. Puram to enforce the mask rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tally-in-chittoor-nearing-1400-mark/article31950145.ece

30 June 2020||G. Venkataramana RaoVijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Experts debate outcomes of Krishna, Godavari board meets||Retired Engineers of Andhra Pradesh who have been closely watching the developments in the irrigation sector after bifurcation have expressed concerns over many issues discussed during the meetings of the management boards of the Krishna and the Godavari held on June 4 and 5 respectively. Even as the a spectrum of old contentious topics were discussed threadbare, several new issues also surfaced on which the retired engineers have reservations. Members representing Telangana made use of this forums to reiterate that denial of the rightful amount of water to the Telangana regions was the main reason behind the State bifurcation. During the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) meeting, little or no objection was raised to the 50:50 sharing of the water for power generation during 2019-21. The proposal made by the KRMB was supported by Telangana while the A.P. representatives remained mute spectators. According to the data presented, A.P. generated more power than Telangana during 2015-16 and 2016-17 fiscals, while Telangana surpassed A.P. during 2014-15, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 fiscals. The main issue, according to the retired engineers, was that the left side power house was just a pumping storage scheme, and it should not be treated on par with the “regular power generation” unit on the right side (A.P.). Peak-hour usage Only Telangana had the facility to generate power during the peak hours and pump up the used water from the tail pond to the main reservoir during non-peak hours. There was no logic in the State claiming 50% of the water in the reservoir for power generation, the engineers pointed out. The KRMB chairman said that the power generation was incidental and that drawing of water for irrigation and drinking purposes was primary. The two States should also keep in view the requirements of the Nagarjuna Sagar Project. Tribunal award During the Godavari board meeting, the engineers wondered how Telangana came up with the figure of 967.14 tmcft as its quota as it was never mentioned in the Godavari River Tribunal Award. They said that Telangana had arrived at the figure by calculating the requirement of the projects it was planning. “This is not the way river water is shared. The Central Water Commission (CWC) has approved the Polavaram Project and no water would trickle down to the dam in a lean year. The AP representatives should be wary of the aggressive stance of Telangana,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/experts-debate-outcomes-of-krishna-godavari-board-meets/article31950173.ece
30 June 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Accused in molestation case will not be spared’||The State government will ensure that those accused of molesting and blackmailing an engineering student will be punished under stringent provisions of Disha Act 2019, said Chairperson of Andhra Pradesh Mahila Commission Vasireddy Padma. The prime accused in the case is the son of a senior police officer. Ms. Padma, who reviewed the investigation of the case, said that two persons had been named in the FIR filed on June 27 at the Disha Police Station in Guntur. The victim, a student of a private engineering college, lodged a complaint on June 20, and after a week into investigation, the police stumbled upon a crucial piece of evidence. “We found that some of the videos of the victim had appeared on some websites and social media handles and it is shocking to note that students well versed in technology are using their skills to do such things. We will take stringent action against such people,’’ Ms. Padma told mediapersons after reviewing the case at the Disha Police Station here on Monday. “Further, the police are investigating into reports that two more persons were involved in uploading the videos on some websites,” said Ms. Padma. The episode came to light after the victim lodged a police complaint with the help of her relatives. The victim, then a first year student of engineering, was allegedly lured into a relationship by the prime accused. The accused then allegedly shot videos of her and reportedly began to blackmail her. The abuse did not end even after she ended her relationship with him. He then allegedly passed on the videos to the victim’s friend. Unable to bear the harassment, the victim decided to lodge a police complaint. Disha Act Superintendent of Police, Guntur Urban, R.N Ammi Reddy said the investigation into this case was continuing and the police were gathering more evidence. Cases under POCSO Act, Disha Act had been registered against the accused, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/accused-in-molestation-case-will-not-be-spared/article31950166.ece

Anil Kumar Yadav on Monday said the TDP’s claim of completion of 70% work on the Polavaram irrigation project during its rule was false as barely 20 % of work was completed. Speaking to newsmen at the rehabilitation colony here, Mr. Anil Kumar said: “Mere Rs. 17,000 crore was spent on the project during TDP rule, and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement issues were largely ignored, leaving the 1.5 lakh oustees to their fate.” First priority “The project can be said to have been completed only after the affected families’ concerns are addressed, for which a whopping Rs. 33,000 crore is earmarked. The Vigilance wing, which is looking into the irregularities in the execution of works, is yet to come out with its report. The State government has been able to save Rs. 800 crore through reverse tendering,” he said. All the 17,000 families which are living in areas falling in the 41.5 contour of the project would be shifted to the rehabilitation colonies by early August to protect them from flood fury. The immediate priority is to shift 4,000 families to the four colonies by July-end to avoid any loss,” the Minister said. Accompanied by Polavaram Special officer O. Anand, Mr. Anil Kumar inspected the progress of construction at the rehabilitation colonies at Kamalapalem, Pothavaram-2, Musallakunta in Devipatnam mandal and Krishnunipalem in Gokavaram mandal of East Godavari district. “The migrant workers deployed at the Polavaram project and rehabilitation work sites have returned after the lockdown was lifted. However, only half of the work is being done,” he said. Rehabilitation and Resettlement Commissioner T.

30 June 2020||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cement company’s gesture to villagers||The JSW Cement constructed a new Balaji temple using black limestone at Nandyal and revived the water source for the local community’s agriculture needs at Bilakalaguduru village near Nandyal. The temple, constructed in an area of 2.5 acres, is part of the corporate social responsibility(CSR) initiative of the JSW. The architecture of the temple, comprising the idols of Balaji and Varahaswamy, is modelled after the Tirumala shrine. The idols are in the form of black limestone ziggurats. According to Anushree Jindal, who led the project, the area where this temple is constructed has a natural canal which has gone completely dry, so it was designed with a view to revitalise the canal and bring its water back for the benefit of the locals. Architect Sameep Padora said: “The idea was to address the socio-cultural expectations of people surrounding it, while developing an ecological framework to rejuvenate the ground water source.” The dry low-lying area around the temple was consolidated into a water retention pond, by redirecting water overflow from a nearby limestone quarry. The banks of the pond were formed into steps of a ghat. The JSW had earlier restored the Chandramouleshwara and Krishna temples in Hampi, Keneseth Eliyahoo Synagogue in Mumbai, and established Kaladham Art Village in Bellary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cement-companys-gesture-to-villagers/article31950143.ece

However, his eagerness to restrict further damage by turning off the valve that was delivering the gas from the pressurised storage chamber to the coolant pipelines, led to his death as ammonia cloud had engulfed him by then, said Chittoor Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories M.V. Siva Kumar Reddy. The plant management agreed to pay a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to Srinivasa Rao’s wife Sri Lakshmi and the first instalment of Rs. 38 lakh was paid on Sunday. A team of Fire Department, Inspector of Factories and SPY Agros employees battled for four hours to plug the leak . Safety lapse According to the officials, a wrong specification of welding rod was used for the pipeline the previous night, which resulted in the giving away of the weld joint when the cooling plant was started, for which high-pressure ammonia is utilised as coolant. Two tonnes of ammonia was said to be stored in the tank, but proper permissions were not there from the Controller of Explosives, they said. These lapses were being probed by a team which will submit its report on June 30 (Tuesday). Mr. Siva Kumar Reddy, who happened to be in Nandyal, his hometown, on that day, sought the permission of Collector G. Veerapandian to join the leak plugging and rescue operations. The leak happened at 9.45 a.m. and Mr. Siva Kumar Reddy identified the source . A plan was made to climb the slippery staircase close to the tank after the cloud was doused with the help of fire engines. The operation was completed by 2.30 p.m., and the ammonia dissolved in water was pumped out. The factory did not have emergency vents on the ridge roof. There was no emergency exit either, he said. The Collector on Monday presented certificates of appreciation to those who worked to plug the leak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plant-manager-put-duty-above-self-during-ammonia-gas-leak/article31950170.ece

Santosh Babu, who sacrificed his life for the country. He was a native of Suryapet in Telangana State. Colonel Santosh was one among the 20 Indian soldiers, who died in the clashes with Chinese troops in the Galwan area at Ladakh on June 15. The martyr, Santosh, completed his schooling in a Sainik school, in Vizianagaram. Later, he joined the premier National Defence Academy (NDA) in Pune and the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun. Santosh was commissioned into the 16th Bihar regiment in 2004 and was posted in Jammu for the first time. Later, he had served in the borders at various locations and laid down his life for the country in the violent clashes with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Galwan Valley. Other slain soldiers The 19 other soldiers were from Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and other States.

30 June 2020||Santosh Patnaik,ANDHRA PRADESH||Consumption of edible oils goes up, thanks to the new normal||Domestic consumption of edible oil has gone up notwithstanding the impact of lockdown imposed to contain spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and compulsion to switch to work-from-home by many employers. Also, major social functions such as marriages have come to a halt, hitting the functioning of hotel and its associated sectors. Sources in the industry told The Hindu that 60% of oil is consumed for domestic purpose during normal days and the rest by consumption by hotels and other commercial firms, including bread and biscuit-makers. While the average per capita consumption is 16 kg, 21 million tonnes is the requirement of which 16 million tonnes is imported due to short-supply in the country. Soya bean oil is imported from Brazil and Argentina, sunflower is sourced from Russia and Ukraine and palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. Work-from-home and the preference for stay at home during the lockdown have led to increase in domestic consumption by 20% compensating to a large extent the loss suffered due to closure of hotels and catering services, according to a conservative estimate. Edible oil is an essential commodity the supply of which cannot be disrupted. With the unlocking in phases, there is a slight increase in demand from the HoReCa (hotel, restaurant and café) segment. Business cycle “We noticed a slight increase in demand for palm oil and larger packs, nothing significant. Not too many people are visiting restaurants, so we are not sure how long will it sustain. The domestic household demand is still maintained and we are witnessing a 10% increase in demand from this segment,” says P. Chandrashekhara Reddy, vice-president, sales & marketing, Freedom Healthy Cooking Oils (Gemini Edibles & Fats India Pvt. Ltd.). On the impact of the lockdown, he said their business cycle involved three essential steps: import/sourcing, refining, packing and shipping. “As we mostly rely on imported edible oils for refining, we are sourcing sunflower oil from Russia and Ukraine, palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. Our plants at Kakinada and Krishnapatnam are able to meet 50% of the demand of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/consumption-of-edible-oils-goes-up-thanks-to-the-new-normal/article31950182.ece

Accusing the Centre of cheating people, he said: “The Modi government is profiteering from the misery of the people by repeated increase in prices as also excise duty on petrol and diesel.” In Tirupati, PCC General Secretary D.

30 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID-19 cases among bank staff a cause for concern||More than 15 bank employees contracted coronavirus in the city during the last week raising concerns among the fraternity. According to information, the employees working in Satyanarayanapuram, One Town, Bandar Road, VMC and Gannavaram branches of a PSU bank tested positive. An employee of another PSU bank on Mahanadu Road, some staff members at Labbipet, Vidyadarapuram and Ramireddypalli branches besides some private bank staff were among the infected, banking sources say. Among them were cases of couples working in different branches or banks. A woman staffer of a bank branch at Gollapudi and her husband working in another branch in the city tested positive five days ago. Another couple, working in Vidyadharapuram and One Town branches of a bank also contracted the virus. While the woman was symptomatic, her husband was asymptomatic. They were suggested to go for home quarantine. “It is surprising that they were allowed to go to Hyderabad as they pleaded that it was their native place,” sources say. Their colleagues in both branches are worried now. Though employees are using masks, gloves and sanitisers, on an average, 500 people visit each bank branch every day and so, the risk always exists. Anybody visiting the bank could be an untested carrier of coronavirus, says an employee. Rural branches The employees working in branches, particularly rural branches, complain that they were not provided adequate facilities though they were asked to work in containment zones also. “There are no thermal scanners in our branch nor a security guard to control the visitors. Due to lack of space, it is very difficult to maintain physical distance.” laments a bank employee, who did not want to be quoted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-19-cases-among-bank-staff-a-cause-for-concern/article31949668.ece

Kala Venkat Rao has demanded that Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy must order an inquiry to the allegations. “ The YSRCP leaders have collected Rs. 1,400 crore as commission from the farmers who have parted with their land for the housing scheme. Another Rs. 200 crore have been collected from the poor with a promise that house sites would be allotted to them,” a statement quoted Mr. Kala Venkat Rao as saying on Monday. He alleged irregularities while fixing the price of land. “The YSRC leaders purchased land from farmers just a few months ago with an intention of giving the same for the housing programme. The government purchased the same land from the YSRC leaders by paying four times of the regular price. The government paid somewhere between Rs. 45 lakh and Rs. 75 lakh per acre for the land worth Rs. 5 lakh or less. These higher rates were paid to the land owned by YSRCP leaders. In Penamaluru, Rs. 75 lakh was paid for the land worth Rs. 40 lakh per acre,” alleged Mr. Kala Venkat Rao. Mr. Rao said the place of allotment of house site depended on the amount of bribe paid. “If the bribe is Rs. 10,000, the beneficiary would get a land in uninhabitable locations . Those who gave more than than Rs. 1 lakh as bribe got the land near their village,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/house-site-scheme-steeped-in-corruption/article31950174.ece

They claimed that the passports of the South Koreans were confiscated due to their importance in the ongoing investigation in the styrene monomer vapour leak from a storage tank in LG Polymers plant at RR Venkatapuram in Visakhapatnam on May 7, killing 12 persons and making hundreds sick. Mr. Jagdish Patel of ANROEV said once the LG Chem personnel left India, they would not return, as has happened in the Bhopal tragedy and other cases. The Korean personnel left India following a critical report by the National Green Tribunal and just before an investigative report emerged from the Andhra Pradesh government, ANROEV members said. The flagship company, LG Chem, had sent the Korean team to Vizag in mid-May to investigate the cause of the styrene leak and support, ‘responsible rehabilitation’. Absolute liability Members of ANROEV claimed that absolute liability should be applied to both LG Chem and LG Polymers, including accountability for deaths, injuries, crop damage and environmental pollution. Long-term health surveillance and support should be provided to the community at the expense of the company.

30 June 2020||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nadu-Nedu scheme may deal a blow to pvt. schools||The State government’s initiative to transform schools under the Nadu-Nedu scheme is expected to deal a big blow to private schools, particularly small and medium range institutions located in towns and semi-urban areas. Many schools are in financial crisis as most parents had not cleared their fee dues in March and April. With the beginning of lockdown on March 24, the schools could not conduct final examinations. Normally, parents will be asked to clear dues before the beginning of annual exams. But this time, the parents have been unable to do so. “With the introduction of Amma Vodi scheme, many parents opted for government schools for their children in the 2019-20 academic year, leading to a huge drop in admissions. Now the situation will be worse as all government schools will get a modern look. Many parents who don’t have money following the lockdown will naturally send their children to government schools,” said a correspondent of a private school in Vizianagaram district. According to him, many private schools will be closed if they are unable to get at least 50% admissions this year. Rent, electricity bills and salaries of teachers cannot be met if the private schools are not assured with adequate admissions. Infrastructure Under Nadu-Nedu programme, the government has been improving infrastructure in 1,145 schools in Vizianagaram district and 1,114 schools in Srikakulam district. The government is spending more than Rs. 100 crore in each district for the prestigious programme aimed at ensuring education in government schools on a par with the standards of corporate schools. Renovation of all buildings, construction of compound walls, well maintained bathrooms, modern black boards, water facility, greenery, clean environment and others will be ensured. Although there are no classes for students till August 3, teachers have been directed to monitor Nadu-Nedu works on a day-to-day basis. Zinnam Zilla Parishad High School (Gajapathinagaram mandal-Vizianagaram district) Head Master V. Adinarayana told The Hindu that many parents were approaching him for admissions with the implementation of Nadu-Nedu programme. “Fortunately, our school strength goes up every year. The strength has gone up to 450 from 300 in the last couple of years. Supply of school bags, shoes, ties and other facilities will make more parents to send their children to government schools. The teachers will also rise to the occasion and improve their teaching skills to gain the confidence of more number of parents,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nadu-nedu-scheme-may-deal-a-blow-to-pvt-schools/article31950184.ece

30 June 2020||ADILABAD,TELANGANA||Efforts of foresters show results at Sarasala||The board announcing the salient features of the plantation being raised at Kotha Sarasala village limits in Kagaznagar forest range division does impress visitors. It, however, does not give any clue to the kind of ‘struggle’ that the Forest department had undertaken exactly one year back in order to raise the plantation. June 30 marks completion of one year of the physical attack that the forest officials led by braveheart Kagaznagar Forest Range Officer Chole Anitha came under when they tried to plant saplings in the 20 hectare degraded forest land in compartments 133 and 136 of Raspalli beat and Reserve Forest Block in Kadamba extension. The incident had evoked revulsion across the country at that time. The plantation in question was raised as compensatory afforestation for forest land that was submerged under the Kaleshwaram project. The land is situated close to spots which are being visited by migrant tigers and once the trees mature it will convert itself into an excellent forest which will support wildlife and local biodiversity.  Good growth The plantation is being given special attention also because it is close to the heart of none other than Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao as it compensates forest lost in construction of his pet Kaleshwaram project. The one year saw sincere efforts by the Forest Department which has resulted in good growth rate of the plants. There are some 10 varieties of plants that have been planted in the 20 hectare plot and the total number of plants are 22,220 in 3m X 3m spacing. The varieties include neem, figs, bombax, bamboo and banyan, among others. “If violence ruled this place one year back, the plantation has erased all evidence of it. Peace will continue ruling this place even as the trees mature over the period of time,” observed a forest officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/efforts-of-foresters-show-results-at-sarasala/article31949964.ece

30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC dismisses PIL pleas against new Secretariat building||Observing that there was ‘no legal infirmity’ in Telangana State Cabinet’s decision to construct a new Secretariat building, Telangana High Court on Monday dismissed a batch of PIL petitions which challenged the decision. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, pronouncing the judgement in the petitions which were heard at length earlier, said the court would not intend to interfere in the Cabinet’s decision. Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy and Telangana Democratic Forum convenor P.L. Vishweshwar Rao moved the HC in 2019 by filing PIL petitions questioning Telangana Cabinet’s decision to go for a new Secretariat building. Already, two more PIL pleas seeking to declare the State government’s proposal to demolish the existing Secretariat buildings and construct new one as illegal were filed in 2016. Taking up the hearing of the 2019 PIL pleas, the HC directed the Registry to tag the older ones as well and heard all the petitions together. During the hearing, counsels for the petitioners contended that there was no need for the government to go for a new Secretariat building when the existing one had all the facilities. Post bifurcation They argued the Secretariat building was used for the united Andhra Pradesh State. After bifurcation, the AP government shifted its Secretariat to Amaravathi, resulting in ample availability of additional space for Telangana government. Advocate-General B.S. Prasad, on the other hand, contended that the existing Secretariat building was old and required lot of repairs and renovations to make it useful for the modern-day working conditions. Instead of spending money on repairs, the government decided to go for a new Secretariat building. While the hearing was in progress, the State government decided in June, 2019 to vacate all the blocks and offices in Secretariat building to different new premises scattered in different parts of the city. While the main Secretariat complex was shifted to nearby BRKR Bhavan, other offices of the ministers and offices were relocated to different buildings. Clarifications sought Meanwhile, the bench headed by the CJ sought some specific clarifications from the government about the proposed new Secretariat building. Details like the proposed complete construction area, design of the new Secretariat and estimated cost of complex were sought by the HC. A petitioner’s counsel told the court that the government itself was not sure about the complete information of the Secretariat building it wanted to demolish and build a new one. Only after the decision to build a new Secretariat was questioned, the government constituted a committee of experts justifying the decision to demolish the old building. The AG cited several Supreme Court verdicts which stated that policy decisions of the government cannot be questioned. After hearing the arguments consecutively for five days in March, the bench reserved the orders on March 6 and delivered the verdict on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-dismisses-pil-pleas-against-new-secretariat-building/article31949971.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Central team asks govt. to focus on containment measures||The Central team headed by Union Health Ministry’s joint secretary Lav Agarwal has advised the State government to focus on containment measures for checking the spread of COVID-19 in the State. The advice assumes significance in the light of a steep increase in cases over the past few weeks since the lifting of lockdown. The Central team suggested that the government increase testing capacity, tracing and clinical management in the State, and also be ready with an action plan for the next two months as there is a likelihood of further rise in the number of cases. The team members held detailed discussions with senior officials of the Telangana government headed by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar after concluding their field visit on Monday. Express satisafaction The team, which visited the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences, Gandhi Hospital and Dhobigalli (a containment area in Domalguda) took stock of the ground situation. The team briefed the officials about its field experience and expressed satisfaction over the hospital management in the State. The Health department made a detailed power-point presentation on the steps taken for COVID-19 management in the State. The presentation encompassed surveillance and containment measures, hospital preparedness, procurement of protection equipment, preventive measures and other aspects. The team was told that the State presently has a capacity of 17,081 beds and adequate additional staff had been recruited to strengthen treatment.

30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID victims denied dignity in death||COVID-19 dead are being denied opportunity for decent cremation in the city, owing to stiff and vociferous resistance by people residing in the neighbourhood of cremation grounds. While getting space in hospitals is becoming increasingly difficult as the cases are spiralling by the day, final journeys of the departed too are riddled with problems. Police and other officials entrusted with the duty of disposing of the bodies of COVID-19 victims are facing toughest time of their life, finding places for cremation. “It’s like dance of death. Every day, we are having to find places for at least 20 dead bodies, including positives and suspects. Pyres are burning 24x7 at the sole location where we have somehow managed to find place,” shared an official under the condition of anonymity. Located in the north-western part of the city, the location has four slots for COVID-19 funeral pyres, used one after the other as dead bodies stream in through the day and also night. After one body is completely burnt, there would be hardly any time to clear the place for next body. In the meantime pyres are arranged in the second slot for the next body, and the process goes on. “We are appalled at the cruelty with which the dead are being denied space. Local people gang up and protest against cremation even as relatives of the dead person wail their heart out,” revealed an official. Though the GHMC maintains the city’s grave yards and cremation grounds, they are mostly in the hands of the societies formed by local communities, he said. “We are ensuring that all those carrying the body are dressed in PPE. However, the attire is a give away, due to which people are able to recognise the COVID-19 bodies,” a senior official informed. Strangely, the resistance is not as much at the Muslim grave yards, as the corporators and other leaders are taking the lead in facilitating the burials. The only request they make is for burial in the night so as not to face any dissent. However, this is not possible in the cremation grounds, as funerals are not performed during night as per the Hindu customs, the official says. However, at the location where they are burning the dead, cremation is performed even during night. According to an account posted on Twitter, by a user with the handle @rjsaulakh, his friend’s mother who died of COVID-19, was one among the seven bodies which burnt simultaneously at the grounds. “... Only shoulder available to him was me, no last rights, body put on cremation along with 7 other bodies which were burning nearby, much more grim situation to carry the dead body from hospital to cremation [sic],” he tweeted, with a picture of the situation. Officials informed that they found another cremation ground in the south-eastern part of the city too recently, which may ease the situation. Further, they hope that people would relent as the number of the dead increases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-victims-denied-dignity-in-death/article31949953.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Not all COVID-19 patients need hospitalisation’||More than the people who are detected with COVID-19, people who have some symptoms of the infectious disease but did not get tested yet are fearing their fate if beds are not available at hospitals. Telangana government Health officials stressed that enough COVID beds are available at government hospitals. They and corporate hospitals heads have stressed multiple times that not all COVID-19 patients need hospitalisation. Those with COVID-19 and without any symptoms are suggested isolation at home. This helps reserve beds for critically ill patients who need oxygen support and other medical interventions. While the corporate hospitals are offering treatment packages for patients isolated at home, the State government is offering tele-consultation, follow-up treatment for those isolated at home. If someone does not have a separate room or bathroom at home, a healthy family member to take care taker at home, they are provided isolation at government health facilities in Hyderabad. Some patients who are asymptomatic did not wanted to be isolated at home and sought admission in private hospitals. A few corporate hospitals are offering isolation at some hotels in and around the city with constant monitoring of health. The home isolation packages for COVID-19 asymptomatic patients are offered by CARE Hospitals, KIMS Hospitals, Yashoda Hospitals, Apollo Home Care, Continental Hospital and others. The resources or services provided as part of the package includes pulse oximeter, thermometer, video or tele-consultation by doctors. The services and charges vary from one hospital to another. Heads of corporate hospitals said that charges for the home isolation costs one-fourth of bill charged for admission at the hospitals.  Government hospitals When a person goes to a government lab or hospital to give samples for coronavirus tests, health condition of the suspects is clinically assessed. Senior officials from the State Health Department said that those detected with COVID-19, but who are asymptomatic (no respiratory distress), are suggested home isolation. Besides, asymptomatic patients above 55 years, but have hypertension or diabetes under control, too are suggested isolation at home. They are issued a kit which includes medicines, and pamphlets which has information including the numbers to contact if situation worsens. Medical teams will track their health condition. If symptoms aggravate, they are shifted to a hospital. If they do not have a separate room or bathroom, or if they do not have a health person at home to take care of them, they are isolated at government health centres. Officials said that 80% of the positive cases are asymptomatic, and around 5% are critical cases who need hospitalisation. Those with mild to severe symptoms can directly go to Gandhi Hospital along with their coronavirus test report. “People don’t have to panic. The government has arranged enough number of beds not only in Hyderabad but in other districts too,” said Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy. He said that 642 patients were undergoing treatment in Gandhi Hospital till June 28. Two-third of beds in the hospital are unoccupied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/not-all-covid-19-patients-need-hospitalisation/article31949942.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Congress protests against fuel prices hike||Congress Member of Parliament from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkat Reddy has alleged that the Centre has fleeced Rs. 18 lakh crore from people during the last six years by increasing prices of petrol and diesel with heavy excise duty. The increase in fuel prices for the last 20 days has burdened further the lives of the poor and middle classes that have been already battered by the COVID-19 impact. In a letter addressed to President Ramnath Kovind against the Central government’s decision to increase fuel prices every day for the last three weeks, Mr. Venkat Reddy urged the former to suggest the Centre to provide relief to people by stopping the fuel price hike and in fact by reducing them in tune with the international oil prices. ‘Poor hit hard’ He pointed out that the poor, middle class, farmers and petty vendors, small traders and employees were suffering badly with the COVID-19 impact on their incomes and instead of providing relief to people, the government was making the lives of such sections more burdensome. Amid the impact of the pandemic on the earnings of the poor, the BJP-led government at the Centre was breaking their back with the huge increase in the fuel prices over the last 20 days. He mentioned that the prices of petrol and diesel were at Rs. 71.40 and Rs. 59.59 per litre, respectively, during the Congress rule in 2014 when the crude oil prices were at $108 per barrel. In 2020, the crude prices were down by 60% compared to 2014 to $43.41 per barrel but thanks to heavy levy of taxes by the Narendra Modi government the price of petrol was Rs. 82.96 per litre instead of Rs. 20.68 per litre. The Congress MP pointed out that the Centre was increasing the fuel prices against the crude prices by hiking excise duty heavily every time the crude prices come down.  Bullock cart rally Meanwhile, the Congress ranks staged protests across Telangana on Monday to protest the abnormal increase in the fuel prices over the last three weeks. The party leaders submitted memorandum addressed to the President of India to the respective District Collectors. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy participated in the protest and submitted a memorandum to the District Collector at Suryapet. In Warangal, several Congress workers were injured when a pair of bullocks brought by them as part of their protest to pull a cart panicked and ran helter skelter after looking at the gathering. The police rushed the injured to the hospital for first-aid and treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-protests-against-fuel-prices-hike/article31949969.ece

30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Medicines at the doorstep for those with hypertension and diabetes||To discourage people with hypertension and diabetes from visiting government hospitals amid rising cases of COVID-19, the Health department is delivering medicines at their doorsteps. Doctors and officials have stressed that COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are at higher risk of developing complications. The elderly and those with co-morbidities have been advised to stay indoors. Besides, during the lockdown from March 23 to May 31, people found it hard to get medicines as transportation also come to a halt. Officials from the Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare wing said they initiated the process of delivering medicines at the doorstep of patients from March year when coronavirus cases had started to emerge in Telangana. Under Non Communicable Disease (NCD) screening programme last year, 1.1 crore adults were screened for the two diseases. Of them, around 10.98 lakh with hypertension and 5.50 lakh with diabetes were diagnosed, and receiving treatment in both public and private healthcare facilities. After initial screening of people above the age of 30 years by Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANMs), if abnormal blood pressure or blood sugar levels are recorded, the person is referred to Primary Health Centre (PHC) medical officer who conducts another round of diagnosis to confirm the readings. If abnormalities are recorded, the patient is put on treatment. Till mid-2019, medicines for NCD were distributed to patients on a monthly basis at Primary Health Centres (PHC).Thereafter, the distribution process was decentralised in Telangana, under the India Hypertension Control Initiative. However, after imposition of lockdown, patients were unable to travel to get medicines. “So, a decision was taken to deliver drugs on a monthly basis by the ANMs to their doorstep. The number of diabetes and hypertension patients receiving treatment in the government sector was 6.5 lakh in March which increased to 8.27 lakh in April and was estimated to be around 8.7 lakh for May 2020,” Health officials said. As ANMs go door to door to deliver medicines, they are provided masks, face shields and gloves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/medicines-at-the-doorstep-for-those-with-hypertension-and-diabetes/article31949930.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Not proper to cast aspersions on medical personnel’||Health Minister Eatala Rajender has dismissed the charges that the death of a 34-year-old patient at the Government Chest Hospital at Erragadda was because of the “indifference” on the part of doctors. The Minister said the patient approached the Chest Hospital as a last resort and the doctors tried their best to effectively treat him. The patient who was admitted to the hospital had co-morbidities and tested positive for COVID-19. “Though thousands are being sent home after being cured, misinformation campaign is under way on social media when incidents like the one at Chest Hospital occur. It is not proper to cast aspersions on the medical personnel who are risking their lives to treat COVID-19 patients,” the Minister said. The remarks assume significance as a video by the deceased alleging that oxygen supply to him was cut off despite his pleas went viral on Sunday. Chest Hospital superintendent Mahboob Khan, however, denied the allegations and said the patient was provided with oxygen support all the time as could be seen from the nasal prongs in the video. The patient suffered a heart attack which was induced by COVID-19, Dr. Khan said. The Minister said the government had made arrangements to deploy 150 additional ambulances to ensure that those complaining of symptoms of COVID-19 were picked up from their homes and taken to hospitals for check-ups. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said steps were being taken to streamline the available mechanisms at every level and ensure that tests were conducted wherever necessary. Some of the private labs where tests were conducted reported high positivity rate and a report had been called for to verify the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/not-proper-to-cast-aspersions-on-medical-personnel/article31949936.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Employees hopeful of promotions soon||There is something to cheer for the employees’ community which has been waiting for long for decisions relating to implementation of the Pay Revision Commission, promotions and other demands. The State government has announced constitution of departmental promotion committees/screening committees with term of office up to December 31, 2021 or their reconstitution whichever is earlier. The departmental promotion committee for the head of the department (non-cadre) and additional/joint secretary (non-cadre) level posts will be headed by the Chief Secretary and the committee for the third level gazetted and above posts to consider proposals pertaining to key departments like General Administration, Home, Municipal Administration, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, IT, Infrastructure and Investment and Welfare departments would be headed by Special Chief Secretary Suresh Chanda as its chairman. Another committee to consider proposals for the Health, Irrigation, Industries and Commerce, Revenue, Transport, Housing and other departments would be headed by General Administration Department Principal Secretary (Political) Vikas Raj as chairman the Special Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary of the GAD (Services) will be the member convener of the three committees. The promotion panel year, according to employees’ representatives, would commence from September 1 and ends on August 31 the next year and the government had not taken a decision on the issue in spite of the fact that the constitution of the committee has been due since September 1 last year.  Retiring employees The constitution of the committees follows the anguish expressed by the employees over delay in promotions due to non-constitution of the departmental promotion committees especially for those who are on the verge of retirement age. Employees are hopeful that the panels would commence their exercise in the right earnest so that there can be promotions in some departments before the end of the current panel year, August 31. They are however concerned that the government had announced the panels for the third and above level gazetted officers. “The first and second level gazetted officers posts did not find a mention in the orders issued recently,” said a member of the Telangana Gazetted Officers’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/employees-hopeful-of-promotions-soon/article31949965.ece

30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘How can MDM be served when schools are closed?’||Telangana High Court on Monday said the courts have certain limitations while passing orders in matters related to public interest. Hearing a PIL plea filed by Balala Hakkula Sangham represented by its founder president P. Achyuta Rao, the HC asked the petitioner how can he demand for mid-day meal for students when schools are shut due to COVID-19. Mr. Rao, in his PIL plea, asked the HC to pass a direction to State government to provide to mid-day meals in government and aided schools. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy wondered how can one expect the government to serve mid-day meal when the schools are closed due to COVID-19. The bench also observed that in case of such grievances the petitioner should approach the government and represent to the officer concerned. The petitioner also wanted the government to supply gadgets to students to avail e-classes. The bench declined to pass any orders and said it was better if the petitioner represented such matters to the government. The matter was posted after two weeks for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/how-can-mdm-be-served-when-schools-are-closed/article31949933.ece

Prabhakar Rao is attaining superannuation on Tuesday. Presently IGP of Special Intelligence Branch (SIB), Mr. Rao joined the police department as Deputy Superintendent of Police in 1991. Ten years later, he was conferred with IPS. Known as ‘straight forward’ officer, Mr. Rao won not just police medals but also public accolades for his handling of sensational cases.

Taking cue from former officers who served the SIB, Mr. Rao began initiatives which helped in busting many Left-wing extremist networks. While the Left-wing was nearly wiped out with the department’s strategy, Mr. Rao’s efforts ensured it did not rise again, and attempts to resurrect it were successfully scuttled. The IPS officer was instrumental in getting neutralised two terror operatives while working as Nalgonda SP.

Revanth Reddy, who is also the working president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC), has requested the Centre to take over the handling of coronavirus pandemic from the hands of State government immediately, stating that the latter has failed to control the spread of the virus and lost confidence of the people. He submitted a representation to Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Lav Agarwal, who headed a Central team that visited Hyderabad on Monday to take stock of the situation by visiting containment areas and hospitals and had a meeting with the State government officials. In that, Mr. Reddy said Telangana, particularly Hyderabad, would witness a huge surge in COVID cases if the Centre did not intervene and constitute a committee to handle the situation. He explained that the test positivity rate of COVID in Telangana was 32.1% as on June 23 and is the highest among major cities in the country. The rate of testing per 10 lakh population was very low in Telangana and only 70,000 tests were conducted till June 23 in spite of the Indian Council of Medical Research asking the State to scale up tests, he added. Stating that there was a shortage of testing machines at only 22 compared to 42 in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the Congress MP said only one Central lab was available for testing since the government had not utilised 22 private labs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-urges-centre-to-take-over-covid-handling-in-ts/article31949931.ece

30 June 2020||N. RahulHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SOPs for locust control issued||A significant recommendation in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued for locust control in Telangana is the need to improve lighting in all identified villages since the operations were to be done at night and pre-dawn times. The SOPs issued by Prof Jaishanker Telangana State Agriculture University based on Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) desert locust guidelines suggested that insecticide spraying should be done during night to dawn and, therefore, all those involved in the activity were to be geared up to work at odd timings. To operate in difficult terrains, if need arose, drones also were needed to be employed from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. Farmers may be assisted to take up prophylactic spraying of neem-based formulation to minimise locust damage on standing crop and nurseries. All the drinking water bodies, including wells and water tanks, must be covered or secured properly to avoid water contamination. Washing, decontamination and first-aid facilities must be ensured. 10 districts at risk The guidelines suitably modified for the needs of Telangana identified 10 districts at the risk of locust attack if swarms moved in eastward direction from adjoining States of Maharashtra or Chhattisgarh. The districts were Mulug, Bhoopalpally, Nirmal, Adilabad, Asifabad, Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Mancherial, Kothagudem and Sangareddy. A series of steps were laid down to be followed before, during and after control operations. Trained village-level teams were to be constituted to advise villagers not to move out from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. in locust operation areas to avoid possible pesticide exposure. Identify possible sites of spray in each border village taking into consideration possible entry of locusts. An aerial survey with helicopters was suggested for finding green vegetation and locating swarms and hopper bands. Helicopters could be used to visit remote areas along with designated locust officers. The surveys should not be for more than three hours at a time. Helicopters must fly about 300 metres above ground tracking space, at least 50 kms ahead of green vegetation. Fly towards the vegetation and level out at five metres or less above the ground, reduce the speed to 40 to 50 kms per hour and swing tail from side-to-side to look towards the helicopter rear for locusts. The spray must be carried out cross-wind at right angles to the wind direction, moving upwind after each spray pass. Make an extra spray pass upwind of the target area. Stop spraying if the wind dropped or turned very strong. Also stop spraying if it starts to rain or seems likely to rain soon and when the wind direction changes by more than 45 degrees. The operations must be supervised by district level committees headed by Collectors and Superintendents of Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sops-for-locust-control-issued/article31949978.ece

30 June 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||NIMZ comes back to haunt farmers||Yekkeli Mahipal is not sure how long the tag of farmer will stick to him, if his worst fears were to become true. A native of Metalkunta in Nyalakal mandal, he cultivates three crops a year in his five acres land. About six years ago the then UPA government had announced establishment of National Investment and Manufacturers Zone (NIMZ) in about 12,635 acres spread in 12 villages of Jarasangam and Nyalakal mandals. The government already purchased 3,500 acres in Jarasangam mandal under G.O. 123. Now after five years the authorities are moving to acquire the remaining 9,000 acres of land from farmers. Recently they tried to conduct survey of land which was opposed by the farmers. Last week, when Collector M. Hanumantha Rao visited Nyalakal mandal the farmers tried to stop his vehicle. The villagers claim the Collector asked them to come on Monday, but when they went to meet him the Collector was not present. Finally they submitted their memorandum to the district revenue officer (DRO) and returned empty handed. “How can we sell our lands for a pittance to the government? What can we do after selling our lands as we know no other work except farming?” asked several farmers present at the Collectorate. The farmers are a disappointed lot as the Collector was not in office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nimz-comes-back-to-haunt-farmers/article31949983.ece
30 June 2020||Bhopal,||Families evicted from Rewa slum face uncertain future||Eviction from a slum during the lockdown piqued Dinesh Bansal more severely than it did on two previous occasions. Already battling hunger as scrap warehouses remained shut and savings had drained, the homelessness inflicted an agony he is still scrambling to overcome. At dawn on May 9, municipal officials accompanied by police razed down homes of 61 people, claiming they encroached upon the Rathara lake in Rewa, to begin a beautification project. These families of traditional bamboo artisans were resettled there five years ago by the Municipal Corporation after being displaced from another site. “During the lockdown we had no work, and then came the earth movers that morning. We were not even given a notice in advance to move out belongings,” alleged Mr. Dinesh, 42, who along with others now lives at the parking lot of a set of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) apartments. The families were even promised regular food and water supply. “For the past one week, we’ve not received supplies. What was the urgency to beautify the lake at the cost of our houses during the lockdown,” asked Umesh Bansal, 34. “They are not going hungry... social workers have been providing food,” said P.N. Shukla, Assistant Engineer at the corporation. “And we are fulfilling their housing demand through the PMAY.” He added it was a “policy decision” to resume work. In September last year, a meeting chaired by the Rewa Divisional Commissioner decided to free the land of “encroachers” so the project could be started. The families said as the lockdown claimed the wedding season from February to June, during which they made Rs. 25,000-Rs. 30,000 each year selling bamboo items and utensils, they were left with no money to deposit Rs. 20,000 for a house under the scheme. “Then we have to bear monthly instalments,” said Mr. Dinesh, who feeds his family of five as well as his brother’s five children. Before the lockdown, he worked as a ragpicker. These days he has found work at a construction site for Rs. 300-Rs. 350 a day. RTI activist Shivanand Dwivedi said, “The families were arbitrarily moved. And if they could pay for a house, why would they be staying in huts in the first place? ” The Corporation, however, claims it issued an eviction notice a day before the drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/families-evicted-from-rewa-slum-face-uncertain-future/article31949902.ece
30 June 2020||Ghaziabad,||7 U.P. policemen exonerated in ‘custodial death’ case||Seven personnel of Uttar Pradesh police have been exonerated in connection with an alleged custodial death in October 2019 in Pilakhuwa area of Hapur, officials said. An FIR lodged by Kuldeep alias Tejpal alleged his elder brother Pradeep Tomar died on the intervening night of October 13-14, 2019, after he was tortured by DSP Santosh Mishra, Pilakhuwa SHO Yogesh Baliyan, Sub-Inspector Ajab Singh, and four unnamed policemen. At that time, the police had said the security guard from Lakhan village was never taken into custody but was called to the Chhijarsi police post in Pilakhuwa for questioning in connection with a murder case. A video of Pradeep’s body being examined by locals had gone viral where they could be seen pointing to the blackening of his posterior and stab marks on arms and abdomen. In another video, his 10-year-old son alleged that his father was tortured in his presence by policemen. Hapur Superintendent of Police Sanjeev Suman said, “The police investigation didn’t find the officials guilty. We submitted the closure report in March. And just before the lockdown, the family members, including Pradeep’s son, recorded their statements in front of the magistrate wherein they absolved the policemen of the charges. The court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hapur, accepted the closure report and exonerated the policemen,” he told The Hindu . According to Mr. Suman, both the brothers were called to the police post in connection with a murder case in which Pradeep was an accused. “Along the way, he met with an accident as his bike hit a milkman’s vehicle near the Chhijarsi toll plaza. They had a fight in which he got injured. It was the policemen who helped by taking him to a local hospital and later to Meerut. However, the family chose to hold them guilty. When we produced witnesses of the accident and the fracas, they changed their statement.”  He said the post mortem report was inconclusive on the cause of death. On why the police didn’t proceed against the family for lodging a false FIR against police officers, Additional Superintendent of Police Sarvesh Mishra said, “It was not a case of Section 181 of IPC (perjury). It was about a false impression of the sequence of events. The family was mistaken.” Kuldeep Tomar, the deceased’s brother, didn’t respond to queries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/7-up-policemen-exonerated-in-custodial-death-case/article31949900.ece
30 June 2020||Mumbai,||Bhima-Koregaon case: Uddhav urged to place accused in house arrest||Historian Romila Thapar, and four other intellectuals, have appealed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to move the 11 activists, arrested in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence case, out of jails and place them in house arrest. Expressing concern over their health, in the letter dated June 25, Ms. Thapar along with Prabhat Patnaik, Devaki Jain, Maja Daruwala and Satish Deshpande, said, “At present 11 social activists — Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Varavara Rao, Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson — are accused in the Bhima Koregaon case and lodged at prisons in Maharashtra. All of them are either senior citizens or have serious co-morbidities, or both, that would place them at severe risk if they were infected with COVID-19.” In the letter they have pointed out, “One of them is a 81-year-old Varavara Rao, who suffered a collapse recently and was in ICU. He continues to be in precarious health. We are concerned about the undue level of risk they are being exposed to which may easily prove fatal. The conditions under which they are lodged are extremely poor and provide no guarantee of their continued well being.” Requesting the Chief Minister to place all the accused under house arrest, the letter added, “Covid-19 contagion is spreading across Maharashtra. Prisons, with their overcrowding and sub-optimal conditions, coupled with the age and co-morbidities of these prisoners may prove to be a death sentence. We appeal you to take the humanitarian step of preventing the unnecessary exposure of elderly and well-respected public persons to such an avoidable hazard.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bhima-koregaon-case-uddhav-urged-to-place-accused-in-house-arrest/article31949894.ece

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Trump’s H-1B ban has nothing to do with saving American jobs’||On June 22, the White House made a proclamation restricting the issuance of non-immigrant work visas across the board, which U.S. President Donald Trump said was to clamp down on American jobs going to foreign workers. The broadest impact may be felt on skilled workers abroad seeking the H-1B visa — in large part granted to Indian nationals each year. In an interview with The Hindu , Sheela Murthy, founder of the Murthy Law Firm specialising in immigration cases and based out of Maryland, U.S., discusses the impact of President Trump’s decision on the economy and immigration. Edited excerpts:  What is your sense of the long arc of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, starting from 2016? To some extent, it is just an evolutionary process. Even before he became President, candidate Trump talked about how he was probably going to go after immigrants and immigration, although he did not let the cat out of the bag over H-1B or professional workers. He talked about building the wall, about preventing people who broke U.S. law from coming into the country. But as soon as he got elected, his focus was on the travel ban [on visitors from certain Muslim-majority countries] around January 2017, on various executive orders, renewed focus on building the wall, threatening to cut off Employment Authorisation Documents. What is the impact of this proclamation on those in the H-1B visa category, and have you come across cases of people facing hardships? Those who have H-1B visas or are seeking them from within the U.S. and filing for extensions or amendments won’t be affected by the June 22 proclamation. But it will exacerbate the problem for those who may have travelled abroad, perhaps for a brief vacation or because of a family emergency, such as a parent being unwell, and who have been stuck there since late March. India shut its airspace to commercial flights around that time. In his April 22 proclamation, Mr. Trump targeted immigrant visas of those stuck abroad trying to come to the U.S. as green card holders, primarily family-based immigration. They may be unable to return to the U.S. at least until December 31, 2020. In the proclamation, the Trump administration has said that it reserves the right to extend this visa issuance ban beyond this date, if circumstances so warrant. Is this move genuinely about a broad immigration crackdown to protect U.S. jobs from foreign nationals or is the motive political, in the context of the election campaign? Yes, they are using the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to focus on their political agenda. This has nothing to do with saving American jobs. Research has shown that for the biggest tech companies and other corporations that are major income producers, the H-1B visa helps to create jobs for American workers, that bringing in high-skill individuals can actually boost the U.S. economy. In that climate, to pander to those people who are not necessarily the most highly educated or possess the highest technical skills is bad, because it is not going to create jobs, but actually take away jobs. Corporate CEOs including Google’s Sundar Pichai and Tesla’s Elon Musk have criticised the proclamation recently. Will there be a pushback from corporate America, through lobbying or lawsuits? I think there will be lawsuits, just as there with most of the immigration-related executive orders so far, including the travel ban, building the wall, and family separations at the border. It makes even less sense, for example, if an H-4 visa holder, a spouse of an H-1B visa holder, who does not work in the U.S. and went to India for what they thought would be a short vacation are now stuck for nine months, separated from their families in the U.S. Such a person has zero impact in terms of taking away a U.S. job. These are the kinds of lawsuits that would win fairly easily. But lawsuits take time, effort and money. Organisations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have been filing these lawsuits pro bono or at a reduced fee. If Mr. Trump wins and extends the visa issuance ban beyond December 31, 2020, wouldn’t the impact on jobs be greater? With regard to current H-1B visas and those who are in the U.S. already, it is not a problem. Most of the current H-1B petitions would not anyway be effective until October 1, 2020, which is the start of the fiscal year 2020-21 for the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service. If some of these applicants happen to be abroad, they are not going to get the visas to travel to the U.S. on H-1B status. On the other hand, if some of those people have other visas, let’s say tourist visas, the way the proclamation is written, for them there may be a potential legal loophole to enter the U.S. on that visa and attend meetings or travel on vacation as per the visa requirements, and within the legal time frame necessary to avoid fraud allegations, file for a change of status within the U.S. legally, to switch from their existing visa to H-1B. Then they would be able to start work based on the prior H-1B approval. If Joe Biden wins the election, will the immigration policy look very different from what it is under Mr. Trump? Historically, Republicans are supposed to be far more pro-business and Democrats, strangely, more protectionist. We’re seeing a little bit of a reversal here because the Trump administration has been focused on being protectionist in many ways, under the guise of helping U.S. workers. Joe Biden has not come out strongly with respect to an immigration policy, but having been the Vice-President under Barack Obama, the general view has been that he would continue some of the policy thinking of that administration. I don’t know that Joe Biden would seek to completely reshape immigration the way the Trump administration has looked at it.  Research has shown that for the biggest tech companies, bringing in high-skill individuals can actually boost the economy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trumps-h-1b-ban-has-nothing-to-do-with-saving-american-jobs/article31949569.ece
30 June 2020||Tehran,||Iran issues arrest warrant against Trump||Iran has issued an arrest warrant and asked Interpol for help in detaining U.S. President Donald Trump and dozens of others it believes carried out the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad, a local prosecutor reportedly said on Monday. Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said Mr. Trump and more than 30 others whom Iran accuses of involvement in the Jan. 3 strike that killed Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad face “murder and terrorism charges,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Mr. Alqasimehr did not identify anyone else sought other than Mr. Trump, but stressed that Iran would continue to pursue his prosecution even after his presidency ends. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Alqasimehr also was quoted as saying that Iran requested a “red notice” be put out for Mr. Trump and the others, which represents the highest-level arrest request issued by Interpol. Local authorities generally make the arrests on behalf of the country that requests it. The notices cannot force countries to arrest or extradite suspects, but can put government leaders on the spot and limit suspects’ travel. Brian Hook, U.S. special representative for Iran, dismissed the announcement during a news conference in Saudi Arabia on Monday. “It’s a propaganda stunt that no one takes seriously and makes the Iranians look foolish,” Mr. Hook said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-issues-arrest-warrant-against-trump/article31949571.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||UN declaration delayed over climate text||U.S. concerns over a paragraph on climate in a UN commemorative declaration have further delayed the statement’s release after tough negotiations successfully resolved previous issues around the text. The declaration, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the UN Charter on June 26, had already been delayed until 6 p.m. on Friday as countries — successfully — worked out a compromise around language that some, including India, had objected as being too aligned with Chinese government thought. The U.S. broke silence (a process under which a statement passes if no member state officially objects within a stipulated period of time) on the document on Friday over concerns about the climate-related paragraph, a European diplomat in New York told The Hindu . Lines on climate in the declaration include: “We need to adapt to the circumstances and take transformative measures. We have a historic opportunity to build back better and greener. We need to immediately curb greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. This cannot wait.” The U.S took issue with reference to the Paris Agreement, a second diplomatic source told The Hindu . The Trump administration gave notice in November last year that it was exiting the 2015 Paris Agreement. A U.S. diplomat at the UN told The Hindu on Sunday that they could not share updates and that, “ongoing diplomatic negotiations are confidential,” implying that negotiations are still in process. Letter on behalf of India  The Hindu had first reported that the U.K. had written a letter on behalf of India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. objecting to language that was considered too aligned with Chinese government’s ideology. This issue was resolved by General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande agreeing to replace the phrase, “shared vision of a common future” — associated with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China (CPC) as their vision of the world — with, “the common future of present and coming generations”. Diplomats from Sweden and Qatar — countries that are co-chairing the consultations on the declaration — have put a lot of effort into the process so far and are likely to come up with a solution, such as separating out the U.S. on the climate point, the European diplomatic source told The Hindu . “The longer this goes on, the more likely someone may come in with other language that is more problematic for everyone… like on human rights or whatever,” the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-declaration-delayed-over-climate-text/article31949574.ece
30 June 2020||Beijing,||China to restrict visa for some Americans over Hong Kong row||China announced on Monday visa restrictions on U.S. citizens who have “behaved egregiously” over Hong Kong, ahead of the expected approval by Chinese lawmakers of a national security law for the city. The country is moving forward on a law that would punish subversion and other offences against the state in Hong Kong, which saw massive and sometimes violent protests last year. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said it was restricting U.S. visas for a number of unspecified Chinese officials for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday that the U.S. “scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail”. “To target the U.S.’s above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,” Mr. Zhao said. China’s top lawmaking committee is expected to adopt the law during sessions that end on Tuesday. While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China’s security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would curb visas for unspecified current and former officials of the Chinese Communist Party “who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms”. Economic sanctions Last week, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a Bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions in the U.S. against Chinese officials and Hong Kong police identified as hurting the city’s autonomous status. Mr. Zhao warned Monday that the U.S. “should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-to-restrict-visa-for-some-americans-over-hong-kong-row/article31949565.ece
30 June 2020||Geneva,||‘Israel’s annexation plans are illegal’||Israel’s aim to annex parts of the occupied West Bank was clearly “illegal”, the UN’s human rights chief said on Monday, warning that the consequences could be “disastrous”. Just days before Israel intends to kick-start plans to annex its West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, Michelle Bachelet added her voice to the chorus urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop the proposal. ‘Dangerous path’ “Annexation is illegal. Period,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement. “Any annexation. Whether it is 30 percent of the West Bank, or five percent,” she said, urging Israel to “listen to its own former senior officials and generals, as well as to the multitude of voices around the world, warning it not to proceed along this dangerous path.” International condemnation of the possible Israeli annexations has mounted ahead of July 1, when the Jewish state could take its first steps toward implementing part of a West Asia peace plan. U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposals pave the way for annexing key parts of the West Bank. Ms. Bachelet urged Israel to shift course, warning that “the shockwaves of annexation will last for decades, and will be extremely damaging to Israel, as well as to the Palestinians.” She warned that “any attempt to annex any part of the occupied Palestinian territory will not only seriously damage efforts to achieve lasting peace in the region, it is likely to entrench, perpetuate and further heighten serious human rights violations that have characterised the conflict for decades.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israels-annexation-plans-are-illegal/article31949573.ece

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||In 24 hours, Palestine faces an existential threat||On June 24, the UN Secretary General António Guterres told a virtual meeting of the United Nations Security Council that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at a “watershed moment” and that the Israeli plans to annex parts of the West Bank have alarmed the Palestinians, many Israelis and the international community. Such annexation would be “a most serious violation of international law”. He called upon the Israeli government to abandon its annexation plans and asked the Middle East Quartet (the United States, Russia, the European Union and the UN) to resume its mandated mediatory role. A violation The UN Secretary General’s alarm has been sounded in the context of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s reported plan to annex on July 1 around 30% of the Occupied West Bank. This will include annexation of all the existing (post-1967) settlements in addition to areas surrounding them and access roads. This, from published accounts, has the approval of the Trump Administration. Under international law, annexation is forcible acquisition of territory by one state at the expense of another state. According to Prof. Nathaniel A Berman of Brown University, U.S., such an act even if sanctified by Israeli law is illegal under international law and would violate the universally acknowledged principle of the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force”. This, according to him, is the accepted position of all international legal bodies including the International Court of Justice. The same position has been taken by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN Human Rights). In a statement on June 16, it described the annexation of occupied territory as a serious violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions, and contrary to the fundamental rule affirmed many times by the UN Security Council and the General Assembly that acquisition of territory war or by force is inadmissible. It pointed out that the 53-year-old Israeli occupation is a source of profound human rights violations of the Palestinian people and said “these human right violations would only intensify after annexation. What would be left of the West Bank would be Palestinian Bantustan, islands of disconnected land completely surrounded by Israel and with no territorial connection with the outside world. Israel has recently promised that it will maintain permanent security control between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. Thus, the morning after the annexation would be the crystallisation of an already unjust reality: two peoples living in the same space, ruled by the same state, but with profoundly unequal rights. This is a vision of a 21st century apartheid.” The statement concludes that despite the dismal record of Israel’s past violation of international law, “accountability and an end to impunity must become an immediate priority for the international community”. The Israeli pulse Despite Mr. Netanyahu’s bravado, an opinion poll conducted by the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz , in March last year showed that while 28% of the Israelis opposed annexation, 11% supported full annexation with political rights for the Palestinians and 16% full annexation with no political rights for Palestinians. In addition, 15% were for partial annexation and 30% expressed no views. An interesting, unprecedented, entrant in the debate is an opinion article, titled “It’s either Annexation or Normalization”, written in Hebrew by the United Arab Emirates Ambassador in Washington and published in an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Ahronot . It urged the Israeli government to desist from the contemplated move. The effect of the plan What would be the consequences of such a move? Would Palestinians living in annexed areas, and owning around 23% of its land retain their private property? Would they be enshrined in a legal framework of a two-class population divided by ethnicity and given Israeli residency as a category of “subjects” of the annexing entity? Would they be on a par with Israeli Arabs of Palestinian origin (Muslim, Christian and Druze) who together constitute about 20% of Israel’s population? Above all, will it take away from the Palestinians the right to have their own state under the right of national self-determination recognised times without number by the international community? Would there be demographic consequences? Israel, by its foundational proclamations, “is not a Jewish state only because most of its inhabitants are Jews. It is state for the Jews wherever they may be, and for any Jew who wishes to be here”. Its official ideology of Zionism (somewhat analogous to other doctrines of strident nationalism of the 20th century) was described much earlier by Vladimir Jabotinsky as “a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force”. Ever since the war of June 1967, the Israeli effort has been to procrastinate a settlement and change ground realities. Israel today is member of the international community and contributes to international cooperation. It has succeeded in normalising its relations with a wide range of countries. A concomitant of this is the observance of globally accepted norms of state conduct. A reluctance to do this is premised on the support of “powerful friends” and imperatives of geopolitics. Must this necessarily have permanence? The record of Palestinian resistance and of protest movements the world over show that injustice and denial of rights has no permanence and, as Jean Jacques Rousseau said a long time back, “the strongest is never strong enough to be always master unless he transform his power into right, and obedience into duty”. For New Delhi India has a substantive relationship, reaching strategic dimensions, with Israel. It is mutually beneficial. India’s amity with the Palestinian people, and its principled support to their cause, predates India’s own independence. On the global stage, we have invariably supported the UN Security Council and General Assembly Resolutions supportive of the Palestinians. At this critical juncture, and now that we are back on the Horse Shoe Table, would we support an annexation in contraventions of international legality and of our own commitments?

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Grain aplenty and the crisis of hunger||With the economic crisis continuing on the one hand and the health system crumbling under the burden of rising COVID-19 cases on the other, it is clear that it will take a long time for things to get back to “normal”. Unemployment is high and it will take a while for lost livelihoods to be rebuilt, especially given the fact that India was already facing an economic slowdown along with high levels of inequality. Among other interventions to revive demand in the economy and create employment, it is absolutely essential that food support in the form of free/subsidised grains is made available to all without any disruptions. An inadequate response As a measure to address hunger, the central government announced as part of the Rs. 1.70-lakh crore relief package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) in the last week of March that it would provide 5kg of foodgrains and 1 kg of pulses for free to all those who are beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) for three months. As it became obvious that many were not part of the NFSA, the government, in May, almost two months after the lockdown was initiated, announced its expansion to cover an additional eight crore individuals for two months to ensure that migrants are included under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package. This basically meant each State being given foodgrain to the tune of 10% more than what they normally get under the NFSA. Many States were already covering more beneficiaries than was allotted to them by the NFSA, and some States made additional temporary provisions for these two months. What needs to be done As many have argued, this is an inadequate response. What is required is a universal Public Distribution System (PDS) to ensure that nobody is excluded. What is also an urgent need now is for the food support announced as part of the PMGKAY and Atmanirbhar package to be extended for a longer period, as both end in June. The president of the Indian National Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, wrote to the Prime Minister last week seeking an extension in the distribution of free foodgrains until September (another three months). It has also been reported that the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, in a video conference with State food ministers/secretaries on June 18, said that “around 10 States have written to the Ministry to extend the distribution of free food grains under the PMGKAY for three more months”. However, the government has not yet announced any such extension. Rather, the government seems to be indicating that all problems of exclusion will be resolved once the One Nation One Ration Card scheme is expanded across the country, which is supposed to be achieved by March 2021. Under ONOC, a beneficiary can receive ration entitlements as under the NFSA from any fair price shop in the country using her/his Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. This will apparently be possible once the Aadhaar numbers of all members enlisted in ration cards are seeded, which will enable transactions under the Public Distribution System across the country to be brought on to one digital platform. It has been announced that ONOC is operational in 20 States. Biometric authentication Portability across States is an important and valid concern that needs to be ensured so that migrant workers can access their entitlements. ONOC, however, has a number of problems in the way it has been conceived, being Aadhaar-based. The experience of biometric authentication using electronic point of sale (ePoS) machines so far suggests that it results in exclusion of some of the most marginalised because of multiple reasons including network issues, authentication failure and so on. Keeping these concerns aside for now, it must be noted that ONOC is definitely not a solution to the immediate crisis of hunger that continues in the aftermath of the lockdown. The integrated management of PDS (IM-PDS) portal, which gives real time data on transactions under ONOC, shows that for the month of May, there were a total of 378 transactions (3,077 beneficiaries) under ONOC and 479 transactions (3,856 beneficiaries) in June (as on June 29, 2020). The figures for April are even lower. Ironically, Mr. Paswan is reported to have said in the same videoconference that, “in the time of Covid-19 pandemic, the scheme proved immensely beneficial for migrant labourers, stranded and needy persons to access their quota of food grains through ONOC portability”. It must not be forgotten that lakhs of migrants were stranded in different places without access to food. Overflowing granaries This emphasis on ONOC is an obfuscation, while the real issue is of burgeoning food stocks along with widespread hunger. If we include unmilled paddy, foodgrain stock in the Food Corporation of India has now risen to almost 100 million MTs while the buffer stock norms is 41 million MTs. This will increase even more as there is another week of procurement open in the rabi marketing season; there will be another round of procurement of kharif crop in a few months (49.9 million MTs of rice was the procurement during the kharif marketing season in 2019-20). A universalised PDS giving 10kg of foodgrains per person per month for another four months requires about 47 million tonnes in total, assuming that nearly 85% of the population actually lifts their rations. It can be safely assumed that the rich will automatically self-select themselves out of the system. This is indicative and the actual requirements would most likely be lower. It is unfathomable why the PDS is not being universalised immediately especially when food stocks are at such a historic high. The government seems to be hoping to get rid of grain through the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) where it sells the grains at prices lower than the procurement cost but much higher than the issue prices under PDS, so that the fiscal consequences can be contained. Earlier experiences with the OMSS do not spell much hope that this plan of the government will be successful. In the period 2017-18 to 2020-21 (up to first week of June), only 16.6 million tonnes of rice and wheat have been sold under the OMSS. The quantity sold each year was less than the quantity offered. Moreover, one-third of all sales was to State governments (almost all the rice) thereby shifting the subsidy burden to State governments. If not OMSS to private buyers, the only other options left are to either export them or let the grain go waste. Needless to say, choosing any of these options while people go hungry is nothing less than criminal.

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The STARS project needs an overhaul||Atmanirbhar Bharat calls for an India that is able to produce and deliver local goods and services to its citizens. This applies equally to education for all children. Delivering a service, like education, requires a capable state, especially given the scale and complexity of its large and diverse population. Building state capability involves a process of learning to do things on one’s own. This is precisely the idea behind an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Fundamentally, therefore, it cannot be outsourced. In other words, state capability is about getting things done in the government, and by the government, by ensuring effective implementation that is responsive to local needs, but also about being able to design and conduct reforms. However, the World Bank’s STARS project, a $3 billion project to improve education in six Indian States, has the mistaken understanding that state capability should be built by giving a larger role to non-state actors and by increasing the use of technology. Both these premises are misguided as they do not contribute to the capability of the state to deliver better education. The reason is that there are some preconditions for effective governance within the public sector that must be met before either technology or non-state actors can be useful. For effective governance First, the administration must be equipped with adequate physical, financial and human resources. An overburdened bureaucracy with vacancies and without basic equipment cannot be expected to be effective. Often one hears that increasing inputs is a waste of resources as they are used inefficiently. This criticism neglects the fact that for efficiency, a critical minimum level of resources is a precondition. Unfortunately, in the education sector we are short of that level in all areas. Second, administrative or governance reforms must give greater discretion to the front-line bureaucracy to address local issues and innovate if required. This is as much a function of better resources at the local level as of greater decentralisation of decision-making or political authorisation. The movement against corruption and towards accountability has had an unfortunate fallout on innovation for fear of misuse of an increased room for manoeuvre. Yet, for reforms to be successful, public sector entities need to be able to try new things, and at times, to fail. Outsourcing to non-state partners not just takes away discretion from state actors but also a sense of accountability and ownership towards their job. Third, there needs to be trust within the administration among peers and across different levels within the administration. If suspicion is the guiding principle, institutional arrangements will be geared to monitoring and surveillance, not support and improvement. The goal must be to improve, not to judge and punish. A flawed approach Why is the STARS approach to build state capacity flawed? First, it fails to address the basic capacity issues: major vacancies across the education system from District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs), district and block education offices, to teachers in schools, remain unaddressed. Without capable and motivated faculty, teacher education and training cannot be expected to improve. Similarly, at the block level, an already overburdened bureaucracy cannot be expected to perform miracles without a substantial increase in trained manpower, support staff and other forms of institutional support. Second, the Bank ignores that decentralising decision-making requires the devolution of funds and real decision-making power. Greater decentralisation can allow accountability to flow to the people rather than to supervising officers. It requires not just investment in the capacity of the front-line bureaucracy but also in increasing their discretionary powers while fostering social accountability. The issue of discretion hinges crucially on trust – the third, important element requiring attention if state capability is to be enhanced. Trust, which implies listening and collaborating across different levels within the administration, is entirely ignored in the World Bank project. Instead, the Bank displays yet again an over-reliance on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as a panacea that lacks any backing in evidence. It is based instead on the idea that a flawed system can be fixed merely through the injection of more and better technology. In fact, technology does not address most of the systemic or governance challenges; it simply bypasses them. This is not to deny that technology has its uses, but its usefulness depends on whether preconditions for an effective use of ICT systems have been put in place. Otherwise the likelihood of exacerbating, rather than solving, problems increases. Technology as a short-cut to creating a capable state has not worked in the past. Fourth, measurement is seen as a way to improve performance. Yet, just like fever does not go away by checking the temperature more frequently, service delivery does not improve by measurement alone. It is important to know that temperature is high, but more important to understand why it is so. Schools in India need improvement. The question is: should money be invested in improving the capability of the system to improve learning or in testing infrastructure, that too for standardised assessments alone? Lastly, outsourcing basic governance functions by “expanding private initiatives” and “reducing government tasks” will not make education “more relevant to local needs” or “democratically promote people’s participation by empowering local authorities” as stated in the project document. Institutions of the state, from State-level officials who design policy changes, to district, block, cluster and school-level officials who adapt those policies for solving local problems rely on past experience (institutional memory) to meet new challenges and build additional memories with every new reform they undertake. New private initiatives do not have these institutional memories, nor do they have a grasp of socio-cultural realities that play an important part in the delivery process. While state structures need to develop more skills to enable them to solve both local and structural problems more effectively, it is not clear how they can be imparted by agencies that are extraneous to both the context and the system. If we want DIETs, block and community resource centres, and schools to be atma nirbhar , we need to enable them to develop their own capability to reform themselves. Outsourcing, an over-reliance on measurement by standardised assessments, and an excessive use of ICT will not get us closer to an Atmanirbhar Bharat.

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||A new era of accessibility||During the lockdown, a father, left with no choice but to steal a bicycle, transported his disabled son from rural Rajasthan to Uttar Pradesh. A professor and wheelchair user in West Bengal, with no means of transport, has no access to medical care during this period, even in an emergency. In the wake of the pandemic and the lockdown, the already arduous quest for health, safety, and security for many has been exacerbated by a lack of accessibility. Impact of the crisis These stories should impel us all to act on accessibility. The pandemic reveals how exacerbated inequities have become, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In India, a study, “Locked Down and Left Behind,” documents the plight of persons with disabilities during this crisis. Of the 1,067 respondents, 73% are facing severe challenges, namely with financial stability, access to essential items, adequate accommodation, and availability of healthcare. Second, thousands of families lack access to critical care takers and domestic help, who play crucial roles in caring for a child or family member with a disability. Finally, there are significant impacts on the well-being of persons with disabilities. In particular, social isolation and limited access to accessible, adequate sanitation or isolation facilities threaten the health and safety of this already vulnerable population. As individuals who either work with children and young adults with disabilities or are caregivers/persons with disabilities ourselves, we have seen the impact first-hand. We have seen parents and families taking on herculean tasks to deliver interventions and therapies for their children, with telephone support from therapists or other support workers. We have seen many caregivers who are coping exceptionally well and are able to support their children or family member; for others, juggling work from home, the needs of this person, alongside other responsibilities are challenging. We have seen how parents, particularly fathers, and organisations are joining forces with caregivers to collaborate on common challenges to develop innovative solutions for persons with disabilities. However, underlying these efforts to address the impact of the pandemic at a community level is the fundamental challenge of accessibility. Persons with disabilities already struggle for equitable access to education, healthcare, transportation, and economic opportunities. The pandemic has further decreased access to these basic services and rights. The pandemic simultaneously presents an unprecedented challenge and an opportunity to change the course of accessibility in low- and middle-income countries in the post-pandemic world. As the world continues to re-imagine a new ‘normal’ for its physical and social spaces, there is a window of opportunity to improve accessibility. In low- and middle-income countries that have battled pressing challenges (mass migration, concurrent infections like TB, limited health infrastructure, etc.), COVID-19 recovery plans include investments in urban planning, health facilities, and social spaces. If accessibility is considered, these efforts can catalyse the vision of an inclusive world. Filling the gaps To address this growing fissure between the accessible and non-accessible world, the international community will have to close some of the gaps and blunt some of the edges by building accessibility across all sectors. Such efforts must engage people to promote education and awareness on including persons with disabilities; implementing accessibility laws and regulations; improving physical accessibility and universal design; reducing stigma; and developing the tools for individuals and communities to engage meaningfully with persons with disabilities. Ultimately, one of the key ways to achieve this is to begin including and involving persons with disabilities in decision and policymaking, for COVID-19 recovery and beyond, which can ensure representation on the matters that govern their lives. There is rarely an opportunity where policymakers have an ability to change the physical and social world drastically. Using this moment to implement universal accessibility should be central to the vision of the post-COVID era. Accessibility is a vital human right, and an accessible post-COVID world is one that will deliver justice to the minority population, without whom the path towards Sustainable Development Goals realisation and universal health coverage will remain a distant goal.

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Share public data with the public||The unsatisfactory state of India’s data collection and processing system is among the many systemic deficiencies exposed by the pandemic. It was highlighted by the recent upward revisions to the COVID-19 death toll in some States. Apart from this implicit acknowledgement of the discrepancies in the data-handling process, there are also allegations of under-reporting COVID-19 cases. In general, on every issue encountered during the last three months, from the migrants’ travails to the inadequate fiscal package, lack of reliable data in the public domain has hampered the search for policy alternatives. From 2006 onwards, several open-source software enthusiasts and civil society activists came together in the U.S. and U.K. with a demand to unlock the data gathered by governments for unfettered access and reuse by citizens. After all, the data collected at public expense must belong to the people. This principle is the basis for the Open Data Charter adopted by 22 countries since 2015. It calls upon governments to disseminate public data in open digital formats. In return, the Charter argues, governments can expect “innovative, evidence-based policy solutions”. Making data accessible online In India, a step towards making non-sensitive government data accessible online was taken in 2012 with the adoption of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP). However, the implementation has lagged far behind its stated objectives. The main thrust of the policy is to “promote data sharing and enable access to Government of India owned data for national planning and development”. The implementation guidelines for NDSAP include lofty ideals such as “openness, flexibility, transparency, quality” of data, and aim to facilitate “access to Government of India shareable data in machine-readable form”. The guidelines prescribe open digital formats suitable for analysis and dissemination. Opaque formats such as the portable document format and the image format are discouraged. As part of the Open Government Data (OGD) initiative, data.gov.in, was launched in 2012. In the current climate, the OGD initiative could potentially have made a substantial difference to India’s COVID-19 response. Had the district-wise, demographic-wise case statistics and anonymous contact traces been released in the public domain, reliable model forecasts of disease spread and targeted regional lockdown protocols could have been generated. Model forecasts have limitations, but models without inputs from empirical data are even more unreliable. Principles of OGD notwithstanding, sufficiently granular infection data are not available. Ironically, violating the data format guidelines, OGD portal provides COVID-19 data only as a graphic image unsuitable for any analysis. The other official data sources (the Indian Council of Medical Research and mygov.in) fare no better. In contrast, the data portals of Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. present district-wise COVID-19 cases data, and also the emergent effects on mental health, jobs and education. According to the latest report of the Open Data Barometer, an independent group measuring the impact of open data, these nations lead the pack while India is a contender to reach the top bracket and not a laggard. The government must provide the impetus and incentive to exploit this voluminous data by invigorating the dated national data portal. Creating social impact Every department must be mandated to share substantive data respecting privacy concerns. Much of the Census and socio-economic data, publicly funded research data, and scientific data are either not open or rotting in unusable formats. The government should look within for examples of creative outcomes of opening up its database. Start-ups have built novel applications using Indian Railways data to provide ticket confirmation prediction and real-time train status. Sharing public data is a way to create beneficial social impact. M. S.

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Cautious, but firm||After weeks of more diplomatic wording, the statement by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on June 26 appears to signal that patience in dealing with Beijing is reaching a dead end. The statement said publicly, for the first time since reports of the stand-off, that the Chinese build-up and clashes with Indian troops, including the Galwan Valley incident on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were brutally killed, had a “larger context”. Moving away from previous statements that alluded to the clashes in May as quite routine, and borne from “differences in perception” of the LAC, the MEA said that PLA behaviour “this year” was a shift from the past. It also admitted that the Chinese side had built up a large armed presence since early May, making it clear that India’s strategic establishment has had much to worry about. There are other shifts of note. While each of the MEA’s several references to the situation at LAC in May and June had mentioned dialogue as the way forward, its latest statement makes it clear that it is China’s responsibility to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC, without citing further dialogue. It warned that a continuation of the current situation “would only vitiate the atmosphere” for the relationship, indicating that the current status quo is unacceptable. In detailing the number of clashes, the use of unauthorised violence on June 15, and the sheer numbers of troops and weaponry “amassed”, the government is pointing out that China has violated every agreement on border peace that the two sides have committed to since the 1993 Agreement. In short, the message is this — not only is the situation at the LAC of concern, but China’s actions have also probably undone decades of careful negotiations on the boundary. Given all that the MEA statement now acknowledges, it is only inevitable that the government will face probing questions on its silence when such a large troop mobilisation by China threatened Indian frontiers weeks ago, and whether it missed signals out of Beijing that this build-up was intended. Other questions remain about Prime Minister Modi’s insistence and the MEA’s consistent stand that Chinese troops have not come across the LAC, and that there have only been “attempted transgressions” by the PLA. Satellite pictures and media accounts point to the contrary. The government must now ensure some clarity. The nation must be apprised on the challenges and the steps planned beyond ongoing military and diplomatic exchanges, to ensure that the status quo ante, prior to May, is restored by China. Each step, whether it involves military action, international support, or sanctions by banning Chinese products or the participation of Chinese telecom and other companies, will come with serious consequences, and the government must ensure wide consultations, simultaneously preparing the people for what may follow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cautious-but-firm/article31949545.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Legitimate concern||By writing a strong letter to Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, alleging that “law and order has collapsed” in the State and that armed gangs “who question the sovereignty and integrity of the nation” had challenged its authority by engaging in blatant “extortion” and siphoning off funds meant for development work, Governor R.N. Ravi has thrown down the gauntlet to the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party-led government, in which the BJP is a coalition partner. The Governor went on to write that functions such as “transfer and posting of officials” who are in charge of law and order above the district level will be done with his approval, as proposed under Article 371A(1)(b) of the Constitution. In a way, he was only voicing the concerns of sections of civil society over the slide in law and order; illegal collections by armed groups have been an issue for several years. In its response to the letter, the insurgent National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM), which has been observing a ceasefire with the government for the last 23 years, has said the group was only engaged in collecting “taxes”, suggesting that the Governor was not inaccurate in his description. But his letter has put the State government in a difficult situation. The much touted peace accord with the insurgent groups involved in the long-standing Naga conflict is yet to be achieved, despite the Centre’s push to conclude it last year. Mr. Ravi has remained the Centre’s interlocutor, a position he took up in 2015, even after becoming the State Governor in August 2019. Despite the Centre’s heady statements heralding a Naga peace accord since 2015, it is nowhere close to finalising it with the groups. In some ways, this is due to the NSCN-IM’s obstinacy such as its insistence on retaining a separate flag and a Constitution for the State of Nagaland and its unwillingness to dismantle its parallel administrative and paramilitary structure. The distrust it invokes among other Naga organisations besides other north-eastern governments because of its core ideology of a “greater Nagalim”, and the inherent difficulties in getting other insurgent actors on board have made this a conflict that persists despite the ceasefire and a problem that does not lend itself to a quick solution. Yet, without an agreement to rein in all the insurgent groups, the State government will have little leeway in imposing its will and prevent the blatant extortion that is hampering development and law and order. The ball is therefore in the Centre’s court, and by extension its interlocutor, Mr. Ravi’s, in finding a way to address this knotty issue. This the Governor must do, not by usurping the authority of the State government in governance matters, but by patiently refocusing on the peace process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/legitimate-concern/article31949546.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Schools and playing fields (From an editorial)||In recognition of the fact that local bodies, particularly the urban ones, are the primary agencies for ministering to the citizen’s social, cultural and physical needs, the Indian Institute of Public Administration has made a study of the educational and recreational activities of towns in the different States. The study points out that there is a link between education and recreation because “as a man’s educational and cultural level rises, his capacity to enjoy leisure intelligently increases.” To the extent that India’s urban population is growing rapidly and there is the urge to rationalise working hours with more time for leisure, the needs of both education and recreation are certainly being pushed into sharper focus. It is disappointing to note therefore from the IIPA study that there is a lot of leeway to be made up in providing basic amenities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/schools-and-playing-fields-from-an-editorial/article31949554.ece
30 June 2020||MUMBAI,||Tata Steel slides to a Q4 loss||Tata Steel’s consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter widened to Rs.1,236crore from a Rs.1,166crore loss in the third quarter and compared to a profit of Rs.2,353crore in the year-earlier period as the COVID-19 pandemic affected its local and overseas operations. Revenue slumped 20% to Rs. 33,770 crore in the quarter. On a standalone basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs. 563 crore compared with a net profit of Rs.2,309crore in the year-earlier period. Challenging year “FY20 has been a challenging year,” said T.V. Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel. “The Indian economy slowed down in the first half with key steel consuming sectors like automotive contracting sharply,” said Mr. Narendran. “While the economy began recovering in the second half, the outbreak of COVID-19 in end March led to an unprecedented disruption and heightened economic uncertainty. We have recalibrated our operations in line with the evolving business environment and are focused on conserving cash while actively de-risking the business,” he added. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 10 per ordinary share of Rs. 10 each and Rs.2.504per partly paid ordinary share of Rs. 10 each (paid-up Rs.2.504per share) for the financial year2019-20. ‘Conserving cash’ Tata Steel had net debt in excess of Rs. 1,04,000 crore as on March 31,2020. “Given the heightened uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused on conserving cash and ensuring adequate liquidity to face potential disruptions in the operating environment,” said Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and CFO, Tata Steel. Reducing expenditure “We have pivoted business decisions on cash flows and successfully driven cash neutrality in our operations by reducing spend, managing working capital and curtailing capital expenditure,” Mr. Chatterjee added. “We have also raised additional funds of Rs. 4,900 crore to build a contingency buffer. Our liquidity at the end of the year remained robust at Rs. 17,745 crore, including cash and cash equivalents of Rs. 11,549 crore.” Ahead of the results, Tata Steel shares declined 0.8% on the BSE to Rs.321.25in a weak Mumbai market on Monday, valuing the company at Rs. 36,812 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tata-steel-slides-to-a-q4-loss/article31949529.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Govt. must allow airlines commercial freedom’||The government must cease to control commercial decisions of India’s airlines to ensure their survival following the financial setbacks caused by the air travel restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation consultancy CAPA India warned on Monday. “Allowing complete commercial freedom is a must for the revival of airlines in India. No other major aviation market in the world imposes such barriers on their own carriers,” the firm said. The removal of curbs would enable airlines to tap into sources of ancillary revenue such as extending zero-baggage fares — which would allow passengers with no baggage to benefit from lower fares, while those with baggage would pay an extra fee thus providing airlines a new source of income. CAPA estimates that Indian carriers could generate $400 million more a year if they were able to offer zero baggage fares. Indian carriers have struggled to tap ancillary revenues because of curbs by the government, which is sensitive to any increase in fares. In 2015, DGCA allowed airlines to offer zero baggage fares but later rescinded the decision. Airlines have over the years been able to unbundle many services and earn ancillary revenue, such as extra fee for seats with leg room and meals onboard. CAPA also reiterated the need to mandate that airlines have a minimum cash reserve to be able to renew their operator’s permit. “CAPA has repeatedly recommended this since 2010. Most airlines today are technically bankrupt and are starved of cash to be able to operate. This is what drives them to discount fares, locking them in a cycle of instability. Unfortunately, this is not recognised at a policy level,” the consultancy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-must-allow-airlines-commercial-freedom/article31949532.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHi,||Auto exports tumble 73% on lockdown, delayed orders||Even as automobile sector exports tumbled 73% in May 2020 to $230.3 million, the industry on Monday warned that inordinate delays in clearance for consignments from China may lead to a halt in the manufacture of vehicles in the country. Import consignments from China are being subjected to ‘100% manual inspection, resulting in clearance delays’ amid continuing border tensions between India and its northern neighbour. “Inordinate delays in clearance due to congestions at ports could eventually impact manufacturing of vehicles in India,” Rajan Wadhera, president, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said. “The industry is piecing itself together as growth is limping back; any further disruption at this juncture is best avoided.” Deepak Jain, President, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association, pointed out that some of the items imported from China are critical components such as parts of engines and electronics items for which India is yet to develop domestic competence. He added that the automotive value chain in the country is about $118 billion, of which import of auto components is $4.75 billion or 4% of the total auto industry turnover. “The automotive value chain is a highly complex, integrated and interdependent one; non availability of even a single component can, in fact, lead to stoppage of vehicle manufacturing lines,” he said. As per data from Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), India, automobile exports fell 73% to $230.3 million in May 2020 compared to a year earlier. “Supply chains broke down due to mobility restrictions and a wave of postponement of foreign orders in the sector led to such a massive drop in exports,” EEPC India Chairman Ravi Sehgal said. Auto exports to the U.S. nosedived 98% to $1.37 million in May 2020. Shipments to Mexico — another important market for Indian auto — dropped more than 65% to $42.50 million last month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/auto-exports-tumble-73-on-lockdown-delayed-orders/article31949534.ece
30 June 2020||Chennai,||MRF Q4 income drops Rs. 500 cr.||The unprecedented lockdown resulted in a drop of more than Rs. 500 crore in total income for tyre manufacturer MRF Ltd. during the fourth quarter ended March 2020 from a year earier. Compared with the December 2019 quarter, the company reported a drop in income of about Rs. 400 crore. The lockdown announced to curb the spread of COVID-19 had led to the closure of MRF’s plants and godowns, the company said. The tyre industry had been facing demand issues for some time. However, the Centre imposing restrictions on the import of tyres was likely to be of immense help to the tyre industry at a difficult time as this, MRF said. MRF had a strong net worth and serviced all its debt obligations in a timely manner. It does not foresee any incremental risk regarding recoverability of assets and ability to service financial obligations. For the fourth quarter, MRF posted standalone net profit of Rs. 669 crore against Rs. 294 crore in the year-earlier period. Total income dropped to Rs. 3,683 crore from Rs. 4,183 crore. MRF opted for the lower income tax rate and re-measured the deferred tax liabilities/assets. Accordingly, the net provision for tax (current tax and deferred tax) for the year is Rs. 4 crore (Rs. 512 crore). Therefore, the full year standalone net profit rose 27% to Rs. 1,395 crore. The board recommended a final dividend of Rs. 94 per share. With two interim dividends of Rs. 3 each paid during the year, the aggregate dividend for the year is Rs. 100 per equity share.

30 June 2020||London,||Hamilton eyes Schumacher’s record||The event at Spielberg is being held on its original calendar date. However, it is not the once-anticipated 11th round of the championship, but the first - a season-opener delayed by the global coronavirus pandemic. More than three months after the Australian Grand Prix was abandoned on the eve of opening practice in Melbourne, the race in the Styrian Alps will be run behind closed doors, without fans, sponsors’ agents and guests and only a handful of reporters restricted to the media centre. The usual high-rise motor homes will be replaced by tents and awnings while the teams, cut to 80 members and all in protective gear, will operate in sanitised “bubbles within bubbles” in a paddock bereft of human contact and the usual swell of rumour and speculation. For all involved, who are tested four days before the event and five days later, it will be an unprecedented and unique experience. Yet, despite all the change and the surreal atmosphere, it is expected that the action, when it begins, will deliver the same likely story. Lewis Hamilton, powered by the all-conquering Mercedes, will go in search of a seventh drivers’ title to equal Michael Schumacher’s record of most titles. The opening three races form just part of an intensive spell of eight European races in 10 weeks, which may become nine in 11 if a proposed round at Mugello, in Italy, is added. Challenger Max Verstappen and Red Bull are expected to challenge Mercedes, with Ferrari and Racing Point in close pursuit. It will be intriguing to see in the opening events if Hamilton’s focus has been affected by his active and vocal support for the current anti-racism protests. “It’s a really weird time in the world and the biggest challenge in my mind is not about the championship necessarily,” Hamilton said. “It’s not a normal year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-eyes-schumachers-record/article31949680.ece

30 June 2020||KOLKATA,||‘Must develop the attitude of a winner’||Even after more than three months, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Gaurav Solanki rues the missed opportunity in the Asia-Oceania Olympic boxing qualifying event in Amman, Jordan, and is keen to learn from the experience. After returning to the country, Solanki, who lost in the pre-quarterfinals of the 57kg qualifier, went straight to the Army Sports Institute (ASI), Pune, to continue with his training and iron out his deficiencies. Disappointing “It was disappointing, but it was a big learning curve for me. I had an opportunity to qualify for the Olympics. I made some mistakes and needed to work on those,” Solanki told The Hindu . Solanki, who had secured his Commonwealth Games gold in 52kg in 2018, said he needed to strengthen his attack. “I just need to attack more even while defending solidly. That’s why I came to the ASI to focus on my game instead of spending time at home.” The long lockdown was an opportunity for the soft-spoken Solanki to have a re-look at his game. “This is the best time to stop a bit and think about my game and make it better. Also, this is the time to improve strength and fitness.” Asked how he adjusted to the methods of different coaching staff, the 23-year-old said, “The coaches at the ASI and the National camp discuss in which areas I need to work and what kind of training I need to do. We coordinate and find a way.” Strong opposition Facing strong opposition from at least four equally good boxers in his weight class in the country, the boxer from Faridabad appeared ready for the tough road ahead. “I know there is strong opposition, everyone is trying to prove his worth. I must develop the attitude of a winner and tell myself that I can win a medal in the Olympics,” said Solanki.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/must-develop-the-attitude-of-a-winner/article31949750.ece
30 June 2020||London,||Talking points ahead of the start||As Formula One gets ready to start the 2020 season, a few things to watch out for. Can Hamilton refocus to land seventh title? The main threat to Lewis Hamilton’s bid to land a record-equalling seventh drivers’ title is likely to be himself. But the sport’s first black champion has admitted he is committed to racing for more than personal or team triumphs. “I’m racing for all of you out there who may feel that you don’t have a voice,” said the Briton. Verstappen’s chance to seize the day? Having proved his speed and talent, this is the time for Max Verstappen and Red Bull to seize the moment and emerge from the opening trio of races as the leaders. A year ago, the young Dutchman bullied his way to victory at the Red Bull Ring and will be keen to win again. Will Vettel shine in final season with Ferrari? After confirming he is leaving Ferrari at the end of this year, Sebastian Vettel may feel freed and capable of delivering the consistency and speed that can inspire the team again despite the threat of Charles Leclerc from the other side of the garage. What now for the talented Russell? George Russell and Williams face a defining season after the British team was put up for sale during the lockdown. Russell is tipped to have a big future, but needs a stronger team in 2021 to prove himself unless Williams finds some resurgent form and haul itself off the bottom of the championship. Russell made good use of the lockdown to become F1’s ‘virtual champion’ during e-racing from his home computer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/talking-points-ahead-of-the-start/article31949753.ece
30 June 2020||CHENNAI,||The importance of strength training||Sports medicine expert Dr. Kannan Pugazhendi, who has been associated with national teams in sports like cricket, hockey, and football, stressed on the need for more wooden courts to improve basketball in the country at a webinar organised by the Integrated Basketball Players Association (IBPA). Speaking on the topic of improving ‘Strength and Fitness in Basketball’, Dr. Kannan said, “India lacks wooden courts and most of the players have to train on cemented courts. “The surface needs to get better if we want our players to jump like [Michael] Jordan and [Kobe] Bryant.” Proper jump technique Elaborating on the aspect of jumping, former Jamaican Olympian (discus throw) Dr. Allison Randall, the strength and conditioning coach for women’s basketball at Vanderbilt University (USA), said “strength is the driving factor in this. “Players need to work on how to adjust their weight. They need to have velocity weight training. “The most important thing in the jump is the landing and players need to focus on how to do so that they don’t hurt their ankles. “A player has to train from toe to head to do it.” Core-strength training Dr. Kannan also added, “In India, there is a lot more focus on movement but core-strength training is lacking. Strength is necessary for power. “It is the core of power. Strength is the beginning while power is the outcome and this is the main reason why strength training should be taken seriously.” The session was moderated by former international Balakrishnan Jayaram and Jayshankar Menon, Asian All Star player and secretary-general of IBPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-importance-of-strength-training/article31949748.ece
30 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||Gunning for an Olympic medal: Rajani||E. Rajani, the 29-year-old Indian women’s hockey goalkeeper, said the players are dreaming of making it big at the next Olympics and leave a rich legacy. “We, as a team, are gunning for an Olympic medal, preferably gold. Having failed to make an impact in the 2016 edition, we have always been keen to create history and leave a legacy to inspire the younger generation,” she said in a chat with The Hindu . Rajani was training at NIS Bengaluru along with the national team when the lockdown was imposed. “I believe the lockdown, when we were in the NIS, gave us a chance to improve overall. That one extra year of experience before the next Olympics will have a positive impact on the team by way of exposure,” said Rajani, a native of Chittoor. “The players came together as a unit under the mentorship of coach Sjoerd Marijine and utilised the lockdown break to help the team bond as a cohesive unit. I feel we will only get better as a team because even the younger players will have that one extra year of experience before stepping into next year’s Olympics” she said. Rajani has played in 91 internationals, including the 2010 World Cup, Commonwealth Games and the 2016 Rio Olympics. “The team has been following the fitness schedule given by scientific advisor Wayne Lombard, focusing on maintaining physical and mental health.”  The support base for Indian women’s hockey team has increased after we made it to 2016 Rio Olympics||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gunning-for-an-olympic-medal-rajani/article31949926.ece
30 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Jobby living a dream||Three years ago Jobby Justin took a bold decision and left his job with the KSEB to chase his dreams in the Kolkata. He has no regrets and after three India caps the 26-year-old striker is living his dream. However, Jobby doesn’t want anyone to blindly follow him. “Don’t follow me. I won’t advice anyone to leave a good government job. But if you have confidence in your ability and the will to work hard you can succeed at the highest level,’’ he told a group of trainees of the LIFFA Academy in a web chat on Monday. The COVID-19 pandemic has kept him mostly indoors at his home in Vettucadu. But the striker is keeping himself fit by following a strict diet and fitness regime given by his ATK fitness trainer. Fitness schedule “It is off-season for me now but you still need to maintain a certain level of fitness. The weekly schedule is sent on whatsapp by the trainer and there are certain set of exercises which you have to do on each day. Though it is difficult to maintain a strict diet when you are at home I resist the temptation to eat oily food. I have learnt that having lesser fat in your body helps you to maintain your fitness for longer duration during a match,’’ he said. Jobby said figuring in two Kolkata derby matches and scoring two goals were the big moments of his career. “I had heard of this derby matches even before I landed it Kolkata. But it was a great experience to be part of it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jobby-living-a-dream/article31949986.ece
30 June 2020||MUMBAI,||Nitin Menon included in ICC Elite Panel||Nitin Menon has become the third Indian umpire to be included in the ICC’s Elite Panel of umpires, with cricket’s governing body announcing his elevation to the top tier on Monday. Ever since officiating in his maiden First Class match as a 28-year-old in 2011-12, Nitin has emerged as one of the most consistent umpires in Indian cricket. This is reflected in the fact that he already has featured in three Tests, 24 ODIs and 16 T20Is in men’s cricket. The 36-year-old from Indore has also stood in 10 women's T20Is, including the 2018 and 2020 T20 World Cups. Nitin, who made two List A appearances for Madhya Pradesh in the zonal one-dayers in 2004, joins S. Venkataraghavan and S. Ravi in the club of Indians who have made it to the Elite Panel. His father, Narendra, was also an international umpire and a First Class cricketer. Nikhil, his younger brother, has been officiating in age-group cricket as part of the BCCI panel. Calculated risk Nitin admitted that it was a calculated risk to shift focus to umpiring. “I realised that I wasn’t that good a cricketer to sustain [myself] at the First Class level, so we discussed it at home and decided to concentrate on umpiring instead. It was a calculated risk but I am glad it has worked for me,” Nitin told The Hindu . “He [Menon Sr.] is also delighted, but ever since our childhood, we have never discussed cricket at home. And the same rule applies even now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nitin-menon-included-in-icc-elite-panel/article31949695.ece

30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Happy living for the elderly||Up in the hills of Dehradun, Ren Madan celebrated his 92nd birthday last week with his wife Leontine, 89, and their friends. They wore masks and gloves, and maintained the physical distancing norms of our COVID-19 times, as they gathered in the dining hall of the Antara Senior Living residential home, to cut a birthday cake baked by the wellness staff. “Had I been in my home in Manali now, it would not have been possible to take care of things amidst the present restrictions,” says the senior-most resident at the facility. He and Leontine will celebrate their 65th wedding anniversary next month, unsure of when they will be able to meet their two children, both doctors in the US. Last month, the Madans had to be content with participating in the marriage ceremony of their granddaughter on a Zoom call. All things considered though, the birthday celebration “is a nice feeling that helps to push away dark thoughts especially during these trying times,” says Ren, who is learning Spanish now. “We are kept engaged like back in school,” he adds with a laugh.  Seniors at risk  As one of the most vulnerable groups, the management and staff of several senior citizens’ homes are taking precautions to keep residents (including its staff) safe physically, while helping people interact with precautions, to take care of mental health too. Antara, for instance, went into lockdown a week before it was officially announced. “This allowed us time to prepare the residents mentally, stock up essentials, make provisions for the staff to stay on the campus, plan regular counselling sessions and fun activities while having zero contact with the external environment,” says Tara Singh Vachani, the Executive Chairman. She says they have not reduced staff strength to make sure emergencies are taken care of in the same way they would have before the lockdown. Locked in Miles away, 75-year-old Prema Viswanathan living in Vanaprastha, a senior citizens’ home near Coimbatore, says she had a vertigo attack and the staff was at her doorstep to take her to the clinic after she made an intercom call. The management has made arrangements for the staff (that includes nursing assistants, helpers, cleaners and cooks) to stay back on the campus during the entire period of the lockdown. “Nobody is allowed to leave the premises and no outsider is allowed entry. Supplies are ordered over the phone and the delivery boy leaves them at the gate to minimise the risk of transmission of the coronavirus,” she says. It’s the same for those at the Nana Nani Homes, Ananya Shelters’ signature project in Coimbatore. S Geetha, from the management says, they have shut the gates of their society ever since the lockdown. The supplies are ordered over the phone and after the delivery boys leave them at the gate, the items (such as milk packets, fruits and vegetables) are given a thorough wash before being brought inside. “All this may take some extra time and labour, but we cannot afford to put a single resident at risk,” she says. The place has been out of bounds even for the family members of the elderly residents.  Interacting with caution  The need now is to balance the humane needs with rigour and protocol, says Major Sathyanarayanan Parthasarathy, co-founder, Melur Meadows Retirement Village near Mettupalayam (Coimbatore). Much before the COVID-19 lockdown, he says, the group had built houses spread across the luxury of greenery, open space, air and sunlight. Given the layout, it has not been difficult to help residents keep physical distance. “Sometimes, they’d come together for activities — cooking, baking, gardening, farming — and we make sure they do these activities in small batches,” he says. For instance, the yoga sessions earlier were conducted in batches of six; now only two people attend a class. “We are delivering meals to every resident’s home instead of asking them to compulsorily come to the dining area. Our service care providers hand over the food to the residents and collect the utensils later,” he says. Regulations in the dining hall at Nana Nani Homes has made CN Andal more confident of going in to eat, rather than eating her food alone. “Earlier, many of us could sit around a table and chat and eat, but now the number of tables has been reduced and only two residents are allowed to sit at one table,” she says and adds that the entire area is well protected and regularly sanitised. “Though we have to be alert, I do not feel worried of catching the infection here,” she says. Staying in touch She misses meeting her grandchildren, whom she visits in summer. “But the staff make sure I do not feel lonely. They take turns to visit me and help me do the Skype calls with my family.” Besides routine temperature, pulse and oxygen level checks for every staff member and resident, retirement homes are also looking at arranging for indoor games, simple exercises, spiritual talks, or movie screenings. “We want them to bond and let them meet in small groups as permitted under the protocol for the activities they enjoy doing,” says Sathyanarayanan.  Age in place  Dr AB Dey, Head, Department of Geriatric Medicine, AIIMS Delhi, says that alarmist news makes senior citizens fear death more than a person who has the day’s busy-ness to keep them distracted. He says there are ways of developing a positive attitude to help keep stress levels down:  Step out of the room and get some sunshine daily.  Keep walking at intervals even if it is around the house, on the terrace or balcony.  Practise deep breathing.  Gently push yourself to do some safe and simple stretching and bending exercises.  Follow a quarantine routine for meals and sleep.  However tough it may be, do smile.   Keeping up the spirits  Dr Sheetal Bidkar, clinical psychologist, Suasth One Step Clinic, Mumbai, suggests family members pitch in with the following:  Be an empathetic listener  Expand family duties to mean seniors are included in most daily activities at home  Quiet companionship is also important  Acknowledge their concern for anything so that they do not hide or mask their feelings, loneliness or depression.  Ask for consent before helping them  Help them revive hobbies or habits  Initiate them into solving crosswords, puzzles and Sudoku for cognitive alertness  Keep in touch over the phone if they are away from you||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/happy-living-for-the-elderly/article31950096.ece

30 June 2020||CHANDIGARH,||‘Return Chinese firms’ donations to PM CARES’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday said donations by Chinese firms to PM CARES Fund should be immediately returned by the Centre amid the ongoing stand-off between India and China. “Various amounts have been received in PM CARES Fund from Chinese companies. At a time when confrontation is going on, I think the money should be returned. We need to take a tough stance on China. We can’t take Chinese money while our soldiers are being killed. Firstly, they (China) are responsible for COVID-19 and secondly, they are responsible for aggression against my country. India doesn’t need Chinese money to look after itself,” said Capt. Amarinder at a press conference here. On the issue of reopening the Kartarpur Corridor in the backdrop of Pakistan’s offer, the Chief Minister said he was in favour of opening the corridor with adherence to social distancing norms, but it’s the Central government that has to take a decision. With necessary arrangements in place to combat any emergent situation to tackle COVID-19, Capt. Amarinder expressed hope that there would be no further lockdown. He, however, made it clear that he would act firmly to not let novel coronavirus spread in Punjab. He said that COVID-19 testing capacity would be enhanced to 20,000 per day by July-end from 10,000 per day currently with the addition of four new testing labs. “The State has adequate equipment to manage any further spread of the pandemic,” he said. “In the first stage, 4,248 beds in government hospitals had been set aside, with another 2,014 now being added, while the private hospitals had allocated 950 beds for COVID-19 patients. The total number of isolation centres identified to accommodate a large number of cases if the crisis aggravates stands at 52 government and 195 private ones,” he said. ‘Abide by rules’ The Chief Minister said he was perturbed over reports of people being fined for violating the health safety measures and warned them to abide by the precautionary health guidelines not only to ensure their own safety but of the entire State. The Chief Minister added that migrant labourers that had left are now returning to Punjab as they envision job potential in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/return-chinese-firms-donations-to-pm-cares/article31949888.ece
30 June 2020||New Delhi,||COVID-19 cases drop for third successive day||The number of new COVID-19 cases in Delhi fell for the third straight day with 2,084 new COVID-19 cases being reported in the past 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Monday. The fresh cases have taken the total number of cases to 85,161. Also, 57 more deaths have been reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths to 2,680. Of the total cases, 56,235 people have recovered and there are 26,246 active cases. The number of new cases was 3,460 on Friday and it fell to 2,948 on Saturday, 2,889 on Sunday and 2,084 on Monday. The number of active cases has also come down for the second consecutive day — the figure was 28,329 on Saturday and fell to 27,847 on Sunday and 26,246 on Monday. After a Delhi government order to review and redesign containment zones on June 22, the number of containment zones has increased from 261 on June 22 to 435 on Monday, according to the bulletin. The redesigning was part of a ‘Revised COVID Response Plan’ decided by the Delhi government, based on directions from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on June 21.  In the same directions by the MHA, it was mentioned that a 100% survey of containment zones is to be done by June 30 and a comprehensive survey of the rest of Delhi will be done by July 6. On Monday evening, the MHA said that the dates have been extended due to the increase in number of containment zones. “Door-to-door survey will be done first in containment zones on priority basis by July 6 [date extended as numbers of containment zones has increased to 435]. This will be followed by door to door survey in entire Delhi,” the MHA spokesperson said on Monday night. Before the statement, there was confusion in many of the 11 districts of the city on whether to carry out survey in areas beyond the containment zones, according to multiple Delhi government officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-19-cases-drop-for-third-successive-day/article31949883.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Being punished instead of rewarded’||There was total system failure from February 24-26 in the Capital — where all the powerful people reside — as riots ripped through north-east Delhi, but I am being punished for helping people, said M.A. Anwar, owner of Al-Hind Hospital in Jafrabad. His name has found mention in a riots-related chargesheet recently submitted by the Delhi police. “The police saw me as a hurdle. That is probably the reason why they decided that they should defame me. By doing this, they are sending a message, so that no one tries to help the victims,” he claimed. “ Jis kaam ke liye mujhe reward dena chahiye tha… aaj mujhe punish kiya ja raha hai, pareshan kiya ja raha hai [For the work they should have rewarded me, they are punishing and harassing me]”. On Monday, Dr. Anwar was treating a seven-year-old girl at the hospital, packed with patients. The girl, with a severe burn injury on her right foot, was wailing in pain during the examination. “This injury was also caused during the riots. A part of her foot has still not healed,” he said. Those three days of communal violence and the aftermath are vivid in his memory. It was followed by police questioning during the month of Ramzan. On February 24, Dr. Anwar returned from Bihar after attending a funeral of a relative. As soon as he reached the hospital that day, severely injured people started coming in. Due to the barricades installed by the police in the area, they could not be shifted to better hospitals. Dr. Anwar moved the High Court through his advocate Suroor Mander, and in a midnight hearing, Justice S. Muralidhar ordered safe passage of patients. “That is probably what ticked off the police ,” he said. Selfless service Dr. Anwar recalled how people kept coming in with grave injuries for over three days after the violence ended. “I would treat one and the other would start crying in pain. In this small hospital, we treated people without asking for their name, caste, class, religion, address and without asking for money,” he said. On the first floor, right above the hospital, he gave refuge to people whose houses were damaged in the riots. Dr. Anwar added that he was in constant touch with police officers, including senior officers, informing them about the situation and also asking for help. “The mob wanted to set a sweetshop on fire, I stood in front of them and stopped it. I got to know that another shop was being set ablaze, I called officers and informed them about it,” he added. In the chargesheet, the police have stated that Dr. Anwar was one of the organisers of the protest at Farooqia Masjid. However, the doctor said that he, in fact, had called the police to clear the protest as the gathering created problems while commuting, “I never even visited the protest site.” In the month of Ramzan, Dr. Anwar was called in for questioning by the Special Cell and Crime Branch at least six times. “The experience was harrowing. They would ask me questions like who served biryani at the protest, water at the protest… give us names… questions I had no answers to,” he said. Dr. Anwar was allegedly made to stand outside the unit’s office for hours in the heat while observing fast. “What else can we call harassment? I got so dehydrated and weak during that time that I still haven’t recovered,” he said, adding that COVID-19 guidelines of sanitising spaces were not followed in the room that he used to be questioned in. Death threats On May 15, Dr. Anwar, through his advocate, also sent a complaint via email to police officers stating that he was feeling scared as he had received threat calls on WhatsApp from international numbers wherein the caller allegedly said that the doctor foiled their plan of killing several members of the Muslim community. The doctor also alleged that the police, during questioning, threatened to slap stricter sections against him. His family, including wife and two minor children, are scared for him. “She is afraid. I tell her that if we stand with the truth, there will be hurdles coming our way. We haven’t done anything wrong, we have only served the people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/being-punished-instead-of-rewarded/article31949852.ece
30 June 2020||June 30 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Bhonsle’ movie review: This Manoj Bajpayee-starrer is an agent of anger and gloom||Devashish Makhija’s Bhonsle has smothered me with a bleakness that just refuses to slack off. And I say this in a good way. Desolation cries out loud in the film through the sentient silence of retired cop Ganpat Bhonsle (Manoj Bajpayee), struggling to get a service extension. It echoes in his dark, dank and shabby room in Mumbai’s Churchill chawl; the meagre, repetitive meals of pav and dal; the grubby utensils and the dysfunctional transistor. There is his own resistance towards human contact of any kind, loath as he is to even accept greetings from the new north Indian neighbour Sita (Ipshita Chakraborty Singh) and her brother Lalu (Virat Vaibhav). On the other hand, is the inability to fight the continual, ominous visitations of a crow. Bhonsle cuts a grim figure — an island unto himself in the vast sea of humanity — and, along with the dismal space that he inhabits, becomes a persuasive agent of gloom. Makhija’s languorous build-up isn’t just about striking a mood or underlining the urban heart of darkness but also making it palpable so it jumps out from the screen to reach the viewer.  The other driving force in the film is anger. Pushed deep inside the recesses of Bhonsle’s heart and mind but simmering on in the face of humiliating solicitations he has to make towards his seniors. There are parallel wraths — of a Marathi cab driver Vilas (Santosh Juvekar) and several others like him — towards the migrants from north India, supposedly robbing them of their jobs and more, that too in their own home turf. It’s a rage fuelled by local politicians and meets with an angry, but somehow capped and contained, backlash from the migrants, like Rajendra (Abhishek Banerjee). All of these strands span the Ganpati festivities — from the making of the idols to their visarjan. Irony is that all the three people, seemingly polar opposites of each other, aren’t united merely by the rage they share in common — righteous in one, entitled in another and retaliatory when it comes to the third. They also partake in a collective reality — of being marginalised, dispossessed and tormented in their own unique way. At the receiving end of the power dynamics themselves, they perpetuate it further to the weaker ones. The intense crescendo of brutality towards the end, however, left me feeling both devastated as well as a trifle troubled in how it seeks violence as a tool for collective catharsis and specially with an intelligent, bright woman forced to be at the receiving end of the worst. But these quibbles apart, though Bhonsle might be set in another time and deals with hatred of a specific kind, it feels prescient for the here and now because hate hasn’t quite died amongst us. The emotion has just shifted shape to become even more multifaceted and demonic. And the insider-outsider debate at the film’s heart couldn’t have struck a more ironical note when a vast number of the migrants in Mumbai have emigrated back home even as the city waits for them to return for its own selfish needs. Competent cast Makhija harnesses a competent set of actors to great effect, be it Juvekar, Chakraborty Singh or Banerjee. Bajpayee is astounding in his internalisation of Bhonsle and acts with not just his face but by deploying his whole body — from his sullen, disinterested look to the weighed down, drooping shoulders to the unsure gait and misanthropic ways. From being a mute witness of misdemeanours to the bearer of a boundless personal tragedy to a ferocious moral force — he conveys it all in a measured manner. Virat Vaibhav is wonderfully vulnerable as Lalu, the reluctant offender with a heightened awareness of his guilt. He and Bajpayee together are the keepers of the sanctity of the chawl’svachanalaya(public reading room) and the film’s conscience at large. Bhonslepremiered at the 2018 Busan International Film Festival and also played the same year at the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival and Dharamshala International Film Festival. The film dropped on June 26 on Sony Liv and is currently streaming there.

30 June 2020||New Delhi,||High Court stays NLU’s decision to reserve 50% seats for city students||In a significant verdict, the Delhi High Court on Monday stayed the operation of a decision by the National Law University (NLU), Delhi, to reserve 50% seats for candidates from the city, saying it was taken in “haste without acting in accordance with the NLU Act”. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad remarked that “grave prejudice” would be caused to the students who would be applying for admission in NLU, Delhi for the academic year 2020-21 if the January 14 admission notification was not stayed. “In fact, staying the operation of the impugned notification insofar as horizontal reservation of seats for students belonging to Delhi has been provided for the academic year 2020-21, would result in inviting a larger section of students,” the court said. Last year NLU, Delhi, received 24,000 applications for admission, but the number of applications dwindled to around 18,000 this year. “This significant reduction in the number of applications received by the respondent NLU, Delhi, is a telling comment on the change made in the admission policy for the academic year 2020-21,” the Bench said. The court’s decision came on two separate petitions challenging the admission notification issued by NLU, Delhi, earlier this year for admitting students to the BA LL.B (Five Year Programme) and LL.M (One Year Programme), providing 50% horizontal reservation to candidates who have passed the qualifying examination from a recognized school/ college/ institute located within the NCT of Delhi. The court, additionally, directed NLU, Delhi to maintain ‘status quo ante as of the previous academic year’ for making admissions the academic year 2020-21. ‘No effect on exams’ The NLU, Delhi was also directed to issue a public notice on or before July 2, informing the public at large about the decision taken by the High Court and granting a further period of one week from the date of issuance of public notice to enable interested candidates to submit their applications for admission. The redrawn schedule will not interfere with the entrance examinations that are to take place in August 2020, the court clarified.  Staying the operation of the impugned notification, insofar as horizontal reservation of seats for those belonging to Delhi has been provided for 2020-21, would result in inviting a larger section of students High Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/high-court-stays-nlus-decision-to-reserve-50-seats-for-city-students/article31949849.ece
30 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Congress leaders detained for protesting hike in fuel prices||The Delhi Congress on Monday carried out protests outside several fuel stations in the Capital to protest against the fuel price rise. The party alleged that the Centre and the Delhi government, under pressure from oil companies, had hiked the prices 22 times in less than a month. Petrol now costs Rs. 80.43 per litre and diesel costs Rs. 80.53 per litre in the Capital. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar rode to Raj Niwas on a horse cart to submit a memorandum to the Lt. Governor to be forwarded to the President seeking a roll back of the fuel prices. However, Mr. Kumar, along with other party leaders, were detained outside the Civil Lines petrol pump. Biased attitude The Delhi Congress alleged that the police was acting in a partisan manner as cases were filed against Congress leaders, while BJP leaders and workers were left scot-free when they organised demonstrations. “We have held 49 people for staging protest without any permission. A case has been registered under IPC section 188 [Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant] and National Disaster Management Act at Civil Lines police station. All the protesters were released on personal bond and eight bull carts have been impounded,” said a senior officer. Mr. Kumar said that the fuel price hike has resulted in diesel becoming costlier than petrol in Delhi for the first time, and demanded a rollback in excise duty by the Central government and VAT by the Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-congress-leaders-detained-for-protesting-hike-in-fuel-prices/article31949855.ece
30 June 2020||GUWAHATI,||Guwahati goes into total lockdown||Guwahati and its outskirts under Kamrup (Metropolitan) district went into total lockdown from Monday following the community spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 14-day lockdown ends on July 12. All government and private offices, commercial establishments, shops, industrial establishments and places of worship remained closed on Monday. Specified fuel outlets, pharmacies and hospitals were allowed to operate. The roads wore a deserted look as the authorities banned the movement of all vehicles except ambulances and those belonging to security personnel and journalists. 26 arrested Twenty-six people were arrested for lockdown violation and 112 others were booked for using vehicles for ‘non-necessary’purposes on Monday. The police warned of action against lockdown violators and said drones would be used in areas that have had a tendency to disobey restrictions. “We will be very tough against lockdown violators who will face legal action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code,” Guwahati Police Commissioner Munna Prasad Gupta said. There were reports of overzealous police personnel getting rough with people engaged in essential services. The police allegedly assaulted a pump operator of the Water Resources Department while attending to his duty of pumping out rainwater in a part of the city. The Opposition Congress was critical of the total lockdown. The total lockdown in Guwahati made Meghalaya take a similar decision, but in areas bordering the principal Assam city. The southern part of Guwahati adjoins Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya. “We took the decision due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in Assam. Inter-State movement continues to be restricted,” Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said. In Manipur, Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren said the existing lockdown will be extended till July 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/guwahati-goes-into-total-lockdown/article31949890.ece

Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta alleged the citizens were getting electricity bills of up to 94 days without subsidy and the Kejriwal government's “silence” on the issue was “proving” that power company sent “huge bills” with their consent. “Even after 2 lakh small and big industries were closed in lockdown, huge electricity bills have been charged from them through fixed charges and average bills. There are more than 7 lakh shops and offices in Delhi from whom huge electricity bills are also being charged in the name of these charges,” he alleged. “Messages are being sent to disconnect the electricity connection if the bills are not paid, which shows the inhuman behaviour and insensitivity of the Delhi government. The BJP demands that the benefit of subsidy be given to consumers and the fixed charge in electricity bills of commercial places should be removed with immediate effect,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-accuses-aap-govt-of-rs-1131-crore-power-scam/article31949857.ece

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Delhi government, said that at a time when four doctors have succumbed to COVID-19, with thousands more infected and the government is hard-pressed to find manpower to manage the system, it was “unfortunate” and “preposterous” that a contempt petition has been filed.
