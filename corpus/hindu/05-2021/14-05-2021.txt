14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sputnik-V shots to be available in India next week, says govt.||The Sputnik-V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya National Centre of Russia, will be available in India from early next week, NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul said on Thursday. “We are also proactively engaging with foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson, asking them to apply for emergency use authorisation in India so that these vaccines can be easily imported and made available in India. Simultaneously, we, along with other like-minded countries, are stressing on IPR waiver for the COVID-19 vaccines. These two interventions, taken in conjunction, will ensure easy availability of vaccines not only in India but globally too,” Dr. Paul said at a press conference. ‘Initial hiccups’ Stating that overall 216 crore doses of vaccines could be available in India between August and December, Dr. Paul said, “The current mismatch in demand and supply is just an initial dynamic situation, which is being faced across the world.” Speaking about Sputnik-V, Dr. Paul said local production is expected to begin in July at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories in Hyderabad. Sputnik-V was given emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller-General of India (DCGI) in April and was first approved in Russia last year. The Ministry, in a statement, said allegations about the delay in licensing for Covaxin and the delayed approval for technology transfer for manufacturing Covaxin were baseless.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sputnik-v-shots-to-be-available-in-india-next-week-says-govt/article34553395.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why not place convicts under house arrest, asks SC||The Supreme Court has thrown open the door to the legislature to “ponder” over the idea of placing convicts under house arrest to avoid overcrowding of prisons. A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and K.M. Joseph, in a judgment, highlighted the “alarming” statistics of prisons. The suggestion is relevant considering the spread of COVID-19. A few days ago, a Bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, issued a series of directions, including the grant of interim bail and parole to prisoners to decongest prisons. Justice Joseph said the occupancy rate in prisons had climbed to 118.5% in 2019. The court referred to the National Crime Records Bureau’s figures of 2019 to show that 18,86,092 inmates were admitted in jails. The number of undertrial prisoners in 2019 was 3,30,487, which, in fact, constituted 69.05% of the total number of prisoners. Secondly, a very large sum (Rs. 6818.1 crore) was the budget for prisons. The “tremendous” overcrowding of prisons and the huge budget were both “relevant in the context of the possibilities that house arrest offers”, the court noted. It concluded that “as regards post-conviction cases, we would leave it open to the legislature to ponder over its employment. We have indicated the problems of overcrowding of prisons and the cost to the State in maintaining prisons”. The 206-page judgment was based on a plea for default bail filed by activist Gautam Navlakha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/why-not-place-convicts-under-house-arrest-asks-sc/article34553391.ece
14 May 2021||Kolkata,||Dhankhar ignores Mamata view, visits riot-hit areas||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday visited areas affected by post-election violence in Cooch Behar, ignoring Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s disapproval. She called it “unilateral proceedings” by the Governor, “violative of long-standing norms of procedures”. Senior Trinamool Congress leaders sharply criticised the Governor’s move. During the day, Mr. Dhankhar visited Mathabhanga and Dinhata, where he met family members of those affected by the violence. At one place in Dinhata, a group of people raised “go back” slogans. Mr. Dhankhar got down from his vehicle and said, “The situation reflected a total collapse of rule of law.” He chided a police officer, saying he should be aware of where the Governor’s convoy was heading. ‘People in fear’ “I have seen fear in the eyes of the people. Houses of the people have been looted,” he said. Mr. Dhankhar was accompanied by Nisith Pramanik, BJP MP from Cooch Behar. In the evening, he took to social media, saying he was distressed by the grim situation. “Visited several affected areas. Distressed at grim scenario. After listening to tales of sorrow no tears left in my eyes. Never imagined severity of post poll retributive violence @Mamata Official was much beyond. One is made to pay with life and rights for voting!” he tweeted. The Governor held a press conference at the Cooch Behar Circuit Office. On Friday, he will visit areas in neighbouring Assam. Former Union Minister and senior Trinamool leader Yashwant Sinha alleged that the West Bengal Governor was “acting according to a script provided to him by Modi/Shah”. “The West Bengal Governor is acting according to a script provided to him by Modi/Shah, who have not yet accepted their miserable defeat in the elections and who have no respect for the Constitution of India. They will never leave Mamata in peace,” Mr. Sinha tweeted. Trinamool leader and MP Saugata Roy said the party had earlier approached the President seeking recall of the Governor. “We can again approach the President if our party chairperson Mamata Banerjee advises us to do so,” Mr. Roy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dhankhar-ignores-mamata-view-visits-riot-hit-areas/article34553393.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre’s SC affidavit jars with TRIPS stand||Public health advocates and intellectual property rights experts point to a “contradiction” in India’s global push for suspension of intellectual property protection with its stand in the Supreme Court that bringing COVID-19 vaccines under a statutory regime will be “counter-productive” at this stage. India, along with South Africa, had initiated a proposal for the temporary waiver of certain provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to facilitate fair, affordable and universal access of COVID vaccines and medicines, especially for developing countries. The two countries had highlighted that some WTO members had carried out urgent legal amendments to their national patent laws to expedite the process of issuing compulsory/government use licences. However, experts point to an affidavit filed by the Centre in the SC on May 9, which shows the government taking a different stand in favour of protection of intellectual property rights. “Any exercise of statutory powers either under the Patents Act, 1970 read with TRIPS Agreement and Doha Declaration or in any other way can only prove to be counter-productive at this stage,” the Centre said in the affidavit. The government said that it is “very actively engaging itself with global organisations at a diplomatic level to find out a solution in the best possible interest of India”. In fact, the Centre even goes to the extent of issuing a word of caution that “any discussion or a mention of exercise of statutory powers either for essential drugs or vaccines having patent issues would have serious, severe and unintended adverse consequences in the country’s efforts being made on global platform using all its resources, good-will and good-offices through diplomatic and other channels”. An April 30 order of the SC had “flagged” the legal framework within which the Centre could “possibly consider compulsory licensing and government acquisition of patents”. However, not all are impressed by the balancing act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centres-sc-affidavit-jars-with-trips-stand/article34553398.ece

Health, Medical and Family Welfare Principal Secretary Anil Kumar Singhal, at a press conference, said tenders were invited on Thursday and the bids could be filed within three weeks (June 3). He said there would be a pre-bid meeting in a week or 10 days and good response was expected as Andhra Pradesh was the first State to announce decision to buy vaccines from foreign firms. Mr. Singhal said many other States were contemplating floating global tenders now. With the lack of sufficient supply of vaccine to the State from the Centre as well as the two manufacturers in the country, the State had requested the Centre to share vaccine formula with other companies to ramp up production. Mr. Singhal said the State was requesting more allocation of medical oxygen and Remdesivir by the Centre. He said 599 metric tonnes against 590 metric tonnes allocated by the Centre was drawn from the plants in the past day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-floats-global-tenders-for-vaccines/article34553352.ece

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||China told to keep prices stable||India has asked Chinese authorities to ensure prices for key medical supplies remain stable as costs for oxygen concentrators and other critical goods have surged on the back of rising demand. “Our expectation at this point is that the supply chain should remain open and product prices should remain stable,” Priyanka Chauhan, India’s Consul General in Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post . “Even if there is a little bit of supply demand pressure, there has to be some stability and predictability to product prices,” Ms. Chauhan said. “And there has to be a sense of governmental level support and efforts. I don’t have the information as to how much influence the Chinese government can have in this matter but if they can, then it would be welcome.” Chinese media are reporting that oxygen concentrators that were listed as selling for 1,000 yuan (around Rs. 11,000) on Chinese e-commerce websites such as Alibaba’s Taobao are now selling for four or five times that amount and the final cost borne by individual buyers once the goods are sold in India is even higher. Ms. Chauhan “appreciated the need for travel bans based on public health concerns, but added that India was asking China to facilitate cargo flights so that supplies could be delivered”, the South China Morning Post reported, adding that “state-owned Sichuan Airlines Logistics suspended cargo flights to India for 15 days last month in response to the surge, which the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India warned would have a cascading effect on supply chains”. “Unreasonable control should be avoided and transport linkages should be maintained,” she said, adding that a phone call between the two Foreign Ministers had helped with some approvals but flights had not yet returned to the same frequency as earlier. Since April, orders for at least 40,000 oxygen concentrators have been placed by Indian companies with Chinese firms, of which 21,000 have so far been delivered, along with more than 5,000 ventilators, 21 million face masks and 3,800 tons of medicines, according to Chinese customs figures. On Sunday, the first batch of 100 oxygen concentrators and 40 ventilators donated by the Red Cross Society of China arrived on a cargo flight from China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-told-to-keep-prices-stable/article34553301.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||OCIs stung by Home Ministry notification||The Home Ministry’s March 4 order that required professional Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), such as journalists, engineers and researchers, to notify the Ministry about their activities in India has left them in the lurch. A portal that was to come up for the purpose is not operational yet. A Ministry official said it was delayed as several officials in the Ministry’s Foreigners Division had tested positive for COVID-19 in the past month. The official said the OCIs could intimate the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) through e-mail till the portal is activated. Rajanna Sreedhara, president of the Association of Resident OCI and Families (AROCIF), said they believed the notification was discriminatory adding that they planned to challenge it in the High Court but the plan is currently on the back burner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NRI quota seats On March 4, the Ministry issued a gazette notification that OCI cardholders could claim “only NRI (Non-Resident Indian) quota seats” in educational institutions. It specified that OCIs could only pursue the following professions — doctors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists, advocates, architects and chartered accountants, and the rest would require “special permission”. OCIs are of Indian origin but hold foreign passports. India does not allow dual citizenship but provides certain benefits under Section 7B(I) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 to the OCIs. So far, 37.72 lakh OCI Cards are said to have been issued. The notification said that OCIs shall be required to obtain a “special permission or a special permit” from the competent authority or the FRRO or the Indian mission “to undertake research, missionary or Tabligh or mountaineering or journalistic activities or internship in any foreign diplomatic missions”. “The notification does not mention IT professionals, a large number of OCIs are engineers; so will they have to apply for employment visa? It says permission required to conduct research ... this will place undue burden on scientific, pharmaceutical, medical, biotechnology and other research fields,” Dr Sreehdara said. “Even if an OCI student has secured a high rank in an exam like NEET [National Eligibility Entrance Test], several institutions of repute do not have NRI seats. The exorbitantly high fees under the NRI quota cannot be afforded by many OCIs as they live and work in India. India-domiciled OCI students are deprived of domicile status both in India [country of residence] as well as the country of their citizenship,” Dr. Sreedhara said. Anjana Hulse, an OCI and Bengaluru resident, said her son secured All India Rank 2 in the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana examinations held by the government, but added, “We are not sure of getting admission in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ocis-stung-by-home-ministry-notification/article34553328.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||India still resists community spread tag||In spite of adding the highest number of COVID-19 infections to the global caseload every day, India continues to label itself as a country with no community transmission (CT), opting instead for the lower, less serious classification called “cluster of cases”, according to the latest weekly report by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 11. Countries such as the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, France — and a perusal of the list of over 190 countries suggest the majority — have all labelled themselves as being in “community transmission”. Among the 10 countries with the most number of confirmed cases, only Italy and Russia do not label themselves as being in community transmission. Both countries have been on a declining trajectory for at least a month and together contribute fewer than 20,000 cases a day — about 5% of India’s daily numbers. India, since the beginning of the pandemic, has never marked itself as being in community transition. Broadly, CT happens when new cases in the last 14 days cannot be traced to those who have an international travel history, when cases cannot be linked to a specific cluster. The WHO guidelines further suggest four subcategories within the broader definition of CT. CT-1 implies “low incidence of locally acquired, widely dispersed cases... and low risk of infection for the general population” with the highest, a CT-4 suggesting “very high incidence of locally acquired, widely dispersed cases in the past 14 days and very high risk of infection for the general population”. The cluster of cases classification says, “Cases detected in the past 14 days are predominantly limited to well-defined clusters that are not directly linked to imported cases. It is assumed that there are a number of unidentified cases in the area. This implies a low risk of infection to others in the wider community if exposure to these clusters is avoided.” Positivity rate India’s national positivity rate, or the proportion of tested cases returning positive, is around 21% and 533 of the 734 districts had reported positivity greater than 10%. There are 24 States with more than 15% positivity and 10 with over 25%, according to figures from the Health Ministry on Thursday. An expert told The Hindu that India’s refusal to describe itself as being in community transmission was an “ostrich in the sand” approach since being in CT — far from being stigmatic or an indicator of failure — had a bearing on how authorities addressed a pandemic. If cases were still a cluster, it would mean that the government ought to be prioritising testing, contact tracing and isolating to prevent further infection spread. CT, on the other hand, meant prioritising treatment and observing advisories to stay protected. “We may have been in community transmission since last April. Testing continues to be useful for forecasting the future course of the pandemic (through random tests) and preparing for it,” said Dr Jacob John, epidemiologist and Professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “Or it is useful if there is a specific course of treatment, or medicine, that can be prescribed once someone tests positive. However, that’s not really why the government seems to want to avoid the term. It just makes us look stupid.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-still-resists-community-spread-tag/article34553341.ece
14 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Railways to revise pay for doctors||The Indian Railways will pay medical practitioners (hired on contract) salary on a par with State governments. The decision was taken after the authorities found it difficult to engage the doctors in the existing pay structure that was less compared to what the respective States were paying. The health infrastructure of the railways, one of the largest employers in the country, caters to the needs of about 12 lakh employees and their family across the country. According to sources, the Ministry of Railways in a note to General Managers of Zonal Railways said that a decision was taken to extend the engagement of medical practitioners over and above the vacancies in Indian Railway Health Service to meet local requirements for handling COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were difficulties in engaging doctors in the present pay structure and there was a demand for parity with the remuneration being paid by State governments. It was decided to empower General Managers to revise the salary paid to doctors on contractual assignment for a period of six months with effect from April 28, 2021 as a temporary measure. The railways also decided to extend the engagement of retired paramedical staff, and hire para medical staff on a contract basis over and above the sanctioned strength to manage the pandemic. The engagement will be valid till March 2022. Order for Remdesivir In a related development, the railways placed an order with M/s Cipla for supplying 7,500 doses of Remdesivir antiviral drug to 23 zones, production units, factories and others across its network, the sources. In a bid to boost the movement of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) by train, it was decided not to levy haulage charges on dummy or empty containers loaded in LMO container rakes, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-revise-pay-for-doctors/article34553316.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||SC asks Delhi to open meal centres||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to open community kitchens in well-advertised places in the National Capital Region (NCR) to provide meals at least twice a day to migrant labourers stranded due to the lockdown in place to curb COVID-19 spread. A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M.R. Shah directed the Centre, Delhi, U.P. and Haryana governments to give dry ration to the migrant poor under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme by utilising the Public Distribution System with effect from May 2021. The court directed the authorities to not insist on any identity card from the migrant labourers while distributing dry ration and that they ought to be content with the self-declaration made by the workers. The Bench ordered Delhi and Haryana to ensure that adequate transport is provided to stranded migrant labourers in the NCR who want to return home. “The district administration in coordination with the police may identify such stranded migrant labourers and facilitate their transport either by road transport or train. The Union of India may also issue necessary instructions to Ministry of Railways to take necessary and adequate measures to cater the need of migrant labourers,” the court directed. The court has asked Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha to file specific responses on steps taken and details of welfare schemes provided for migrant labourers. The court has been protecting the rights of migrant labourers since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. It had passed a series of orders for their welfare. A couple of orders of the court last year had asked States to detail welfare schemes devised for migrant workers who had reached their native places. During the hearing on Thursday, the Bench urged the Centre and the States to consider the “harsh realities” facing the migrant poor. The hearing was based on an application filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan seeking urgent intervention from the Supreme Court to ensure food security, dry rations, cash transfer and transport facility for migrant labourers at nominal rates during the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-delhi-to-open-meal-centres/article34553351.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||App to view SC proceedings launched||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Thursday said he was “actively considering” the proposal to telecast live the proceedings of the Supreme Court. The CJI, however, said concrete steps in this regard would be taken only after seeking a general consensus among his colleagues in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Ramana made the announcement in a virtual address while launching a mobile app which would allow media persons to view the Supreme Court’s virtual proceedings live on their mobile phones. “Transparency is a time-honoured principle when it comes to the judicial process in our country. Hearing of cases has always taken place in public courtrooms, with access being allowed not only to lawyers and litigants in a particular case, but also to the general public,” Chief Justice Ramana said. Role of media The CJI said public access to court hearings was important as the rulings of courts, more particularly the Supreme Court, had an impact on the lives of people across the country. “The role of the media assumes importance in the process of disseminating information,” Chief Justice Ramana underlined. The CJI said the initiative to launch the mobile app for journalists came after he heard that the Press was depending on lawyers for video links of virtual hearings. The CJI said media persons should remain safe while working amid the surge of infection in the second wave of pandemic. The Chief Justice said he had received requests to create an independent mechanism for journalists to access court hearings without endangering their health. “I was a journalist for a brief time. During that time, we did not have car or bikes. We used to travel on bus as we were directed not to avail conveyance of organisers of the event,” Chief Justice Ramana recalled. The CJI urged media persons to use the mobile app responsibly. He said there might be some teething issues concerning the app and requested the media persons to be supportive. The CJI also launched a new feature in the Supreme Court’s official website called ‘Indicative Notes’, aimed at providing concise summaries of landmark judgments in an easy-to-understand format. “This will serve as a useful resource for media persons and the general public who wish to be better informed about the rulings of the court,” Chief Justice Ramana explained. With regard to granting accreditation to mediapersons, the CJI said he had given directions to further rationalise the policy.  Justice Hemant Gupta said access to media to court proceedings would increase transparency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/app-to-view-sc-proceedings-launched/article34553307.ece

In 1918, when the pandemic [the Spanish flu] hit, Suryakant Tripathi ‘Nirala’ wrote, “till the gaze travels we can only see bodies and more bodies”. But the BJP has never learnt from history or its mistakes. Many believe that the Kumbh Mela was the biggest super-spreader event that took COVID-19 to the interior villages of U.P., Bihar and other north Indian states. Do you agree? I would say that people’s religious beliefs and their faith have been played with. The government’s messaging was wrong. The BJP declared that they had defeated COVID-19. Other than elections, the BJP can’t plan for anything. Innocent people went to Kumbh because they trusted the government, but the reality was hidden from them. Please remember that it was declared in Davos in January that India had defeated COVID-19 and had also helped 150 countries. Today, everyone can see what is happening in India — other countries are sending aid to us. From western to eastern Uttar Pradesh, many videos paint a sorry picture of health facilities in the State. What is the feedback that you are getting? Health services in the State are working because of doctors, nurses and support staff. I had said in the beginning of April that the cancer institute [in Lucknow] should be turned into a COVID-19 hospital. It took three weeks for the Chief Minister [Yogi Adityanath] to make it happen. The situation in rural areas is terrible. The BJP hasn’t planned anything from last year onwards. In Uttar Pradesh, it has become a crime to express your anguish. At the best of times, medical treatment for the poor in U.P. is a challenge. How would you have done things differently given that you were the Chief Minister of the massive State for five years? History teaches us that there are more than two waves in a pandemic. After the first year, I would have set up a committee, which would have worked on increasing the oxygen capacity and making vaccination free. And, I would never have threatened people that their property would be confiscated or that I would apply the NSA [National Security Act] on them. A panel constituted by the Prime Minister warned about a “second wave” in March but because of the elections, no one listened to them. It is essential to listen to the views of specialists. The pandemic is not just an illness but leads to several social problems like unemployment and malnutrition; patients with other diseases don’t get treatment, and mental health suffers. Women and children suffer the most as domestic violence and abuse grow. This needs a helpline and other relief. We must also collect accurate data so that people get the correct picture. It would appear that the Opposition in U.P. is unable to hold the Yogi government accountable. Is it that the Opposition is weak and unable to present an alternative to the BJP? See, in any democracy, all four pillars are required to make a government accountable. The BJP has spared no effort to ensure that this does not happen. Please see the results of the panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh — we are doing our job. Every member of the Samajwadi Party is engaged in helping people, but we are not publicising this. It is the BJP that calls the Opposition weak. Have you asked this question to those who saw a wave of seats for themselves in West Bengal? Elections to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly are to take place in early 2022. Your alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)came a cropper in 2019 for the Lok Sabha. Will the SP go it alone in the upcoming Assembly poll? I have said many times that we will contest the Assembly election on our own. We can come to some adjustments with smaller parties. What is the political message from the recent Assembly elections, especially the massive victory of Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal? First, the BJP lost despite giving its all. Second, the politics of division and humiliation does not always work. Many other lessons, too, but for the moment, it would not be appropriate to elaborate. Is there a larger message to the Opposition here or will regional heavyweights remain content to occupy the political space in their respective States? India’s foundation is the federal structure. First, the battle will be for the State, and second, for the country. The BJP wants to impose its ideology on everyone but India is a country of great diversity. We can’t say one language, one society, one State or area is better than another. We are all equal. But, still, Uttar Pradesh has a key role to play in the country’s politics and in 2022, the State will deliver a powerful blow to the BJP.  The BJP had declared that they had defeated COVID-19 ...

14 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||At least 18 elephants killed in lightning strike in Assam||A bolt of lightning is believed to have killed a herd of at least 18 elephants in central Assam’s Nagaon district on Wednesday night. The incident happened in the hilly Kandali Proposed Reserve Forest in the Forest Department’s Kathiatoli Range, said officials. “The local staff said 18 elephants have died and lightning is most likely the cause,” Assam’s Chief Wildlife Warden, M.K. Yadava, told The Hindu . “There have been cases of lightning striking animals down. Lightning claimed five elephants in West Bengal some time ago, but this is huge,” he said. Officials said a team of veterinary doctors and other wildlife experts have left for Kandali and are expected to reach the spot by Friday morning. The team will examine if there are other reasons behind the death of the elephants. The district has had cases of man-animal conflicts in the past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/at-least-18-elephants-killed-in-lightning-strike-in-assam/article34553324.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||Bengal FM calls for GST Council meet||There is an urgent need to call a meeting of the GST Council, especially with the brutal second wave of COVID-19 that is likely to severely hit the economy, West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said in a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday. The council has not met since the virtual meeting it held in October last year. Mr. Mitra is the second State Finance Minister to raise the issue in the last ten days. In a letter to Ms. Sitharaman, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal made a similar demand on May 5. Mr. Mitra reminded Ms. Sitharaman that the rules dictate that the Council must meet once every quarter of the financial year. “You would agree that not meeting every quarter to discuss vital issues is not in line with the very principle of cooperative federalism,” he said. The alarming shortfall that is expected in the compensation to the States needs to be discussed urgently, he said. As per the government of India’s projection, the shortfall was expected to be to the tune of Rs. 1,56,164 crore in 2021-22, without taking into account the impact of the current COVID-19 crisis. “Now, due to COVID wave-2 and lockdowns, the compensation will be much higher than what was projected earlier. This is undoubtedly, deeply distressing,” he said. GST revenues constitute nearly 50% of the State government’s revenue. With the States being the majority stakeholders in the GST Council, they hold the deciding power. Mr. Badal had earlier pointed out that the committee of officers or the GST implementation committee was formed only for mundane matters, but in the absence of the Council’s meeting, it is bringing about substantive changes without consulting States. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have also been demanding that GST be waived on key medical items required to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-fm-calls-for-gst-council-meet/article34553331.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Sweden assessing aid requirement’||Swedish companies operating in India have lost employees and their family members to the pandemic and Stockholm is assessing the required aid that will be sent to deal with the humanitarian crisis. “We are working closely with partners in India to get an understanding of what is required on ground. It is heartening to see so many stepping up to the challenge — from government and large companies to individuals, including the Indian diaspora community in Sweden — each contributing to make a difference,” said Ambassador of Sweden Klas Molin. In a press statement, a group comprising Swedish businesses, agencies, individuals and the government said there are approximately 220 Swedish companies present in India with around 2,00,000 direct and more than 2.2 million indirect employees. The Swedish Chamber of Commerce India (SCCI) has begun a move to save lives, livelihood and undertake preventive measures. The Sweden India Business Council in Stockholm is coordinating with business houses of Sweden to provide medical supplies and care through Indian NGOs like Pratham, Indian Red Cross Society and Doctors without Borders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sweden-assessing-aid-requirement/article34553304.ece
14 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam NRC authority seeks re-verification of citizens’ list||The Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC) authority has approached the Supreme Court seeking a comprehensive and time-bound re-verification of the citizens’ list, highlighting “major irregularities” in the process. The interlocutory application by State NRC Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma also prays for the deletion of illegal voters from Assam’s electoral rolls besides the revision of the draft NRC and a supplementary list under a relevant clause of the Schedule of Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The notification for starting the Supreme Court-monitored exercise to update the 1951 NRC in Assam was issued in December 2013. The final draft published in August 2019 had excluded 19.06 lakh out of 3.3 crore applications for lack of adequate documents establishing them as Indian citizens. The NRC Coordinator filed the application on May 8, two days before newly-appointed Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the BJP-led government favoured 10-20% re-verification of the citizens’ list. Highlighting that the final NRC is yet to be published by the Registrar General of India, the application states that some “issues of substantive importance” cropped up while preparing the rejecting slips, thus delaying the process. Each of the 19.06 lakh people left out of the draft NRC are required to approach the nearest Foreigners’ Tribunal within 120 days of receiving a rejection slip for weighing their citizenship claims. Highlighting some “glaring anomalies” , the plea admits the NRC process helped create a “huge digitised database of NRC of 1951 and the electoral rolls of Assam up to 1971, as also the digitised details of NRC applicants”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-nrc-authority-seeks-re-verification-of-citizens-list/article34553319.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||40,000 Tocilizumab vials for States, UTs||The Central government has allocated to the States and Union Territories 40,000 out of the 45,000 vials of recently imported drug Tocilizumab (80 mg strength) for treatment of COVID-19. The remaining 5,000 vials have been set aside for the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) for distribution to the institutions under it as well as for the Department of Pharmaceuticals towards supply to the health institutions under other ministries. A fortnight ago, the Centre allocated 9,900 vials (200 mg) of Tocilizumab to the States/Union Territories and Central health institutions. The second lot of Tocilizumab arrived on May 10, senior officials from the MoHFW and the Department of Pharmaceuticals said in a joint communication. Tocilizumab was sourced only through imports from Hoffman La Roche by Roche India and marketed in the country by Cipla, they noted. While the sale of Tocilizumab to various States/UTs was being undertaken directly by Cipla, the Central government was “making all efforts to ensure that the drug is available across the country,.” they stated. Referring to the earlier allocation, their letter pointed out that the MoHFW recently also allocated 50,024 vials (80 mg) received through donation among the States and Central health institutions. The allocated vials were being placed at the disposal of the health departments of the State governments/UTs for supply to government and private hospitals. The State governments should advise them to contact the health department to source the drug, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/40000-tocilizumab-vials-for-states-uts/article34553342.ece

The country has so far reported a total of 2,40,31,659 cases and 2,62,053 deaths. Maharashtra reported 42,582 infections, followed by Kerala (39,955) and Karnataka (35,297). Maharashtra also recorded 850 casualties, followed by Karnataka (344) and Delhi (308). As many as 3,24,050 new recoveries were also recorded on the day, taking the total recoveries past the 2 crore mark. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. Over 18.64 lakh samples were tested in the country on Wednesday (the results for which were made available on Thursday). It is 1.19 lakh less tests than those conducted on Tuesday and also 58,537 less than those conducted the previous Wednesday (May 5). On Tuesday, over 19.8 lakh samples were tested, the highest in a single day. Only around 18.94 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Thursday. Only about 4.2% of India’s adult population have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine as on May 12. Among major States/U.T.s, the three with the highest coverage of both doses are Gujarat (7.6%), Delhi (7.51%) and Kerala (7.22%).

The State leadership has been facing mounting demands for their immediate ouster for the downfall of the party in the Assembly election. Never before has the Congress party been electorally routed in recent times. The party won 21 seats this time, one less than in the 2016 Assembly election. However, its popular vote-share moderately improved to 25.12% from 23.80% last time. This has been attributed to the increase in the number of seats the party contested: 93 against 87. Sources said the organisational revamp from the top would strengthen the mandalam and booth committees, and bring in a coordinated mechanism in the party. The debilitated apparatus had resulted in the inability of the party leadership to chalk out a strategy for the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-mulling-change-in-leadership-in-kerala/article34553801.ece

In the judgment, Justice Joseph elaborates the rather “long” history of house arrests starting with that of St. Paul the Apostle in Rome. Drawing vignettes from ‘A Brief History of House Arrest and Electronic Monitoring’ by J. Robert Lilly and Richard A. Ball, he refers to how “societies found in Poland, South Korea, India, and the Soviet Union are known to employ ‘house arrest’ primarily to deal with troublesome political dissenters”. Justice Joseph details how ‘house arrest’ in India has its roots in laws providing for preventive detention. He then moves on to how ankle bracelets have become an indispensable appendage to monitor compliance of house arrests in foreign countries. He said how these bracelets were the product of an inspiration of a New Mexico district court judge “who read a comic strip where Spiderman was being tracked by a transmitter fixed to his wrist”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-not-place-convicts-under-house-arrest/article34553308.ece

The Ministry said the recommendation of the COVID working group was also accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), headed by Dr. V.K. Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog, in a meeting on May 12. At a press conference on Thursday, Dr. Paul said that the dosing interval extension had been recommended after a careful study without pressure from anyone and in consultation with the World Health Organization. This is the second time in three months Covishield dosage intervals have been widened by the Health Ministry. In March, the States and Union Territories were directed to increase the gap from 28 days to six-eight weeks for better results. Dr. Paul said, “We must have faith in the scientific process followed in the country.

An April 30 order of the Supreme Court had “flagged” the legal framework within which the Centre could “possibly consider compulsory licensing and government acquisition of patents”. However, not all are impressed by the balancing act. They have called for urgent steps for compulsory licensing of COVID vaccines and drugs to ramp up production and availability. A plea by IIT Madras alumnus Pratheesh Prakash, represented by advocates Sriram P. and Mukund P. Unny, in the Supreme Court accused the Centre of “enabling privatisation and profiteering over vaccines by monopolists in a manner contrary to public interest”.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana said the additional amount should be included in the income of the dead person as “future prospects”. The recent judgment, authored by Chief Justice Ramana, came in a petition filed by the children of a 37-year-old self-employed woman who died in a car accident near Phagwara in Punjab 11 years ago. Significant judgment The judgment is significant as it recognises self-employment as gainful employment and calls for an increase in the compensation amount accordingly. Chief Justice Ramana referred to a Constitution Bench decision in National Insurance vs Pranay Sethi , which had “clearly held that in case the deceased is self-employed and below the age of 40, 40% addition would be made to their income as future prospects”.   The High Court had earlier held the victim ineligible for future prospects because she was self-employed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-for-hike-in-compensation-to-under-40-and-self-employed-road-accident-victims/article34553322.ece

The Goa Bench of the High Court said that State authorities had informed it that some of the casualties may have taken place due to “logistical issues” related to connecting oxygen cylinders to the manifold (group of large gas cylinders) that resulted in interruption and drop in pressure in supply lines of oxygen to patients. The court observed that despite its order on providing medical oxygen to COVID-19 patients at the GMCH, there were 15 deaths during the dark hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the government-run facility on Thursday. The Bench of Justices Nitin W. Sambre and M.S. Sonak was hearing a bunch of petitions on the recent deaths of COVID-19 patients at the GMCH, allegedly due to a lack of medical oxygen. Direction to govt. The court said the Centre should ensure that the allotted quota of medical oxygen is made available at the earliest to Goa, which is reporting a very high test positivity rate. The judges said they were pained that logistical issues should give rise to such serious consequences. “We expect the State administration to find out ways and means to overcome these logistical issues, so that, precious life is not lost on account of any deficiencies in the matter of supply of oxygen to patients,” the court ruled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-more-dead-in-top-goa-hospital-high-court-told/article34553346.ece

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Vedas are infinite||The Vedas provide both worldly or the objective type of knowledge as well as the transcendental kind of knowledge. In a discourse, Swami Omkarananda, who passed away on May 10, drew attention to many salient features of the Vedas which are the primary source of all knowledge. The term Veda is derived from the root ‘Vid’, which means knowledge or jnana. Since knowledge is infinite the Vedas too are infinite. Another characteristic of the Vedas is that they are ‘sabda pramana.’ This means that the Veda sabda in the form of utterances, sounds and words carries significant meaning and thereby it becomes the instrument that provides knowledge. So the Vedas are synonymous with knowledge. A human being assimilates knowledge of the immediate world around through the senses such as the eye, the ear, etc, which serve as instruments for providing knowledge. It is also true that what one knows is limited and that there are many areas of knowledge still to be known. In the Gita, Krishna makes it clear that true jnana is spiritual wisdom and is totally different from any kind of the objective knowledge that most of us are familiar and even proficient in. Sage Narada confesses to Sanatkumara that though he is well versed in all kinds of scriptural knowledge he still feels a thirst for something else. Sanatkumara affirms that only ‘Self knowledge,’ the ‘atma tatva,’ is the source of all knowledge that is worthwhile. The Mandukya Upanishad also confirms that the sages and rishis of yore have realised the self through constant meditation and contemplation of the all pervading Brahman and enter into Him. So, they are always full of joy and remain tranquil and unperturbed. But faith and belief in the word of scriptures is indispensible for assimilating the spiritual jnana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vedas-are-infinite/article34553332.ece

14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Priority for optimum use of oxygen||Facing high demand, many hospitals have chalked out strategies for the optimal use of oxygen. From doing their own oxygen audits to turning to devices for delivering appropriate amounts to patients, a number of hospitals are leaving no stone unturned to prevent wastage. As COVID-19 cases continue to surge in Tamil Nadu, the demand has been soaring over the past several weeks. Not wanting to take any chance — considering the uncertainty over the supply of the now-scarce resource — hospitals have taken measures for judicious use of oxygen. According to a section of government doctors, one of the biggest problems was patient attenders increasing the flow of oxygen by means of the flow meters attached to the central supply. “They change the flow from 10 to 15 litres or 20 to 30 litres. Owing to the high case load and less manpower, monitoring each and every aspect is difficult. This results in wastage,” a senior doctor said. To ensure that the available resource was used appropriately, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital formed a respiratory care team, comprising a professor of anaesthesia, an assistant professor, a staff nurse, an anaesthesia technician and a post-graduate student in anaesthesia. “This team carries out daily analysis and monitors oxygen therapy for patients. At times, patient attenders increase the oxygen requirement level on their own. To conserve oxygen, this team audits the daily requirement of oxygen for each person. We want to cut down on excess use and put in place an appropriate therapy,” Dean E. Theranirajan said. J.V. Peter, director of Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the hospital came up with a five-point strategy — avoiding the use of “oxygen guzzlers” such as high-flow nasal cannula; “oxygen stewardship programme” with nurses and therapists functioning as stewards and auditors of oxygen use; “more for less” — the use of devices such as non-invasive ventilators, non-rebreather mask or partial rebreather masks with reservoir bags to reduce oxygen use; “resetting safe oxygen targets” — 92% to 94%; and “reducing the pressure on liquid oxygen” with the use of oxygen concentrators. “We were able to reduce oxygen use by 10% to 12%. This strategy was to conserve oxygen and optimise its use... A rupee saved is a rupee earned. Similarly for oxygen, a litre saved is a litre produced,” he said. Throughout the State, hospitals are trying to bring down the use of high-flow nasal cannula, a senior government doctor said. “Instead, we are using devices that give patients the correct amount of oxygen... These airway devices deliver metered doses of oxygen. Some hospitals use venturi masks, in which we can set the amount of oxygen required by a patient,” the doctor said. Almost all hospitals are on their toes for 24 hours when it comes to audits. “We calculate the per hour oxygen usage and the number of patients on oxygen support. If it does not tally, we find out the reason,” the doctor said. At the Government Corona Hospital, Director K. Narayanasamy said for patients with oxygen saturation of 80%, rescue therapy was done with high-flow oxygen for an hour. “Once the levels improve to 92%-93%, we move to low-flow oxygen. We continue to monitor and wean the patient off oxygen support,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/priority-for-optimum-use-of-oxygen/article34553496.ece
14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Heavy rain over south T.N., Western Ghats likely||A cyclonic storm brewing over south-east Arabian Sea may bring light to moderate rain over many places of the State till May 16. Most parts of the State may continue to escape harsh weather and peaking mercury levels as the weather system is also likely to keep the day temperature under check. The low-pressure area that formed over south-east Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area on Thursday is likely to further strengthen as a depression over the same region by May 15. It is likely to become a cyclonic storm by May 16 and move north-northwestwards towards Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coasts, the officials said. The cyclonic storm is likely to be named Tauktae. The name was suggested by Myanmar. It is expected to reach near Gujarat coast around May 18 evening. Officials of the Meteorological Department said while heavy to very heavy rain may occur in Western Ghats districts and south Tamil Nadu, places like Chennai too have a chance of light rain on Friday. The rain spell may last till May 18. S.Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said such formation of cyclonic storms over north Indian Ocean was normal during pre-monsoon season. This would influence rain across the State. But the intensity of the rain would vary. One or two places in the Western Ghats region and south Tamil Nadu would receive heavy to very heavy rainfall till May 17. Some of the areas that are likely to receive heavy rain with strong winds are Theni, Dindigul, Coimbatore and Kanniyakumari. There would be an increase in rainfall from Saturday. “The weather system in the Arabian Sea will strengthen cool easterly winds. This would bring down day temperature in many parts of the State and several locations recorded below normal temperature. This month, easterly wind flow had kept day temperature close to average, including in Chennai, on many days, “ he added. Officials said the maximum temperature may remain near normal and it may climb one or two degrees Celsius above average in some areas. Another seasonal trough was also aiding thunderstorms over the State. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Thursday, Barur in Krishnagiri district received the day’s maximum of 5 cm of rainfall. The Meteorological Department forecasts light to moderate rain in some areas of Chennai till Saturday. The maximum temperature will be around 36 degrees Celsius.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/western-ghats-south-tn-to-get-heavy-rain/article34553512.ece

14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Biomedical waste generation doubles||With the rise in COVID-19 cases, there are concerns about the disposal of huge quantities of biomedical waste. Last year, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) released a set of standard operating procedures to be followed by those who test positive. Biomedical waste, generated from homes and hospitals and COVID-19 Care Centres, must be collected and safely disposed of, in accordance with the protocol, either through incineration or deep burial. Civic bodies across Tamil Nadu maintain that they observe the protocol religiously. Biomedical waste must be collected in yellow bags. Local body officials said that the amount of waste had almost doubled. According to a Chennai Corporation official, each COVID-19 patient may generate 1 kg of biomedical waste a day. In the past fortnight, 11,000 kg was collected from patients in home quarantine and sent for disposal to agencies authorised by the TNPCB. A sanitary inspector in the Coimbatore west zone said waste mostly comprised used gloves and masks.“We used to handle around three tonnes a day from hospitals in Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts before the pandemic. Now, we are handling six to seven tonnes a day,” said J. Suriyanarayanan, a partner in Tekno Therm Industries, a common treatment facility. S. Sudhakar, another partner, said 80 employees were working with protective gear in three shifts.   Western region Kovai Bio Waste Management Private Limited collects nearly two tonnes of biomedical waste from the Nilgiris. It also handles biomedical waste from hotels that have been turned into COVID-19 Care Centres, testing laboratories and a few smaller hospitals. “Our staff and their family members eligible for vaccination have been vaccinated. Vehicles collecting biomedical waste are disinfected after every trip,” said the company’s managing director S. Bhuvaneswari. In the limits of Salem Corporation, biomedical waste from over 1,000 patients in home isolation is collected daily by an authorised agency. In Dindigul Corporation, five of the 48 wards have been declared containment zones. The Udhagamandalam and Coonoor municipalities in the Nilgiris have designated vehicles to visit the homes of people in isolation to collect the waste. “However, following a fire at the facility, the incinerator is not working. Instead, the waste is buried,” said a worker. In Coonoor, the waste is disposed of at the waste management park at Ottupattarai. Erode Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan said all the yellow bags collected from various wards were transported in a separate vehicle to the compost yard at Vendipalayam and buried in deep pits. Hospital biomedical waste is collected by a private agency and disposed of at the incineration plant. Southern region The waste is collected twice a day in the Rameswaram and Paramakudi municipalities, which have the highest number of patients in Ramanathapuram district. The Madurai Corporation has stopped providing bags as “the number of cases is rising rapidly, and it is difficult to strictly comply with the rules like last year,” a sanitary inspector said. An official of the Vellaikkal dump yard said that around 650 tonnes of general waste collected in Madurai reaches the yard daily. In Tiruchi, biomedical waste from the COVID-19 Care Centres are sent to the common facility in Thanjavur for disposal. Northern region In Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupathur and Tiruvannamalai districts, nearly five tonnes of waste is generated from 800 places. Of this, four tonnes is COVID-19 pathological waste, which is incinerated. TNPCB officials said they were monitoring the entire process.

14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 deaths: very few seek legal accountability||“My father could have been saved. It was not just COVID which killed him,” tweeted an actor recently. This is a common refrain among most people who have lost loved ones due to the raging pandemic but very few if at all have chosen to approach the courts against the alleged unpreparedness of the State in the handling the crisis. And legal experts cite multiple reasons for the hesitation. No doubt, activists have been filing numerous public interest litigation petitions on general issues concerning COVID-19, and the Supreme Court as well as several High Courts have taken up suo motu proceedings to monitor the state’s actions in the fight against the pandemic. However, individual cases demanding an inquiry to fix responsibility or seeking damages for the loss have been few and far between. Senior counsel R. Vaigai says there is certainly a “grave failure” on the part of the state in having “failed to save lives” as people can be seen running from pillar to post in frantic search of hospital beds, oxygen, drugs and vaccines. Yet, many have not approached courts to hold the state accountable for various reasons, including economic status, she points out. The counsel says people in the low-income group do not choose to litigate because their primary concern is basic survival. And those who can afford to litigate choose not do so because the judicial system is not litigant-friendly. E-filing of cases is yet to become a norm in the country and the long delay in disposing of even writ petitions, filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, is the dissuading factor, she says. Two writ pleas so far So far, only two individual writ petitions related to COVID-19 have been filed in the Madras High Court. One is a case filed by the wife of a neurosurgeon whose body could not be buried in a Christian cemetery in April 2020 because locals had objected, fearing the spread of COVID-19. A single judge ordered reburying the body as per her wish, but a Division Bench stayed the order on an appeal preferred by the Greater Chennai Corporation. The other case was filed by a vaccine trial volunteer who reportedly suffered medical complications. He filed a writ petition, through his counsel N.G.R. Prasad, seeking compensation of Rs. 5 crore and this case is also pending adjudication after notices were ordered to the Centre, the Drugs Controller General of India, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the vaccine manufacturer. Senior counsel M. Ajmal Khan says not many in the country choose to sue the state because it is very difficult for a common man to put up a legal fight against the “mighty government”, which has a number of law officers to defend itself. Constitutional courts also do not entertain writ petitions easily because such cases involve disputed questions of fact. Most of the time, the litigants are forced to approach civil courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-deaths-few-seek-legal-accountability/article34553514.ece

14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Steep rise in funerals||The city has been seeing a steep rise of over 300% in the number of bodies cremated at major burial grounds under the control of the Greater Chennai Corporation since the first wave of COVID-19 last year. Where there used to be seven bodies a day for cremation, now there are 28, a senior official said. “The number of cremations has crossed 350 a day, and this extraordinary increase has led to malfuction in some crematoria/gasifiers,” the official explained. Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi on Thursday inspected burial grounds to resolve issues reported by residents. Mr. Bedi has called a meeting of executive engineers on Friday to repair crematoriums and redress the grievances of residents. On Thursday, ambulances and hearses had to wait for several hours at burial grounds. A large gathering of people was found at burial grounds on Thursday. For instance, more than 30 bodies were cremated in Velangadu. The tremendous increase in the load caused the equipment to malfunction and residents took to social media to flag the delay in cremations. Karuna Prasad, a resident, posted on Wednesday evening about the difficulties faced by mourners. He said a body was not cremated on Wednesday in burial grounds located in areas such as Kannamapet and Nungambakkam, reportedly because of the malfunctioning of equipment. The body had to be taken Pozhichallur. Under repair On Thursday, the crematorium in Mylapore did not function as the equipment was under repair. Meanwhile, residents in the neighbourhoods of several crematoriums alleged that the workers demanded Rs. 15,000 for cremation because of the demand for allocation of time slots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-records-a-steep-rise-in-funerals/article34553506.ece

14 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Don’t reduce vaccine supply to State: HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday ordered that the Centre should not reduce the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to Tamil Nadu just because the State government had decided to float global tenders to procure the vaccines, apart from the purchases being made from two domestic manufacturers. The court said the procurement through global tenders is a long-drawn process whereas the State is already facing a shortage of vaccines. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, however, made it clear that the Centre could appropriately rework the allocation of vaccines to Tamil Nadu as and when the global tenders mature and supplies are received. The judges also noted that the supply of oxygen to the State had been increased from 419 to 519 tonnes a day under the National Oxygen Plan, but the supply of 40 tonnes from Kerala had been stopped. “Overall, there does not appear to be any dearth of oxygen in the State at the moment,” the judges said and adjourned to Monday the further hearing of a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court to monitor the fight against COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-reduce-vaccine-supply-to-state-hc/article34553484.ece

14 May 2021||DHARMAPURI/KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||The under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths||On Wednesday, the Government Dharmapuri Medical College Hospital administration was in firefighting mode. It was responding to queries on “rumours of 47 COVID-19 deaths on a single day on Tuesday at the hospital”. It started off with an unverifiable WhatsApp message with claims that were subsequently denied by the hospital administration. “Take it as false information. Only 7 deaths are due to [COVID-19] positivity. The remaining include those who were admitted with symptoms but tested negative. They were suffering from complications as a ‘sequel to COVID-19’,” said Dean K. Amudavalli. Those numbers were for 36 hours and not 12 hours, and included symptomatic patients who needed oxygen and had co-morbidities, she said.  Only three deaths Similarly, at the Krishnagiri Government Medical College Hospital, among the 23 deaths, only three were recorded as COVID-19 deaths. Nine other bodies, however, were bagged for potential positivity as a precaution. “The virus remains for a maximum of 10 days, but the patient may develop other complications, persistent and COVID-19-related, and may not get discharged. That death after an RT-PCR negative test is not documented as [related to] COVID-19 as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) protocol,” said N. Muthuselvan, Dean of the Krishnagiri hospital. This has led to under-counting and under-reporting by government hospitals here. Swab negativity at the time of fatality, days or weeks after testing positive, would not find its way into the State bulletin, said the deans of the two government medical college hospitals here. “The person might test negative after five days at the hospital, but the virus would have damaged the lungs, causing infection for two weeks or even two months. This ‘sequel to COVID-19’ will not be counted as a COVID-19 death because the ICMR guideline says so,” said Dr. Amuthavalli. Government hospitals have selectively taken cover under the WHO death coding classification, reiterated by the ICMR Cause of Death (COD) manual for COVID-19. Under this, COVID-19 is documented as the underlying cause of death (UCOD) when an RT-PCR test is positive – with or without typical COVID-19 symptoms, when present with co-morbid symptoms (asthma, heart disease and type 1 diabetes). The death is recorded as such with a different code when the test is negative but clinical COVID-19 symptoms are present. When the test is inconclusive but the symptoms are present, it is recorded as ‘probable COVID-19’. It is recorded as ‘suspected COVID-19’ when the test result is awaited, but symptoms are present. But government hospitals here are recording only cases of deaths with COVID-19 positivity at the time of death. “Incidental COVID-19 is not taken as COVID. Someone may have hypertension, diabetes or other co-morbidities and when we test for COVID-19, they may test positive. The presentation is that of a disease but not of COVID-19,” said Dr. Muthuselvan. But as per the second protocol of ICMR–COD manual, positivity with symptoms presented as co-morbid conditions should be documented as COVID-19. What government hospitals cite as “COVID sequel” or “incidental COVID” is the sequence of events from the onset of the disease (COVID -19) leading up to the death of the patient. “We have been told orally in the meeting that only deaths within 10 days of admissions will be taken as COVID-19 deaths. But this is wrong because once community transmission has started in a pandemic, every death should be counted as a pandemic death, as per international standards,” said a medical officer in Krishnagiri. Any damage done by the virus after the person tests negative is not counted as a COVID-19 death. But the ICMR manual states nowhere that the UCOD should be documented as COVID-19 only if it occurs within a specific time of infection. It also details the recording of time between the onset of the disease and death, which may be “hours, days, weeks or even years”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-under-reporting-of-covid-19-deaths/article34553482.ece
14 May 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Flower growers feel the heat of lockdown||Farmers growing flowers, including jasmine, sampangi and paneer rose, were seen abandoning the produce in dumper bins here at the wholesale flower market as they neither had buyers nor could preserve the flowers. With the fortnight-long lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic coming into force since Monday, the farmers have been trying to prevent their losses. In a bid to ensure that their livelihood was not affected, the government had given time for opening up shops till noon. After 12 p.m., the curfew comes into force till May 20. Under such circumstances, there were takers for vegetables, milk and meat but not many buyers for procuring flowers like jasmine, rose and sampangi in the market, said Marimuthu, a flower grower from Nilakottai. Even if the temples were open, the devotees would buy garlands. With the shrines closed, there was not any scope for selling the flowers, he rued. He claimed that many flower growers in and around the district had decided not to harvest or pluck as they have to shell out wages for the labourers. A wholesale merchant, however, said that he would dry the roses and sell them at a later date to people, who could use them in manufacturing of perfumes. There are at least 2000 flower growers in and around the district, who brought in at least 10 tonnes of flowers daily to the market. On an average, jasmine, which was selling at Rs. 1,000 per kg this season, was available for Rs. 100. Similarly, sampangi arali and paneer rose varieties, which were quoted at Rs. 60 per kg in the wholesale market, were selling at Rs. 15. With not much scope to transport the flowers to other districts or States due to restrictions, the farmers had very limited scope to preserve them. Hence, they had left them in trash, while some others had chosen not to pluck them from the fields, the merchant said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flower-growers-feel-the-heat-of-lockdown/article34553868.ece

A farmer had cultivated banana on land belonging to the Public Works Department (PWD) in the Vilamundi Forest Range of Sathyamangalam Division.

They found over 200 banana plants damaged. One banana plant however, was only half damaged, and when examined, had a sparrow’s nest with four hatchlings inside. After inspecting the plantation, Forest officials said the herd had raided the crops during the night hours and possibly left the one tree undamaged after hearing the sound of the hatchlings. “These hatchlings make loud sounds and the elephants may have left the tree without damaging it completely,” an officer said. After the video went viral, many villagers visited the field to check out the bird’s nest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wild-elephants-rampage-banana-plantation-leave-a-tree-with-birds-nest-unbroken/article34553536.ece

Two gasifiers will be installed at Thathaneri crematorium and one at the Moolakarai facility. City Engineer S. Arasu said the new gasifiers are being installed to reduce the burden of the crematoriums. “An order has been issued to procure three gasifiers for Rs. 30 lakh each. These new gasifiers are expected to be commissioned within 10 days,” he said. Both the crematoriums, with two gasifiers each, are functioning round-the-clock to cremate COVID-9 bodies. A source at Thathaneri crematorium said around 50 bodies were dealt with every day. There were 10 freezer boxes at the crematorium to keep the COVID-19 bodies “But COVID-19 bodies keep on coming. So we issue tokens to the family members and usually they have to wait for around six hours to cremate the body of their loved ones,” he said. The lack of basic facilities at the crematorium also adds to the difficulties faced by the families, he added. Overheated The second gasifier at Thathaneri was under repair and set right only recently. Since these gasifiers are functioning continuously, the machinery gets overheated. “One of the gasifiers has been repaired several times due to over-usage,” he said. Moolakarai crematorium handles around 40 COVID-19 bodies every day. As in Thathaneri, the families are forced to wait for many hours to cremate the COVID-19 bodies.

14 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Quota only for those who studied in Tamil: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has held that the 20% reservation for Persons Studied in Tamil Medium (PSTM) would only apply to candidates who studied their entire education from Class I to the prescribed qualification in Tamil Medium. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the 20% quota should be applied at every stage of the recruitment. The court said that the PSTM Act, 2010 and the Amendment Act, 2020 were constitutionally valid. The court observed that Tamil Nadu Appointment on preferential basis in the Services under the State of Persons Studied in Tamil Medium Act was rightly enacted so that people would be encouraged to undergo their education in Tamil medium. The constitution recognises the importance of mother tongue and National Education Policy gives importance to education in mother tongue. Giving preference to those who studied in Tamil Medium in employment would not amount to arbitrary action, the judges said. The court was hearing a petition that challenged the notification issued for Group I Services examination. The petitioner G. Sakthi Rao of Madurai had sought a direction to the State to allow only those candidates who completed their entire education in Tamil Medium. The main contention of the petitioner was that the candidates who had not done their school education in Tamil Medium were getting the benefit of the 20% quota under the PSTM Act by obtaining their degree in Tamil Medium. Some had obtained fake certificates, he said. The judges directed the Chief Secretary to direct the Department of School Education and Higher Education to strictly indicate the medium of instruction in the certificate either, Tamil or English in which the student studied. The court directed the State government to appoint only those teachers who were qualified in Tamil literature to teach Tamil in schools and colleges. The government should not appoint candidates who obtained cross major subject degrees in Tamil as Tamil teachers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/quota-only-for-those-who-studied-in-tamil-hc/article34553498.ece

14 May 2021||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Cooperation of people is vital to curb spread of COVID-19, says Law Minister||Cooperation of general public was of utmost importance to curb the spread of COVID-19 at a time when the State government had accorded priority to protect the people from the onslaught of the second wave of viral infection, Minister for Law S. Regupathy said on Thursday. Calling upon the people to unfailingly adhere to safety measures such as wearing masks while venturing out to public places, washing hands frequently, and maintaining personal distancing, Mr. Regupathy said officials should sensitise the general public at the village-level to the infection and its rapid spread since many of them had remained careless. Presiding over a meeting along with Minister for Environment Siva V. Meyyanathan at the District Collectorate here to review the measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the district, Mr. Regupathy said the State government’s primary task was to carry out measures to contain the spread of the infection in addition to executing other welfare schemes. Several COVID-19 patients were being admitted in government hospitals from private hospitals in the wake of shortage of oxygen in private hospitals, he said adding that the State government had taken necessary steps to bring oxygen from different districts and other States.

14 May 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Agro-technologists advocate direct sowing for samba season||The Tamil Nadu Senior Agro Technologists Forum has advocated direct sowing for the coming samba season taking into consideration the metereological forecast of southwest monsoon and habitual water management practice. The Forum comprising retired agriculture and agriculture-related department officials have been analysing the water requirement and availability status prior to commencement of kuruvai crop in delta region for the past 15 years. They come out with suggestions for effective utilisation of the available water at the beginning of the crop year. They also make assessment of the anticipated flow into the Stanley Reservoir, Mettur, during the southwest monsoon. The Forum favoured conjunctive use of water resources by agriculturalists in Cauvery deltaic region, including the combined Thanjavur district area, last year when the shutters of Mettur dam was lifted on the customary date of opening:June 12. This year, it favours adoption of direct sowing technique alongside in at least 50% of the anticipated total samba cultivation area. The reasoning is that in the past the quantum of water at Mettur, as per the inter-State water sharing mechanism during June, July and August, has seldom been realised in full by Tamil Nadu and there was a steep shortfall in realisation of water at Mettur last year ending with March 31 this year. As per the Tribunal findings, Tamil Nadu would be realising 25 tmcft water from the 65-km spread area between Billigundulu and Mettur. Since a total of 204.28 tmcft water passed through zero-point at Billigundulu till March, the actual realisation at Mettur should have been 229.28 tmcft. But, in reality, the dam recorded a total inflow of 170.66 tmcft only till March. Hence, the State government should find out the cause for non-realisation of around 58 tmcft of water at Mettur and initiate necessary steps to plug the leak. This being the case, the meteorologists in their initial assessment had predicted a normal southwest monsoon, which was likely to be 98% of the long period average with an error of plus or minus 5%. The Forum’s estimate: only about 33% of rainfall could be expected in catchment areas of the Cauvery during the southwest monsoon. With the extent of storage at Mettur during the first week of June expected to be around 56 tmcft this year, which would be 9 tmcft less than the optimum level to be maintained at Mettur at the time of opening of the shutters for two crops, the Forum suggested that direct sowing of seeds could be adopted in half the total area of samba cultivation of about 4.40 lakh hectares in the Cauvery deltaic region in Tamil Nadu. Adoption of the direct sowing method would help reduce the water requirement for irrigation by around 38 tmcft. Thereby, the irrigation needs for the crop year could be managed with the expected realisation of around 233 tmcft of water, it said.  Adoption of the direct sowing method will help reduce the water requirement for irrigation by around 38 tmcft Tamil Nadu Senior Agro Technologists Forum||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agro-technologists-advocate-direct-sowing-for-samba-season/article34553901.ece

Speaking to reporters recently, she said seven places of worship, including Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, Tiruttani Murugan Temple, Velankanni shrine, Nagoor dargah and Tiruvannamalai Temple, have been identified for implementation of a ‘child-friendly’ temple project devised by the Centre. The objective was to prevent children from being abused in such festivals. For instance, children missing at such events were used for begging and engaged as child labour by shops/vendors. Hence, in a bid to prevent such acts, the project would be implemented with the support of the district administration, police and other stakeholders. The chairperson was here to conduct a public hearing over a complaint lodged by an advocate from Kerala with the National Human Rights Commission that a 16-year-old girl from Nagalapuram, near Bodinayakannur here, was allegedly gang-raped. Inquiry revealed that the victim delivered a baby after she was in love with a youth. The complaint that she was gang-raped was incorrect. As the girl died, the child born to the victim was handed over to an adoption agency in Gandhigram in Dindigul district. The Commission planned to recommend compensation to the victim’s family. Ms. Saraswathy and commission member V Ramaraj conducted the public hearing at Theni Collectorate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/child-friendly-temple-project-to-be-launched-soon/article34553870.ece
14 May 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||First oxygen tanker rolls out of Sterlite’s Thoothukudi plant||The first tanker with 4.8 tonnes of medical oxygen was dispatched from Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant on Thursday. “The medical-grade oxygen, with 98.6% purity, from Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant was sent to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital,” said K. Senthil Raj, Collector and chairperson of the State government-appointed committee to monitor oxygen production at the plant. After producing 5 kilo litres of liquid oxygen in the first two or three days, the plant is expected to generate 35 tonnes of medical-grade liquid oxygen a day from May 15 or 16. This will come in handy for the Collectors of the southern districts, who have been waiting for oxygen to save a few thousand critically ill COVID-19 patients. As the copper smelter in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex here was sealed after the protests on May 22, 2018, Vedanta, promoter of the company, approached the Supreme Court with a plea to reopen its oxygen plant alone. After the court allowed the plea, the committee inspected the plant and monitored its overhaul, which was completed in a short span. Sterlite Copper has one more oxygen unit with capacity to turn out 35 tonnes of medical-grade oxygen. It is also being overhauled. The second plant will likely generate oxygen within a couple of weeks. Sterlite Copper said, in a statement, that the company would dispatch two oxygen tankers daily, to begin with, and scale up the number gradually. Chief executive officer Pankaj Kumar said the plant was reactivated at the earliest, thanks to the efforts of the suppliers and the partners. The support received from employees and the community also played a critical role in getting the plant ready for immediate production. “We are especially grateful to the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the State government, the Central government and the local administration for making every effort to provide necessary approvals expeditiously. My team members and I are honoured that our facility and efforts are directly helping save lives. We promise to make every possible effort to ensure that there is a continuous production of oxygen from our plant to mitigate this crisis,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/first-oxygen-tanker-rolls-out-of-sterlites-thoothukudi-plant/article34553490.ece

14 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Will to win should overcome fear of defeat: Dinesh Karthik||Whenever one has a chance to move ahead, the will to win ought to overcome the fear of defeat, said India cricketer Dinesh Karthik. “When that happens, you are always ready for anything that crosses your path and your instincts come out in full flow,” Mr. Karthik shared these thoughts while reflecting on his brilliant stumping of England's Michael Vaughan at Lord’s in 2004, during a ‘virtual meet and talk’ session organised by the Santhanam Vidhyalaya on Thursday.  Talking on how preparation helps boost confidence, he referred to his six of the last-ball in the final of Nidahas Trophy in 2018. It was this preparation that helped him achieve the best possible result. Succeeding was all about performing tasks with abundant passion, sincerity and honesty. “Of course there are competitions, but if you are determined to make a difference sky is the limit,” he said responding to another query. On captaincy, he observed that two important qualities of a leader were honesty and empathy. When a leader is able to bring the best out of every person in the team, success would eventually follow, he said.  His sincere advice to students was to spend quality time with family and, more importantly, to desist from whiling away their time playing with mobile phones. The hour-long session was moderated by K. Chandrasekharan, Chief Executive Officer, Santhanam Vidhyalaya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-to-win-should-overcome-fear-of-defeat-dinesh-karthik/article34553899.ece

14 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Efforts taken to overcome vaccine hesitancy among tribal people in the Nilgiris||The Nilgiris district administration has worked out an action-plan to get the tribal population in the district vaccinated against COVID-19 disease. In order to achieve this, officials have come up with a comprehensive plan to overcome vaccine hesitancy among the communities. According to officials, there are a total of 27,032 persons belonging to Toda, Kota, Paniya, Kattunayakan, Kurumba and Irula tribes in the Nilgiris, out of whom 8,779 are more than 45 years old while 12,656 persons are in the 14 - 44 age group. Monitoring Officer for the Nilgiris district Supriya Sahu said that a plan has been prepared to vaccinate all members of the tribal communities in the coming weeks. However, vaccine hesitancy among tribal communities remains an issue that needs to be addressed. On Thursday, Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya visited tribal communities surrounding the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) to convince them to take the vaccine, after residents fled into the surrounding forests when health officials visited their villages to vaccinate them recently. The Collector, along with the monitoring officer for the district, reached out to members of various NGOs who have been working with the communities, including Tarun Chhabra from the Toda Nalavaaazhvu Sangam, Stan Thekaekara, founder of ACCORD – Action for Community Organisation, Rehabilitation and Development, and M. Alwas, from the Nilgiri Adivasi Welfare Association (NAWA). The grassroots NGOs have volunteers convincing community members to take the jab, and are working alongside other members of the district administration, including health department officials. “We felt that tribal communities should not be asked to visit their local PHCs or hospitals, as this might make them even more hesitant to take the vaccine, so we are taking the vaccines to them in their own villages,” said Ms. Sahu, who said that with the help of volunteers, tribal communities are being convinced to take the vaccine. In Gudalur and Pandalur, vaccine hesitancy is high due to the spread of misleading videos through mobile messaging applications that people taking the vaccine were developing complications. Stan Thekaekara said that they are countering these misleading videos by recording videos of community members taking the vaccine. “The videos have community members who have taken the jab speaking of their experiences, and are an attempt to convince more members to come forward to take the vaccine,” said Mr. Thekaekara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-taken-to-overcome-vaccine-hesitancy-among-tribal-people-in-the-nilgiris/article34553529.ece

Periyasamy and Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu on Thursday reviewed anti-COVID-19 operations in the district to find more strategies to curb spread of the viral infection. Speaking to reporters at the end of a review meeting with Collector V. Vishnu and other senior officials, Mr. Thangam Thennarasu said supply of 41 KL medical-grade liquid oxygen by neighbouring Kerala had stopped. Hence, alternative measures to ensure availability of oxygen for COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment in southern districts were being explored. Even as the ‘Oxygen Express’ from Rourkela was expected to arrive in Tamil Nadu on Friday, steps had been taken to generate medical-grade oxygen in plants of Jindal Steel Works and Tamil Nadu Newsprints Limited. “Though there is a ban on using industrial oxygen for other purposes, the present situation has compelled us to get medical-grade oxygen from all possible sources to save every COVID-19 patient under treatment in Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Thennarasu said. The State Government would discuss with Kerala on restoration of oxygen supply to Tamil Nadu, he added. Mr. Periyasamy said the meeting, which had decided to increase the number of COVID-19 tests, discussed in detail about meeting the oxygen requirement. The State government, which was keen on achieving ‘zero infection’ in all distrits, would extend all possible medical treatment to patients undergoing treatment for the viral infection. Mr. Appavu said appointment of 200 more doctors in Tirunelveli was discussed at the meeting to ensure early medical intervention and best possible treatment to COVID-19 patients. “Medical Officers attached to all primary health centres in the district have been advised to take samples if patients come to the PHCs with cough, cold and fever.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-under-way-to-tackle-short-supply-of-oxygen-says-minister/article34553873.ece

Radhakrishnan, the Advocate-General said the counters would be shifted to the stadium as early as possible. During the course of the hearing, advocate Naveen Kumar Murthi brought to the notice of the court that patients were dying in ambulances that queued up outside government hospitals while waiting for their turn to get admitted. He claimed that nine patients had died in ambulances because they could not get admitted in time, and urged the court to issue appropriate directions. Observing that they, too, had seen photographs of ambulances queuing up outside hospitals in newspapers, the judges, in their interim order, wrote: “Learned Advocate-General has assured the court that steps are being taken to ensure that there is no such queuing up and that ambulances are not held as additional hospital units. For such purpose, additional stretchers may be procured by government hospitals to house patients in corridors and other places.” The court went on to state: “This is a war-like situation where treatment has to be afforded to all who need the same. By and large, things appear to be under control and nothing untoward has, thankfully, been reported on account of lack of oxygen or the like. However, to ensure that there is prevention of a large number of cases in future, immediate steps need to be taken to accelerate the rate of vaccination and create awareness of the need for inoculation.” Taking note of some hospitals in Tamil Nadu as well as in Puducherry lying in disuse, the court ordered that every endeavour must be made to convert these establishments into makeshift hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nehru-stadium-is-remdesivir-sales-point/article34553487.ece

14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: Yediyurappa, Ministers vociferously defend their work||Under intense public scrutiny and attack from the Opposition over COVID-19 management across the State, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his Cabinet colleagues came out on Thursday to vociferously defend their work. Reeling out statistics on beds and supply of oxygen, medicines, and vaccines available in the State, and the support from the Centre, Mr. Yediyurappa, flanked by his Cabinet colleagues at a nearly hourlong press conference, gave an impression that Karnataka was doing much better in comparison with other States. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, in particular, said Karnataka was among the best in the country in COVID-19 management. Oxygen supply While the Opposition has been a vocal critic of the Centre over oxygen supply, some of the statistics laid out by the Chief Minister also pointed at it. According to Mr. Yediyurappa, while the Union government increased oxygen allocation from 965 tonnes to 1,015 tonnes, currently 765 tonnes is available. Nearly 250 tonnes is coming from Odisha and Visakhapatnam. “We received 1,050 MT of oxygen on May 11 and have received 800 MT on May 12. The entire allocation to the State and what is available in the State is being completely used. Attempts are being made to get oxygen from other States and efforts are on to increase oxygen production,” he added. However, Dr. Narayan claimed that there was no shortage of oxygen in the State currently, and efforts were being made to have a buffer stock of oxygen. “The needs of all hospitals have been met.” The earlier problem was that the demand went up by about 100 to 150 tonnes in March as consumption drastically increased, he added. The Chief Minister said that of the 127 oxygen production units being established, 62 were being funded by the State while 27 were being funded by the Centre and 24 by the NHAI. Of the about 10,000 oxygen cylinders to be procured to meet the demand in districts, the State had bought 730 cylinders and the Centre had given 380. With respect to Remdesivir allocation, Mr. Yediyurappa said that of the 3.01 lakh vials allocated to Karnataka between April 21 and May 9, about 2.77 lakh vials had been supplied so far. Between May 10 and 16, the State had been allocated 2.74 lakh vials. “Due to increase in demand, we have asked the Centre to allocate from the quota of other States where it has not been used,” he added. The Chief Minister also said that the cases and positivity rate were on the decline in Bengaluru, Bidar, and Kalaburagi owing to strict lockdown. “There is no need to panic. Accept strict lockdown and only then we can get expected results,” he requested. Oxygenated beds Meanwhile, Revenue Minister R. Ashok accused private medical colleges and private hospitalsof furnishing false data on oxygenated beds, and physical inspection of hospitals had led to additional 2,106 oxygenated bedsmade available to the public in the last one week. He also said that 1,635 COVID care centres with oxygen were also functioning in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-yediyurappa-ministers-vociferously-defend-their-work/article34553470.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Drop in demand for regular beds||Over the last week, many private hospitals have recorded a drop in demand for regular beds. H. M. Prasanna, President, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), who confirmed this trend, said the number of patients needing general beds has reduced. However, demand for oxygenated beds, which includes high dependency units and ICU beds with ventilators, continues to remain high. One of the reasons is that by the time patients are hospitalised, they need to be immediately given oxygen, said Mr. Prasanna. As on May 13, data provided by the BBMP showed that as many as 2,739 of the total 15,041 beds were available in the city. This includes all types of beds in government medical colleges and hospitals and private medical colleges and private hospitals. However, a break-up of the data showed that a majority of the hospitals did not have a single bed vacant in the high dependency units, ICU or ICU with ventilators. Anoop Amarnath, Head of Department, Internal Medicine, Manipal Hospitals and member of critical care support group, Government of Karnataka, said there is a small dip in the requirement for general beds in the last three to four days at their hospital. “This could be because of the good triaging model that determines the priority of patients treatment based on severity of their condition. The availability of more COVID Care Centres where patients with mild symptoms are treated has helped free up the hospital beds. Vikram Sreeram, managing director of Mallige Hospital, also observed a similar trend. “The demand for general beds even under the government quota has reduced in the last four days,” he said, but added that it was too early to make any inferences or say that this was an indication of positive cases reducing.  This could be because of the good triaging model that determines the priority of patients treatment based on severity of their condition Anoop Amarnath, HoD, Internal Medicine, Manipal Hospitals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drop-in-demand-for-regular-beds/article34553446.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Centre being partial to U.P.: HDK||The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday accused the Centre of being partial to Uttar Pradesh, alleging that the Centre had supplied only 120 tonnes of oxygen to Karnataka despite the court’s order to supply 1,200 tonnes. “The Centre has displayed the height of partiality by providing 1,680 metric tonnes of Oxygen to Uttar Pradesh though it has fewer COVID cases compared to us (Karnataka),” he tweeted. “Have Kannadigas become orphans in this federal structure? The bias attitude of the Centre with respect to Karnataka has been exposed by the statistics furnished by the Government itself,” he said in a series of tweets. Questioning the Centre over the allocation, Mr. Kumaraswamy, he said: “Why the Centre has so much contempt against Karnataka and Kannadigas? Is it due to the fact that Karnataka has elected highest MPs for the BJP or is it an effort to project Yediyurappa as a villain?” He alleged that the Centre should understand that it is functioning under a federal structure and hence equal priority should be given to all the States. It is an obligation on the part of the government to take care of the needs of those in dire situation, he added. The former Chief Minister said, “The Chief Secretary himself has expressed helplessness with respect to the availability of vaccines. He has said that those wanting to take the first dose will have to wait as priority would be given to those taking the second dose in the wake of the Centre supplying only 7 lakh doses as against the request to provide 3 crore doses.” He asked those supporting the decisions of the BJP if they were willing to take responsibility for the large number of Kannadigas who were losing their lives owing to oxygen shortage. “Though the Centre gave only 120 metric tonnes of oxygen as against the court instruction of 1,200 metric tonnes, the Union Ministers and BJP MPs have fallen over to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi and thank him for the oxygen.” The Centre should shun the arrogance that comes from the belief that it was most powerful and instead take measures to fulfil the genuine requirements of Karnataka and realise that it was running the federal government, he added. However, responding to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s tweets, BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi in a tweet said the total allocation of oxygen for Karnataka was 1,075 tonnes, and the 120 tonnes mentioned was through one Oxygen Express to meet the State’s emergency needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-being-partial-to-up-hdk/article34553473.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Chamarajanagar deaths: Decide on paying ad hoc compensation: HC to govt.||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to decide on payment of compensation to families of thsoe who died owing to a lack of oxygen supply at Chamarajanagar district hospital early this month. A State-level COVID-19 monitoring committee, consisting two retired judges of the High Court, of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority had in its report to the court recommended payment of compensation while pointing out that 24 patients had died between May 2 and 3. The court also said that it will consider issuing direction on payment of ad hoc compensation if the government is unable take a stand on paying compensation as the committee has clearly pointed out that patients had died due to lack of supply of oxygen besides elaborating on the causes for lack of oxygen supply. The court also pointed out the death audit report of the hospital itself had found that three patients had died due to lack of oxygen. A Special Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, said that first priority is to pay at least ad hoc compensation to the families of victims, and later to focus on the actions to be initiated against those involved in the Chamarajanagar district administration and the hospital for their failure. As the report prima facie pointed out manipulation by tampering of LMO register maintained from April 29, 2021 and two oxygen consumption registers maintained by the bio-medical engineer, the Bench directed the Chief Secretary to keep the records seized on the directions of the court in his custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chamarajanagar-deaths-decide-on-paying-ad-hoc-compensation-hc-to-govt/article34553449.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||It is going to be a long wait to get a jab in private hospitals||Getting a jab at private hospitals in Karnataka is going to take longer as they are still negotiating with vaccine manufacturers to procure vaccines. Barring a few hospitals, the majority of the hospitals stopped vaccination on May 1 as they stopped receiving the doses from the government. H.M. Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), who are trying to procure vaccines for all the private hospitals in the city, said that they are likely to take at least another one-and-a-half months to get their supply of vaccine. He said that they had got in touch with Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, and Reddy’s Lab. Many hospital management say that they are hassled as people have been turning up at the hospitals after booking appointments on the CoWIN portal. “We do not have a stock of vaccines but they book appointments on the CoWIN portal. They turn up at the gate and when we inform them that we do not have any stock of the vaccine, they become abusive,” a hospital management member stated. However, many hospital managements are trying to directly get in touch with vaccine manufacturers and are hoping to get vaccine stock in a week or two. “We were left in a spot early this week as we did not get enough time to get in touch with vaccine manufacturers and were left scrambling for vaccine stock,” a board member of a hospital management said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/it-is-going-to-be-a-long-wait-to-get-a-jab-in-private-hospitals/article34553453.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Priority in vaccination to be given to over 19 lakh people who have taken first dose||More than 19 lakh persons above 45 years, who have taken the first dose of vaccine in the State, have become eligible for the second dose for whom priority would be given, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said on Thursday. “Of about 1.1 crore doses received by the State, about 99.5 lakh doses have come from Covishield and the rest from Covaxin,” he told reporters. “We are in constant touch with the Centre and are hopeful of receiving doses by next week.” According to him 14.87 lakh beneficiaries of Covoshield have completed six weeks and are now eligible for the second dose, and 5.1 lakh Covaxin beneficiaries are eligible for second dose now. “The available stock will be given to those requiring second dose. The State has received 1.11 crore doses so far of which about 1.1 crore doses have been given,” he added. The Chief Minister said that the State government is purchasing 3 crore doses to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44. Without providing a timeline, Health Minister K. Sudhakar said that the vaccination for those between 18 and 44 years will be done when the State receives its quota. “The Centre has told States that it will buy 50% of the total vaccines from the two vaccine manufacturers and provide it to States.” The Health Minister said there were an estimated 63 lakh in the State who are above 45 years yet to take the first dose. While 36 lakh above 60 years have received the first dose, 11.09 lakh have received both doses. In the 44 to 59 age bracket, 37.53 lakh have received first dose and 5.54 lakh have received both the doses, he added.    Meanwhile, the State has requested the Centre to provide medicines to combat Mucormycosis or the black fungus that has been reported in post COVID cases in Karnataka and Maharashtra. He said that the fungus has been noticed in a few cases in post COVID recovery stage following over use of steroids, Remdesivir and oxygen among persons with comorbidities. “We have sought a stock of 25,000 vials from the Centre and we have also bought 1,050.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/priority-in-vaccination-to-be-given-to-over-19-lakh-people-who-have-taken-first-dose/article34553454.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bear entire cost of vaccination drive, Congress tells Centre||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar on Thursday demanded that the Union government bear the entire cost of COVID-19 vaccination drive and free the States from the financial burden. “The Centre should bear the entire cost of the vaccine and take the responsibility of supplying it to States. All citizens should be given free vaccination,” he told mediapersons here. Condemning the “silence” of 25 BJP MPs and their “failure” to put pressure on the Centre on supplying vaccine and drugs related to the pandemic, the Congress leader said the “double-engine government” (BJP government in the State and at the Centre) had not lived up to the expectations of the people. It has not supplied vaccine, oxygen, and ventilators adequately and has not provided proper treatment to virus-infected patients. The States, which were already financially stressed owing to lockdown, should not be burdened with having to place orders for vaccines. It was the duty of the Centre to provide vaccines to States and to ensure universal coverage free of cost, he said. Owing to shortage of supply, Karnataka has suspended vaccination for the 18-44 age group from May 14. Noting that many people had taken extreme steps owing to the COVID-19-induced lockdown and loss of income and jobs, the Congress leader demanded that the State government provide financial support to growers of vegetables, flowers, and fruits, small vendors, and unskilled workers in the unorganised sector. Mr. Shivakumar,who led the party’s protest against the State government’s “failure” to handle the pandemic on Wednesday, also urged Chief MinisterB.S. Yediyurappa to convene a bankers’ meet to waive interest on loans borrowed by farmers and the poor, and reduce the price of fertilizers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bear-entire-cost-of-vaccination-drive-congress-tells-centre/article34553466.ece

In a letter addressed to the Chief Secretary, the commission has asked that infrastructure be put in place to treat children before the next wave strikes. This includes reservation of beds for children in both government and private hospitals. The committee has also asked the State government to form supervisory committees to protect the rights of children who have lost both their parents owing to COVID-19. “There are many cases of children losing both their parents in the State. Because of the lockdown it is becoming difficult to protect the rights of those children. There are chances of them becoming victims of human trafficking, illegal adoption, and others,” stated the commission in the letter, adding that hospitals should be established along the lines of those launched by the Maharashtra government to treat orphaned children. It also underscored the need to form a supervisory committee at both the district and the State levels. Members of the supervisory committee should include officers from the Women and Child Development, the Education, the Social Welfare, the Health and Family Welfare Departments, the police, and others. The State government has already appointed a nodal officer to provide all necessary facilities and support to the orphaned children.

If vaccine companies do not manufacture them, should we hang ourselves?” asked Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Thursday. Defending the delay in vaccine manufacturing, he told reporters that vaccine manufacturing had been affected owing to delay in arrival of raw materials. He said that the government had been prompt in handling the pandemic. At the same press conference, BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi said: “Judges do not know everything,” while referring to Sarvajna in Kannada. He said: “Whether it is State or Central government, both have to work on the advice of the technical experts.

Shivakumar tweeted: “BJP leader C.T. Ravi’s statement against judges that they were not Sarvajnas is highly condemnable.

Yediyurappa, M.P. Renukacharya, attacking Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti for his “carelessness” that has inconvenienced the government. Taking to Twitter, Mr. Renukacharya said: “Umesh Katti has failed in supply of rice during the COVID time. I have spoken to the chief minister for the supply of 5 kg rice and he has agreed to it.” He further urged Mr. Katti to give up his “careless” attitude and stop issuing funny statements that were inconveniencing the government. “Being a eight-time legislator and a Minister, he has to take up serious work to help people during COVID-19,” Mr. Renukacharya said. Without referring to anyone, he said:“Being a Minister, instead of working for people, you are lobbying in Delhi to change the Chief Minister. Just because a loser in an election goes to Delhi, the Chief Minister will not be changed.” Meanwhile, BJP sources said that the attack against Mr. Katti by Mr. Renukacharyawas part of the ongoing factional fight between those opposed to the Chief Minister and those in the Chief Minister’s camp.

14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||More than 300 govt. employees have succumbed to COVID-19||In an indication of the susceptibility of government employees to COVID-19 because of the nature of their work, the Karnataka State Government Employees’ Association (KSGEA) has said that more than 300 government employees have succumbed to the infection during the second wave of the pandemic. Though a majority of government employees have been asked to work from home, more than 300 employees, largely primary and secondary school teachers, lost their lives owing to the havoc created by the widespread virus, KSGEA president C.S. Shadakshari told The Hindu . The teaching community has been largely affected by the virus. The pandemic claimed the lives of around 250 primary and secondary school teachers. Teachers of Bengaluru and Kalaburagi divisions have been largely affected and around 150 teachers succumbed to the infection in these two divisions, according to sources in the government, he said. Owing to many teachers’ deaths, Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association general secretary Chandrashekar Nugli said the association had urged the government to reserve 10% of beds in government hospitals for teachers. He said that 53 infected teachers had died in Vijayapura district alone. The government has announced payment of an ex gratia amount of Rs. 30 lakh to families of all department employees who died owing to the pandemic while on COVID-19 duty. Meanwhile, the KSGEA urged the government to vaccinate all government employees to ensure delivery of services to the public. Mr. Shadakshari said a petition had been submitted to Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar seeking further reduction in the number of staff in departments such as Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Urban Development, Food and Civil Supplies, Energy, DPAR, Finance, Animal Husbandry, Agriculture, Horticulture, Labour, and Commerce and Industries, which were currently operating with 50% staff in offices.

This was about 30% last month,” the former Chief Minister tweeted. ‘Step up infra’ Instead of concentrating on Bengaluru alone, the government should take steps to upgrade health infrastructure in districts, taluks and villages, he suggested. “There is still time for the government to improve health infra in rural areas by increasing beds, oxygen supply, and healthcare staff, etc.” Stating that district in-charge Ministers should be made responsible for controlling the pandemic in their districts, he appealed to the government to direct all Ministers to stay in their respective districts and monitor the situation. “Miserable state of rural health infra was exposed in the first wave. Yet, the government failed to improve the situation. It is unfortunate that @BJP4Karnataka govt has failed to act even after the Chamarajanagar oxygen crisis incident that killed 28 patients,” the former Chief Minister tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/case-surge-in-rural-areas-worrisome/article34553467.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Has direction on SMS on COVID-19 result in 24 hours been implemented effectively’||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday told the State government that one of its staff members, who died of COVID-19 on Wednesday night, appears to have not received an SMS intimation about the result of his sample test till he died, while questioning whether the court’s direction to intimate test results within 24 hours to patients has been implemented effecively. A Special Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, told the government counsel that S.V. Muniraju, 45, a driver, had given his sample for COVID-19 test on May 10 and he died on May 12 . On verification of the test result by the High Court’s registry, it was found that the sample was sent to the lab for test after 22 hours, at around 9 a.m. on May 11, and the sample was tested and result was ready. The registry has later found that he tested positive but perhaps he had not received intimation through SMS about test result and due to which he could not get proper treatment. The High Court, on complaints of delay in getting COVID-19 test results and intimation, in April directed the government to ensure conduct of test and intimation of test results within 24 hours of sample collected. The government had also issued a notification in this regard. Clarifying that it is not taking this issue as he was the court’s staff member but it was concerned about implementation of court’s order and lives of citizen, it directed the government to take action against concerned persons and submit a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/has-direction-on-sms-on-covid-19-result-in-24-hours-been-implemented-effectively/article34553451.ece

14 May 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Varsity V-C, Registrar file plaints against each other||The differences between Vice-Chancellor B.P. Veerabhadrappa and Registrar S.S. Patil in Kuvempu University have reached the police station. Both have filed complaints against each other with the Bhadravati police over the “handing over the charge” of the Registrar’s post. The State government issued an order appointing KAS officer C.N. Sridhar, Registrar of the university on May 10 and the order was cancelled the next day. However, before the order was cancelled, the university staff witnessed a high drama on the campus on May 11. In the absence of the incumbent Registrar, the KAS officer took charge in presence of the Vice-Chancellor and others. As the transfer order was withdrawn later on the day, the V-C got the Registrar’s chamber locked up and sealed. The next day Mr. Patil returned to his chamber. Now, the V-C has accused that Mr. Patil broke open the lock illegally and also filed a complaint with the police. On the other hand, Mr. Patil alleged that the V-C and others trespassed his chamber in his absence. Mr. Veerabhadrappa has maintained that locking up the chamber was necessary to avoid confusion. “As soon as the new officer took charge, I relieved Mr. Patil from the post. But later the transfer order was cancelled. By then, Mr. Patil was relieved. Hence, I locked up the Registrar’s chamber and got it sealed to avoid any confusion,” he told The Hindu . The next day, he alleged, Mr. Patil broke open the lock and entered the chamber. “I have filed a complaint with the police and also informed the State government,” he said. Mr. Patil has countered the V-C’s argument. He told The Hindu that he held the post as he neither handed over the charge nor that the V-C had the power to relieve him from the post. “The transfer order was cancelled by noon on May 11. However, the KAS officer reached the campus as late as 4.30 p.m. on the day. The V-C and the senior faculty entered my chamber late in the evening at 8 p.m. and made him occupy my chair. I have got the video footages of their act. They have no right to enter my room, where I have my belongings, without my knowledge. They did not call me to hand over the charge either,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/varsity-v-c-registrar-file-plaints-against-each-other/article34553457.ece

14 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fruit and vegetable farmers and traders hit hard||Farmers raising vegetable and fruits and merchants dealing with them, wholesale as well as retail, have been hit hard by the fortnight-long Janata Curfew and the lockdown that began on Monday with limited time available to dispose of produce. Though the government has said that there will be no restrictions on agricultural activities, trading in the produce is limited to the window for essentials purchase between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., thus blocking the entire supply chain. While farmers are unable to harvest and sell their entire produce in time, wholesale merchants are unable to sell produce in time to retailers due to the time restrictions. Secretary of Mangaluru APMC Varthakara Sangha B.K. Imtiyaz told The Hindu that wholesale traders who place orders with farmers have to lift produce whether or not they are able to sell them to retailers. The State-wide COVID-19 restrictions on commercial activities except between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. and the weekend curfew exclusive to Dakshina Kannada have affected traders severely, Mr. Imtiyaz said. A wholesale trader in fruits at APMC in Baikampady here said that wastage used to be up to 30% of the produce during normal days. “With restrictions in place, more than 50% of the fruits go waste so as our income. Wholesale merchants are throwing away rotten fruits with there being no choice,” he said. Nithin, a retail fruit merchant here, said that the reduced essentials purchase window has affected retail fruit vendors as they are unable to procure produce from wholesale traders, bring them to their shops and sell them within four hours. In Dakshina Kannada, this window has been reduced to just three hours thereby making things worse, he said. Consequently, their profit margins have shrunk with more wastage. Meanwhile, farmers growing vegetables and fruits across the State have been airing their distress on social media platforms and appealing to people to buy their produce at field price so that they do not suffer losses. However, a majority of them are unable to dispose of their produce which perish fast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fruit-and-vegetable-farmers-and-traders-hit-hard/article34553553.ece

Hospital in Mysuru on Thursday triggering tension on the premises. The patient was wheeled in two days ago to the old Jayadeva Hospital building, which is one of the COVID-19 triage centres and is located on the K.R. Hospital premises. “The condition of the patient, who had tested positive for COVID-19, was explained to the family at the time of admission. Despite attention and care, the patient passed away on Thursday evening following which the doctors and staff on duty were roughed up and assaulted,” according to S.S. Abhishek, president, Resident Doctors’ Association. He told The Hindu over phone that the incident has demoralised the medical fraternity who are attending to a national emergency and yet there was nobody to safeguard them. “We put ourselves at risk and are under tremendous pressure working almost 24x7 and yet, we come under attack,” Dr. Abhishek added. C.P. Nanjaraj, director, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, said he informed Commissioner of Police Chandragupta about the incident and sought additional security. Consequent to the developments, the police assured to step up security and also erect a barrier to prevent entry of unauthorised persons. One of the doctors at the triage centre said the hospital authorities were lax as there was only one lady deployed for security. The RMA members gave a written complaint about the incident and the police have assured to initiate action. This is the second such incident at K.R. Hospital in recent times, which has raised apprehension among the working doctors who have sought additional security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/doctors-roughed-up-over-patients-death/article34553464.ece

Sudhakar in the wake of an inquiry report attributing 24 deaths in Chamarajanagar earlier this month to shortage of oxygen. Mr. Dhruvanarayan, who is also a former MP representing Chamarajanagar, accused Dr. Sudhakar of misleading the public by claiming only three COVID-19 patients had died due to oxygen shortage.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Plan for 20 oxy-buses hits roadblock||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) proposes to have at least 20 oxy-buses to help COVID-19 patients in critical need of oxygen. A demo bus with eight oxygen cylinders has been fabricated. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Thursday tweeted that oxy-buses with the capacity to treat eight patients at a time will be stationed near government hospitals and triage centres. However, the shortage of oxygen cylinders is proving to be a major roadblock to the civic body’s plan. Indi Village Foundation, the organisation that is assisting the civic body with these buses, is not sure when they will be launched. According to a representative from the foundation, the plan was for the buses to have eight oxygen cylinders each. “But we have been hit hard by the scarcity of oxygen cylinders. We have now revised the plan, and are trying to incorporate oxygen concentrators instead of oxygen cylinders,” the representative said and added that with oxygen concentrators, the buses can be operated round-the-clock. While the buses will be funded by the foundation, the cost of each bus will now escalate. “We are looking at various options. We will have to import the oxygen concentrators and are in the process of doing so,” the representative said. With the change in plan, it remains unclear when the initiative will actually be rolled out. Mr. Gupta said that, apart from Indi Village Foundation, several other organisations too had come forward to assist the civic body with the initiative purely on a voluntary basis. “Our objective is to channelise efforts by various organisations. We are looking at standardisation and utility aspects of this initiative,” he said. Private initiative A similar initiative has been taken up by Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, in association with Greenwood High International School. They have launched five buses that will provide free oxygen to people waiting to get a bed outside hospitals. Each bus has been redesigned to accommodate 12 patients at a time. A press release stated that each patient will be able to use the oxygen for two hours and will also be given a free nasal cannula. “We plan to see how this initiative works for the next 10 days, and then scale up to 10 buses,” said Satish Kumar Jain of Maharaja Agrasen Hospital. Citizens who wish to avail this facility can call the hospital at 09620304864.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-for-20-oxy-buses-hits-roadblock/article34553437.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Patients, NGOs struggle to refill oxygen cylinders||Families of patients, who are dependent on oxygen cylinders at home, as well as non-government organisations and volunteer networks, who provide this service to individuals, are finding it increasingly difficult to get their cylinders filled. One of the reasons is a decision taken by the authorities to crack down on people hoarding oxygen cylinders and streamline supply to hospitals. Oxygen plants have been told not to fill empty cylinders brought by individuals. However, this measure has caused inconvenience to those who are genuinely in need of oxygen and getting treated at home. “Through our network, we have been supplying cylinders for those in need. For the last few days, individuals going to the plant to refill cylinders are facing problems. The staff of some plants are asking people to produce discharge letters from hospitals to refill cylinders or letters from doctors,” said Sabeen Nazir from Naasih Foundation. Due to the lack of oxygenated beds, many COVID-19 patients have no option but to use oxygen cylinders at home. Even patients who have been discharged from hospitals but need oxygen at home are reportedly facing difficulties. “Based on references from hospitals, we are supplying oxygen to people who have cylinders, but getting a letter from hospitals is a tedious process. We had a bank of 150 cylinders. On an average, we would send 40 to oxygen plants to be filled. But the plants are refusing to fill cylinders of NGOs,” Mr. Nazir added. Senior IAS official Munish Moudgil said, “Since March 9, we have asked plants not to refill cylinders brought by individuals. Steps have been taken to stop hoarding, as people may be selling cylinders in the black market. Filling of cylinders of individuals will result in short supply to hospitals. It is better for people who are in need of oxygen to get treated in hospitals.” However, NGOs point out that while prioritising supply to hospitals is important, the authorities should consider the genuine needs of patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/patients-ngos-struggle-to-refill-oxygen-cylinders/article34553443.ece

On Wednesday, the Karnataka Examinations Authority said the Common Entrance Test for admission to professional courses would be conducted on August 28 and 29, instead of July. The government’s decision to postpone the Class 10 board examination has come as a relief to parents and students. However, some students expressed their frustration and helplessness as the academic schedule has once again been thrown out of gear. D. Shashi Kumar from the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said it was the correct decision, given the spike in cases. “Health should be prioritised now, and we thank the Minister for taking this decision,” he said. He added that teaching and non-teaching staff of the various private schools would cooperate and work with the department whenever the new dates are announced. Seroprevalence Many parents are also worried about predictions that children will be especially vulnerable to a third wave of COVID-19. The Karnataka Private School Managements, Teaching and Non Teaching Staff Coordination Committee has written to the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee to conduct a seroprevalence survey among children. This, they said, will help them estimate the prevalence of antibodies of children during the second wave. The committee stated that it was important to do so in light of reports that there will be a third wave which would have serious academic consequences on students. Members pointed out that schools have been shut for more than a year and taking a decision on future course of action should be taken on the basis of this survey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sslc-exam-postponed-govt-to-announce-new-dates/article34553461.ece

The total availability of water is expected to be 168 tmcft at the reservoir at Hospet, Karnataka. Telangana’s share Meanwhile, in its monsoon forecast for 2021 released on Thursday, Skymet, a weather forecasting company, said the onset of southwest monsoon over Kerala was likely to be on May 30 with a model error of +/- 2 days. At the first online water review (Webex) meeting on Thursday of the Tungabhadra Board, which was attended by the dam Superintending Engineer, Anantapur HLC SE, and Kurnool in-charge SE, the pro rata entitlement of Karnataka was fixed at 110.143 tmcft. For Telangana, the entitlement was fixed at 5.159 tmcft. Out of the total entitlement of Andhra Pradesh, the Tungabhadra High-Level Canal will get 25.755 tmcft, the Lower Level Canal will get 19.019 tmcft and the KC Canal will receive 7.925 tmcft. The probable date of release of water is July 20, according to HLC Superintending Engineer Nayakanti Rajasekhar. The dam at present has an inflow of 4,632 cusecs, with availability of only 5.715 tmcft. The abstraction at the dam for the season ending this month is 170.8 tmcft and the pro rata allocation of the HLC system is 26.184 tmcft. The total will be 28.184 tmcft if we include 2 tmcft for KC Canal. The total quantum of water released from the dam was 28.184 tmcft, while the quantum realised at the A.P. border at Kanekal was 26.346 tmcft. The Skymet release says the monsoon is expected to be “healthy normal” to the tune of 103% (with an error margin of +/- 5%) of the long period average (LPA) of 880.6 mm for the four-month period from June to September. This will make it the third consecutive year of normal or above-normal monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-to-receive-5269-tmcft-water-from-tungabhadra/article34553931.ece
14 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka govt. pulled up by HC||Questioning why the State government overlooked a series of advisories by the Centre on need of timely administration of the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday said that the people of Karnataka would not have faced such a desperate situation to get the second dose had the State adhered to the advisories issued since April. The court directed the State government to adhere to the advisories on priority to be given on the second and submit to the Central government the district-wise need of two types of vaccine for the second dose. A Special Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, issued the directions while noticing that the Central government’s advisories were very clear on the timely completion of second dose. The Bench, from the advisories issued on April 14, April 29 and May 6, found that the Centre had categorically stated the requirement of completing two doses of vaccine within prescribed scheduled and on prioritising vaccine for the second doses. ‘Come clean’ “The government must tell the truth to the public. Let people unnecessarily not go to vaccination centres. You (State government) must come clean,” the Bench orally observed while pointing out the inconsistency in the data of vaccine required for the second dose and serious lapses on the part of State government in timely administration of second dose. The Bench pointed out that the data submitted earlier indicated requirement of 26,08,907 doses of the vaccine for administration of second dose to those who have already completed 4 to 6 weeks from taking the first dose. However, the data submitted by the State government on Thursday stated that only 19,97,729 doses were required for the second dose, the Bench said. It also noticed from the submissions of amicus curie Vikram Hilgol that an additional around 5.28 lakh doses of vaccine were required for health and frontline workers for the second dose. To a query by the Bench on what happens if the second dose is not given within the ideal period of 4 to 8 weeks, Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General of India, said that an expert group is likely to give its view on this aspect within a couple of days. “India cannot afford to waste even a single dose of vaccine,” she said, while assuring the Bench that Centre would make an endeavour to make sufficient allocation of vaccine for second dose while pointing out that Karnataka has efficiently used vaccine doses as wastage is not much. On a query whether Karnataka committed default of Centre’s advisories, she said that Centre jointly with States wants to ensure vaccination of citizens, and its is for the States to implement its advisories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-govt-pulled-up-by-hc/article34553354.ece

14 May 2021||G.V.R. Subba RaoVIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID-19 dampens Ramzan festive mood||COVID-19 has dampened the festive mood in the shopping hubs in the city on the eve of Ramzan on Thursday. The festive mood was clearly missing in One Town and other commercial areas. Not much activity was witnessed near masjids as well where religious texts and other essentials are sold. Traders lament that not even usual business is taking place, leave alone Ramzan festival sales. “Last year’s lockdown saw a complete closure of Ramzan activities. This year, the police gave us permission to open shops. But, there are no customers,” says Suleman, a shopkeeper at Panja Centre here. While curfew restrictions are in place on the one hand, rumours that there is a “COVID outbreak” at Panja Centre spoiled the mood on the other. “People are not venturing out. There is a dip in sales by 75%,” Mr. Suleman says. “I have more stock than customers,” says G. Prasad, a fancy shop owner. The counter collections used to be more than Rs. 30,000 on the eve of Ramzan. During Ramzan season, the sales used to be between Rs. 2.5 lakh and Rs. 3 lakh. This year, it is not even Rs. 40,000. Though the shop was opened by 6.30 a.m., the sales did not cross even Rs. .4,000,” he says. “Look at that semiya seller. His situation is worse,” Mr. Prasad says pointing his finger at Osman. The roadside vermicelli vendor recalls that he used to sell not less than 1,000 kg two years ago. Last year, there were no sales at all due to lockdown. This year, 100 kg of semiya was put on sale. Of this, still 10 kg vermicelli is unsold. Except distributing it to friends and relatives, there is no other option, he says. Mr. Suleman says customers and vendors from nearby places in the district had not turned up this year. Their share of sales alone used to be 50%, he says. “People have no money and are not witnessing any business. They are celebrating with whatever is available. That is the situation now," he says. “This year is much worse than last year, which witnessed lockdowns. One can see deserted streets and shuttered shops. No trader, or for that matter a commoner, would have suffered so much. These two years are the worst part of our lives,” sums up Mr. Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-19-dampens-ramzan-festive-mood/article34553405.ece

Reacting to wishes from the Twitterati on his well-being after his recovery from COVID-19, he asked people not to self-medicate, follow the advice of medical experts, stop watching negative news on TV channels and stop relying on WhatsApp expertise. Exercise and stay strong mentally was his advice. The Minister was bombarded with questions on vaccination and shortage of medicines while some personally requested for the same. He agreed on the vaccine availability challenge, but said Telangana was doing better compared to national average. He also shared a chart which mentioned Telangana’s vaccination performance (per million population) at 1,41,939. On the improvement of medical infrastructure in Telangana, he said that the oxygen beds alone were 9,213 in September 2020 which have gone up to 20,739 in May 2021. On the oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir injections being sold at extremely high prices, he said the Central government had taken over oxygen distribution and the State government was doing an audit by private hospitals on consumption. He said doctors were under pressure from patients to use it and this demand has led to hoarding. However, the government has cracked down on the black-marketeers. Vaccination slots With regard to vaccination slots, the Minister said that so far in Telangana 45.37 lakh people have been vaccinated with first dose, out of the total 45-plus population of 92.24 lakh. Second dose has been given to more than 10.3 lakh people. “Ideally 70% population being vaccinated should break the chain. So out of the 2.9 crore adult population in Telangana we need to vaccinate 1.9 crore people. Since it’s a two-dose vaccine, we need 3.8 crore doses,” he said. On procuring vaccine at State level, the Minister reminded that the Central government has mandated that 85% of all production be handed over to it. From the remaining 15% all States and institutions have to compete. The government can’t procure from abroad as Drug Controller General of India has allowed for usage of only Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik in India. “Hopefully Pfizer and Moderna will be allowed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-doing-better-on-covid-front-says-ktr/article34553857.ece

14 May 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||NIA files FIR in Sri Lankan drugs and arms seizure case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has filed a First Information Report (FIR) in the reported seizure of drugs and arms and ammunition from a Sri Lankan fishing vessel off Vizhinjam in March. The FIR was filed before the Special Court for NIA cases, Ernakulam. The Narcotics Control Bureau had earlier registered a case after the law enforcement agencies arrested six Sri Lankan nationals and reportedly seized 301 kg of heroin, five AK-47 rifles and a thousand 9mm ammunition from the vessel Ravihansi from the Arabian Sea on March 25. Cases were booked against the foreign nationals under the provisions of the Arms Act and the Indian Penal Code. Later, the Home Ministry directed the NIA to book a case after it was found that a Scheduled Offence under the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, was committed by the accused. The NIA was brought in to investigate the crime considering the gravity of the offence and its ramifications on national and international security, the FIR noted. Coast Guard in the dock Incidentally, L.Y. Nandana, one of the six accused in the case, had earlier complained before the a trial court in Thiruvananthapuram that officials of the Coast Guard made him lie on a hot iron plate, used to cook food, beneath which was a lighted gas stove. The accused, who suffered burn injuries on his back, was produced before the court. Later, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, on an instruction from the Additional Sessions Judge 1 of Thiruvananthapuram, directed that the accused be admitted to the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapruam. The magistrate has sought information from the Coast Guard on the men who were on board the vessel on the day of the alleged ill-treatment.

14 May 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. mulling leadership change in Kerala||After being roundly criticised for its rickety organisational structure, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) is contemplating a change of guard, including replacing Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran as well as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala. The State leadership has been facing mounting demands for their immediate ouster for the downfall of the party in the Assembly election. Never before has the Congress party been electorally routed in recent times. The party won 21 seats this time, one less than in the 2016 Assembly election. However, its popular vote-share moderately improved to 25.12% from 23.80% last time. This has been attributed to the increase in the number of seats the party contested: 93 against 87. Sources said the organisational revamp from the top would strengthen the mandalam and booth committees, and bring in a coordinated mechanism in the party. The debilitated apparatus had resulted in the inability of the party leadership to chalk out a strategy for the Assembly election. A senior party functionary said no proper organisational poll had been held after 1991. Thus, many young leaders, fed up with the existing system of coteries attached to certain leaders occupying posts in the KPCC and the District Congress Committee, had remained dormant or chose to leave the party, he said. The Congress leadership has already come around to the view that its daring move to field K. Muraleedharan, Vadakara, MP in Nemom, backfired. The party lost its Hindu votes in other segments and also failed to receive the expected minority votes. He finished third after the BJP’s candidate, Kummanam Rajasekharan. “The party gave undue importance to Nemom... The Congress retained the Palakkad seat, defeating technocrat E. Sreedharan, one of the tallest candidates in that party. Likewise, BJP State president K. Surendran could not win from Manjeswaram. A reasonably good candidate would have been suited for Nemom as well,” K. Sudhakaran, Congress MP, told The Hindu on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-mulling-leadership-change-in-kerala/article34553369.ece

Oxygen shortage Meanwhile, State Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy, who held a video conference from Nellore with captains of industry, said the State government would soon come out with an oxygen policy and take short-term and long-term steps to overcome the shortage. He exhorted entrepreneurs to fulfil their corporate social responsibility and by chipping in with their contributions liberally to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Treatment from home strategy had proved effective as 16,530 patients in the district had been fully cured of the disease so far, Nellore Collector K.V.N.Chakradhar Babu said. Health workers, medical officers and volunteers were monitoring the health condition of 15,463 patients after providing them medical kits, he added.

14 May 2021||SANGAREDDY,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fall in migrants leaving Telangana||Thanks to the exclusion given to some sectors by the government during the 20-hour-a-day lockdown for the next 10 days, all the industries are running without any hurdle and this has given a huge relief to many migrant workers engaged in various industries. The Jogipet revenue division headquarters saw a considerable number of migrants walking towards different destinations in Maharashtra on Wednesday night. All of them had come from Hyderabad. Knowing this, the local scribes came forward and provided them water and snacks. Not only that, they informed the same to MLA Ch. Kranthi Kiran who has immediately responded and contacted the police, requesting them to provide food and transport to the migrants. “About 15 people, including women and children, arrived here in the night. We have provided them food and requested the transport vehicles to drop them at destinations nearest to their villages. There is a fear among the vehicle drivers that they might get infected with coronavirus if they offer transport to these migrants. Hence we have to convince them to take these migrants along,” B. Srinivas, Circle Inspector, Jogipet told The Hindu . However, no migrants were found walking till afternoon in this town. It is expected that the migrants may reach the town in the evening as walking during daytime during the peak summer is a debilitating exercise . “This time, the number of migrants walking to their native places is very less compared to the first wave of COVID-19, when there was an exodus . It seems very few are planning to return back as the industries are running without any problem. They will lose their earnings by going to their native places and any loss of income during the pandemic situation will be a serious problem for any family,” said Srinivas, an official working at Sangareddy. However, on Thursday, a family with children was seen walking from Nasapur to Sadashivapet for about 50 kilometres as they lost their work at Narsapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fall-in-migrants-leaving-telangana/article34553364.ece

The building was constructed in 1991 and houses a marriage hall to accommodate 800 persons with dining hall, kitchen, party rooms, dormitories with separate rooms for the bride and the groom. The mushrooming of kalyana mandapams and community halls in the locality has prompted the management to take up refurbishments works to the building so as to suit to the requirements of the modern day public. The TTD decided to equip its building with centralised air-conditioning facility besides taking up improvement works to kitchen, dining hall and replacing the furniture among other things. It also transferred the funds to the GVMC for the execution of works. Though the TTD enhanced the service charges of the kalyana mandapam, the water charges remain untouched at Rs. 100 a day.

Jagan Mohan Reddy has called upon the officials to draw up a long-term plan for increasing medical oxygen production with immediate focus on setting up at least a 300 Metric Tonne (MT) facility at Kadapa or Krishnapatnam so that it will also be useful to the steel plants proposed to be established there. The daily consumption of medical oxygen in the State due to the second wave of COVID-19 surpassed 600 MT, which makes it necessary to prepare for future contingencies, he observed.

14 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Vaccination only way to win war against COVID-19’||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that vaccination is the only way to get rid of COVID-19 and insisted that the Union government should come out with alternatives to increase the vaccine production to meet the growing demand. Speaking on the occasion of releasing the first tranche of financial assistance to farmers under the YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme on Thursday, Mr. Jagan said if 26 crore people aged over 45 in the country were to be vaccinated, 52 crore doses would be required. Similarly, 60 crore people aged between 18 and 45 needed 120 crore doses. Thus, a total of 172 crore doses were needed, but so far only about 18 crore doses had been administered, which was less than 10% of the actual requirement. Mr. Jagan said Andhra Pradesh alone required over seven crore doses to cover all those aged above 18, whereas the Centre had given only 73 lakh doses till date. He said that only two companies were manufacturing vaccines across the country with just seven crore doses per month. While Bharat Biotech was producing one lakh doses, Serum Institute of India is making six lakh doses per month. He urged the public to wear masks, maintain social distance and wash hands frequently to prevent COVID infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-only-way-to-win-war-against-covid-19/article34553939.ece

14 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State in the forefront in job guarantee scheme||An increase in wage employment, material expenditure and issue of new job cards, the State’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (2005) story for 2020-21 looks bright. Andhra Pradesh was able to better utilise MGNREGA funds to provide employment to the workers and corresponding material wages. With the pandemic and reverse migration caused by the lockdown, the Central scheme helped thousands of workers to earn a livelihood, and the State was also able to create assets like buildings housing anganwadis, village secretariats and Rythu Bharosa Kendras, using the material component. According to an analytical report compiled by LibTech, represented by a team of engineers, social workers and social scientists focussed on improving public service delivery, using data available on public domain, from the financial years 2018-19 to 2020-2, of the total funds of Rs. 1,12,443.9 crore released by the Centre under the scheme for the financial year 2020-21, Andhra Pradesh’s share is Rs. 10,365.5 crore (9.21%). “We used the data available as on March 31, 2021, and focussed on key components such as MGNREGA expenditure, job cards, employment generated and payment issues,” says Chakradhar Buddha, one of the team members. For the first time, he points out, NREGA expenditure has crossed Rs. 10,000 crore in the State. Compared to last two years, the expenditure has increased to more than Rs. 10,020 crore and is in fact the highest in the history of the scheme implementation in the State. With this, AP stands in the third place in the country in terms of overall expenditure. Though the State has recorded higher expenditure than Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it has generated lower persondays than these states. “The dual muster system also contributed to increase in the expenditure,” explains Mr. Buddha. A total of 4.4 lakh (4,46,571) new job cards issued in the financial year 2020-21 and a total of 7.3 lakh (7,29,121) workers were added. This accounts for 3.44% of all job cards issued since the inception of the scheme in the State. The highest number of new job cards were issued in Anantapur (53,844) and Visakhapatnam district (52,062) and the least in Nellore district (15,689). This year, 26.04 crore persondays were generated, highest in the last three years, and a 30 % increase from 20.08 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-in-the-forefront-in-job-guarantee-scheme/article34553927.ece

Kantha Rao on Thursday directed managements of private schools and junior colleges to comply with the Supreme Court guidelines on the fee structure for online classes. In a statement, Justice Kantha Rao said the Commission had received complaints against managements of a few educational institutions who insisted on payment of full fee and if not paid, they were denying the link to the online classes being conducted in the wake of the pandemic. Citing the apex court’s order, Justice Kantha Rao said conduct of online classes had brought down the maintenance cost of schools. It was unfair on the part of the managements to claim charges for facilities that were not being given to the students. He said the Supreme Court had asked the managements to consider the financial constraints of the parents in these difficult times of the pandemic. He said even if a student had not paid fees, they should not be deprived of online classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fee-collection-panel-chief-warns-private-schools/article34553936.ece

Sailajanath has written a letter to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), drawing its attention to what he calls the “mishandling” of the COVID-19 crisis in the State by the YSRCP government, which has resulted in the death of patients due to absence of oxygen supply. In a statement released on Thursday, Dr. Sailajanath said he had urged the NHRC to direct the government to pay an ex gratia of Rs. 25 lakh each to the next of kin of those who died due to the “negligence of the government” and Rs. 10 lakh each to the next of kin of those who succumbed to the virus. He alleged that COVID deaths in hospitals was only a “tip of the iceberg,” as the actual number of deaths was higher. Asking Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to own up responsibility for the deaths, he said the government should have kept adequate stocks of oxygen ready to treat the virus-hit. “While people are dying, the government is busy foisting cases against opposition leaders,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-writes-to-nhrc-on-deaths-due-to-lack-of-oxygen/article34553934.ece

Her relatives alleged negligence on the part of the staff as she was made to wait despite being in an advanced stage of pregnancy. “Pregnant women normally suffer three to four hours of labour pain before delivery. This is a case of precipitous labour, where delivery happens rapidly, after pains begin. It is her third pregnancy and repeated pregnancies can result in this kind of a situation.

14 May 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Self-medication can lead to serious health complications’||With the non-availability of beds, oxygen in hospitals and lack of financial support to bear medical expenditure, many patients infected by COVID-19 are indulging in self-medication in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. A large number of patients and their relatives are approaching pharmacies without medical prescription of doctors. Almost all pharmacies, even those operated by corporate hospitals, are said to be providing medicines directly to customers. Medical experts say it is a dangerous trend and could lead to serious health complications among COVID-19 patients. “Incorrect self-diagnosis may worsen the health condition of patients instead of providing relief. It is not at all advisable for COVID-19 patients since symptoms may vary for each patient. The drug suggestions being circulated in social media should not be used by patients on their own. There could be side effects on many organs, including heart, liver and kidneys due to self-medication,” says senior physician and expert on infectious diseases Kutikuppala Suryarao, a Padma Sri awardee. Indian Medical Association member and senior doctor from Palasa in Srikakulam Duvvada Jeeviteswara Rao says that many patients in rural areas are depending on pharmacies due to non-availability of hospitals and medical assistance in their vicinity. “Patients should try to reach doctors over phone to get proper medical advice. There may not be any adverse impact with the usage of regular medicines for patients in stage-1. But self-medication is dangerous for the patients in the second and third stages,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/self-medication-can-lead-to-serious-health-complications/article34553403.ece

14 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||City grid-locked as shoppers ignore COVID norms||Hours to go before Id-ul-Fitr, massive traffic jams on arterial roads and clogged shopping areas were the norm on Thursday morning prior to the lockdown curfew hour of 10 a.m. Gudimalkapur, Charminar, Toli Chowki, Musheerbad, Monda Market, Moazzam Jahi Market and Begumpet shopping areas were packed with people till at least 10.15 a.m. before the shoppers dispersed and shops were shut. Long stretches of roads were gridlocked including near Hitex, Chaderghat, Langer Houz, Shaikpet, Filmnagar, Osmangunj, Afzalgunj, Nayapul, Musheerabad, Mehdipatnam and Masab Tank. At Gudimalkapur, which is one of the biggest wholesale and retail vegetable and flower markets in the city, the shoppers and buyers spilled over to the main road near Jyoti Nagar blocking traffic during the morning hours. “We went for shopping to Kondapur and returned via the service of Outer Ring Road as the traffic in Tolichowki was heavy,” said Swaraj, a resident of Friends Colony. Others were not so lucky. “I started at Secunderabad to reach a friend’s house in Gachibowli. I am still stuck near Toli Chowki. All stretches of roads are packed. It is difficult to even navigate a two-wheeler between Rethi Bowli and Shaikpet,” said Zubair, a degree student, at 9.45 a.m. The Charminar area witnessed especially heavy rush with people making last minute festive purchases before disappearing into the inner lanes of the city. Though a large number of people were wearing surgical masks, social distancing norms went for a toss. The four-hour break in lockdown meant that there was a tizzy with people either trying to buy everything in a hurry and return home creating chaos. While e-commerce deliveries are being allowed unlike the last lockdown, a majority of petrol outlets stayed shut creating a problem for delivery executives who could be seen trying to persuade shop hands to fill their vehicles with fuel. “Petrol outlets can function if they are on the highway. My outlet is open and nobody has asked us to shut the facility,” said a petrol outlet owner in Jubilee Hills area. However, by 11 a.m. the streets emptied out and police pickets enforced the lockdown by checking documents of all commuters on the roads. The All-India Muslim Personal Law Board issued a call to the Muslim community to keep Eid simple. “Limit your Id greetings to a verbal one, refrain from handshake or hugs. Wear masks, Leave a gap of one row between rows and a distance of one metre between two worshippers during Id prayers,” says a statement issued by AIMPLB. “We are asking people to pray at home and only a few people will pray at the masjid. There will be no communal prayers,” said Maulana Ghayasuddin Ahmed when asked about Id prayers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/city-grid-locked-as-shoppers-ignore-covid-norms/article34553850.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID cases in Telangana drop: DPH||Asserting that the incidence of coronavirus was showing a declining trend for the last few days, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that several parameters, including case positivity and fatality rates as well as admissions into hospitals, were showing a downtrend. Of the 71,221 persons tested on Thursday, 4,693 were found positive and there were 33 deaths. “New infections, death rate and case positivity rate are all coming down,” he said. Speaking to reporters, Dr. Srinivasa Rao, accompanied by Director of Medical Education Ramesh Reddy, said that while night curfew was in force since April 20, lockdown with four-hour relaxation was imposed in the State from Wednesday to further contain the spread of the virus. People should take precautions while entering markets or standing in queues at liquor outlets by religiously following the COVID protocols. “Lockdown has been imposed to save the lives of people. People who are following the restrictions for 20 hours a day should take adequate precautions during the relaxation time to ensure the virus does not spread,” he said, adding that emergency medical services including vaccination were continuing uninterrupted. In this context, he said administering the second dose for those aged above 45 was in progress with 15 lakh people already taking the second dose. “Focus will be on administering the second dose to people who took the first dose till this month-end based on the availability of the vaccine,” he said. People opting for the second dose need not register themselves and they could walk into the nearby vaccine centres to get it. There was however, no need to rush to the vaccine centres as the second dose of Covishield should be administered between six to eight weeks and Covaxin between four to six weeks. “In view of the time available, people should approach vaccine centres in such a manner that there is no rush,” he said. He expressed concern over reports of excess usage of oxygen and ‘unnecessary’ administration of drugs like Remdesivir. “There are effective alternatives to drugs like Remdesivir which could be utilised for treatment of patients. Doctors in private hospitals should understand that Remdesivir should be administered on specific indications. They should not misuse the drugs,” he said. Teams of medical professionals constituted by the government were in constant touch with private institutions advising them to ensure rational and judicious use of oxygen and drugs. Of the 450 metric tonne oxygen allotted to the State, 320 MT were being consumed by the private hospitals. These hospitals were advised to make judicious use of the commodity. There was also no cause of concern about the bed availability as close to 5,900 oxygen beds and over 2,700 ICU beds in different hospitals were vacant as on date. The government was constantly monitoring the use of drugs as well as oxygen on a daily basis and steps were afoot to set up more oxygen plants and procure more generators. He allayed apprehensions about black fungus claiming that it had been occurring in case of patients with immune compromise under high dose of steroids. On the availability of ventilators, he said that the strength of ventilators had been augmented by 1,300 in the recent past, but a minor chunk of them were not functioning. It was therefore, contemplated to deploy teams with biomedical expertise to rectify the lapses and ensure that the equipment was available for patients without any delays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-cases-in-telangana-drop-dph/article34553837.ece

Srinivasa Rao informed in the official bulletin that the number of active cases has reduced to 56,917 on Thursday as against 59,133 the day before with 6,876 persons having recovered from the virus. With this, the total number of those infected since last March is 5.16 lakh whereas the total number of those recovered is 4.57 lakh and the number of those dead during this period has risen to 2,867 from 2,834. The fatality rate across Telangana continues to be 0.55% with national average being 1.1%. The recovery rate has risen slightly to 88.42% more than the national average of 83.2%. Areas under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and surrounding districts continue to show high figures with the GHMC having 734 positive cases, Rangareddy 296, Medchal-Malkajgiri 285 and Sangareddy 136.

Relatively fewer cases came from the districts of Naryanapet (39), Adilabad (39) and Jangoan (45). Dr. Srinivasa Rao appealed to citizens to reach out to the nearest healthcare facility when symptoms surface as early treatment prevents complications. Children less than 10 years of age and elders above 60 years were asked to avoid going outdoors unless mandatory. Since there is a high incidence of COVID in the age group of 20-50 years, they should also refrain from going outside unless for work or essential shopping. Precautions like use of face mask and social distancing is a must. Meanwhile, GHMC is going to continue the fever survey on Eid with 718 teams visiting 51,178 houses.GHMC call centre 040 2111 1111 has been giving advice to people’s queries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/4693-test-positive-in-state-33-succumb/article34553833.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Blue Dart forms consortium for drone vaccine delivery||Express logistics service provider Blue Dart has formed a consortium to deliver vaccines using drones under the ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project of Telangana government, World Economic Forum, NITI Aayog and Healthnet Global. Union Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had recently granted the project certain exemptions and permission for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) delivery of vaccines on an experimental basis. Vikarabad has been chosen for the pilot project. A release from the company said the Blue Dart Med-Express consortium will revolutionise the delivery of vaccines and emergency medical supplies to the remotest parts of India with drones. CMO and Head-Business Development Ketan Kulkarni said, “The consortium aims at enabling safer, efficient and cost-effective drone delivery flights. With efficient systems in place, it can help reduce the current logistics cost, making the healthcare logistics faster and efficient.” Director of Emerging Technologies in the IT department of Telangana L. Rama Devi said, “The project would generate real and actionable insights to drive future adoption policies and integration with the existing healthcare supply chain. With COVID wrecking existing supply chains, adopting such disruptive technologies is the need of the hour.” It is the first such programmes in the country where multiple drones would fly BVLOS to establish their value proposition for the healthcare supply chain. The vision is to ensure healthcare equity for rural areas, Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/blue-dart-forms-consortium-for-drone-vaccine-delivery/article34553831.ece

Only four prayers are allowed in the presence of the imam. Do not believe the rumours on social media,” the Hyderabad Police Commissioner said, adding that action would initiated against persons who were those creating and spreading rumours. Mr. Kumar along with Additional Commissioners of Police Anil Kumar, DS Chauhan and other senior officers inspected the check posts on the Tank Bund. “We are effectively implementing the lockdown,” he said. “Yesterday, we held a virtual conference with religious leaders, politicians, imams, maulanas, and Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali on the importance of Ramzan prayers to reduce the impact of the Coronavirus,” the Police Commissioner said. He urged the citizens to follow the guidelines prescribed by the government for weddings and funerals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ramzan-prayers-to-be-held-at-home/article34553847.ece
14 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Govt. suppressing report on COVID treatment ‘scam’: Revanth||Congress MP and Telangana Congress Committee working president A. Revanth Reddy has alleged that the government had suppressed a report of the Enforcement and Vigilance department on the irregularities in purchase of medicines and equipment by Telangana State Medical Development Infrastructure Corporation (TSMDIC) for COVID treatment. The MP said purchases worth Rs. 450 crore were made last year for COIVID treatment through TSMDIC and irregularities worth crores were exposed by the Enforcement and Vigilance report. “Why is the government suppressing it and whom does it want to shield?” he asked at a press conference. Mr. Reddy said similar financial irregularities are likely in the government’s decision to go for global tenders for purchase of vaccines and medicines now. “The constitution of the Task Force committee by the government on coronavirus that will also deal with purchases clearly indicates it,” he alleged. Task Force The Congress MP questioned the decision to make IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao the Head of the Task Force committee. “Is it because the tenders are involved here,” he asked and claimed that none of the Task Force committee members were involved in dealing with COVID treatment since the last one year. In fact, former Health Minister Eatala Rajender, who had been active in handling coronavirus issue, has been deliberately moved out so that he can’t be part of the committee and the financial resources to be available for it, he claimed. He said the Task Force committee should consist of doctors, scientists and technologists involved in studying the virus and creating treatment for it rather than IAS officers who had no knowledge about it. “Ministers or IAS officers should only be involved in implementing the expert committee’s recommendations,” he argued. The Malkajgiri MP also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Central government stating that they had ignored the warnings of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders on the second wave. Mr. Modi should have considered the opinion of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or the Opposition leaders who sent a combined letter expressing their concerns and offering suggestions. He said the Central government is sitting on a request from him for an oxygen plant in a hospital owned by the Defence Department and being converted into COVID hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-suppressing-report-on-covid-treatment-scam-revanth/article34553855.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||None to keep surveillance on long-distance train passengers||While there is a lockdown in force for 20 hours a day with bus and metro rail services curtailed, the administration seems to have missed taking into account the hundreds of long-distance train passengers arriving in the capital daily. SCR officials said at least 50,000 passengers arrive in various special trains in the three stations of Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kacheguda. Passengers starting the journey are ‘randomly’ checked for temperature when they get into the trains, but there are no checks whatsoever, once they alight at the terminal station. “Last year, we had TS health department setting up a desk, taking down details of each and every passenger. Healthcare workers were calling up for next few days to inquire about their health. Though it was wound up in mid-June, it did serve a purpose to keep an eye on passengers arriving from other places with a quarantine stamp on their arms,” they pointed out, pleading anonymity. This year, despite rising cases,there is no such directive from the government. Senior officials accepted that monitoring and surveillance of passenger arrivals from ‘hot spots’ where positive cases are high is the need of the hour, for a more effective control of the pandemic along with the lockdown. It is being done at the airports where airlines have been insisting on negative RT-PCR tests. SCR is, meanwhile, ready to deploy 80-100 COVID isolation coaches at short notice if requested by the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/none-to-keep-surveillance-on-long-distance-train-passengers/article34553829.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High demand leads to shortage of key drug to treat Black Fungus||An exponential growth in demand for Liposomal Amphotericin B amid more people contracting Mucormycosis has resulted in an acute shortage of the key, expensive drug used in the treatment of the rare fungal infection. It was business as usual until even a fortnight ago for those dealing in the drug. “Suddenly, the quantities [sought] have doubled and the companies producing the drug say there is no stock,” said managing director of Medihauxe Pharma P. Girish Bhat. “Since yesterday, more than 150 patients with Mucormycosis or Black Fungus as it is also known are in touch with us in Hyderabad alone for the drug,” he said on Thursday, even while pointing that the quantities supplied by the producers in recent days are insufficient for even one patient. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens, according to an advisory prepared by experts and National Task Force for COVID-19. The demand for Liposomal Amphotericin B has been soaring in the face of many treated for COVID also getting this infection. Mr. Bhat said the selling price of the injection is Rs. 6,500 (50 mg vial), across brands, with the number of doses per day ranging from 4-6 depending on the weight of the patient. The treatment regime lasts 21 days for some. One of the largest distributors for life saving medicines in the region, his firm is a major distributor of the product manufactured by Mylan Laboratories, he said. Besides Mylan, some of the other companies making Liposomal Amphotericin B are Abbot India, Bharat Serum and Vaccines and Celon Labs. Without discounting the possibility of prices being revised upward by producers, he said it, however, was not easy for any manufacturer to meet such a steep increase in demand. It is very difficult for them, he said, citing how the demand has gone up from barely 10 patients contracting Black Fungus a month prior to the pandemic to the present 200-250. Two leading private hospitals in the city alone, to whom the firm supplies, want 25,000 vials, he said, adding to how improved allocation of medicines to Telangana could make a difference. Mylan Labs was yet to respond to a questionnaire at the time of going to print.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-demand-leads-to-shortage-of-key-drug-to-treat-black-fungus/article34553830.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre to help NGOs help needy during pandemic||In a move to help the suffering poor and the destitute on the streets because of the pandemic, the Central government, through the Food Corporation of India, has introduced a scheme of special dispensation for supply of foodgrains under Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS) to charitable and non-government organisations engaged in relief operations and engaged in running camps for migrant labour and vulnerable groups. Mr. Ashwini Kumar Gupta, (GM, FCI) said on Thursday the Central government as a one-time measure in view of the extraordinary situation caused by the pandemic that charitable trusts and NGOs running relief camps or community kitchens for providing food to the needy people may be provided foodgrains – both rice and wheat – under this OMSS which has been extended up to March 2022. “Accordingly, it was decided that the district collectors shall be nodal officers for the purpose. The charitable trusts and NGOs must first approach the collectors along with a request letters mentioning details of their organisations, purpose for which the rice will be used, quantity and depots from where they wished to lift the stocks,” the official said. Mr. Gupta said the offices of collectors will verify the credentials of the organisations and endorse the letters if the claims were genuine. Then, they may deposit the money to the account of the FCI regional office here. “The minimum quantity to purchase shall be one tonne but there was no cap on the maximum. The organisations may mail the request letters along with collector’s endorsement and payment particulars to the FCI which will then direct its divisional offices to issue release orders, he said. “Buyers must deposit full cost within five days and lift stocks within 10 days up to 10 tonnes. Above 10 tonnes, the cost must be met within 21 days and lifting the stocks within 35 days,” Mr. Gupta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-to-help-ngos-help-needy-during-pandemic/article34553841.ece
14 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Little curbs on people’s movements||The streets of Hyderabad are painting a different picture these lockdown days, with people venturing out on the roads even after 10 a.m. as if there are no restrictions in place. Ironically, police of three urban commissionerates — Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda — who claim to have set up more than 270 check-posts with over 18,000 personnel were hardly stopping any vehicles even in the afternoon. A trip from Langer Houz to Malakpet via Abids and Chaderghat, and return to Mehdipatnam, saw very little or no checking at check-posts even though vehicles are moving about till 12 noon, no less. Hundreds of two-wheelers and four-wheelers were moving freely and they were not stopped by the police personnel. Different situation Around 12 noon, police stopped and started questioning a few bikers near Mahavir Hospital, Ravindra Bharathi, and Andhra Bank signal at Sultan Bazar. Several concerned residents claim that the police have hardly visited their colonies since the lockdown was announced. “We are starting the vehicle check only after 12 noon. Until then we stop only a few vehicles,” said a policeman. The situation is completely different when the police personnel at the check-posts get a hint that their senior officers, who are hand-holding the situation, are on their way to inspect the area. However, top brass maintain that the lockdown enforcement was in place after 10 a.m. and people who were coming out without any valid reason were booked. “Apart from essential services, those who are venturing out on the streets are booked after 10 a.m., when the lockdown relaxation ends,” Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. He said that there are 180 check-posts and 39 pickets with over 12,000 personnel in their jurisdiction to act against the violators. “Senior officers in the rank of Additional Commissioner of Police are hand-holding the situation in each zone,” Mr. Kumar said. Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar said they have 75 check-posts with over 5,000 personnel deployed round-the-clock. “We are being polite to those who are coming out for vaccination and other essential services and the violators are taken to task,” he said. Meanwhile, Rachakonda police chief Mahesh M. Bhagwat said that at 46 check-posts they have deployed over 1,500 police officers to control the situation. “We are acting tough even against single persons not wearing masks inside the car,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/little-curbs-on-peoples-movements/article34553846.ece

Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar has taken the initiative to arrange a liquid oxygen tanker of five MT capacity from the Transport Department to bring the consignment of oxygen from the ITC’s paper mill near Bhadrachalam in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district to the District Headquarters Hospital here every day, sources said. Growing demand The arrangement will help cater to the growing demand for medical oxygen in the midst of the second wave of coronavirus infections. The District Headquarters Hospital has become self-sufficient in meeting the medical oxygen requirements of the critically-ill inpatients of the hospital following the operationalisation of the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plant at the hospital recently, sources added. The hospital already has 13,000 litres capacity Liquid Oxygen Tank (LOT). Timely gesture The ITC paper mill’s timely initiative to supply five MT of oxygen every day will further enhance the availability of oxygen stocks in the State-run major public healthcare facility in Khammam, sources in the hospital said.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Salman Khan can’t save this mess of a film||Mumbai is in the grip of a drug mafia. Teens are falling prey to substance abuse. The existing crime lords of the city don’t seem to be the main culprits. The perplexed police force decides to bring in a specialist to ‘clean up the city’. The latest Salman Khan starrer Radhe , directed by Prabhu Deva, acknowledges that the film is inspired by the 2017 South Korean film The Outlaws . But seriously, one needn’t look at international content for a storyline such as this one. There are enough masala films in India that have had similar storylines.  Radhe plays out like The-Outlaws -meets- Darbar -meets-many-masala-movies. Rajveer Shikwat or Radhe (Salman Khan)’s entry will put superheroes to shame. Who needs a Spider-Man or Superman when Radhe enters like a whirlwind and those at the receiving end are left to reconstruct what has just happened, in hindsight. The science-defying entry is meant solely for the massy superhero movies, to be lapped up by cheering fans in theatres. As theatres remain closed in many parts of the country, Salman keeps his almost annual date with Eid, through ZeePlex this time. Radhe’s reputation precedes his arrival. He is credited with 97 encounters and has been transferred 23 times. No task is challenging for him and he throws away redundant a punch line ‘ ek baar commitment kar diya toh apni bhi nahin sunta’ . It’s a role that Salman can sleepwalk through. If that isn’t enough, Dia (Disha Patani) believes that Radhe is an aspiring model and gives him suggestions for modelling and body language. Ghajini anyone? Disha is saddled with a ‘cute but downright dumb’ character. Megha Akash and Bharath are relegated to the background as young cops. At least Megha gets two scenes to make her presence felt. There isn’t much in the film to hold interest, but for the menacing Rana (Randeep Hooda) who proves to be elusive and a tough nut to crack, even for Radhe. But their face-off, especially in the pre-interval segment, falls flat. One can recall Tamil and Telugu masala films that have gotten these pre-interval clashes right, however repetitive or banal the storylines might have been.  Radhe’s story is all over the place and you hardly care for what’s happening on screen. Dance numbers are thrown in, including the much-publicised ‘ Seeti Maar’ (originally composed for the Telugu film DJ ). One of the biggest puzzles has to do with Jackie Shroff’s character. He plods through the film with ‘the script said so’ demeanour. Radhe is dreary and listless, with no attempt to do anything innovative.

14 May 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi’s demand down, can give extra oxygen to others: Sisodia||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said that Delhi’s daily medical oxygen requirement has come down with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases and that extra oxygen can be given to other States. “We have written to the Central government on Thursday that Delhi’s daily oxygen requirement now is only 582 MT, instead of 700 MT. We have informed the Central government that Delhi’s quota is 590 MT and the extra oxygen we are getting could be given to other States which need more oxygen,” Mr. Sisodia said in a video statement. He also said that the SOS calls for oxygen from hospitals have also come down. He said that the oxygen demand was directly proportional to the increase in cases. “During the peak period, we were getting regular SOS calls from the hospitals. Now, we receive 1-2 SOS calls daily which are fulfilled without any delay. Delhi government is a responsible government and hence it is requesting the Centre to reduce the daily oxygen allocation of Delhi to 582 MT,” he said. Huge profits Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said that he has urged the Union Health Minister to fix prices of vaccines at Rs. 150 and added that vaccine manufacturers were making huge profits. “The manufacturers of Covaxin and Covishield have considered this crisis as an opportunity to generate high profits. So, when Covishield is being supplied to the Centre at Rs. 150 and at this rate, the chairman has stated on record that they are incurring profits,” Mr. Jain said. “The company is manufacturing 6 crore vaccines every month. Even if we go by a profit of Rs. 10 per dose, and they give half of the vaccines to the Centre, which is 3 crore, the estimated profit comes out to be Rs. 30 crore. Now, the same vaccine is being sold to State governments at Rs. 300, which means the profit doubles, while the cost of production remains the same... So, on 100 crore doses, [they are making] a profit of Rs. 16,000 crore,” the Health Minister said. Mr. Jain said that he has also told the Union Minister that instead of States going separately for international tenders for vaccines, the Central government should buy it for all States. He also said that about 100 vaccination centres are closed due to shortage of vaccines. In a related development, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said that Delhi government should allow vaccination of people above 18 years at all centres so that maximum number of residents can be vaccinated in a less time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhis-demand-down-can-give-extra-oxygen-to-others-sisodia/article34553806.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC takes swipe at ‘irritating’ dialler tune on vaccination||The Delhi High Court on Thursday took a swipe at the “irritating” dialler tune message asking people to get vaccinated when there was not enough vaccine to inoculate everyone. “You have been playing one irritating message on the phone whenever one makes a call, for we do not know how long, that you should have the vaccination, when you don’t have enough vaccine,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said. “You are not vaccinating people, but you still say that vaccination ‘lagavaiye’ [get vaccinated]. Kaun lagayega vaccination [who will get vaccinated], when there is no vaccination. What is the point of the message,” the High Court remarked. “You should give it to everyone. Even if you are going to take money, give it. That is what even children are saying,” the Bench said, adding there should be more such messages instead of just one which is running for the whole time. “Till like a tape it stops running or starts skipping, you will run it for 10 years,” the court remarked as it asked the authorities to “have more of them [dialer messages]”. “When a person hears a different one every time, maybe it will help him/her,” it said. The High Court’s suggestion came while hearing a bunch of petitions related to the COVID-19 situation in the Capital. During the hearing, the Bench also suggested using TV anchors or producers to create awareness amongst public about use of oxygen concentrators, cylinders and vaccination. Awareness drive The Bench said that one litre oxygen concentrator machine are being sold at Rs. 60,000 while it really does not serve any purpose. It also said that people with oxygen level at 90 think they are being treated, but they need to be informed that treatment is also required. The court also suggested that celebrities could interview doctors which can then be publicised. “You need to do it fast,” the High Court said as it directed the Centre and Delhi government to submit their respective reports by May 18 on what steps they are going to take for disseminating information on COVID management through print and TV media and also dialer tunes.  You are not vaccinating people, but you still say that vaccination ‘lagavaiye’.

14 May 2021||New Delhi,||Not inclined to proceed in Hussain case: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said it was not going to proceed further into the plea seeking inquiry against AAP MLA Imran Hussain for alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders and distributing it free of cost to COVID-19 patients in his constituency. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli took note of the submission of the Delhi government that he was not provided the oxygen by the State or refillers from the quota allocated for COVID-19 patients. The court also expressed satisfaction with the explanation and invoice submitted by Mr. Hussain to show that he had taken 10 cylinders on rent and got them refilled from Faridabad. Senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, who is the amicus curiae, said the explanation tendered by Mr. Hussain “appears to be credible”. Image tarnished Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said that due to the instant plea the reputation of Mr. Hussain, a Cabinet Minister, was adversely affected and all the good work he did is brought to nought. Mr. Mehra said the plea was brought only against one party before the court and that too without doing any independent enquiry. There cannot be a fishing and roving enquiry, Mr. Mehra said, adding that it also deters the individual from doing any such work for the benefit of the people in the future. The court, however, said it cannot stop anyone from coming to court. It also said that it did not ask the AAP MLA to stop his distribution if he was not taking oxygen from the quota allocated to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/not-inclined-to-proceed-in-hussain-case-hc/article34553804.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Data consultant launches website to ease plasma donation process||In the second week of April, a 26-year-old data consultant who has thousands of followers on social media, decided to put the influence to good use and teamed up with a friend to create a website that brings together plasma donors for COVID-19 patients and help the needy. Divya Jain, who had been amplifying requirements of oxygen and plasma on social media, roped in a tech-savvy friend and created the website fightagainstcovid19.org after buying a domain. “I was getting a lot of requests for oxygen, plasma, hospital and medicines and I thought I have a good social media presence so should put it to good use. I thought of doing it on small scale but then it grew to a seven-member team,” she said, adding that all the members are her colleagues and friends. The team now has Rikit Shahi from Hyderabad, Himanshu Pandit from Indore, Ayushi Saxena from Gwalior, Amit Pundir, Savita Bisht and Padmini from Delhi. All of them operate from their homes and attend to the needs of their respective cities and nearby places.  Explaining the process, Ms. Jain said two types of people can use this website – those who can donate plasma and those who require it. “As soon as we get the information on plasma donation and that of plasma request, we call and verify the information and try to close the requirement within 12-24 hours,” she said. Currently, this group has nearly 2,000 donors out of which they have made 1,500 people meet the patients. “We send at least two donors to a patient and there is no guarantee that it’ll work out but we do the needful from our end,” she said. Ground realities Among the issues they faced on the ground, Ms. Jain said more people are coming forward to donate plasma in Maharashtra as compared to Delhi. The biggest reason for their reluctance is that people are scared to visit hospitals due to the situation. “We try and convince them to go to plasma bank instead of the hospitals,” she said. Another hassle for the donors, she said, is that because of the lockdown, people can’t travel. But patients’ families pitch in as it is their requirement. “The third biggest problem is the misconception that women can’t donate. Hospitals tell patients’ families that they won’t accept women donors because their HB is low, which further makes them think that women donors are not accepted. We have to then force them to speak to doctors. So many women have successfully donated,” she said. Some hospitals, she said, are putting strict rules that only those who have recovered before 28 days or more can donate. “This is another misconception because there are donors who have recovered 20 days ago and their anti-bodies have developed,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/data-consultant-launches-website-to-ease-plasma-donation-process/article34553808.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU teachers seek Union Minister’s intervention||With no COVID Care Centre being set up by the Delhi University at the Patel Chest Institute, despite repeated requests by professors, a few members of the DU executive council on Thursday wrote to Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan seeking urgent intervention. Stating that several teaching and non-teaching staffers of DU have died due to COVID-19, the professors sought immediate ramping up of facilities in the university. The letter written by EC members Seema Das, Rajpal Singh Pawar and Finance Committee member Dr. J.L. Gupta said it was unfortunate that medical resources available in the university had not been utilised to their full capacity. “In the given scenario, there is an urgent need to revamp the facilities available at all medical centres and more particularly at Vallabhai Patel Chest Institutesituated in the heart of the university. People are dying due to non-availability of beds and oxygen cylinders. Even within the university, we have lost near and dear ones working in the administration, departments and colleges...” the letter read. The letter urged the Minister to give necessary instructions to DU V-C, who is also the Chairman of VPCI, to convene an emergency meeting of the VPCI governing body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/du-teachers-seek-union-ministers-intervention/article34553811.ece

DCP (North) Anto Alphonse said that the accused has been identified as Aryan Singh alias Dhananjay, a resident of Noida who is pursuing B.Tech from a noted institute. With the money acquired from cheating people, he stayed at luxury hotels. Police said he used Instagram to target his victims and also used the name of a well-known foundation to gain trust. Police said a relative of a patient lodged the complaint stating that he has been cheated by the accused. The complainant said that he received a message on a WhatsApp group for setting up ICU facility at home and contacted him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/btech-student-arrested-for-cheating/article34553809.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police trying to save Sushil: victim’s kin||Delhi Police has written a letter to Delhi government informing them about Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar being wanted in a murder case on Thursday. Mr. Kumar, employed with Indian Railways, was currently on deputation, posted as an Officer on Special Duty (OSD) at Chhatrasal Stadium, where the brawl allegedly took place on May 3-4 midnight. It had resulted in the death of wrestler Sagar Dhankar (23) while three other suffered injuries. “Around 10 days have passed but police have failed to record the statement of three victims who were also beaten up with the deceased Sagar, before a Magistrate under CrPC 164. Police are trying to save Mr. Kumar from day one of the incident and they are giving him more time by delaying his arrest,” said a relative of the deceased. The relative questioned why the police filed the FIR on the basis of general diary entry but not on the complaint of the other three victims. A senior police officer said the investigation officer had recorded their statement. The eyewitnesses will be produced before a magistrate to record their statement after getting permission from a doctor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-trying-to-save-sushil-victims-kin/article34553810.ece
14 May 2021||Mumbai,||Coming under attack, Ajit Pawar cancels tender for hiring agency for publicity||Faced with criticism for seeking a private agency to handle publicity of his office, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday ordered to cancel the tender. The State General Administration Department had on Wednesday floated a tender seeking an external agency to look after Mr. Pawar’s publicity across various social media platforms and to disseminate information, increase outreach on public-oriented decisions, and highlight announcements made by his office. The total cost of the tender was pegged at Rs. 5.98 crore for the year 2021-22. Mr. Pawar, however, cancelled the order and clarified that his office did not need an independent social media agency. “Our work speaks for us, and we do not require publicity agencies. This office does not need an external agency and the government order regarding the same should be cancelled immediately,” a clarification issued by Mr. Pawar’s office said. The Deputy CM office further said that Mr. Pawar preferred to work without limelight. “He does not require publicity to highlight his work. Only the government publicity department will take care of ensuring public relations for his office,” it said. Earlier, Opposition BJP sought cancellation of the order. “The State government cites fund crunch when it comes to paying doctors and nurses but has money to hire a PR agency,” BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/coming-under-attack-ajit-pawar-cancels-tender-for-hiring-agency-for-publicity/article34553597.ece

14 May 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra extends ‘Break the Chain’ restrictions till June 1||Even as the cases have been declining somewhat in the State in the last few days, the Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to extend its ‘Break the Chain’ restrictions currently in force till June 1. An order issued by Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, extended all previous curbs that had been imposed under the orders of April 13, 21, and 29 “till 7 a.m. on June 1”. The order mandates that any person entering the State by any mode of transport will have to carry a negative RT-PCR test report which would have to be issued a maximum 48 hours before his entry into Maharashtra. “The restrictions on persons arriving from places of ‘sensitive origins’ as per orders dated April 18 and May 1 will be applicable to anyone arriving from any part of the country into the State,” the directive said. It further says that in case of cargo carriers not more than two persons may be allowed to travel in the same. In the event of these carriers originating from outside the State, they would have to enter with a negative RT-PCR test. The directive has ordered local district administrations to keep a “special vigil over rural markets and agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and ensure COVID-19 appropriate behaviour”. The order further empowers district administrations to shut down APMCs after reviewing the situation on case-by-case basis in the event of indisciplined behaviour by errant citizens and vendors or violations of pandemic norms on their part. At the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, there was a general unanimity on the imperative to extend lockdown-like restrictions until cases and fatalities had drastically dropped in the State. While a number of districts in north Maharashtra and the Marathwada region besides cities like Mumbai and Pune have been showing a declining trend, cases are on the rise in the sugar heartland of western Maharashtra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-extends-break-the-chain-restrictions-till-june-1/article34553600.ece
14 May 2021||Pune,||MVA, BJP trade blame over vaccine supply||The row between the Centre and the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra over COVID-19 vaccine roll-out has turned into a full-blown slanging match , with State Minister Nawab Malik on Thursday alleging that the French Embassy in India had procured the Moderna vaccine and that it was being administered to its nationals in Navi Mumbai despite only three other vaccines being permitted in the country. Mr. Malik, Minority Affairs Minister, sought to know from the Centre how a ‘non-permitted’ vaccine was allowed to be administered to the residents of France and their relatives living here. “Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V are the 3 vaccines that are permitted in India by our government. According to information received by me, the French Embassy in India has procured the [Moderna] vaccine and is inoculating their citizens and their relatives at Navi Mumbai with the help of Apollo Hospitals, Mumbai. The question arises, how can a non-permitted vaccine be allowed to be administered?” Mr. Malik said on Twitter. He said if the French Embassy staff could get the jab, then why couldn’t the Indian government get it for Indian citizens as well. In response, a spokesperson from Apollo Hospitals clarified that the vaccine was imported by the consulate concerned and that the hospital was merely administering it. “This process is approved by the Union Health Ministry, the Drugs Controller General of India, and the External Affairs Ministry,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Pune BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole hit out at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Mr. Thackeray had given first priority to Mumbai as it was the Shiv Sena’s bastion, while leaving Pune, the worst-hit district in the country, in the lurch. Mr. Shirole, the BJP legislator from Shivajinagar, claimed that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which is controlled by the BJP, had, as early as April 20, proposed to Mr. Thackeray that it would procure 25 lakh vaccines for Pune’s citizens using its own funds, but that the Chief Minister had not given his assent on it yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-bjp-trade-blame-over-vaccine-supply/article34553603.ece

14 May 2021||Tel Aviv,||Israel-Palestine fighting escalates||Israel faced an escalating conflict on two fronts on Thursday, scrambling to quell riots between Arabs and Jews on its own streets after days of exchanging deadly fire with Islamist militants in Gaza. Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a “massive reinforcement” of security forces to quell mob violence across the country, where police stations have been attacked and people savagely beaten on both sides. Despite global alarm and diplomatic efforts to halt the spiralling violence, hundreds of rockets again tore through the skies over the Gaza Strip overnight. Israel’s Air Force launched multiple strikes with fighter jets, targeting what it described as locations linked to Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza. In Gaza, 83 people were reported killed since Monday — including 17 children — and more than 480 people wounded as heavy bombardment has rocked the crowded coastal enclave and brought down entire tower blocks. The Israeli military said it had struck Gaza targets more than 600 times, while Hamas had fired over 1,600 rockets towards Israel. Israel’s civil aviation authority said it had diverted all incoming passenger flights headed for Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport to Ramon airport in the south, as air raid warnings once more went off across Israel. In southern Israel, seven people were killed, including one six-year-old, after a rocket struck a family home, the United Hatzalah volunteer rescue service said. Recent days have seen the most violent escalation in seven years between Israel and Gaza’s armed groups, triggered by weekend unrest at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews. The unrest has been driven by anger over the looming evictions of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of east Jerusalem. ‘Preventing pogroms’ Coinciding with the aerial bombardments is surging violence between Arabs and Jews inside Israel. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP that violence was at a nadir not seen for decades and that police were “literally preventing pogroms from taking place”. Hundreds were protesting in the Arab town of Kafr Kassem in central Israel, burning tires and torching police vehicles, he said. He added that nearly 1,000 border police were called in to quell the violence, and that more than 400 people had been arrested. On Wednesday night, Israeli far-right groups took to the streets across the country, clashing with security forces and Arab Israelis. Police said they had responded to violent incidents in multiple towns, including Lod, Acre and Haifa. Israeli television on Wednesday aired footage of a far-right mob beating a man they considered an Arab until he lay unconscious on his back in a street in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv. “The victim of the lynching is seriously injured but stable,” Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital said, without identifying him. A state of emergency has been declared in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod, where an Arab resident was shot dead and a synagogue has been torched. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, in unusually strong language, denounced what he described as a “pogrom” in which “an incited and blood-thirsty Arab mob” had attacked sacred Jewish spaces. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “what has been happening these last few days in Israeli towns is unacceptable. “Nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews, and nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs,” he said, adding that Israel was fighting a battle “on two fronts”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-palestine-fighting-escalates/article34553294.ece
14 May 2021||Washington,||Biden hopes ‘violence will end sooner than later’||U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that Israel has a right to defend itself but after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he hopes violent clashes with Palestinians will end quickly. “I had a conversation with Bibi Netanyahu not too long ago,” Mr. Biden told reporters. “My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.” Mr. Biden said U.S. diplomacy was in high gear with national security and defence staff “in constant contact with their counterparts in the West Asia — not just with the Israelis, but also with everyone from the Egyptians and the Saudis to the Emiratis.” Mr. Biden spoke as calls grew internationally for a de-escalation of violence after intense hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians that have left dozens dead and hundreds injured. ‘Ensure civilians’ safety’ Russian President Vladimir Putin and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday jointly called for an end to the ongoing fighting. “In light of the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it was stated that the primary task is to stop violent actions on both sides and ensure the safety of the civilian population,” the Kremlin said in a statement after a video call with Mr. Guterres..||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-hopes-violence-will-end-sooner-than-later/article34553292.ece
14 May 2021||COLOMBO,||Mohamed Nasheed flown to Germany for treatment||Maldivian leader Mohamed Nasheed was on Thursday flown to Germany for treatment, a week after surviving anassassination attempt in capital Male that left him critically injured. Following the May 6 “terror attack”, as Maldives police described the bomb explosion, doctors in a Male hospital performed complex surgeries on the Parliamentary Speaker and former President, to remove shrapnel from his liver, lungs and abdomen. He was discharged from hospital on Thursday, and medically evacuated to Germany with high security, local media reported. In the first tweet from his account since the explosion, Mr. Nasheed said in the local Dhivehi language: “A special thanks to the health sector of the Maldives. By the grace of Allah, I will stay the course to deliver good governance that you all seek. Eid Mubarak to everyone!” Linking the blast to religious extremists, the police arrested three persons allegedly involved in the “deliberate act of terror”. The Maldives’s Parliamentary Committee on National Security Services is probing the security breach that led to the attack on the former President. Religious extremism The explosion, which made international headlines, has turned the spotlight back on religious extremism in the Maldives, a growing concern especially amid the return, over the last few years, of dozens of Islamist radicals recruited as Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq. In a statement condemning the attempted assassination,South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR),a regional network of human rights defenders, said the incident evoked “popular unresolved murders and disappearances in past linked to extremist groups”, such as the murder of blogger Yameen Rasheed in 2017, and MP Afrasheem Ali in 2012, and the 2014 disappearance [subsequently declared murder] of journalist Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla. The network urged President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s government to probe the incidents and bring perpetrators to justice. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, who formerly served as Foreign Minister of the Maldives, said it is important to “carefully conceptualise” the May 6 attack. “It is a targeted attempt to assassinate former President Nasheed, an act of political violence for which no one has claimed responsibility to date. It is also a terrorist attack because it is aimed at eliminating former President Nasheed for his political views and activities — which primarily include the promotion of a secular democracy and combating corruption, as Speaker of the Parliament and leader of the MDP,” he told The Hindu . In his view, the attack sends a “chilling message” to those who stand up to religious extremists and demand an end to impunity and corruption. Timing of attack The timing of the attack, Mr. Shaeed said — a Thursday night in the last third of Ramzan — “strongly suggests that this was the handiwork of religious extremists”. However, it is too early to foreclose other possibilities or connections, he noted. “Especially since there is a vortex of violence implicating corrupt politicians, religious fanatics and criminal gangs that carry out targeted attacks on individuals who stand in their way,” he said, “What this assassination attempt highlights is not just widespread religious extremism that is suffocating society, but also endemic impunity and corruption that have rendered the state incapable of protecting people from these vicious elements, even when it comes to someone as high profile as former President Nasheed,” he added. Urging President Solih to lead broad-based push back against corruption, impunity and religious extremism, Mr. Shaheed cautioned that the inability to dismantle these structures would make the Maldives “even more vulnerable” to political violence, rendering the country “ungovernable”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mohamed-nasheed-flown-to-germany-for-treatment/article34553298.ece
14 May 2021||Riyadh,||Riyadh frees Bin Laden patriarch||Saudi Arabia has released construction magnate Bakr bin Laden, more than three years after his detention in a purge of the kingdom’s elite that upended his vast business empire, sources told AFP. The former chairman of the Bin Laden Group, Saudi Arabia’s biggest construction company, was reunited last week with his family in the Red Sea city of Jeddah after being freed from an undisclosed detention site, two people close to his family said. Mr. Bakr, 70, a half-brother of the late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was not reachable for comment. . Mr. Bakr and two other siblings, Saad and Saleh, were snared in a November 2017 purge that saw hundreds of royals, tycoons and Ministers locked up for months in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel, then widely dubbed a five-star prison. The unprecedented crackdown, which rattled private investors just as the kingdom sought to lure capital to help diversify the economy, was described by the government as an anti-corruption measure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/riyadh-frees-bin-laden-patriarch/article34553296.ece
14 May 2021||COLOMBO,||Tamils’ war memorial in Mullaitivu found vandalised||A new memorial plaque for Tamils killed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, along with monuments erected earlier, were found vandalised on Thursday in the northern Mullaitivu district, according to a committee organising the remembrance event falling next week. Accusing the Army of destroying the war memorials for Tamils, the Mullivaikkal war remembrance committee voiced concern over the “continuing attack” on Tamils’ right to memorialisation. The Army denied involvement in the incident. In the brutal final battle of the civil war in May 2009, tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were trapped and killed in Mullivaikkal, located along the north-eastern coast of the island. Every year, Tamils remember their loved ones on May 18, a day that brings back distressing memories to scores of affected families. The government, on the other hand, marks May 19 as ‘Ranaviru [War Heroes] Day’ in the south, hailing soldiers “who fought terrorism”, by defeating the separatist LTTE. The end of the war is either about “victory” or tragic loss, depending on which side of the ethnic divide it is viewed from. It remains a sensitive issue in Sri Lanka, 12 years after the war ended. “We went to place a new stone plaque in memory of those who were killed in Mullivaikkal, last night [Wednesday]. Army and police personnel at the spot asked us to return. We left the plaque nearby and came back. When we went back early this morning, the plaque was missing and other monuments erected there earlier were destroyed,” said Fr. Sinnathurai Leo Armstrong, co-chair of the remembrance committee. “I see this as a deliberate, genocidal act. It is a continuation of the Sinhala state’s history of trying to erase Tamils’ identity,” he told The Hindu . Army denies role When contacted, Army spokesman Brigadier Nilantha Premaratne said the Army had no role in the destruction of the monument. “Most of the monuments have been there for a few years now and there has been no problem. It is possible that some third party vandalised the structures to cause disharmony,” he told The Hindu . Asked how the new plaque went missing, when Army personnel reportedly guarded the area, Brigadier Premaratne said police would probe the incident to find out who was behind the act. This is not the first instance of Tamils’ war memorial being destroyed overnight. Rights groups in Sri Lanka, international watchdogs, and the UN have repeatedly highlighted the denial of Tamils’ right to remember. In January this year, authorities at the University of Jaffna bulldozed a memorial erected two years ago in memory of the civilians who died in May 2009. Following student protests and pressure from different quarters, including India, authorities rebuilt the monument on campus, and unveiled it last month. ‘Demolished people’s hearts’ Condemning Thursday’s development in Mullivaikkal, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) — representing Tamils in Sri Lanka’s north and east, termed the destruction of the memorial structure “the height of indecency.” “The act did not merely destroy a plaque made of stone, but has demolished the hearts of lakhs of Tamil people,” a statement issued by Alliance spokesman and Jaffna MP M.A. Sumanthiran said. The incident was reported after the Army and police inspected the place, the statement said, adding that no one can prohibit the people remembering those who died in the war. “No orders can make those memories fade. We will observe the Mullivaikkal remembrance, in a way that no one can stop us,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tamils-war-memorial-in-mullaitivu-found-vandalised/article34553291.ece
14 May 2021||Yangon,||Monks in Myanmar split on anti-junta movement||Myanmar’s Buddhist monkhood led an earlier struggle against military rule but is split on the coup that ended the country’s nascent democracy. The struggle against the military has drawn broad support from across Myanmar society. The monkhood is no exception. About a dozen monks have been arrested. But a hardline, pro-military faction within the clergy has also defended the junta. Among that group is Parmaukkha, a monk who was once held for inciting hatred against Rohingyas. The ideological divide is a far cry from the 2007 uprising, when monks led huge protests against the junta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/monks-in-myanmar-split-on-anti-junta-movement/article34553295.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Should political prisoners be released during the pandemic?||As the second wave of the pandemic rages across India, the country’s overcrowded prisons are in danger of becoming major hotspots for the spread of the disease. Dozens of political prisoners, mainly civil rights activists, continue to languish in prison indefinitely with no possibility of their trials commencing any time soon. In a conversation moderated by Jayant Sriram , Sanjay Hegde and V. Suresh discuss whether political prisoners should be released in view of the pandemic. Edited excerpts: The Supreme Court has dismissed the bail plea of Gautam Navlakha in the Bhima Koregaon case. When we talk about political prisoners in India, there are a few prominent cases that come to mind thanks to the media — activists arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case, activists arrested during the anti-CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act] protests, and those detained in Kashmir. How many others are there that we just don’t hear about and who is not getting any legal aid right now? V. Suresh:The unfortunate reality is that people seem to think that political prisoners are there only with regard to these high-profile cases. Actually there are cases from about 12-13 States — hundreds of people have been arrested and kept in prison for what are essentially political offences. This means that they have been put in prison on account of their political affiliations or allegations that they participated in conspiracies of a political nature. It’s a pity that many of these prisoners are not known; their cases have not come to the public eye. There are hundreds of Adivasi prisoners in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. There are people belonging to the minority communities in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, apart from Delhi and other places. Even during the pandemic, we see that political prisoners are repeatedly denied bail with no indication that the trial for the offences they have been put in jail for will start any time soon. What could be the justification for keeping them in prison? Sanjay Hegde:You have to see why they were arrested in the first place. They were arrested because a political executive, headed by the respective Home Ministries, whether of the Centre or the States, said, do something about these people. The police then file an FIR, do an investigation which results in a charge sheet, and then arrest the person. The arrest is then defended through the courts, and when particularly harsh provisions like the UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act] are applied, then, thanks to certain judgments of the Supreme Court, there’s almost no chance of the person getting bail in the interim period. Now, if the UAPA is invoked, or if something like sedition is invoked, technically, the sentence could extend to life. So, these people do not even have the benefit of ordinary administrative orders which have been passed, which say that anybody likely to face a sentence of less than seven years can be released during the pandemic. The courts themselves have passed such orders. It’s a different thing that these trials do not even start. And when they are heard, it will be after the 14 years that a normal life sentence entails. We do not have a system in the country; we have a process. And the process is the punishment. For prisoners held under provisions like the UAPA, is there any other recourse during the pandemic other than repeatedly applying for bail? SH:The only other recourse is political, i.e., if the charges are dropped. The state always has the right to withdraw charges. The moment the UAPA or anything is invoked, the judges give it extremely careful attention, more than it deserves, and tend to lean more towards keeping the person detained. None of our laws were built with the idea that a pandemic would intervene. All that we are doing temporarily is suspending ordinary laws during the pandemic or saying that in ordinary cases, we will let prisoners go. But at the end of the day, the virus does not respect how long the person is likely to be imprisoned. The virus just sees people who are huddled together and it spreads. Now, I do not see the logic of keeping people in prison, not giving them bail and putting them at risk of catching the virus. And then letting them die without even a determination of innocence or guilt. There has to be a method in which the court can say that during the pandemic, you can treat them to be continually in detention, but you can release them to be with their families. Those methods can also be evolved, but they have not been done. VS:The first thing that we need to acknowledge is the irony in our criminal justice system. To put it as an aphorism, one can say that the law defines offence, but the state defines offender. The law may say that a particular offence will come under the UAPA or will constitute a terrorist offence or a seditious offence. But it is not merely what the law says; it is what the state determines through the arm of the police. When the state defines the offence, that’s when the mischief comes in. We saw that selective interpretation of who an offender is during the Delhi violence last year. Unfortunately, the reality is not taken into account by the courts who know very well the poor conviction rate in UAPA and sedition cases. Let’s look at the conviction rates as per the NCRB [National Crime Records Bureau] report of 2019. The conviction rate for the UAPA shows a very low 3.1%. If you take earlier laws like TADA [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act], it was 1.4%. POTA [Prevention of Terrorism Act] was relatively better, but on the whole, we have abysmal conviction rates. These conviction rates in many cases are poor not because the investigating officers goofed up but because these offences often did not actually take place, they were cooked up. As Mr. Hegde mentioned, the process itself is the punishment and in PUCL [People’ s Union for Civil Liberties], we have been arguing that if you let people out on bail, that itself will reduce the harshness of many of these laws. Now, in a context like COVID-19, there has been a classification of prisoners into those who are facing a sentence of seven years or less, those who are facing a sentence of more than seven years and those who have been convicted under special laws like the UAPA. This classification was made by a committee set up by the Maharashtra government and it recommended that only the first category can be eligible for release, to decongest the prisons. This categorisation defies common sense. When you have such a low conviction rate, what is the justification for keeping people inside for long periods during the pandemic when they are at the mercy of the prison administration? This was challenged in the Bombay High Court by the NAPM [National Alliance of People’ Movements] and went up to the Supreme Court as well, but the classification of prisoners was upheld. Now, the latest order of the Bombay High Court in a PUCL application before it records that 241 prisoners tested positive. Another worrying fact is that a number of jail staff, too, have tested positive. So, when you look at it from any which angle — jurisprudential, political or humanitarian — there’s no justification for keeping these prisoners in jail for such long periods. The courts have also recorded the fact that 95% of the people who were let out on interim bail had reported back when the situation had improved in January this year. So, there’s no reason why these prisoners should not be out on bail. Dr. Suresh brings up an issue here, that in India and globally, prisons are considered hotspots for the virus to spread. There have been numerous instances in which the courts have noted that there is an overcrowding of prisons. Have any reforms or solutions to this problem been advocated? SH:The courts can pass orders but the responsibility for implementation lies with the administration. And if the administration doesn't implement it during a pandemic, it is hardly likely that there will be material before the courts to pull up the administration in contempt or anything like that. To the best of my knowledge, all that the administrations have been doing is trying to decongest prisons, but this by itself is no guarantee against infection. We have no idea about prisoners’ vaccinations. The congestion still continues because even if people are released on bail or parole, many are unable to meet bail conditions, for instance. The point is that unless the administration as a matter of policy really looks at all these prosecutions that it has launched and says, okay, where there are no repeat offenders, where the offences are relatively marginal, where people have spent a year or two in prison, it is better to just close the file by withdrawing the prosecution, or accepts plea bargains from the prisoners, so that they can be released into society and into the slightly better safety that the outside world affords, what they’re essentially doing is allowing the possibility of small sentences to degenerate into a sentence of death within the prison walls. VS:Look at what happened with the case of Sudha Bharadwaj or Siddique Kappan, both very well-known cases. Sudha Bharadwaj was said to be COVID-19 negative but she fell very ill over the past couple of weeks. Kappan, who tested positive for COVID-19, was shifted from a U.P. jail to Delhi because of the Supreme Court. And even before the order had been worked out, the U.P. police took him back, right under the nose of the Supreme Court. Now this shows the type of disdain that the executive has towards even the Supreme Court. In the case of political prisoners, nobody from outside can go in, there is no communication from inside coming outside. So, if at all you get to know what the situation is outside, it’s more by accident than by a system in place, which makes it all the more important for us to open up these jails. Otherwise, you will only have a sense of casualties which will add to the number of COVID-19 deaths. What’s the point in talking about it in a post-mortem manner when you could have very easily ensured that there is better care for these prisoners? The examples of Sudha and Kappan are only examples; there are probably numerous other examples in other States which are never heard about — Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra, and various other States. I think we need to really focus on many of these States because we don’t get to know what’s happening there.  When you have such a low conviction rate [under the UAPA], what is the justification for keeping people inside for long periods during the pandemic when they are at the mercy of the prison administration?

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||The crime of enforced disappearances must end||The democracy movement in Myanmar is at a critical juncture. On February 1, 2021, the military launched a coup d’état to overthrow the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy. The military is committed to suppressing the people’s movement, and the police are carrying out unimaginable acts of violence and oppression against those demanding freedom of expression and the restoration of democracy. Since the coup, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) has received reports of enforced disappearances from the family members of victims. There is concern that there will be a plethora of cases of enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, and even murder if the situation continues to deteriorate. Myanmar is not the only country in Asia that enforced disappearances are becoming a major concern. There are other leaders and regimes that have the mistaken notion that they can do anything to maintain their power. Regretfully, this includes using enforced disappearances as a tool to suppress the people. Concerns around minorities In China, the Working Group has received numerous reports from family members and concerned civil society organisations that a massive number of enforced disappearances have occurred in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Under the pretext of re-education to prevent terrorism, members of the Uyghur minority ethnic group are forcibly sent to what Chinese authorities call ‘vocational education and training centers’, with no information on their whereabouts and fate given to their families. The Working Group Chair has met many people from the region who are trying to find out what happened to their family members and they are living in fear. It is especially concerning because the basis for such forced disappearances is often very trivial: for example, having relatives living abroad or maintaining international contacts could lead to an enforced disappearance. ‘Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location (RSDL)’ under Article 73 of the amended Criminal Procedure Law, is used against individuals accused of endangering state security, and is another issue of serious concern. Because RSDL places individuals under incommunicado detention without disclosing their whereabouts, it may amount to a form of enforced disappearance. Post-conflict issues Sri Lanka has experienced more than three decades of domestic conflict, which was accompanied by various forms of enforced disappearances. It seemed that there was some hope developing because of efforts by the government to confront its history. However, recently, the government is weakening initiatives it previously started to search for and investigate enforced disappearances and has now returned to promoting a culture of impunity for these crimes. It is also disheartening to point out that enforced disappearances are being committed in the name of counter-terrorism measures. Increasing numbers of enforced disappearances are being reported in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and it does not seem that the situation will improve in the near future. Enforced disappearances became widely known to the world in the 1970s and the early 1980s during the ‘Dirty War’ in Argentina where the Argentine military dictatorship committed the forceful disappearances of some 30,000 of its own citizens while denying that they kidnapped, tortured, and murdered them. To fight against these gross and systematic human rights violations, the UN Commission on Human Rights established the Working Group in 1980 as the first special procedure mechanism of the UN Commission on Human Rights. An enforced disappearance is defined by several constituent elements. First, it is characterised by the deprivation of liberty, where persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty. Second, there are grounds for seeking governmental responsibility for the act, including of officials of different branches or levels of government or by organised groups or private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of, the government. Third, such an act typically occurs in the context of a state’s continuous refusal to take relevant action, including refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons outside the protection of the law. Remedial measures Under the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance (1992), the Working Group works to assist families of disappeared persons to ascertain the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared and to assist and monitor states’ compliance. Additionally, with the assistance of the secretariat members based in Geneva, the Working Group monitors states’ compliance, and documented cases of enforced disappearance. The Working Group receives individual petitions from victims’ families and civil society members, and channels them through to the relevant governments to demand searches for the disappeared persons, investigations, and punishment for those responsible. The WGEID also presses states to offer remedies, including compensation and a guarantee of non-recurrence of the violations. Since its inception, the Working Group has transmitted a total of 58,606 cases to 109 states, and as of 2020, the number of outstanding cases under active consideration stood at 46,271 in a total of 92 states. Unfortunately, the number of cases of enforced disappearances in Asian states is not decreasing and we are seeing a rapid increase in some countries. The Working Group has serious concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on enforced disappearances. Not only have enforced disappearances continued during the pandemic, but it has generated new contexts for enforced disappearances and has reduced the capacity of all actors to take the necessary action to search for and investigate cases of disappeared persons. Ratifying the Convention To protect the right to be free from enforced disappearances, the international community adopted the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance in 2006, which became effective in 2010. However, the number of participating states is still very low compared to other treaties. Among 63 member states of the treaty, only eight states from the Asia-Pacific region have ratified or acceded to the treaty. Only four East Asian states — Cambodia,  Japan, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka have ratified it. Asian countries should consider their obligations and responsibilities more seriously and reject a culture of impunity in order to eradicate enforced disappearances. They should also understand that their domestic criminal law systems are not sufficient to deal with the crime of enforced disappearance. An enforced disappearance is a continuous crime that needs a comprehensive approach to fight against it. While working as an expert for the UN Human Rights Council’s Working Group for the past five years, I have come to understand that one of the most tragic dimensions of the crime of enforced disappearance is the suffering that is inflicted on the people who know the victims. Enforced disappearance is a serious crime that goes against the philosophy of humanity. The pain and suffering of the family members do not end until they find out the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones. Bottles of water and facial tissues should always be readily available when interviewing the family members of the disappeared persons because their stories cannot be told without tears. Mothers looking for sons, wives looking for husbands, and the children looking for parents demonstrate the endless chain of tragedy in our contemporary world. This human atrocity must end immediately. I hope that the international community will strengthen its efforts to eradicate enforced disappearances as soon as possible.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Mucormycosis risk mitigation in the COVID battle||The COVID-19 pandemic continues to play havoc all over the world and India is no exception to this. While 70%-80% of those affected with COVID-19 recover without many side-effects, about 20%-30% of patients affected with symptomatic COVID-19 might require hospitalisation — here, a minority can get worse and require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic was first described from Wuhan in China, it is quite clear that it is people with comorbidities such as being of an older age, obese, having uncontrolled diabetes, heart or respiratory diseases and malignancies, who fare badly. New worry The new fear after the treatment of COVID-19, especially in an ICU setting, is contracting a severe disease known as mucormycosis. This is a serious, but rare, fungal infection caused by a group of fungi known as mucormycetes. Mucormycosis usually affects people who have poor immunity, and those with uncontrolled diabetes have the highest risk of developing it. Other risk factors of mucormycosis include steroid treatment, those who have malignancies, HIV/AIDS and those who have been treated with medicines such as deferoxamine for iron overload conditions. When the COVID-19 infection takes a more serious turn, heavy doses of steroids are given to the patient as a life-saving measure. Unfortunately, this can precipitate new onset diabetes in those who do not have diabetes, or substantially raise blood glucose levels in those persons who already have diabetes. This sets the scene for the development of mucormycosis. Types and diagnosis Mucormycosis is of several types, of which the commonest is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. This starts as a common cold or sinusitis, but soon spreads to the eyes producing redness of the eyes, and later bulging of the eyes known as proptosis. It may eventually lead to paralysis of some of the eye muscles, or even to blindness. It can also spread to the brain, and if this occurs, the prognosis is very grave. Other forms of mucormycosis include the pulmonary form in which the lungs are mainly involved and less common cutaneous mucormycosis or disseminated mucormycosis, where it spreads throughout the body. The last two are also associated with very poor prognosis. A very high index suspicion of mucormycosis is needed by the clinician treating COVID-19 cases, particularly in the setting of diabetes and steroid use. If the condition is diagnosed early and aggressive treatment given, the prognosis is good. Antifungal drugs such as Amphotericin B are used, but they are quite toxic and also expensive. If the involvement is extensive, radical surgery may be needed as a lifesaving measure in some cases, including removal of the jaw or the eye. Sugar control, steroid use It is very important for those with diabetes to keep their sugar levels under very good control. The dose of antidiabetic drugs will have to be adjusted and, in most cases, insulin would be needed to keep the sugars under control throughout the day. If steroids have to be used, their judicious use is recommended. For e.g., steroids should be given only at the appropriate stage of the disease, in optimal doses, and for as short a period of time as possible. Meticulous hygiene and care of the equipment inside the ICU including oxygen tubes and ventilators should be done in order to reduce the risk of fungal and other infections. In the case of mucormycosis, the adage ‘prevention is better than cure’ could not be more true. It is worth emphasising the point that steroids do not have any role in the prophylaxis or the prevention of COVID-19. Indeed, steroids reduce one’s immunity and may actually increase the risk of developing COVID-19. Also, in the initial phase of viremia (medical term for viruses present in the bloodstream), the use of steroids can actually disseminate the virus widely, thereby worsening the COVID-19 infection. It is only when the cytokine storm is suspected, (which usually occurs in the second week of the COVID-19 infection) that steroids should be used, and that too with discretion. Monitor blood glucose I find that in many patients who were put on steroids for COVID-19, their blood glucose levels are not adequately monitored, leading to extremely, and often dangerously, high blood glucose levels. This can also precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis — a classic situation where the more dangerous forms of mucormycosis occur. Hence, those treating COVID-19 infection must pay equal importance to the control of diabetes. To those with diabetes, my advice to them would be to have a healthy diet which has a lot of vegetables and less cereals (rice or chapati) and include more protein in the form of bengal gram, green gram, black gram, or mushroom. They must also have an active and regular exercise programme. It is very important for them to have their medicines regularly and if the sugars are not under control, to switch over to insulin if needed, at least for a short period. All these measures will help to effect good control of diabetes which can reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 and also its dangerous side-effects including mucormycosis. Finally, frequent monitoring of sugar levels should be done by using a hand-held, blood glucose meter. it is possible to wear a small sensor patch on the upper arm which can continuously monitor a person’s blood glucose levels and thus keep it under good control throughout the day. It is also very important to get oneself fully vaccinated. Vaccination will ensure that the risk of developing severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalisation and thus the risk of developing dangerous infections such as mucormycosis, can be drastically reduced.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Reforming medical education||India’s health systems have been confronting numerous challenges. In order to effectively address these challenges, our health systems must be strengthened. One of the critical building blocks of the health system is human resources. The serious shortage of health workers, especially doctors, in some northern States is a major impediment for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Health workers are critical not just for the functioning of health systems but also for the preparedness of health systems in preventing, detecting and responding to threats posed by diseases such as COVID-19. If urgent action is not taken, the shortage will amplify and health systems will get further weakened. The workforce crisis has been aggravated by the imbalances within the country. For instance, the doctor-population ratio in northern States is far short of the required norm, while the southern States, barring Telangana, have enough doctors in possession. There is also a general lack of adequate staffing in rural areas. Shutting out the poor These health system challenges will remain largely unaddressed with the government’s market-oriented approach towards medical education. There is no denying that in order to meet the significant shortfall of qualified doctors in northern States, scaling up of medical education is warranted. However, certain proposals, such as the NITI Aayog’s proposal of allowing private entities to take over district hospitals for converting them into teaching hospitals with at least 150 MBBS seats, may sound attractive but there are reasons to be deeply concerned. Through the implementation of such a policy, the private sector in medical education will be encouraged; it will also directly aid the corporatisation processes of healthcare provisioning while the under-resourced public health system will be a collateral damage. District hospitals are considered as the last resort for the poor. This will change. The corporatisation will make the services very costly and exclude them from getting care. Even from the perspective of producing more doctors to meet the shortages in under-served areas, this is unlikely to yield the desired result. Private players treat medical education as a business. Thus, it would shut the door on a large number of medical aspirants who would otherwise have a strong motivation to work in rural areas but do not have the means to finance themselves. Additionally, the medical graduates trained in such private sector ‘managed’ medical colleges will prefer to find employment in corporate hospitals and not in rural areas to regain their investment. Further, this proposal is not aligned with India’s national health policy goals like achieving universal health care and health equity. Instead, it will widen health inequalities further. Solving doctor shortage, therefore, needs long-term thinking and commitment from the political leadership. The government should learn from previous cases of public-private partnerships (PPPs). In the past, contrary to the expectation that markets would help increasing access to primary and tertiary care for the poor through private players, the evidence supporting their effectiveness is very limited. In fact, many PPPs had to be shelved owing to the non-compliance of the agreement conditions by the private sector under which they were also supposed to cater to the non-paying patients. A public good An unfettered market approach or a regulated market with medical colleges that are publicly funded but privately operated, providing competition for traditional government medical colleges, is not the answer to the health workforce crisis. Medical education is a public good as its purpose is to improve the population health and decrease disease burden. The pandemic has provided us an opportunity to make medical education a public good once again. There should be a substantial step-up in public investment in medical education. By establishing new medical colleges, the government can increase student intake as well as enhance equitable access to medical education. Besides, it must allocate adequate financial resources to strengthen the overall capacity of existing medical colleges to enrich student learning and improve output.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Temporary respite||The latest retail inflation and industrial output data from the National Statistical Office (NSO) offer some relief from the pall of gloom cast by the relentless second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provisional headline inflation slowed to a three-month low of 4.29% in April, helped by softer food prices and a statistical base effect. The rate using an imputed index for the year-earlier period was 7.22%. A separate NSO release showed March industrial output jumped by 22.4%, benefiting again from the fact that the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had posted an 18.7% contraction in March 2020, when the economy was halted by the start of a nationwide lockdown. A closer look at the inflation data reveals a substantial cooling in the prices of cereals, milk and milk products, vegetables, and pulses and products. While both cereals and vegetables saw a deflationary trend widen to -2.96% and -14.2%, respectively, dairy products, which have the second-largest weight in the food and beverages category, also slid into deflation territory at -0.13%. And price gains in pulses, which had been bothering monetary policy makers by having been stubbornly stuck in the double digits over an 18-month stretch, decelerated into single digits to reach a 20-month low of 7.51%. The combined impact slowed inflation across the food and beverages group by more than 250 basis points to 2.66%. Still, the same Consumer Price Index data also point to persistent price pressures that could potentially fan faster inflation in the coming months, especially at a time when the socio-economic burden of the crippling pandemic and the impact of the lockdown that several States are resorting to is yet to be fully gauged. Price gains in meat and fish quickened to 16.7% and was little changed at 10.6% in the case of eggs, while inflation in oils and fats accelerated almost 100 basis points to 25.9%. Transport and communication also remained in the double-digit range at 11.04%, despite benefiting from the virtual freeze in the pump prices of petroleum products that coincided with last month’s Assembly elections. Now, with global crude oil starting to firm again and local petrol and diesel prices resuming their upward trajectory, the prospect of haulage costs — for transporting goods from factory and farm gates — rising in the near term is very real. Add to the mix rising international commodity prices and the outlook for inflation gets even more cloudy. Industrial production numbers may also provide cheer only for a limited period, aided in no small measure by output having cratered in the first few months of the last fiscal. IHS Markit’s PMI survey for April showed new orders and output having slowed to eight-month lows, and with the pandemic-triggered factory shutdowns threatening supply disruptions, industrial production and inflation face challenges. Policymakers must stay vigilant to ensure price stability even as measures to bolster demand are the need of the hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/temporary-respite/article34553271.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Assam brew||The transfer of power in Assam, from Sarbananda Sonowal to Himanta Biswa Sarma was a smooth affair albeit mediated by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s central leadership. Mr. Sarma has been the key strategist and troubleshooter for the BJP, not only in Assam, but in the entire northeast, for six years now. It would have been unsustainable for the party to keep him away from the post of the Chief Minister any longer. He was a key figure in the Congress until 2015, when he walked out of it to instantly emerge as the face of the BJP. A champion of pluralism as a Congress leader, Mr. Sarma grew strident as a polarising figure in Assam as a BJP leader. The BJP won Assam for a second consecutive time on the back of intense Hindu consolidation that swept through autonomous tribal regions, and across Bengali and Assamese speakers. Mr. Sarma has said his government would expand the welfare schemes started in the BJP’s first term, particularly targeting women and tea garden workers. That is hardly a controversial move, apart from the additional burden it might put on the State finances. The real challenge for him is in balancing the conflicting expectations of the constituents of the party’s support base with regard to the new citizenship regime legislated by the Centre. Mr. Sarma’s government has already moved the Supreme Court for a re-verification of the Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC). The State government alleges “major irregularities” in its making — ineligible inclusions and unreasonable exclusions. An application by the State also prays for the deletion of illegal voters from Assam’s electoral rolls. The final draft of the NRC published in August 2019 had excluded 19.06 lakh out of 3.3 crore applications for lack of adequate documents establishing them as Indian citizens. Some think too few have been excluded. The CM wants up to 20% re-verification in the NRC for areas bordering Bangladesh and 10% for interior areas; and the Supreme Court’s guidance on the issue if discrepancies are found. The BJP’s evasive position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which Assamese nationalists fear will open a floodgate of Bengali Hindus into the State besides granting citizenship to those who are already there, has been successful as an electoral strategy this time. That it is a central law and the State has little to do with it is technically correct, but it is disingenuous for a party that is in power at both levels. The BJP has been riding a tiger on the citizenship question.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Fact and fiction in a fake news epidemic||Was this the smoking gun? “Chinese military scientists discussed weaponising SARS coronaviruses” was the headline of a report in The Australian , which flashed on my WhatsApp one morning this week. Before noon, I’d received the report from half a dozen people with the familiar prescription: “Must read!” The report said it had unearthed a leaked document written by Chinese military scientists speaking of weaponising coronaviruses, confirming what has for long been suspected by conspiracy theorists ever since the pandemic began in Wuhan, China. But there was a small catch. The secret document cited in the report was from a not-so-secret book published in China in 2015, which is still available in Chinese bookstores. It also turned out that the authors, including Xu Dezhong, formerly a professor at the Air Force Medical University, were speaking of the first SARS epidemic being “weaponised” not by China, but by foreign powers unleashing a virus on the Chinese population. Not that these two details made much of a difference as the story continued to go, well, viral. The belated publicity was not entirely bad news for Mr. Xu. On one online Chinese bookstore, Dangdang, there was “a 10-fold increase” in the price of the book, observed Pan Chengxin, a professor at Deakin University in Australia. The book, by most accounts, wasn’t taken very seriously in China — perhaps until this week. Shortly before The Australian report, another article on the origins of COVID-19 evoked discussion. A 10,000-word essay by Nicholas Wade, previously a science reporter for The New York Times , made a strong case for why a laboratory accident couldn’t be ruled out, citing, among other things, the outbreak beginning in Wuhan, home to the premier Chinese lab studying coronaviruses; the absence of a natural bat population there; and the inability to find an intermediate animal host, as was found after the first SARS epidemic, establishing its natural origins. Mr. Wade went a step further, suggesting there were scientific reasons to suggest this virus was not natural. That claim was, however, rebutted by many virologists including Kristian Andersen, who pointed out that his argument of an unusual “furin cleavage site” being a smoking gun was “the only specific argument put forward to support a lab leak” and was “false”. If you are confused at this point, you are not alone. For news reporters trying to separate fact from fiction, furin cleavage sites and codons might as well be Latin or Greek. What Mr. Wade did, however, get right is his conclusion that there is no clear evidence either to support or rule out whether the virus came from nature or a lab. Indeed, a lab accident and natural origins are not mutually exclusive possibilities, considering we may never know if the natural source was in a cave or in a cage. Further muddying the search for origins is the politics. If the Trump administration in the U.S. prematurely wanted to claim the virus was lab-made despite thin evidence, China has spread its own conspiracy theories, with one Foreign Ministry spokesperson claiming that the virus was brought by the U.S. army to Wuhan. China has also been far from forthcoming, delaying access to Wuhan and not providing a WHO team with raw data. And forget about foreign researchers ever getting unrestricted access to the insides of Wuhan’s labs, all of which will only lead to more doubts. Ultimately, only science, free from politics, can give us a clear answer. But good science takes time, which is in short supply in an age where we demand immediate answers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fact-and-fiction-in-a-fake-news-epidemic/article34553282.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Repression and violence||Mr. C.F. Andrews writes: It is with the deepest sense of pain, that I am obliged to write to the Press once more, in order to make a double protest. On the one hand, certain acts on the part of those who represent the Government of India in its official capacity, such as the imprisonment of young students, the prohibition of the wearing of Gandhi caps, the licentious use of Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code — these and other arbitrary and high-handed measures appear to me to have had the inevitable effect of inflaming the passions of the people. It is true, I have come across instances of admirable self-restraint in the exercise of penal force on the part of Government officials and to these I would bear personal testimony but there have been other instances, which have savoured directly of tyranny and against these I would make emphatic and indignant protest. On the other hand I have to protest against the violence of speech and the increasing action of violence on the popular side. During the past few weeks, I have been in constant touch with huge crowds of famished and desperate people, who have been on the strike in our great cities. I have, through this experience, realised more than ever before, how inflammable this material is; and if I have myself transgressed the bounds of calm and reasoned statement, in the excitement of the time in which we live, I sincerely regret it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/repression-and-violence/article34553280.ece

The State Assembly has also been dissolved. This step has been taken following a report received from Mr. Shriman Narayan, Governor, that since no party was in a position to form a Government following the resignation of the Hitendra Desai Ministry, President’s rule should be imposed. The Governor’s report was not, however, released since it has to be placed before Parliament first before it is made public. But it is learnt that the Governor had clearly indicated that the political situation in the State was such that the party alignments had become uncertain and it would not be possible for any group to form a stable Ministry either alone or in association with others. He has also recommended dissolution of the State Assembly as advised by Mr. Hitendra Desai. To-day’s action of the President paves the way for a mid-term election in the State which is expected to be held some time in November or December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/presidents-rule-for-gujarat/article34553281.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Stalled projects’ completion is stimulus’||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the government’s efforts to help finish stranded housing projects would serve as a ‘sustained stimulus’ for the ailing real estate sector and drive demand in core sectors including cement and steel. Speaking at the virtual handing over of apartments to 640 households following the completion of the first stalled residential project funded through the Special Window for Affordable & Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) in Mumbai, Ms. Sitharaman said that the project, completed over 18 months despite the COVID-19 pandemic, indicated ‘positivity’ for the realty sector. “I remember, in 2019, the number of families that kept calling the Prime Minister and the representations that kept coming to us about the bank loans they had taken, the EMIs they had to pay,” the minister said. “2019 was a very testing time for us on this particular score, because the real estate industry was going through a stressed time, they were cash-strapped,” she added. With banks not lending to the sector, many projects were left almost complete, translating into ‘a perpetual wait’ for families who had booked flats, she said. “For a middle-class family, to have to pay rent and equally the EMI on loans taken for their homes, couldn’t have been worse than anything else. It was the biggest burden they were carrying after investing to have a happy home for themselves. It was a Catch 22 situation, you couldn’t go elsewhere to find a house, you couldn’t get your own house because it wasn’t completed,” Ms. Sitharaman pointed out. Last mile funding Stating the last-mile funding to push stalled real estate projects had given priority to middle class families, she said the cost of apartments helped under the scheme had been capped at Rs. 2 crore in Mumbai, Rs. 1.5 crore in the National Capital Region and 5 other cities, and Rs. 1 crore in the rest of the country. “So this particular scheme has primarily and only focused on relieving the suffering of the middle class who invest in their homes by borrowing, and who, for no fault of theirs, suffer because houses are not given to them... because real estate itself went through a cash-strapped situation in 2019,” Ms. Sitharaman observed. “But today, we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” she added. Eventually, the SWAMIH investment fund-1, managed by SBICap Ventures, would benefit 1,16,000 Indian families awaiting their homes, the minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/stalled-projects-completion-is-stimulus/article34553263.ece

Key drivers of PE/VC market have been e-com, pharma, healthcare, edutech, online media, SaaS, technology and IT/ITeS. “E-commerce sector has recorded $3.7 billion in PE/VC investments in the four months of 2021 compared with $2.8 billion recorded in full-year 2020. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, which led to a significant increase in the valuation of many direct to consumer businesses,’’ the EY official added. The largest deal in April 2021 saw a new fund of Blackstone along with ADIA, UC Investments and GIC announcing the acquisition some 75% in Mphasis for about $2.8 billion.

14 May 2021||MUMBAI,||‘HNIs invest in stocks, stay off fixed income, real estate’||Despite the current uncertain economic environment precipitated by the surge in COVID-19 cases, wealthy Indians and family offices are investing in blue-chip stocks in India and abroad as well as in tech start-ups to maximise returns, according to wealth managers. They have mostly moved away from investing in low-yielding fixed instruments such as fixed deposits and bonds, and real estate, even as they invest about 5% of their funds in gold which has emerged as a hedge against rupee depreciation, the analysts said. In addition, there are about 100 listed companies that are attracting investments from this class, they said. “Equities market in India is a great growth engine, and has performed well over a long time,” said Atul Singh, founder and CEO, Validus Wealth, a private wealth management firm with assets close to $600 million. Mr. Singh said investing in the fixed-income market has become challenging. “Yields have fallen to a level where they are lower than the inflation expectation, giving negative real interest rates. Mutual funds have disappointed, and hence are out of favour,” he said. “Market-linked debentures have gained popularity as a tax-efficient vehicle for taking debt exposure,” he said. These instruments provide about 8% return. “The average returns on stocks in the past year, have been in the realm of 40% to 50%,” said Tanushree Banerjee, co-head of Research, Equitymaster. “Investors cannot take such high returns for granted. They must have a long-term tenure in mind, [for] returns of 15-20%, which are closer to long-term averages.”  Yields from fixed income avenues are giving negative real interest rates Atul Singh Founder and CEO, Validus Wealth||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hnis-invest-in-stocks-stay-off-fixed-income-real-estate/article34553259.ece

14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Relax FCRA norms, ease relief flow, says Nasscom||Infotech industry association Nasscom has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to temporarily relax stringent Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) norms so as to ease the flow of overseas COVID-19 relief into the country and grant emergency use authorisation for all WHO-approved vaccines in view of domestic vaccine shortages. Terming the devastating economic and social impact of the second wave of COVID-19 that is ‘being felt across the country’ as unprecedented’, Nasscom’s missive to the PM listed three ‘critical asks’ to enable industry to act faster to help the country navigate the second wave and better prepare for future waves of the pandemic. “Times like this call for greater partnership and collaboration across industries and the government,” it pointed out. “Many countries and global companies are providing aid to India and are helping the healthcare infrastructure deal with the surge. However, the amended provisions of the FCRA Act 2020 are proving to be a deterrent,” it said in the letter. On May 3, the government permitted imports without GST levies for pandemic relief material donated from abroad for free distribution in the country, delegating States to certify the entities that will receive such imports. However, no exemption has been granted from the FCRA norms that require domestic entities receiving foreign aid to get an approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs. “Given the humanitarian crisis, we would request the government to grant a temporary waiver to the FCRA Act and the 2020 amendments. This will enable NGOs to transfer funds between FCRA-approved NGOs and non-FCRA approved NGOs,” it said. Vaccine options Making a strong pitch for liberalising vaccine imports, Nasscom said the availability of vaccines particularly for the private sector ‘continues to be very challenging’ though firms are attempting to source them. “We request the government to provide emergency use authorisation for all WHO-approved vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and others that have gone through stringent approval process globally — to ensure there is no vaccine divide in the country,” it said. The statement assumes significance as States are struggling to source vaccines, and several of them are in the process of floating global tenders to import vaccines. Nasscom also requested the PM to use data more effectively to manage the pandemic and improve the government’s response. “COVID tracking and vaccination, insights, and analytics from data could play a key role in decision-making and early warning signals. We must ensure effective access to data for insights and planning, across all states and key departments, on a priority,” it reiterated to the Prime Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/relax-fcra-norms-ease-relief-flow-says-nasscom/article34553270.ece

14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||RIL unit bags bulk of supply at firm’s KG-D6 gas e-auction||As many as 14 users across sectors slugged it on a third-party electronic platform for seven-and-half hours to secure natural gas from the eastern offshore KG-D6 block before the oil-to-chemical (O2C) unit of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) bagged most of the supplies, sources said. Reliance Industries Ltd. and its partner BP Plc. of the U.K., who are bringing a second set of gas discoveries in their Bay of Bengal KG-D6 block, had offered 5.5 million standard cubic metres per day of additional gas in the auction for a flexible tenure of between 3 to 5 years. Gas-user companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Reliance O2C, GAIL Gas, Adani Total Gas Ltd., Torrent Gas, Torrent Power and gas trading companies like GAIL, Shell and IGS were locked in the intense bidding war on the e-auction that happened on May 5, sources in the Reliance-BP consortium said. At the end of the intense bidding war, Reliance O2C walked away with 3 mmscmd of supplies, offering better prices than competitors, they said. India Gas Solutions (IGS) — a JV of Reliance and BP — bagged another 1 mmscmd, while IOC got a similar volume. The remaining volume was picked by Adani Gas (0.15 mmscmd), IRM Energy (0.10 mmscmd), GAIL (30,000 cubic metres per day) and Torrent Gas (20,000 cubic metres per day). In the three auctions, Reliance-BP has sold about 18 mmscmd of domestic gas from new fields in the KG-D6 block, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ril-unit-bags-bulk-of-supply-at-firms-kg-d6-gas-e-auction/article34553266.ece

14 May 2021||Madrid,||Atletico steps closer to the LaLiga title||With the Spanish league title in sight, Atletico Madrid made sure it didn’t falter. Diego Simeone’s team moved closer to ending its title drought in Spain with a 2-1 home win against Real Sociedad on Wednesday, taking a major step toward securing its first league trophy since 2014. “We could hear them,” said Atletico captain Koke, who played his 500th match for the club. “There are two games left but that’s a lot. Everyone is losing points in this league. We have two finals ahead of us.” Ante Rebic netted a 12-minute hat-trick in the second half to help AC Milan rout Torino 7-0 in Serie A and strengthen its chances to qualify for the Champions League. Theo Hernandez also scored twice on Wednesday as Milan remained level on points with second-place Atalanta, which beat Benevento 2-0. The two are two points above Napoli and three above fifth-place Juventus, which won 3-1 at Sassuolo. There are two rounds remaining in Serie A. Emile Smith Rowe took advantage of a defensive howler from midfielder Jorginho to score the winner as Arsenal beat Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to stop the host from moving third in the Premier League. It was Arsenal’s third straight Premier League victory and a much-needed morale booster after its loss in the Europa League semifinals left the Gunners without a chance of qualifying for the Champions League.

14 May 2021||MUMBAI,||Powar returns to take charge of India women’s team||Ramesh Powar has returned as the India women’s team’s head coach with the Cricket Advisory Committee preferring the former India off-spinner over former India batsman W.V. Raman. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced Powar’s appointment on Thursday through a statement signed by secretary Jay Shah after the CAC, headed by former India pacer and coach Madal Lal, interviewed eight candidates over two days. “Looking forward to take India Women’s cricket ahead. I sincerely thank the CAC and the BCCI for this opportunity,” Powar said in a short statement. Raman graciously congratulated and wished Powar the best through a social media post.  Interestingly, Raman had taken charge of the team in December 2018 following Powar’s tumultuous short stint with the team. The veteran coach is understood to have recently had a fall-out with new selection panel, which led to the BCCI advertising for a new coach. Raman was also interviewed for the post on Wednesday, but the CAC recommended Powar. Despite his recent success with Mumbai’s men’s team in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Powar’s appointment has raised eyebrows among the women’s cricket fraternity. Tussle with Mithali After all, the crafty spinner was involved in a bitter dispute with veteran batter Mithali Raj during his previous stint with the team that lasted barely four months starting July 2018. Powar and Mithali’s tussle during the World T20 overshadowed India’s march into the semifinals. Interestingly, with Powar set to take over with India women’s forthcoming tour to England, he will have to work in tandem with Mithali in two formats. While Mithali has retired from T20Is, she will be a vital cog in the ODIs and the one-off Test scheduled in England. The BCCI is expected to announce support staff and the squad for the England tour on Friday. Powar’s previous stint with India women was his first major coaching stint. Since then, he has worked with the Mumbai Cricket Association indoor academy, the National Cricket Academy and Mumbai men’s one-day team. Soon after coaching Mumbai to the Hazare Trophy title in March, he attended a Level-2 hybrid coaches’ workshop at the NCA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/powar-returns-to-take-charge-of-india-womens-team/article34553385.ece

Second seed Nadal won through 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(3) after nearly 3hr 30min on court against the 13th-seeded Shapovalov. Nadal was trailing a set and 0-3 down in the second set before powering back. Shapovalov also broke for 3-1 in the third set but Nadal broke back immediately and held on despite two match points against him in the 12th game to force a tie-break. The Spaniard has reached his 16th last-eight appearance in Rome and a 97th ATP Masters 1000 quarterfinal. Earlier, World No. 1 Novak Djokovic swept into the quarterfinals with a straight-sets wins over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Fans are back The five-time champion won 6-2, 6-1 in 70 minutes against the 48th-ranked Spaniard with the venue filled to 25% for the first time amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The 33-year-old next plays Stefanos Tsitsipas in a rematch of last year’s French Open semifinal which the Serb won. Fifth seed Tsitsipas ended the run of home hope Matteo Berrettini 7-6(3), 6-2. In the women’s section, World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty eased into the last eight with a straight-sets win over Russian Veronika Kudermetova. The Australian won 6-3, 6-3 to set up a clash with US teenager Coco Gauff, who earlier ousted Madrid winner Aryna Sabalenka. Dangerous “Coco is extremely dangerous. She’s played an exceptional tournament thus far. She’s got the ability to take the game on. She’s aggressive. She can run. She can trust her legs,” said Barty. Belarus’ Sabalenka, the World No. 4 and seventh seed, fell 7-5, 6-3 to the 17-year-old Gauff, ranked 35, who reached her fourth quarterfinal of the year. Defending champion Simona Halep, the third seed, was forced out with a calf injury in her second round match.  The results:   Men: Third round: Novak Djokovic bt Alejandro Davidovich 6-2, 6-1; Rafael Nadal bt Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(3); Stefanos Tsitsipas bt Matteo Berrettini 7-6(3), 6-2; Reilly Opelka bt Aslan Karatsev 7-6(6), 6-4.

14 May 2021||TOKYO,||IOC supports measures to make the Games happen despite public opposition||The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday said it supported Japanese measures to counter COVID-19 and was confident the Tokyo Olympics would be a “historic” event, despite wide public opposition. With less than three months to go before the Games begin on July 23, Japan is battling a surge in coronavirus infections. A majority of its population wants the Olympics cancelled or postponed for a second time, according to several polls, with about 70% of the 10,500 athletes — about 7,800 — already qualified for the Games. “We are now very much in an implementation phase with 78 days to go and fully concentrated on delivering the Games,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told an online news conference. “When the Games happen and the Japanese people are proud host of an event that will be an historic moment, I think I am very confident we will see public opinion hugely in favour of the Games.” His online news conference, however, ended with a protester, who had signed up as a journalist to ask a question, unfurling a banner reading “No to Olympics” and shouting profanities and “No Olympics anywhere” before being cut off. Japan has extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and three other areas until the end of May as the number of cases rises daily, forcing IOC President Thomas Bach to postpone a visit to Japan in May. An opinion survey conducted from May 7-9 by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily showed 59% of respondents wanted the Games cancelled as opposed to 39% who said they should be held. “Postponement” was not offered as an option. “In terms of Japan and Tokyo we understand the caution,” Adams said. “We are fully in solidarity with them. People are very cautious. We have to fully trust Japanese authorities.” “There will be ups and downs (in public opinion).We have to take account of public opinion on a longer term. “As thing stand now we are moving full ahead.

14 May 2021||Chennai,||‘I have enjoyed every bit of my ride’||R. Chandrasekhar was sort of a first division legend. Loads of wickets with his tantalising off-spin, many runs with his strokeful batting and 20 years representing the star-studded State Bank. Chandrasekhar will be completing 85 on Friday and it has been quite a journey across eras. “I have no regrets,” he told The Hindu on Thursday. Prolific With the ball, he bowled in tandem with the great V.V. Kumar. “Every season, I would pick around 40 wickets.” The octogenarian added, “I used to flight the ball, depending on my off-spinner. I could also bowl the leg-cutter.” People who played him count him as a genuine spinner of the ball. So highly rated was he at one time that comparisons were made with S. Venkatraghavan. But then, luck did not smile on Chandrasekhar. He played just one Ranji game, against Andhra, picked three wickets in the first innings, scored 30 odd runs in his only outing, and did not bowl in the second innings. “The next season, I was not picked,” he said. His younger brother R. Prabhakar was a swashbuckling pace bowling all-rounder and his son Vansanth Kumar Chandrasekhar, a strokeful top-order batsman. Both played for the State. And, Chadrasekhar kept himself busy after retirement. He was the chairman of State senior selectors, an EC member, BCCI match referee, a TNCA panel umpire, chairman of various TNCA sub-committees and a TNCA treasurer. “I have enjoyed every bit of my ride,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-have-enjoyed-every-bit-of-my-ride/article34553476.ece
14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Decoding Chinki Yadav’s omission from Olympics team||One swallow does not make a summer. Even if you are World No.1, it does not cut much ice with the stringent Olympic selection policy of the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI). The omission of Chinki Yadav, the reigning World No.1 in sports pistol, after she had won the World Cup gold in Delhi in March, beating Rahi Sarnobat and Manu Bhaker, may have been perplexing, to say the least. More so, when the Asian Games gold medallist Rahi and the 19-year-old Manu got the nod to shoot the event in Tokyo. The 23-year-old Chinki, who had won the Olympic quota with a good score of 588 out of 600 in the Asian Championship, even though she finished sixth in the final, was herself quite relaxed about Olympic selection, after her golden fare. Rahi, who has won two World Cup gold medals in 2013 and 2019, put things in perspective. “I was very happy with the way Chinki performed in the Delhi World Cup. She was not performing that great when the selection policy had started collecting scores for a year or two, reasoned Rahi, who had lost the gold to Chinki in the shoot-off after a tie in a spectacular final. Yes, in the four World Cups in 2019, Chinki had scores of 584, 580, 571 and 570. A tenth placing was her best. Undisputed No.1 Manu was the undisputed No.1 in the country with her consistently high scores in the event, even though she had no World Cup medal to show in sports pistol till she won the bronze in Delhi. Rahi and Chinki were almost identical with their averages. “It is important to have consistently high performances in international competitions for a year or two. Otherwise, it is not easy to survive in the Olympic atmosphere under pressure,” said Rahi. “I want to see her as a teammate in future, in such high-level competitions,” added Rahi. Air pistol World No.1 and a lawyer by profession, Abhishek Verma felt that there was no room for debate, as the national federation had “strictly followed the laid down selection policy”. It was a fair decision,” Abhishek said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/decoding-chinki-yadavs-omission-from-olympics-team/article34553413.ece
14 May 2021||MELBOURNE,||Tactically he is as good as you get, says Paine||Australia skipper Tim Paine has thrown his support behind Steve Smith replacing him as captain of the Test team when the time comes for a leadership change. Paine succeeded Smith as captain in 2018 after the batsman was banned from international cricket for 12 months and suspended from leadership roles for two years for his role in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal. Smith said in March he would gladly take the captaincy back if the chance came, and Paine said he deserved to be considered. “I think so. Obviously I don’t make that decision but the time I played with Steve as captain he was excellent,” Paine said in comments published by News Corp media on Thursday. “Certainly tactically he is as good as you get. Yeah, I would support him getting that job again.” Former players and experts have pushed for Smith to be reinstated, and called for 36-year-old Paine to step aside after a shock 2-1 loss to a severely depleted India in the home summer. No plans now Paine has no plans to relinquish the captaincy but suggested he might be tempted to bow out of the game if Australia dominate England in the 2021-22 Ashes. “If I feel like the time is right and we’ve beaten the ‘Poms’ 5-0, what a way to go out,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tactically-he-is-as-good-as-you-get-says-paine/article34553371.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||Irfan, four others test COVID positive||Olympics-bound race walker K.T. Irfan is among five elite track-and-field athletes who have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Sports Authority of India’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. The tests were conducted last Friday and those who returned positive have been kept under quarantine. “At least five elite athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 when tests were conducted on Friday. They have been kept isolated from others,” a source at the SAI Centre told PTI on condition of anonymity. The source said another male race walker also tested positive, but his name could not be confirmed. “Four male players and 1 female player and 4 support staff tested positive for COVID-19,” the SAI source stated. “The female player had come from home. The players were tested on 6th and their results came positive on 7th. They received their first vaccine dose on 29th April. “One male player and one female player were not vaccinated. They have been tested again on the 10th and their results are awaited tomorrow [14th]. One athlete would also be tested once more in 2-3 days’ time.” It is learnt that none of the female race walkers are among those who returned positive. The 31-year-old Irfan had qualified for the Tokyo Olympics way back in early 2019 after finishing fourth in the 20 km event of the Asian Race Walking Championships in Nomi, Japan. The SAI source said the whole hockey team training at the Centre other than one player has tested negative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/irfan-four-others-test-covid-positive/article34553414.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Sindhu gets land for her academy||The Andhra Pradesh State Government on Thursday issued orders allotting two acres of land in Visakhapatnam to P.V. Sindhu to set up a badminton academy and sports school. This is a fulfilment of the promise made by the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy when he felicitated Sindhu on becoming World champion two years ago. Sindhu thanked the CM for his “wonderful gesture” and promised to live up to the xpectations in putting in place a truly world class academy. This will be the first full-fledged badminton academy in the port city and the initial plans include not only focussing on the sport but also ensuring that the trainees get quality education by setting up a sports school too. The proposed academy will be located near the Visakhapatnam Institute of Medical Sciences at Chinagadili Village (Vizag Rural). “Though the initial proposal was to allot five acres of land for the proposed academy, different factors were weighed in and it was decided to allot two acres to start with,” a senior State Government official said. The Government was briefed by the champion shuttler that the ultimate objective is to produce an Olympic medallist and that Sindhu will draw from her experience to ensure that the best of the young talent, especially girls from the rural belt, will be given special attention, the official said. “The Government is impressed with the commitment and passion Sindhu has shown,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-gets-land-for-her-academy/article34553815.ece
14 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Hyderabad CA’s imbroglio continues||The two groups — one led by Hyderabad Cricket Association president Mohd Azharuddin and the other by the secretary R. Vijayanand — continued to be at loggerheads as they sent diverse statements on the appointment of Chief Executive Officer on Thursday. Vijayanand in his media release stated, “This is to inform you that the Apex Council of HCA, as decided in the AGM, has appointed Suneel Kante as CEO and he has taken charge from today in the presence of the members — vice-president K. John Manoj, joint secretary Naresh Sharma and Surender Agarwal (treasurer) besides myself.” “Suneel is available at the HCA office at Rajeev Gandhi international stadium during office-hours for anyone to meet him,” the secretary’s statement said. However, Azhar in his release said, “the above communication and appointment of the CEO is illegal and suffers from procedural infirmities. It is unfortunate that they (above members) are working overtime to reduce the Apex Council of HCA to a proprietorship concern and the governance in HCA to a street shop by their acts of ignorance and arrogance. “I have not been consulted; I have not assessed any candidate to confirm if he meets the eligibility conditions prescribed in 23(1). I’m sure other educated and rule compliant members — at least three of them have not been consulted. “There is an in-house procedure that needs to be set up for appointing the CEO,” he added. “All that I know is that the CEO &CFO positions were advertised in the newspaper on my push, then radio silence. And, suddenly this announcement. True reflection of decision making in a proprietorship concern. “This blatant violation of the Constitution by you will be brought to the attention of BCCI and the Honorable Supreme Court and the High Court as the actions are a contempt of law,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hyderabad-cas-imbroglio-continues/article34553817.ece

14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Dealing with success was the hardest time in my life’||Shooter Abhinav Bindra on Wednesday said that he had encountered mental health issues right after winning the 10m air rifle gold medal at the Beijing Games in 2008. Bindra, the only Indian to win an individual gold in the Olympics, said just after that moment of celebration, he felt a “void”. He also said he wanted to quit shooting after the feat. Asked whether he faced mental health issues, Bindra said: “I had a long career in sport, with many ups and downs. It’s ironic my biggest mental crisis in life came when I actually succeeded. A lot of people talked about dealing with failure, but for me, dealing with success was probably the hardest time in my life. “Up until Beijing where I had my greatest victory, I had trained for 16 years of life with a singular goal and singular obsession that I wanted to win gold medal at the Olympics. Was depressed and lost “One fine day, this dream, the goal was achieved but it created a very large void in my life. I think to me that was very challenging. I was depressed and was lost. I did not know what to do with my life and what to do next. That was probably the toughest moment of my life,” said the 38-year-old. “My energies were depleted. It took a lot out of me to win. But more than anything, when you are goalless, you are listless in your life. The beauty of having goals in life is that it drives you and when that is lost you lose a lot of meaning in life... sometimes we get lured by an equation that gold medal equals happiness. That is false and we need to reverse that equation and make it as happiness equals gold medal,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dealing-with-success-was-the-hardest-time-in-my-life/article34553383.ece

14 May 2021||LOS ANGELES,||Hawks, Knicks clinch playoff berths||Los Angeles Lakers raised its 2020 NBA championship banner on Wednesday before scraping to a 124-122 victory over the hapless Houston Rockets to keep alive its hopes of direct entry to the 2021 playoffs. Atlanta Hawks clinched its first playoff berth since 2016 with a 120-116 come-from-behind victory over the Washington Wizards, and the New York Knicks was assured of its first post-season spot since 2013 when Boston Celtics fell 102-94 to Cleveland Cavaliers. With the regular season speeding toward its close on Sunday, the Lakers remained outside the top six in the Western Conference and likely looking at having to advance through the play-in tournament for the teams ranked seventh through 10th in each conference. Lakers reserve Kyle Kuzma drove for the go-ahead layup with 6.9 seconds remaining, putting Los Angeles up 123-122 after it had surrendered nine straight points to fall one point down. Lakers forward Wesley Matthews then managed to poke the ball away from Houston’s Kelly Olynyk on what would be the Rockets’ final possession, and Talen Horton-Tucker made a free-throw to complete the scoring. The teams occupying the final two playoff spots in the West, Portland and Dallas, both won on Wednesday, Portland downing the league-leading Utah Jazz 105-98 and Dallas beating the New Orleans Pelicans 125-107.

14 May 2021||London,||Porto to host CL final||The all-English Champions League final will be held in Porto with 12,000 fans from Chelsea and Manchester City, UEFA confirmed on Thursday. The May 29 showpiece was moved from Istanbul to the 50,000-capacity Estadio do Dragao due to England imposing tougher pandemic travel restrictions on Turkey that would have prevented fans flying in. The initial alternative had been to use Wembley Stadium in London, but talks with the British government stalled on Monday over being able to secure quarantine waivers for the guests and broadcasters required by UEFA to attend the game. But Portugal is among the 12 territories that England is allowing people to return from without quarantine beginning next week. UEFA said 6,000 tickets to both Chelsea and City fans would go on sale on Thursday. “Fans have had to suffer more than twelve months without the ability to see their teams live and reaching a Champions League final is the pinnacle of club football,” UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said. “To deprive those supporters of the chance to see the match in person was not an option and I am delighted that this compromise has been found.  Last year’s final, which was also moved from Istanbul to Portugal, was played without fans in Lisbon as Bayern Munich won.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/porto-to-host-cl-final/article34553415.ece

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||All about the honey||What is the most sustainably produced alcoholic beverage? It is a non-grain recipe, once known as the elixir of the gods: mead. Crafted from honey and water and fermented by yeast, mead leaves a small carbon footprint since it depends on bees and nectar available on existing farmlands, unlike grains that are cultivated specifically for beer, rum or whiskey. In terms of alcohol content, mead is closer to wine than beer, ranging between eight to 20% ABV (the amount of alcohol/ethanol in a drink). Mead is widely thought to be one of the oldest alcoholic beverages, with evidence of a fermented beverage made of honey, rice, and fruit dating to 7BC in China. Over the past decade, meaderies in India have slowly been taking this story forward in some pockets of the country. In barely a year since it opened, Nashik-based Cerana Meads is supplying to select hotels and restaurants in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik. Pune-based Moonshine, which holds the distinction of being Asia’s first meadery, has been around since 2018 and retails its experimental wares across retail at about 200 stores and 200 restaurants across Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Navi Mumbai,Thane and Goa. “We began with just two tanks when we were testing the waters for mead, then we scaled up with two larger tanks and now we have 20,000 litre tanks like the ones at wineries, at our factory. Our idea is to have a pan India footprint and build a global brand,” says Moonshine co-founder Rohan Rehani. Clearly, mead is in demand.  For Yoginee Budhkar and Ashwini Deore, co-founders at Cerana Meads in Nashik, starting a meadery in 2020 was a natural progression of their interest in beekeeping and their fascination with fermentation. Yoginee explains, “While doing my doctorate in Food Engineering and Technology, I had a fortuitous introduction to meads while visiting a professor in the U.K. My friend and fellow PhD scholar Ashwini was enthusiastic about creating an innovative product from agricultural resources, and her love for wine and spirits led us to Cerana Meads.” Along with its flagship mead, the meadery has collaborated with breweries in Maharashtra and Karnataka to make braggots, melding malt and mead, and also makes India’s very first pyment — a mead using grapes. Their version uses chenin blanc grapes from Nashik. Cerana’s melomels, which are fruit-infused meads, highlight both local produce and natural honey, “Our jamun (black plum) melomel uses local jamun s and jamun honey, which is earthy and spicy. For our pomegranate melomel, we have a lychee honey that has floral notes. We also use multi-floral honey from forests in Himachal Pradesh, where you find citrus fruits and flowers,” says Yoginee. All of Cerana’s offerings are priced at Rs. 180 a pint except for their Yule spice sold in winter at Rs. 450. The products find takers among the 25-40 age bracket, largely upper middle class consumers who have travelled and are curious to try out homegrown craft beverages. Says Cerana customer Shilpa Brahme from Pune, “Their jamun melomel and yule spice continue to be my favourites. Being a home-baker, I have also used Yule spice for cake preparations when I’ve invited friends for dinner and dessert.” Business of bees The founders at Cerana have undergone training in beekeeping. In every natural hive, a portion of the honey is used as food for the bee larvae, and the surplus gets stored in the upper one-third of the structure. Manmade bee-boxes mimic this ingenious design. The upper one-third of the bee-box, called the super, is where honey is stored. The lower two-thirds, called the brood box, houses the queen and worker bees. “It took us painstaking effort to convince beekeepers to start using only the supers for their honey collection, instead of invading the brood box, and we buy only that honey for our mead production,” states Yoginee. Honey is also important to entrepreneur duo Rohan Rehani and Nitin Vishwas, who started Moonshine. Back then, meads did not exist in the Indian excise lexicon. Now Moonshine Meadery in addition to its regular stream of meads in the market, has branched out to a special Moonshine Honey Project. Moonshine has its own ‘bee whisperer’, Akshay Borse, “with two years of experience on the field, 10 harvests across the country, and probably 1,000 bee stings, Akshay has made it his mission to change the way beekeeping is practised in the country,” adds Rohan. The Mustard honey harvested from Doonda, Rajasthan, in January 2021, tastes like a lemon glaze, quite counterintuitive to the memory of pungent mustard. “Our latest harvest was in March, an acacia honey which we will use for the next edition of the Project X mead, to highlight the wonderful single-origin honey that our country has to offer,” states Nitin. To revive beekeeping, bee-boxes have been set up in and around Pune, and the Mulshi valley. The post-processing filtration and packaging is carried out below 38 degrees Celsius, to preserve all the bio-enzymes produced by the bees. The lockdown has been busy at Moonshine, with the launch of MeadLABS, gluten-free meads celebrating seasonal fruits andhoney, priced between Rs. 130 in Goa to Rs. 190 in Maharashtra. The meadery plans to expand retail in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala by 2022. The grilled pineapple mead is made with rum-soaked pineapple that has been grilled over coal, combined with a multi-floral honey. For the guava-chilli variant, white and pink guavas meet multi-floral honey and the feisty Naga ghost chillies. The bourbon-soaked apple mead is crafted by ageing Moonshine’s apple cyder mead over bourbon-infused French oak chips. Shinchita Majumdar, a regular mead patron, says, “Moonshine Meads are pure art in a pint. The guava chilli, grilled pineapple and coffee and my current favourites.” Rohan agrees, “Meads lend themselves to so many iterations; combining Indian flavours and Indian honey is a thing of beauty.”  Mead is widely thought to be one of the world’s oldest alcoholic beverages||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/all-about-the-honey/article34553569.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||The world beyond the dinner table||“Food is adjacent to so many other things that impact us: gender, caste, a vast variety of beliefs…” According to former journalist Peter Griffin, discussions around the subject of food can be relatable, fascinating and endless. He should know: as founder and admin of the vibrant Facebook group Simple Recipes For Complicated Times, he has been privy to the cooking struggles, recipes and cravings of over 6,000 Indians since the group launched, when the pandemic began. The experience, he says, has taught him something. Something beyond the host of regional recipes, shortcut kitchen “hacks” and produce advice that members have been sharing. From one man’s light-hearted rant about disliking nuts to another woman’s memories of her aunt in Kashmir, who taught her to be independent, opinionated and feminist without actually using the term feminist, food and the kitchen shapes our lives and personalities in ways we often do not realise. Griffin is now taking these conversations to a different platform, in a different format. His ongoing Table Talk conversation series features an in-depth discussion every other Sunday, each with a noted guest from a far-flung walk of life. From theatre artiste Kirtana Kumar’s experience of moving from city to farm and foraging for her own produce, to food writer Antoine Lewis tracing the influence of different countries in what is now considered quintessentially Indian diet, each person, brings a different discussion to the table. He recalls Lewis’s conversation in detail: “It was about authenticity. So much of what we consider authentic, essentially Indian food is actually not Indian. India has about three native spices, yet we call ourselves the land of spices. The chilli is not native to India; it came via the Portuguese, as did the tomato and the potato. The thing with food is that it migrates, morphs, changes. We are not exactly eating what our great-grandparents grew and ate.” His audience for these conversations has so far varied between 10 and 30, but as word spread, the next edition has 50 registrations already. Griffin is both cautious and optimistic; he has enough topics and speakers in mind for another six months, but recognises that scheduling is a challenge. “It’s more of a challenge because I want these conversations to be topical, and cannot predict what topic would be relevant a few months down the line,” he states. Griffin adds, “If it gets successful, and I am able to accommodate the number of people who want to come in, then I would have to consider doing it in a webinar format.” But to enable that, he would have to spend some money, he observes, “in which I have to make some money off it [Table Talk], at least enough for it to pay for itself.” There are options he can consider, from sponsorship to ticketing, but that is too far in the future to thresh out. For now, his focussing is on the next edition, and the next, with everyone from authors to anthropologists slotted in. “The people I have lined up are knowledgeable, have fun stuff to share and are interesting speakers,” he says, and registrations are open.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||On a magic carpet||“You broke your promise!” screamed Pia. Her face was red, as she stamped her foot and waved her hands. As you may have guessed, Pia was an enfant terrible. Her parents were tired of her tantrums. They wondered how their cute little baby girl had transformed into such a holy terror. They looked up from their computers and then at each other. They rolled their eyes, raised their eyebrows, shrugged their shoulders, and went back to work. “You are the worst parents any child can have. I’ve been through a year of hell in that horrible school. You promised to take me to Disney World in Brussels.” Tricked! When her parents heard this, they sniggered, giggled and finally burst into laughter. They laughed till tears rolled down from their eyes. Pia was so surprised that she forgot she was having an outburst. “What’s so funny?” she whispered, when the laughter died down. “Ha ha ha ha,” laughed her dad, “if you had read any of the books we bought you, you would know... ha ha ha ha.” “Know what? WHAT?” screamed Pia, impatiently. “Ha ha ha ha….there is no Disney World in Brussels. So technically, we did not lie. Ha ha ha ha,” said her mom, as her parents began laughing again. Pia went up to her room and, just to show her parents how angry she was, banged the door shut. The entire house vibrated with the sound. She lay on her bed and thought of having a good cry. But there were no tears. Her eyes fell on her bookshelf. “They laughed at me because I did not know that there was no Disney World in Brussels,” she said to herself. She felt her anger returning. “They laughed because they thought it was something I should know! From books! Could it be? Will books give me the answers?” The first book she saw was Horrid High . A school named Horrid High? It must be my school, she thought, as she took it off the shelf. She was gripped by the story of Ferg Gottin and Horrid High. With each page she turned, she was drawn more into the story. Before she knew it, the book was over. An intense feeling of sadness came over her. “Maybe I can find something else on the shelf,” she thought. She read The War That Saved My Life . How can a war save a life? She sniggered. Everyone knows a war can only kill. No sooner had she started when she was transported to Britain and World War II. She became 10-year-old Ada with a clubfoot. Ada’s struggles became hers. Ada’s victories, she claimed. It was with a sigh she turned the last page. Now, there was no stopping Pia. As 10-year-old Micah Tuttle, she set off on a search for Lightbender and the fantastical Circus Mirandus. The silence in the house was deafening. Pia’s parents became worried. Had they been too harsh with her? Feeling guilty, they crept up and peeked into the room. Imagine their surprise when they saw her bent over a book. Read-a-thon From the ravages of WWII, Pia was now in India 1947. She was reading Nisha’s letters to the mother she had never known. From the letters in The Night Diary, Nisha understood the heartbreak of separation and Partition, of loving someone you have only heard of, and of the need to try and fit in. It gave her a glimpse of the angst of severance and a perception of history so far removed from her textbook. When her parents called her for dinner, Pia said, “I am Harriet the Spy and I am in New York!” From New York, it was a long journey to Malgudi, as she became Swami studying at the Mission School. It was late and her parents were now worried. Pia hadn’t eaten the whole day. “This has got to stop,” said her father. “Oh please,” replied Pia, exasperated. She had just begun a new book. The opening lines took her breath away.  In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines, lived 12 little girls in two straight lines.  Pia now knew she didn’t need to get onto a plane or train to go anywhere. Sitting in her room she could travel to any place in the world. She could even journey in time. She could battle dinosaurs, fight whales, meet magicians, fly, dance…in fact do anything she wished.  Pia was enfant terrible. Her parents were tired of her tantrums.   Pia was so surprised that she forgot she was having an outburst.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/on-a-magic-carpet/article34553641.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Test of patience||“Uuuuuuurrrgh!” Shyam tossed the tablet aside. “What happened?” Thatha asked, looking over his newspaper. “I’m waiting for the new season of Fortnite to upgrade. There’s another 80% to go and it’s going to take hours. All my friends have upgraded and are playing without me.” “Shall I tell you a story while we wait?” asked Thatha. “Ok, but not about how you walked 30km to school every day without chappals . ” Thatha laughed. “Ok. How about the time I once had to wait months for something I desperately wanted?” Shyam’s eyes grew wide. “Months? No way!” “It was 1946, and I was 14 years old, your brother’s age in fact. Where is Sachit? Maybe he wants to listen too?” “NO!” said Shyam firmly. “No sharing.” Shyam plonked himself on his Thatha’s lap. Shyam had loved to do this since he was a baby and still did. “Ok. This is just for you,” Thatha whispered. “I was 14 years old living in Madras. Me, your Rajan Thatha, Krishnanrajan Thatha and Rathnam Thatha were all cricket crazy.” Shyam giggled. “You’re so skinny, I can’t believe you played cricket. Did you have a six pack like Kohli?” “I had a 20 pack, okay! Every day, we would all go to a plot opposite The Hindu office. There’s a big hospital now, but back then it was an empty patch of land among coconut trees. Youngsters would come from across the city to play, and anyone could join in the game.” Life altering moments “One day, a gentleman called Venkatraman stopped to watch us play. He seemed as cricket mad as we were. After we wrapped up, he took us to a nearby hotel and bought us all coffee.” “Thatha! You shouldn’t go with strangers! Don’t you know that?” “You’re right, but we were lucky. In fact, meeting Venkatraman was an important moment in our lives! He thought that we were all solid cricketers and suggested that we start our own cricket club.” “Like the Chennai Super Kings?” “Yes! But, we had no money.” “Why didn’t you ask your parents?” “It was a different time. There was no idea of pocket money. We were a large family; no one was going to waste money on our cricket club. But Ratnam Thatha said he would find the money we needed. He wrote to all sorts of people — from the President of the Madras Cricket Club to Vijay Merchant.” Shyam looked blank. “Who’s Vijay Merchant?” “Only the finest cricketer in the land. But there was no e-mail or WhatsApp back then and we couldn’t send a Facebook message either. Everything had to be sent by post. First, we argued over what the letter would say. Then, we needed money to post it. We were too scared to ask our father, so we asked our mother. She put some money aside in a rice drum every month for emergencies. She gave us the money and we posted the letter.” “What happened next?” Shyam’s eyes were round. Test of patience “Nothing! Months passed with no reply. It was agony.” “Didn’t you give up?” Thatha chuckled. “Strangely enough, no. We did other things to keep us busy. Someone at the Madras Cricket Club had promised to donate us a genuine cricket ball. So, Rathnam Thatha would cycle every day to his house and wait at the gate. After a month, the poor man got so fed up that he gave him the ball.” “He had to wait a month for a ball? Now we can order one on Amazon and it comes the next day!” “True. But the waiting was half the fun. It gave us something to look forward to. I wouldn’t have had it any other way.” “What happened then?” “One day, when we were eating our tiffin, our father handed over an envelope to Krishnarajan Thatha. We all were convinced it was from Vijay Merchant, and we pounced on him, begging him to see. My mother wasn’t having it, though. We had to finish our meal first.” “MORE DELAYS! UNFAIR” yelled Shyam. “I don’t think we’ve ever eaten our food so quickly. Then, we stood around Krishnarajan Thatha, urging him to be quick,” Thatha chuckled. “What was inside?” “A money order, for Rs. 125!” Shyam’s face fell. “That’s all?” “That was a lot back then, Shyam. Rs. 125 in 1946 would be worth thousands today. Well, after months, we finally had some money and a cricket ball. We bought ourselves a kit and a mat and set up our own club called the Jubilee Cricket Club.” “Every day, we would rush home from school and college, load our kit onto a cycle rickshaw and go to Island Grounds. We would play until it became dark, come back home and talk about how we had played, much to the annoyance of our parents.” “Ha! Kind of like when we talk about Fortnite at dinner.” “Just like that.” “But those were some of the best days. There was nothing we loved more than the game itself, and we were ready to try anything, to wait as long as we had to, just to play.” Shyam’s phone pinged. “Looks like your game is ready” said Thatha, picking up his newspaper again. Shyam looked at his phone. “Thatha?” he said. “Hmmm?” “I think there’s an old cricket bat in the storeroom and a ball. Do you want to play?” Note: This is a true story about how the Jubilee Cricket Club was formed by the author's father-in-law and his brothers in 1946. The club celebrates its 75th birthday this year.   But the waiting was half the fun. It gave us something to look forward to.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/test-of-patience/article34553619.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Through the tiger’s eye||Abhi hid a yawn as Sumana Miss told them about conservation and why it was necessary. Not that he had anything against conservation; just that it seemed such a distant thing to worry about. The peal of the doorbell jerked him out of his daze and Abhi sat up. He heard loud scuffling noises and wondered who it was. But he had to wait till school was over to find out. When he left his room, he found Amma opening a large cardboard carton. “Look!” she smiled. “Great-aunt Shaku sent me some stuff from her house because she’s moving in with her son soon. Let’s see what’s in the box!” There were books, which Amma pounced on with a cry. “I remember reading these as a child,” she said. “Shaku Atya lived in a village in the hills, and we spent many summers there!” There were soft heaps of saris, smelling of naphthalene balls, which Amma hugged to herself. Just when Abhi had decided that there was nothing for him, Amma pulled out something golden. A hunter’s trophy “What’s that?” he demanded. “That,” said Amma, holding it up, “is a tiger skin! Shaku Atya’s father-in-law was a hunter and their house was full of deer heads and tiger and bear skins!” “Can I have that?” Abhi asked. “This?” Amma asked, astonished. Abhi nodded, thinking how great it would look on his wall. He spread it out on his bed and admired the pattern of the stark black stripes against the golden colour. He ran his hands over the fur, enjoying its smooth perfection. Then, his fingers found a little hole. Curious, Abhi pushed his finger into it. Instantly, the room melted away and, instead of cream painted walls, Abhi saw dry yellow grass. A drum was beating somewhere close by, and its ugly beat annoyed him. He opened his mouth to protest and out came a growl. Deep and long, it thrummed through his body. But it did nothing to silence the noise. Instead, the drums beat faster and moved closer. Though Abhi smelt the sour smell of fear, his tail twitched triumphantly. He only had to roar to frighten all living things. Look at how silent the jungle had fallen around him. Even the pesky monkeys had been frightened into silence. Found! “He’s in that patch of grass,” someone hissed. “Move! Get him out of there!” Abhi felt the gentle vibrations of feet walking towards him and knew a moment of rage. But there was also a small sliver of fear at these creatures that would not take no for an answer. The best thing to do was to go away. So, gentle as a whisper, he moved. The grass trembled gently, as he pushed past the stiff dry stalks. For a moment, it seemed as if he would get away. Then the drums surrounded him, and escape became difficult. Still he moved, body close to the ground, his golden fur blending with his surroundings. But the enemy was waiting on the other side of the grass and Abhi knew then that there was only one thing to do. He crouched in the grass and then, with a mighty leap, he sprang. He sailed through the air, and the watchers shouted in terror. He roared and the jungle was silenced. Into the silence came a loud bang and Abhi felt a sudden jolt of pain. He stumbled and fell. A hum of voices sounded in the still forest but Abhi only wanted to get away. He struggled up and ran on, only to collapse in the middle of some bushes. He lay there, feeling the pain digging deep into him, seeing the world tremble and turn pale. “What a specimen!” he heard someone say. “Must be at least eight feet from nose to tail!” But the noises meant nothing to him and, slowly, they faded away. In their place was the hum of the fan and the distant mutter of the television. Abhi looked down at the hole in the tiger skin. A reminder So that was where he had been shot, that tiger who had been wandering around his jungle, looking for food. Tears blurred his eyes and, for a minute, it was difficult to remember where he was. Then Abhi blinked his tears away and carefully folded the tiger skin. He would keep it safe, in memory of the tiger who had been shot to please a hunter. He would keep it in case he ever needed reminding why animals mattered to our world and why conservation was necessary. But Abhi didn’t think he would need to be reminded. A journey, however short it had been, in a tiger’s body was not something you could forget.  He roared and the jungle was silenced. Into the silence came a loud bang...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/through-the-tigers-eye/article34553645.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the past?||“There’s nothing to beat a hike in the hills — a total escape into the past!” Shreya heard Dad say to Mom, as he hopped out of the bubble and leaned it against the garage wall. “You can drive out of the city and hike in the hills,” Mom murmured. “You don’t have to use that contraption…” “You call it a contraption?” exclaimed Dad. “It’s my greatest invention so far…” They moved towards the foyer and Shreya skipped backwards — and almost fell over her younger brother. “What are you doing here?” she hissed. “The same as you,” Kabir hissed back. “Trying to figure out what Dad’s up to…” They backed half-way up the stairs. When they heard their parents enter their bedroom, they went down again and tried to hear what was being said. All they could catch, however, were disconnected bits: “Within the next month or so”, “With the kids, of course!”, “Perfectly safe! I’m in one piece, aren’t I?” “What’s that thing?” Kabir asked, when they were back in their room. “You were there longer than I was.” This was not the first time Shreya had watched what Dad was doing. “I think he’s made some kind of time machine…” “What?” cried Kabir. “You mean we can go back to pre-Covid times and live a normal life?” “You heard him,” said Shreya. “He’ll take us in a month or so…” Kabir threw up his hands. “How can we wait that long?” It was obvious that Shreya was just waiting for him to say what she had already thought of because she stood up and said, “Then let’s go now!” Kabir jumped up. In minutes, the two of them were in front of the bubble in the open garage. “Do you know how it works?” asked Kabir. “Well, Dad straps himself in and presses something and he’s gone…” Kabir was indignant. “You’ve been watching and you never told me…?” Shreya got into the bubble. “Are you coming or not?” she asked. Kabir jumped in. There were straps for their arms and covered grooves for their feet. Soon, they were secured in place and the bubble shut on its own. Shreya pressed a switch that blinked at her and suddenly they began to spin violently. They grabbed at each other and let out a scream of surprise. At last they stopped moving. Sheepishly, they let go of each other and unstrapped themselves as the bubble opened. Where are we? It was night and they were on a low hill. “I don’t know what year it is, but the air feels clean!” Shreya exclaimed. Kabir climbed onto a rock and looked around. “There are lights in the distance. Should we go that way?” “Let’s stay away from people — maybe we’re in the distant past and we’ll be treated like aliens. Let’s just hike like Dad did.” They walked downhill through the trees in the moonlight, enjoying their freedom. Suddenly they heard voices. “I’m telling you; I saw something weird,” someone said gruffly. “It could be someone after our food stock.” “Here? In this remote village?” said another. “Where else?” said the gruff voice. “The cities are crazy — the rate of infection is high and there are lockdowns and what not…” The children looked at each other. What was this? Had they gone into the lockdowns of the past or were they in a future where the COVID situation was even worse? How had Dad enjoyed a fun hike and why were they in trouble? “Run!” hissed Shreya, and she and Kabir raced back uphill. They tripped over stones, blundered against branches, and made enough noise to tell their pursuers exactly where they were — but the bubble was nowhere in sight! “It was near those rocks!” said Kabir, pointing upwards to the right. Shreya looked back. There were three figures in the open that were gaining on them. Desperation made the children practically fly. At last they saw the bubble half-leaning against a rock. They darted in, grabbed the straps and pressed the switch, as their pursuers burst into the small clearing. The bubble closed and they took off. This time, they didn’t scream — they were just relieved to be off. Soon, they were safely back in the garage; confused, frightened, but, most of all, relieved to be home safe! A little later A fortnight later, Dad put down his toast at breakfast time and said, “You kids have been having a tough time indoors — how about we use this machine I’ve invented that travels long distances in minutes, and go to the hills? You’ll love the open air…” “You mean it’s not a time machine?” asked Shreya. Dad shook his head, puzzled. “Whatever gave you that idea?” he asked. “No, we can just go some 100 to 200 kilometres away and hike in the nearby hills…” She and Kabir exchanged a look — and then both of them said together, ‘No! NO! No hikes!’  “I think he’s made some kind of time machine…” “What?” cried Kabir.   How had Dad enjoyed a fun hike and why were they in trouble?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/back-to-the-past/article34553637.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Dreamy deliveries||I was feeling anxious. COVID-19 cases were once again on the rise in my city, even though the vaccination drive was going on in full swing. Most people were feeling low, as we were in another lockdown. No travel, no outings, no meeting friends. All this stress was affecting my sleep. I tossed and turned in bed. Suddenly I saw a dove in a pleated brown skirt and a brown blouse drop a letter that said “A surprise awaits you” on my bed. The next day my parents gifted me a cycle. A few nights later, a crow in a brown shirt and shorts dropped another letter on my bed. “A shock awaits you,” said this . The next morning, I received an e-mail from my class teacher. She had given me a C grade for my assignment. From then on, I began to dislike crows. The birds from the dream Due to the lockdown, I had started a daily exercise routine of skipping and cycling in the morning and walking in our garden after dinner. As I turned around for my third round of the garden, I heard the flutter of wings. A dove and a crow were bickering at the root of a tree. They were the same birds I had seen in my dreams; the ones that brought both good news and bad. As the dove bent its head, a hole appeared in the tree. The birds quickly entered the hole. Before the hole could close, I moved towards it and poked my head in. Instantly I was pulled in with the contours of the hole adjusting to my body. Surprisingly, I didn’t feel scared travelling through the darkness but the journey was short. The moment I emerged on the other side, I was stunned by the sudden brightness, as though several floodlights had been turned on. I was standing in a clearing with a poky house to my right. Outside hung a wooden board that said ‘Dreamland Post Office’. I peeped through the window and saw the dove and the crow sorting slips of paper into two stacks. After the sorting was over, the birds tucked each slip of paper inside fancy envelopes on which they wrote the names of the people to whom the letters were addressed. Then they dropped the letters into two brown bags. Stretching their aching paws and rubbing their tired eyes, they turned to me. “Hello Veer! How are you?” they said in unison. “Sorry! We didn’t speak to you earlier because, if there is even a single mistake, Prince Elga Eagle will scold us. He wants the right message to be delivered to the right person. Else there will be complete confusion.” “I met both of you few days back in my dream,” I greeted them. “I’m grateful you didn’t call it a nightmare. I know that you hate crows since then,” said the crow, its eyes filled with tears. “Sorry,” I said, and looked down. It wasn’t the crow’s fault that I had received a low grade. He was just the messenger. Night missions “It’s okay,” the crow said. After slinging a brown bag around their necks, the birds put on their masks. “Can I join you in your mission tonight?” I asked. The birds agreed and blew at me. I shrunk to the size of a thumb. “Handing me a tiny mask, the crow said, “Sit on my back.” The birds flew high. Mists swirled low in the air, thousands of grey clouds drifted aimlessly. “We are in the land of sleep,” the crow explained. Each grey cloud had the sleeping image of a child. As we flew deeper into the mist, it thickened and became darker. Picking up a letter with the message, “Be careful of insects”, the crow entered one cloud. “When we penetrate the cloud with the child’s image, we are actually entering their mind, giving them the dream.” It stood a distance away and dropped the letter, which was absorbed by the cloud. “Social distancing,” it smiled, squirting sanitizer on its claws. “Tomorrow, the boy will be stung by a bee while playing in his garden.” I made a face. “Now my turn,” said the dove said flying close so that I could hop on to its back. Picking up a letter that said “the delivery boy will bring you a surprise” from her bag, the dove flew straight into a cloud. My eyes widened when I recognised the sleeping child. It was my classmate Faiz. “Tomorrow he will get a box of chocolates from an online site as a part of a lucky draw.” The birds spent the entire night delivering messages to sleeping children all over the world. “Can I join you both again tomorrow night? I asked. “Sure,” the crow laughed. “During this time of the pandemic, this is a safe mode of travel.”  “We are in the land of sleep,” the crow explained. Each grey cloud had the sleeping image of a child.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/dreamy-deliveries/article34553634.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Unlikely band of heroes||“Hey guys, how about going on a picnic tomorrow?” Naani asked. “Where to?” asked 10-year-old Ishan. “A tiny village called Mangalajodi, around 65 kilometres from here, on the northern shores of Chilika.” “Isn’t Chilika the largest coastal lagoon in India?” asked Riya, who was older than Ishan by a year. “Yes, and it is home to hundreds of exotic birds,” Naani replied. “That sure sounds exciting,” exclaimed Ishaan, hugging Naani. Riya and Ishan had come to Bhubaneswar from Delhi to spend their winter holidays with their grandma. Paradise of birds The next day, they started early in the morning. By 6.30 a.m. they had reached Mangalajodi. Their driver stopped the car and led them down a narrow path through thick undergrowth. They reached a marshy wetland sprinkled with reeds and vegetation. Two men in a boat were chatting; one got up and came towards them. “You want to see the birds?” he asked in Odia. “Yes, but we will need a guide as well to tell us about the birds?” Naani said. “Maaji, I will be your guide.” “Uncle, can the canoe move in this swamp?” Riya wondered. “Don’t worry, beta. There is a channel of water running through the marsh. I can navigate the canoe quite easily.” Soon, they were on their way. It was all silent and the only sound was that of the oar gently slapping the water. Suddenly, there was a sharp hoot and Ishan jumped up, almost falling off. A colony of reeds had come alive. They could see birds of different sizes and shapes taking flight at diverse speeds and to various heights. The air was filled with a euphony of sounds. It was an awesome sight and Riya wasted no time in clicking pictures on Naani’s mobile. “Uncle, what is your name?” Riya asked the boatman. “Sadhu Behera.” “What is this book you are carrying?” Sadhu gave her the tome and she looked at the title: Book of Indian Birds by Dr. Salim Ali. “Can you read and write English?” Riya asked him. “No, beta. But I can recognise each bird from a distance. Once I spot the bird, I show the picture to tourists who then tell me the correct pronunciation. That is how, over time, I managed to pick up the names in English.” Revelation “Uncle, how long have you been a guide?” Ishan asked. “Beta, we have been guides since 2000. Before that, we were all poachers for many years.” “Poachers?” Naani was stunned at the confession. “Yes, we used to trap the birds and eat them up or sell them in the market. We used to sell their eggs too.” “What made you change your ways?” “In 2000, someone from an NGO counselled us. He told us that the birds are our lifeline. If we keep killing them, soon there won’t be any left. What will happen to us then? So, rather than killing the birds, we should protect them for our own good.” “He was absolutely right,” Naani said. Sadhu nodded and continued, “We were convinced and agreed to follow his directions. We knew the territory intimately, were aware of the tactics used by hunters, and had excellent knowledge of the birds. So, from poachers we became not only guides but also protectors.” “Are you happy with this change?” Naani asked. “Of course, we are. We make as much money by working as guides during the tourist season and for fishermen at other times. Today, we not only take pride in showing tourists around, we also educate them.” “How is that?” asked Riya. “ Beta , we tell the visitors about how to preserve nature, maintain hygiene and coexist with nature. When we notice anyone poaching, we catch them and hand them over to the Forest Officials. As protectors, we get a lot more respect. We have also won awards and recognition at the State level.” A few minutes later, Sadhu stopped the boat and softly whispered. “Look to your left.” They turned their heads and Riya let out a gasp. The most beautiful bird she had ever seen was resting gently on a water plant. “That is called the Black-Winged Stilt.” As Riya watched fascinated, she noticed that the bird’s wings were jet black while its underbelly and neck were fluffy white. However, what took her breath away were the winged creature’s legs — bright orange and delicate like those of a ballet dancer! “Uncle, where all do these birds come from?” asked Ishan. “They travel all the way from Russia and Mongolia, as well as the Caspian Sea!” On the way back, Naani said, “Isn’t it strange that Sadhu, who has not been to school, taught us one of the most important lessons — to treat nature with empathy and respect?” The other two nodded in agreement.  We have been guides since 2000. Before that, we were all poachers for many years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/unlikely-band-of-heroes/article34553652.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Mirror, mirror, on the wall||The worst thing is to be forced to sit at home. That too, for a whole year. That too, without seeing your friends. That too, wearing a mask and always washing your hands. That too, that too. Believe me, it was getting on my nerves. Sitting at home is one thing. Being forced to do that is quite another! And then it happened. Honestly. None of it is a lie or make-believe. It really happened. And that’s what made the year special. You can’t even stay home in peace! My sister Tara and I were talking to our cousins in Kerala through our phones. Defying the Great Pandemic, they’d left home and were walking down the streets of Mattancherry, which is in Kochi where they live. Mattancherry is a quaint little place with quaint little shops selling quaint little things. It was an adventure just to sit in our house and watch our cousins roaming the streets. While everyone else was masked, the twins Raju and Saju were happily going around with only silly grins on their faces. They soon walked into a shop selling antiques. Saju’s phone showed us everything. Nothing was less than a 100 years old! Grandfather clocks, fearful masks, carved swords and lamps, cupboards and chairs, old paintings, chess-boards, gramophones ... what a treasure-house! Giggling softly, Raju pointed to the owner, an old man snoring behind the counter. Because of the Great Pandemic, there were no other customers; only crazy Raju-Saju! They came up to a mirror standing in a dark corner. It was long and with a carved, golden frame, now peeling with age.Saju pointed his phone at a cardboard piece resting against it. Printed in thick black letters were the words: “Warning! Danger! Please ask Owner to explain in detail. DON’T Touch! It could harm you and others!” I guessed what would happen next. The twins have a strange habit: Warnings made them curious! We saw them reflected in the mirror, stretching out their hands. And they both touched the mirror! Poof! Tara and I still don’t know what really happened. The last thing we saw was the twins disappearing into the mirror, as if it was a sheet of water. And then Tara and I were hit by a strong force like a wave in the sea. We blacked out. When we opened our eyes, it seemed to be after ages. We were both standing in the shop we’d just seen in our phones: the antique shop in Mattancherry! And the twins had disappeared. As we stood looking blankly at each other, there was a shout and the sleeping owner leapt up and charged at us. He was a small old man with a big old temper. We ran! We scooted from the shop with him chasing and yelling. Soon, other people joined the old man. Imagine the scene. Two innocent kids from another city being chased for no fault of theirs by people in masks led by a ferocious old man! Down the streets of Mattancherry we ran. Nothing was familiar. We didn’t know where we were, and where we were going! All we knew was the shouting behind us, the old man and his growing gang of chasers! Where were the twins? How did they vanish after getting us into this mess? “There’s the Synagogue! Let’s run inside! Remember Uncle took us last time.” “What if it’s closed when we reach there?” asked Tara. “Let’s jump into a café!” So that’s what we did. Quickly, before the mob could spot us, we jumped inside one of those quaint little cafés. Inside, all was quiet, dark and cosy. Panting heavily, we plonked ourselves at one of the tables. It took quite a while for our eyes to get used to the dimness. To our surprise, there was someone seated there already. To our even greater surprise, it was a very familiar someone. We peered and squinted at him to make sure. We took off our masks at the same time. “Uncle!” we screamed. “You both!” he screamed back. “How did you get here?” He stared as if we were some fantastic creatures and not his sister’s children. “I just got a call from Raju and Saju. They said they were not in Mattancherry any longer. They said I might run into you both instead! What on earth is happening?” “Oh, Uncle, where are they?” “It’s the strangest thing! They must be joking, of course.” “What did they SAY?” “They are in your house in Chennai!” His eyes bulged. “How is that possible?” “It is possible,” said Tara. “Long story. Order us something to eat and we’ll tell you. Just promise us one thing, Uncle.” “What?” “Never touch a strange mirror. You might put other people in danger!”  The twins have a strange habit: Warnings made them curious! ... They both touched the mirror!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall/article34553628.ece

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Mirror, mirror, on the wall||“Uuuuuuurrrgh!” Shyam tossed the tablet aside. “What happened?” Thatha asked, looking over his newspaper. “I’m waiting for the new season of Fortnite to upgrade. There’s another 80% to go and it’s going to take hours. All my friends have upgraded and are playing without me.” “Shall I tell you a story while we wait?” asked Thatha. “Ok, but not about how you walked 30km to school every day without chappals . ” Thatha laughed. “Ok. How about the time I once had to wait months for something I desperately wanted?” Shyam’s eyes grew wide. “Months? No way!” “It was 1946, and I was 14 years old, your brother’s age in fact. Where is Sachit? Maybe he wants to listen too?” “NO!” said Shyam firmly. “No sharing.” Shyam plonked himself on his Thatha’s lap. Shyam had loved to do this since he was a baby and still did. “Ok. This is just for you,” Thatha whispered. “I was 14 years old living in Madras. Me, your Rajan Thatha, Krishnanrajan Thatha and Rathnam Thatha were all cricket crazy.” Shyam giggled. “You’re so skinny, I can’t believe you played cricket. Did you have a six pack like Kohli?” “I had a 20 pack, okay! Every day, we would all go to a plot opposite The Hindu office. There’s a big hospital now, but back then it was an empty patch of land among coconut trees. Youngsters would come from across the city to play, and anyone could join in the game.” Life altering moments “One day, a gentleman called Venkatraman stopped to watch us play. He seemed as cricket mad as we were. After we wrapped up, he took us to a nearby hotel and bought us all coffee.” “Thatha! You shouldn’t go with strangers! Don’t you know that?” “You’re right, but we were lucky. In fact, meeting Venkatraman was an important moment in our lives! He thought that we were all solid cricketers and suggested that we start our own cricket club.” “Like the Chennai Super Kings?” “Yes! But, we had no money.” “Why didn’t you ask your parents?” “It was a different time. There was no idea of pocket money. We were a large family; no one was going to waste money on our cricket club. But Ratnam Thatha said he would find the money we needed. He wrote to all sorts of people — from the President of the Madras Cricket Club to Vijay Merchant.” Shyam looked blank. “Who’s Vijay Merchant?” “Only the finest cricketer in the land. But there was no e-mail or WhatsApp back then and we couldn’t send a Facebook message either. Everything had to be sent by post. First, we argued over what the letter would say. Then, we needed money to post it. We were too scared to ask our father, so we asked our mother. She put some money aside in a rice drum every month for emergencies. She gave us the money and we posted the letter.” “What happened next?” Shyam’s eyes were round. Test of patience “Nothing! Months passed with no reply. It was agony.” “Didn’t you give up?” Thatha chuckled. “Strangely enough, no. We did other things to keep us busy. Someone at the Madras Cricket Club had promised to donate us a genuine cricket ball. So, Rathnam Thatha would cycle every day to his house and wait at the gate. After a month, the poor man got so fed up that he gave him the ball.” “He had to wait a month for a ball? Now we can order one on Amazon and it comes the next day!” “True. But the waiting was half the fun. It gave us something to look forward to. I wouldn’t have had it any other way.” “What happened then?” “One day, when we were eating our tiffin, our father handed over an envelope to Krishnarajan Thatha. We all were convinced it was from Vijay Merchant, and we pounced on him, begging him to see. My mother wasn’t having it, though. We had to finish our meal first.” “MORE DELAYS! UNFAIR” yelled Shyam. “I don’t think we’ve ever eaten our food so quickly. Then, we stood around Krishnarajan Thatha, urging him to be quick,” Thatha chuckled. “What was inside?” “A money order, for Rs. 125!” Shyam’s face fell. “That’s all?” “That was a lot back then, Shyam. Rs. 125 in 1946 would be worth thousands today. Well, after months, we finally had some money and a cricket ball. We bought ourselves a kit and a mat and set up our own club called the Jubilee Cricket Club.” “Every day, we would rush home from school and college, load our kit onto a cycle rickshaw and go to Island Grounds. We would play until it became dark, come back home and talk about how we had played, much to the annoyance of our parents.” “Ha! Kind of like when we talk about Fortnite at dinner.” “Just like that.” “But those were some of the best days. There was nothing we loved more than the game itself, and we were ready to try anything, to wait as long as we had to, just to play.” Shyam’s phone pinged. “Looks like your game is ready” said Thatha, picking up his newspaper again. Shyam looked at his phone. “Thatha?” he said. “Hmmm?” “I think there’s an old cricket bat in the storeroom and a ball. Do you want to play?” Note: This is a true story about how the Jubilee Cricket Club was formed by the author's father-in-law and his brothers in 1946. The club celebrates its 75th birthday this year.   But the waiting was half the fun. It gave us something to look forward to.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/test-of-patience/article34553622.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Made in Mandrem||During the last lockdown, artist Pradeep Naik painted a series of abstracts, employing shades of green and blue.When I arrived in Mandrem, a small village in Pernem taluka in North Goa, I was overwhelmed by the green fields and blue sky. For me, this visual offered an immediate entry into Naik’s painting. Later, he told me that the lockdown made him realise the luxury of sight, one of the privileges of village life. Mandrem, a quietly scenic village, was always well known for its skilled masons. Naik’s father was also once a mason. The village is also well known for its Ganesha idol makers. Artists Kalidas Mhamal and Bhisaji Gadekar remember how they used to watch these idols being made — their first and only exposure to art while growing up. Mandrem was also home to some fine portrait artists, who painted theatre sets and big hoardings. But perhaps this little village’s biggest claim to fame is the cohort of Goa’s most noted contemporary artists it has produced, including Naik, Shilpa Mayenkar Naik, Kalidas Mhamal, Kedar Dhondu, and Bhisaji Gadekar. Dhondu’s Lonely Residents project, which garnered a lot of attention during the last lockdown, is currently being shown at a group exhibition at Sunaparanta Goa Centre for the Arts, alongside several major Indian and international artists. Gadekar was recognised with the FICA Emerging Artist Award in 2020. Mhamal’s Caste Thread , an installation displayed at the Museum of Goa, is in renewed circulation owing to ongoing conversations about caste in the art ecosystem. These artists, who have found acclaim and recognition, trace the genesis of their art to Mandrem, where they continue to live and work. Pradeep Naik was the first artist from this group to receive a formal art education at the Goa College of Art, after which he went to Hyderabad for further studies. His canvases assimilate abandoned objects, architectural features of Goan homes, and frescoes from churches and temples among other motifs. He explains, “In a village like ours there was no art education. If not for my art teacher in school, Gajanan Naik, I wouldn’t have even known about art college. After I returned from Hyderabad, I started organising my own exhibitions in Goa. Renowned artist Subodh Kerkar also helped me. Gradually, buyers began to travel to Mandrem to buy my paintings.” Promoting artists from Goa Over the years, Naik also played a key role in setting up the Goa Artist Collective, which works to promote and showcase artists from Goa through exhibitions, workshops and discussions. His house in Mandrem is the focal point where artists meet, interact and plan for the future. Naik also supports a range of initiatives by younger artists, sometimes even offering financial aid. Although they’re all from the same village, these artists mostly met through exhibitions. Mhamal thinks it helped to have a role model in Naik. He says, “I realised that it was possible to continue living in the village, practise art and make a living as well. The myth of the city as a prerequisite for success was broken.” He has started teaching art in the village, and one of his students has now qualified for the Goa College of Art. Recently, Mhamal also participated in an exhibition at a local café where his work and those of others from Mandrem was displayed. Some of his students from the village visited the exhibition with their families, perhaps their first time at an art exhibition. A permanent silence, interrupted now and then by chirping birds, hangs over Gadekar’s studio, Chitrashala, nestled amid tall trees. Gadekar studied sculpture at Shantiniketan after attending the Goa College of Art, and is also a performance artist, a practice through which he acknowledges his family history. For a performance at the Goa Arts Festival, his father, a tailor, stitched his costume, while his mother helped drape a sari on stage. He says, “Farming is part of my family history. Mandrem’s soil has a very interesting quality, and people come here to collect it for sculpture. I feel privileged to have direct access to this soil.” Like Mhamal, Gadekar also feels that his location is no longer a disadvantage, but rather an enabler to transport local stories and practices into his art. Shilpa Mayenkar Naik arrived in Mandrem after her marriage to Pradeep Naik. She believes her practice acquired a special dimension after moving to Mandrem, where she set up her own home. Her paintings feature an army of tiny ants and insects that can easily be spotted in any home in the village. She explains, “I paint ordinary, mundane objects that surround my life here. Many of my drawings have local flowers, vegetables, seeds. While the ants may seem negligible to others, they demand to show up on my canvas. I cannot ignore them because I see them everywhere.” When Kedar Dhondu started painting, his subjects were his parents, who worked in the fields of Mandrem. His recent paintings highlight the oppressive aspects of village life such as land grabbing and unfair practices of landlords. He is also engaged in a legal battle over a plot of land. These experiences lent a new lens for him to examine the village. He says, “I want to display these paintings in the village because I believe in site specificity. It will lead to community engagement when people see their concerns raised through art. They will realise that art can be about their lives and struggles.” The artists have several plans to organise exhibitions and art camps, not just in Mandrem but in other Goan villages as well. Most of them have eschewed the usual gallery route, with their work finding an audience primarily through their own efforts. Pradeep Naik says, “In the past year, droves of people have relocated to villages in Goa. The city has come to the village. Similarly, art establishments are aware of our existence. They can reach us if they want to. We will be here.”  The writer is a culture critic who teaches literary & cultural studies at FLAME University, Pune.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||The icon of Kuchipudi village||Adjacent to the Bala Tripurasundari temple stands a small dilapidated building that has stood mute witness to the life of Kuchipudi doyen Pasumarthy Kesava Prasad (1952-2021). This building is where Kesava Prasad lived for the past four decades, teaching and promoting the Kuchipudi dance form that originated in Kuchipudi village, in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.  Sangeet Natak Academy awardee Pasumarthy Rattayya Sarma, the oldest guru living in Kuchipudi village, says: “Many gurus have brought laurels to the dance form across the globe, but Kesava’s contribution is quite unique, as he was instrumental in creating a bond between the classical dance fraternity and the village. He would invite dancers to our village; his way of celebrating cultural heritage.” “Kuchipudi will not have another guru like him to promote its dance tradition,” adds Sarma. In the 1980s and 1990s, when renowned gurus were popularising Yakshagana, Kesava encouraged solo Kuchipudi performances. A Sanskrit graduate from Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, he was the disciple of Vedantam Parvateesam, Vempati Chinna Satyam and P.G.V. Krishna Sastry. As the disciple of Vempati, Kesava led the 37-year-old Akhila Bharata Kuchipudi Natya Kala Mandali (ABKNKM) from its formative years. Between 1978 and 1983, Kesava did a stint as part-time dance assistant at Sri Siddhendra Kalakshetram while serving as an assistant in the village government school. He initiated his two sons — Mutyam (Kuchipudi guru) and Hari (mridangam artiste) — into the Kuchipudi tradition. The multi-faceted guru was born into a family of Kuchipudi and Yakshagana artistes, and his father, Pasumarthy Subramanya Sastri, was a renowned Yakshagana exponent. Dancer-guru Vedantam Radheshyam says, “As the founder secretary of ABKNKM, Kesava fulfilled the dreams of yesteryear gurus by turning the village into a venue for classical dance performances. Many dancers visited and were inspired to research its history and dance tradition.” Reviving the art form “In 2015, I agreed to work with Kesava to revive the teaching of Kuchipudi in the village. It was due to his hard work that we were able to run the Kuchipudi school at my guru Vempati’s house. The village has lost a great scholar and dance historian, who has been the prime source for many academicians and dancers,” says Bala Kondala Rao, also a Sangeet Natak Academy awardee. V. Venkayya and S. Rama Krishna Rao, former vice-chancellors, Krishna University (KRU-Machilipatnam), admit that Kuchipudi dance became the face of their institution, and it was Kesava’s idea to start the school in Kuchipudi village. Says Chennai-based Vempati Venkat, son of guru Vempati Chinna Satyam, “It’s a personal loss for me. After my father’s demise I used to consult him on different aspects of dance. He was the go-to man for most Kuchipudi artistes, teachers and dance scholars.”  Kuchipudi village will not have another guru like him to promote its dance tradition -Rattayya Sarma||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-icon-of-kuchipudi-village/article34553235.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Songs of worship||In our country, god has been visualised in a multitude of forms. And the form of Rama, who inspired the great epic Ramayana, has always been associated with creativity in artistes and with a wide representation in all the arts. The Ramayana has been a source of not just spiritual inspiration but has also produced great literature, poetry and music. The Bhakti movement in particular saw a flowering of talent from the great saint-poets, who composed songs in praise of Rama that soon became an intrinsic part of the repertoire of the performing arts. While the creations of Tyagaraja are well known, a number of other composers have written equally exquisite songs dedicated to Rama in the Carnatic tradition, rich in lyrics and ragas. The song ‘Vadavarayai matthaki’, from the Aycciyar kuravai of the Tamil classic Silappadikaram, mentions the lord as Rama. This song was set to music by S.V. Venkataraman and made popular by M.S. Subbulakshmi, and featured in her historic concert at the United Nations. The Nalayira Divyaprabandham of the Azhwars contains several pasurams dedicated to Rama. One such pasuram, ‘Mannu pugazh kosalai,’ is a tender lullaby to the scion of the Raghu clan. A lilting composition of Kulasekhara Azhwar, this was set to music and made popular by the brothers, B.V. Raman and B.V. Lakshmanan. Then we have had the Haridasas from Karnataka, whose seminal contributions to Carnatic music include compositional forms such as the pada or the devaranama, ugabhoga and the suladis. Many such compositions sing the praise of Rama. Purandaradasa, the Karnataka Sangita Pitamaha, has dedicated many a Devaranama to Rama, the most popular of which is ‘Jaya Jaya Jaya Janakikanta’ in Nattai ragam. He stresses upon the greatness of Rama nama in songs such as ‘Rama embo eradaksharada mahimayanu’ and ‘Rama mantrava japiso’. The song ‘Rama nama ratna hara’ visualises Rama as the ten avataras of Vishnu. Many of these Devaranamas have been set to music and made popular by Madras Lalitangi, M.L. Vasanthakumari, R.K. Srikantan, T.K. Govinda Rao and others. The compositions of Talapakka Annamacharya were recently discovered from copper plates preserved in the Tirumala temple. Of his many songs dedicated to Rama, ‘Vandeham Jagatvallabham’ set in the ragam Hamsadhwani by Sripada Pinakapani and ‘Deva devam bhaje’ (versions in ragas Hindolam and Dhanyasi), are well known. ‘Rama Rama prana sakhi’ in Bhairavi, immortalised by the family of Veena Dhanammal, has an interesting depiction of shringara rasa. The nayaka, separated from his beloved, wonders how Rama could endure the separation from Sita. It is said that Kshetrayya wrote this when he missed the company of his devadasi friend while visiting Bhadrachalam. Ramayana in Thiruppugazh The Thiruppugazh verses composed by Arunagirinathar dedicated to Muruga are intricate Tamil songs set to complex rhythmic patterns. Though every song culminates in a prayer to Muruga, instances from the Ramayana , right from the birth of Rama to his coronation and later the anecdotes about Lava and Kusha have been woven into the text of several Thiruppugazh verses. These have been popularised by the Alathur Brothers, D.K. Pattammal, D.K. Jayaraman, Guruji Raghavan and many others. The picturesque temple of Bhadrachalam, on the banks of the sprawling Godavari, is testimony to the devotion of Kancherla Gopanna, popularly known as Bhadrachala Ramadasa. His intense devotion is articulated in many emotional Telugu compositions. Ramadasa describes the myriad relationships the devotee shares with the divine. Many of his songs such as ‘Paluke bangara mayena’, ‘Idigo bhadradri’, ‘Takkuvemi manaku’, ‘Ikshvaku tilaka’ and ‘Etirugananu’ have been popularised by many musicians such as M. Balamuralikrishna and Nedunuri Krishnamurthy. Inspired by the song ‘Etirugananu’ and its musical arrangement in the ragam Nadanamakriya, the seer of Sringeri Sharada Peetam, Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal, composed ‘Kausalyasuta,’ a Sanskrit composition to the same musical setting. Upanishad Brahman, a great Advaita sanyasi, composed several Divyanama kirtanas. Tyagaraja was inspired by these kirtanas. Upanishad Brahman's ‘Ramashtapadi’ was set to music by Muthuswami Dikshitar. Unfortunately, the tunes are not available now. Others such as Bodhendra Saraswati spearheaded the Namasankirtana tradition along with Sridhara Ayyaval, Bhashyam Gopalakrishna Sastri and Sadguru Swamigal. Narayana Tirtha, the author of the Krishna Leela Tarangini , hails Rama, Krishna and Govinda as the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. Many a composition of saint-composer Sadasiva Brahmendra are dedicated to Rama. In Sadasiva Brahmendra, one realises the oneness of jnana and bhakti. The songs of Brahmendra were set to music and rendered by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. The evergreen ‘Pibare Rama rasam’ in raga Yamuna Kalyani extols the glory of Rama. ‘Khelati mama hrdaye’, ‘Bhajare re Raghuviram’, ‘Prativaram’, ‘Chetasri Ramam’ are other songs of Brahmendra dedicated to Rama. Inspired by the Kamba Ramayanam , acclaimed Tamil composer Arunachala Kavirayar composed his immortal opera, the Ramanatakam . Several kirtanas from Ramanatakam were set to music and made extremely popular by Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar and later by K.V. Narayanaswamy, S. Ramanathan and R. Vedavalli. ‘En pallikondir ayya’, ‘Yaro ivar yaro’, ‘Ramanukku mannan mudi’, ‘Eppadi manam’, ‘Arivar yar unnai’, ‘Sharanam sharanam’, ‘Avataram seididuvire’, ‘Kanden kanden’ and ‘Ramanai taruvai’ are a handful of pearls from this amazing opera. The famous ‘Enakkun irupadam’, set in ragamalika, covers the whole of the Ramayana in multiple charanams. In the trinity of Carnatic music, Tyagaraja’s name is, of course, synonymous with Rama bhakti, with numerous exquisite creations written to his favourite god. From the monumental Pancharatnams and the magnificent kritis to the gentle Divyanama kirtanas and the emotive Utsava Sampradaya kritis to the delightful operas, his entire repertoire is dedicated to Rama. Written like intimate conversations with his beloved god, they encompass a wide spectrum of sentiments and are expressed through beautiful music. Songs on kshetra Muthuswami Dikshitar dedicated kritis at each kshetra that he visited. His kritis are creative marvels that contain historical references to the kshetra , details about the temple, the deity and the paraphernalia associated with it, the traditions and festivities, esoteric references and more. Everything finds a perfect setting in the sahitya and the sangita of Muthuswami Dikshitar. His compositions dedicated to Rama showcase sheer grandeur. ‘Shri Ramam’ in raga Narayanagaula, ‘Ramachandram bhavayami’ in raga Vasanta and ‘Mamava Pattabhirama’ in raga Manirangu are classics. Among the other Dikshitar kritis on Rama, a few are in rare ragas such as Kokilaravam (‘Kodandaramam’), Mahuri (‘Mamava Raghuvira’) and Manji (‘Ramachandrena samrakshitoham’), Hindolavasantam (‘Santana Ramaswaminam’) and Ramakali (‘Rama Rama kali kalusha virama’). He also composed a few nottuswara sahityas such as ‘Rama Janardana’. The term ‘Rama’ is an integral part of the appellation of the rulers of erstwhile Tiruvitankur, more popular as Travancore. In the legacy of the Travancore royalty, Maharaja Swati Tirunal is renowned. A multi-faceted personality, the Maharaja has dedicated several compositions to Rama, the song ‘Bhavayami Raghuramam’ being one of the most famous. Originally set in Saveri, this composition, that covers all the kandas of the Ramayana , was reset to be a garland of seven ragas — Saveri, Natakurunji, Dhanyasi, Mohanam, Mukhari, Purvikalyani and Madhyamavati by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and made immortal by M.S. Subbulakshmi. Among the other kritis of Swati Tirunal on Rama, the kriti ‘Rama Rama Gunasima’ in raga Simhendramadhyamam that was popularised by Musiri Subramania Iyer, ‘Kalayami Raghuramam’ in ragam Begada that was popularised by G.N. Balasubramanian, ‘Jaya Jaya Raghurama’ in Sahana and ‘Rama Rama pahi’ in Devagandhari are known for their compositional and lyrical grandeur. The bhajan ‘Ramachandra prabhu’ is a beautiful piece in Sindhubhairavi. A varnam by Tenmadam Narasimhachari, ‘Rama nive’, in Karaharapriya, incorporates the entire Ramayana in a nutshell. This varnam was made popular by vidushis T. Brinda and T. Mukta. The post-trinity period abounded in wonderful compositions on Rama by a plethora of gifted composers. The most popular ones include Mysore Sadashiva Rao’s ‘Saketa nagaranatha’ (Harikamboji); Patnam Subramania Iyer’s ‘Abhimanennadu’ (Begada), ‘Dhanyudevvado’ (Malayamarutam), ‘Intakante’ (Kannada), ‘Raghuvamsa sudha’ (Kadanakuthuhalam); Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar's ‘Parama Pavana Rama’ (Purvikalyani ), ‘Nijamuga Rama’ (Kiravani), ‘Nikela nayeda’ (Devamanohari); Mysore Vasudevachar’s ‘Brochevarevarura’ (Khamas), ‘Ra ra Rajivalochana Rama’ (Mohanam), ‘Bhajare re manasa’ (Karnataka Devagandhari); Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar’s ‘Sharanagatavatsala’ (Karaharapriya ), ‘Nidu mahima’ (Hamsanandi), Vanamamalai Jeer’s ‘Dasharatha suta’ (Jhonpuri); Tiruppayanam Panchapakesa Sastri’s ‘Sapashyat kausalya’ (Jhonpuri); Koteeswara Iyer’s ‘Rama ravikulasoma’ (Bhairavi ); Papanasam Sivan's ‘Janakipate’ (Karaharapriya), ‘Swami sharanam (Ananda Bhairavi), ‘Sri raman ravikulasoman’ (Narayanagaula), ‘Ramanai bhajittal’ (Mand); Ambujam Krishna’s ‘Aravinda padamalar’ (Kapi), ‘Gati niye enru’ (Thodi) and Spencer Venugopal’s ‘Nivanti daivamu’ (Varali), ‘Ni dayaledani’(Dhanyasi) and more in a list that seems endless. The Carnatic tradition has innumerable compositions with Rama as muse. As Ramadasa says in his song, ‘Ramajogi mandu konare,’ it is the “ultimate panacea” . Or, to borrow Tyagaraja’s words, ‘Atyanta Brahmanandame’.  The writer is a well-known   Carnatic violinist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/songs-of-worship/article34553252.ece
14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Memories set in stone||He dreamt everything big and beautiful. Like the gigantic temples and sculptures that he created during his lifetime. He desired to live for 120 years, create “another Konark” in his home state Odisha and to be honoured with the Bharat Ratna for it. Famed sculptor Raghunath Mohapatra, sitting member of the Rajya Sabha; Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awardee and a recipient of the Shilpi Guru award from the central government, and the Dharmapada Puraskar, Odisha’s highest honour for art, passed away in Bhubaneswar on May 9 at the age of 78. Mohapatra was not a mere dreamer, he was a determined doer, whose incredible achievements speak volumes of his creativity, vision and confidence. Winning the National Award for sculpture at the young age of 21 helped him give shape to his imagination early on. One of his initial works, the six-feet-tall greystone statue of the Sun god, displayed at the Central Hall of Parliament, remains a bright spot in his creative journey. Another remarkable creation is the large lotus sculpted on a single black granite stone at former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s samadhi, Vir Bhumi, in Delhi. “Eminent sculptors from around the country were invited to present their proposal-models to the government. Sonia Gandhi had come personally to view the models. She asked me why I had thought of the lotus. I explained my concept of Rajivlochan (lotus-eyed), which she appreciated,” Mohapatra said in interviews. The majestic Mukteswar Gate in red sandstone at the popular Surajkund crafts-fair complex, near the national capital, and the three 20-feet-tall statues of Buddha in white sandstone at the monastery in Ladakh are the other signature pieces by the sculptor, whose Buddha statues have also found pride of place in Japan and France. Odisha boasts numerous creations of the legend, like the white sandstone Buddha statues atop the historic Dhauli hills near Bhubaneswar and the replica of the Konark horse at the Master Canteen square in the heart of the city, the most familiar landmark of Bhubaneswar. Not just sculptures, Raghunath Mohapatra conceptualised and designed more than a dozen temples in India and abroad. The Tara Tarini temple in Ganjam and the Jagannath temples at Remuna and Angul — all in Odisha — apart from temples in Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam . A primary school dropout, who sold stone idols to pilgrims in the streets of Puri, Raghunath was born into a traditional family of sculptors of the Pathuria Sahi (colony of stone-carvers). He grew up under the watchful eyes of his maternal grandfather and eminent sculptor, Aparti Mohapatra, whose family had a long association with the Jagannath temple of Puri. “My ancestors were the sculptors of the Jagannath temple in Puri and the Sun temple at Konark. Stone sculpting is a family legacy and I was naturally drawn towards it. My grandfather was my guru. I was quite scared of my teacher in school, who used to punish me since I was poor in studies. I was once beaten up so mercilessly by the teacher that I had blood stains. As soon as my grandfather discovered this, he decided that I should stop going to school and pursue the family craft,” Mohapatra once told me. Though he stopped going to school at age eight, his sculpting skills came to the fore. He was 16 when his talent was spotted by some officials of the State Handicrafts Department and he was offered the job of a trainer at the Handicraft Training and Designing Centre, Bhubaneswar. He rose to finally become the Centre superintendent. After spending more than 50 years of his career as a guru for more than 2,000 sculptors in Odisha, Mohapatra announced his long-cherished dream of building the Aditya Narayan (another name for the Sun god) temple near Puri eight years ago. It was billed to be another Konark. He bought 100 acres of land and started working on his mega project. “While 1,200 sculptors took 12 years to complete the Konark temple, my project will be complete in eight years and involve 600 sculptors and an investment of about Rs. 300 crore. The sprawling campus will have a research and development centre on Odisha’s temple architecture and a state-of-the-art training centre for sculptors,” he had said. The pandemic has claimed his life, but his art will live on through his many creations.  The Bhubaneswar-based journalist   writes on culture.   Not just sculptures, Raghunath Mohapatra conceptualised and designed more than a dozen temples in India and abroad||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/memories-set-in-stone/article34553228.ece

The disciple arrived with a large painting of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, a gift for the newly-weds. And Tyagaraja burst out singing ‘Nannu palimpa’ in Mohanam. This was the piece de resistance of J. A. Jayanth’s flute recital last Sunday for Naada Inbam, in memory of Andal Ananthanarayanan and V. Ananthanarayanan. Jayanth presented an aesthetic and elaborate interpretation, with the swaraprastara at the pallavi. In between, he played the long flute to create an ultra-tranquil ambience. Some of the swara phrases reminded one of Flute Mali. Little wonder, as his grandfather and guru, vidwan T.S. Sankaran was Mali’s disciple. On the violin, Sayee Rakshit, a student of V. Ramani, K.G. Rajesh and now, A. Kanyakumari, responded brilliantly. Earlier, Jayanth’s Mohanam alapana had a unique musical energy with silken phrases and eloquence. Sayee’s delicate essay of the raga added to the experience. N.C. Bharadwaj (mridangam) and ‘Ghatam’ Karthick presented a thani that sounded like a continuation of the kriti. If Bharadwaj rose to the occasion with a wholesome vinyasa where the intricate tisra nadai was remarkably creative, Karthick’s characteristic joyous approach enriched the concert. Jayanth presented two more Tyagaraja compositions — the Arabhi Pancharatna kriti, ‘Sadinchane’ and ‘Kamalapthakula’ in Brindavana Saranga . The latter was preceded by a short sketch of the raga. The saint-poet of Thiruvaiyaru says, ‘Rama is like a moon emerging from the ocean of the Sun dynasty’. The kalpanaswaras at pallavi summed up the emotion and appeal of the composition. Jayanth and Sayee together created a few brilliant moments in the recital, which had an energetic start with the Hamsadhwani varnam, ‘Jalajaksha’, followed by ‘Yedhaiya gathi,’ the Chalanattai kriti by Koteeswara Iyer, with swarams at the pallavi. Exhaustive swaraprastara Jayanth offered an extensive yet contemplative alapana in Subhapantuvarali. I would rate it as one of the best elucidations of the raga that I have heard in recent times, with passages of relative calm slowly giving way to pulsating phrases. It appealed to both the ear and the soul. Dikshitar’s ‘Sree Satyanarayanam’ in Rupakam offered scope to explore the potential of the rather pensive tune — although in Hindustani music, Subhapantuvarali is often played to usher in a festive spirit. The exhaustive swaraprastara helped to create an ebullient spirit, especially when he played the long flute. Purandaradasa’s ‘Venkatachala nilayam’ in Sindhubhairavi evoked an air of devotion. Perhaps inspired by his own playing of the raga, Jayanth rendered an allied Hindustani raag Bhairavi. ‘Jo bhaje hari ko sada, sohi parama pada paavega,’ Brahmanand’s bhajan popularised by Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, was presented in a simple manner. His flute conveyed well the essence of the verse, ‘One who always thinks of god will alone attain the feet of the god’. Narayana Tirtha’s Tarangam, ‘Govindamiha gopika nanda kandam’ (Khanda Chapu) in Bageshri, again with a predominantly Hindustani flavour, instantly brought forth the bhakti and karuna rasas. Jayanth wound up the recital with a Thiruppugazh in Hamsanandi. A word about the tambura artiste will not be out of place. In these days of all-pervasive electronic tamburas, it was a delight to see Purva Dhanasree on the instrument.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Tyagaraja’s opera and the French connect||In 2001, French impresario Christian Ledoux and his wife Miriam landed up at our house. After listening to my daughter Shubasree’s singing in a concert, they had decided that they wanted her to play the role of the main gopika (friend of Krishna) in Tyagaraja’s opera Nauka Charitram (Story of the boat). They also wanted my husband [Trichur Ramachandran] and me to participate, along with an impressive group of accompanists. We were delighted to accept. Christian and Miriam headed Diva Musiques de Mondes, an arts organisation in Paris, and were very keen to promote Carnatic and Hindustani music in Europe. They regularly organised shows at all major cultural centres in France, including the Théâtre de la Ville, a grand old-style theatre (near the famous Moulin Rouge) where art performances from across the world were staged. We were amazed by the duo’s knowledge of Tyagaraja’s works. We have often heard Christian hum a kriti and Miriam explain the meaning of some of the words in the song. They knew about most Indian classical musicians and regularly attended the December Music Festival in Chennai and annual music concerts in Kolkata and Kashi. Painting the story As I spoke to Miriam about developing the idea for the opera, I suggested using old miniature paintings of Krishna with the gopis, of the Yamuna river, and of scenes depicting Krishna travelling by boat. Miriam instantly agreed and I began sourcing appropriate photographs of paintings for each scene from my large collection of art books. Both of us felt that for the European audience to understand the story, we should have translations in French appearing on the side screens. The opera describes Krishna’s journey by boat on the Yamuna with the gopikas. Angry with their vanity and arrogance, Krishna creates a storm and a huge hole appears in the boat. The petrified gopis scream for help, but Krishna playfully asks them to seal the hole with their clothes. The gopis realise their folly and seek forgiveness. Krishna, happy to have taught them a lesson, rescues them. In 2002, before the performance, the Ledouxs released the recording of Nauka Charitam’s songs in the European market, which were sung by Trichur Ramachandran (who played the roles of Krishna and the narrator), Shubasree (main gopika), Lakshmi Rangarajan and me (other gopikas). The opera premièred at Sivagami Pethachi Hall in Chennai.  I created a huge golden-hued boat for the backdrop.  I also provided the background score and notations, while the eclectic orchestra included Prapancham Balachandran on the flute, Mudicondan Ramesh on the veena, Kallidai Sivakumar on the mridangam, K. Sivaraman on the violin, and Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam. When we landed at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, Tyagaraja’s Thodi kriti ‘Dasarathee’ came to my mind. In the kriti, the saint-poet sings of how Rama makes his songs popular in doora desa (far away lands). How true. Miriam told me how much she loved the last song ‘Gandhamu puyyaruga’ in Punnagavarali in the opera. Sadly, in April this year, Ladduji (our nickname for Christian Ledoux) passed away. I will always remember him for making the Nauka Charitram performance  tour an integral part of my life and art.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||The composer with a multi-faceted oeuvre||“The Brahma-rakshasa needs more lines!” “The chorus can’t drown out the High Priest!” “The duet works, now shorten the moonlight aria!” For six years, between 2003 and 2009, enigmatic communications like these would fly across Mumbai — by phone, by fax, and by courier — between Vanraj Bhatia’s studio and mine. During those years, I worked closely with the legendary composer and music director on an opera, Agni Varsha (‘The Fire and the Rain’), based on Girish Karnad’s play, which the playwright had translated into English from his original Kannada. While I developed the libretto, Vanraj composed the music. In the process, I spent many delightful — and sometimes exasperating — hours with the maestro, listening as he played passages from our evolving work on the piano, imbibing a series of masterclasses on tempo, orchestration, polyphony, and the seemingly impossible project of creating an opera entirely through a choreography of Hindustani ragas. Trained in Western classical music at its wellsprings and also in Hindustani classical music, Vanraj Bhatia (1927-2021) was that rare figure — a composer whose transcultural experiments were always intense and persuasive, never perfunctory. Constantly experimental, curious about how musical systems could come together in convergence or counterpoint, he always sought out fresh challenges of scale. Whether it was an advertising jingle, a tune or score for a film, or a formal composition, Vanraj brought the same degree of artistic engagement to the occasion, resulting in a vivid and memorable body of work. His vibrant tune for ‘Mero gaam katha parey’, the signature song of Shyam Benegal’s 1976 film, Manthan , sounds as fresh and vital as it did when we first heard it, 45 years ago. His magnificent opening music for Shridhar Kshirsagar’s Khandaan (1985), India’s first TV series, still commands attention. His sonorous score for Benegal’s TV series, Bharat Ek Khoj (1988-89), inspired by Vedic chanting, remains compelling, decades after the series was first screened on Doordarshan. As does his brooding, ominous score for Govind Nihalani’s 1988 Doordarshan mini-series based on Bhisham Shahani’s Partition novel, Tamas . Training in music Born to a Kutchi business family, Vanraj studied at Mumbai’s New Era School and learned Hindustani classical music with Professor B. R. Deodhar, whose pedagogy marked a break with the gharana system and introduced students to a spectrum of styles. As a teenager, he became captivated by Western classical music and eventually — after having studied Sanskrit and English literature at Elphinstone College — convinced his father that this was his true métier. He spent the 1950s in London, where he studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music, and in Paris, where he studied with the legendary French-Russian conductor and composer Nadia Boulanger at the Conservatoire de Paris. He would look back fondly at his five years in Paris, crediting Boulanger with having pushed him to master the balance between discipline and epiphany. To place Vanraj in his proper milieu, let us remember that the honour roll of Boulanger’s students includes, among many grand figures, the composers Igor Markevitch, Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland and Philip Glass; and the conductors Daniel Barenboim and John Eliot Gardiner. I have often felt that Vanraj did not receive the full acknowledgement that he deserved for his extraordinary, multi-faceted oeuvre. Awards certainly came his way. These included stellar tokens of recognition such as the Rockefeller Foundation grant and the Lili Boulanger Memorial Award, which sustained him as a student in Europe, as well as the National Film Award for Best Music Direction in 1988 for Tamas , and, in 2012, the Padma Shri. But his practice always remained beset by the question of context. To votaries of Hindustani music, he was an interloper from the world of Bach and Beethoven. Devotees of Western classical music were puzzled by his interest in the raga world-view. Was he a pure musician, or was he a man of the market, with his nearly 7,000 advertising jingles and his music for movies and television? Such questions were more important to people who wanted to fit him neatly into a box than to him, but their persistence certainly got under his skin. He struck back with solo piano compositions like Toccata No:1 in Raag Bahar and the Agni Varsha Rhapsody, the solo flute nocturne, Sangeet Raat, and the heart-stopping choral compositions, Rudranaam, Vaasansi Jeernani, and Six Seasons. As an independent practitioner, he negotiated a difficult intermediate terrain between the pursuit of his own music and the work that he did as a cultural entrepreneur who did not have the security of a conservatory or academy to fall back on. The only academic position he ever held was a chair in Western musicology at the University of Delhi (1960-1965). Established by the Rockefeller Foundation, the chair did no one any good. Vanraj always said that, as a practitioner, he hated teaching music theory; and the university cordially detested Western classical music. As he told the musicologist Greg Booth in a 2017 interview, “They were very glad to get rid of me.” Consider, also, how solitary his career was for much of his life. Apart from the Paranjoti Academy Chorus, directed and conducted since 1967 by the formidable Coomi Wadia, and the relatively recently established (2006) Symphony Orchestra of India at the NCPA, there was very little by way of infrastructure for Western classical music in Bombay, Bhatia’s home city and operational base. Formidable range Between the 1970s and the 1990s, Vanraj produced the music with which the popular audience most readily associates him — the score for Shyam Benegal’s iconic films, Ankur (1974), Manthan (1976), Bhumika (1977), Junoon (1978), Kalyug (1981), Mandi (1983), Trikal (1985) and Sardari Begum (1996). He also worked with other directors in India’s parallel and art-house cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Aparna Sen ( 36 Chowringhee Lane , 1981), Kundan Shah ( Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron , 1983), Saeed Mirza ( Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! 1984), Kumar Shahani ( Tarang , 1984), Vijaya Mehta ( Pestonjee , 1987), Pervez Merwanji ( Percy , 1989), and Arun Khopkar ( Katha Doan Ganpatraoanchi , 1996). Less well known is the music he composed for theatre. He conceived the music for Ebrahim Alkazi’s productions of Tughlaq (1972) and Andha Yug (1974), and for the Brecht productions on which Alkazi collaborated with Fritz Bennewitz, Teen Takke ka Swang (‘The Three-Penny Opera’, 1970) and The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1972). In years to come, as archivists, scholars and lovers of music embrace the expansive arc of his oeuvre, we will celebrate Vanraj Bhatia as the highly original and trail-blazing creative intelligence he was.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||As graceful as her music||On a December afternoon in 1994, I attended a concert at Narada Gana Sabha in Chennai. As I walked past the mini hall, I could hear a strong voice aligned clearly to the tara sthayi shadjam. I entered the hall and sat on a chair in the first few rows. And for the next two hours, I was soaked in pure classical music — unhurried, authentic and divine. I saw my guru for the first time that day. She was wearing a beautiful magenta silk sari and her face appeared calm. That minute I decided that I should become her disciple. When my parents approached her, she readily agreed to train me. Thus started a three decade long musical journey with my guru Prema Hariharan, one of the finest Carnatic musicians of her time. Groomed by stalwarts Guru Prema hailed from a family of music connoisseurs. Her first guru was Akhila Natesan and she would often proudly show the note books in which “Akhila teacher” had written down compositions. Subsequently, she learnt from stalwarts like Pattamadai Sundaram, Trivandrum R.S. Mani, Maharajapuram Santhanam (she was his first disciple), and Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman. Prema Hariharan cherished her lifelong friendship with the excellent musician and musicologist Sulochana Pattabhiraman, who was like a mentor to her. My guru strictly adhered to patantharam . She would patiently explain the meaning of a kriti before teaching. She was very particular about the correct pronunciation of words and not compromising with the bhava of a kriti. When teaching a song, she would often narrate incidents from the lives of the composer, which would make the students understand the context clearly. She would point out the usage of swaras typical to that raga that could convey the bhava best. She stressed on the importance of the correct splitting of words in the song to avoid ‘padachedam’. While handling ragas, she would speak also about the allied ragas. The many opportunities I had to offer vocal support to her have enriched my musical journey.  Guru Prema’s home was open for all her students. We could walk into her kitchen freely and get something to eat. She treated us like she would her children. In her, we found both a guru and mother. Adhering to tradition but yet gracefully moving with the times and embracing technology with ease, Prema Hariharan will always be remembered for her grace and pure music.

14 May 2021||May 14 2021 00:00 IST,||A dedicated guru and guide||I have had a long association with Pasumarthy Kesava Prasad. In fact, he was instrumental in making possible my first visit to Kuchipudi village, which made a huge difference to my dance career. This village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh was gifted to the Kuchipudi Bhagavata families several centuries ago in recognition and appreciation of their art. Since then, the families here took up the dance form as a profession, practised it with utmost dedication, and propagated it. Sadly, the number of gurus and dancers is dwindling. Nevertheless, some of them have kept the tradition going, despite the many challenges they face. One such personality, who remained dedicated to the art form till his last days, was Kesava Prasad, son of Pasumarthy Subramanya Sastry. As a dancer, teacher and choreographer, I feel extremely grateful that he introduced me to some of the finest gurus such as Vedantam Parvateesam, Vedantam Rattaya Sarma, Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma, P.V.G. Krishna Sarma, Chinta Ramanadham and Vedantam Radheshyam. I trained briefly under Pasumarthy Rattayya Sarma. At that time, Kesava Prasad arranged for my stay in the village and ensured I was served home-cooked meals. He would go to any length to support dancers. During my stay at the village, I had the opportunity to discuss various issues pertaining to art with him. He was keen to make Kuchipudi a heritage village, and to facilitate access to the outside world, especially artistes. He set up a private library that had an interesting and wide collection of books, talapatras, journals, photographs and newspaper articles. In 2017, I took my daughter and disciple Prateeksha to meet him for her MA dissertation. While most of the gurus of those times spoke only Telugu, Kesava Prasad was probably the only one who could converse in English and that helped artistes from elsewhere to know more about the village and the art form. In 1983, he established the Akhila Bharata Kuchipudi Natya Kalamandali and organised several dance festivals, inviting classical dancers from across the world to perform in Kuchipudi. I was fortunate to be one of them. The village landscape, the divine ambience, the simplicity of the residents has had a great impact on me as a dancer. The village is built around the temple of Ramalingeswara and Bala Tripurasundari, and the goddess is the presiding deity of the village. It is customary to recite the hymn ‘Amba Paraaku’ before every Kuchipudi performance.

14 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kalra’s oxygen concentrators were substandard, says report||It has now emerged that besides being exorbitantly priced, the oxygen concentrators supplied by Navneet Kalra were of no use for COVID-19 patients and could have instead been counter-predictive, said Delhi Police citing medical experts on Thursday. Mr. Kalra has been evading arrest after the Delhi police raided his restaurants in Lodhi Colony and Khan Market and recovered more than 500 oxygen concentrators. He has been accused of hoarding, black-marketing and selling the medical equipment at exorbitant rates. A senior police officer said that they had seized a total 524 oxygen concentrators during the raids at Mr. Kalra’s restaurants and Matrix Cellular’s warehouse in Chhattarpur. “The Delhi police had sent two different models of the seized concentrators for testing at Shriram Institute for Industrial Research. The report found that an average output in terms of oxygen purity is found to be 32.7% and 38.2% respectively in a 9-litre and 7-litre model. The testing was carried out in the laboratory room air and the oxygen concentration was found to be merely 20.8%,” said the officer. He said that the report has been submitted in the court. “The experts said that these oxygen concentrators are unfit for COVID-19 patients. A medical equipment that produces less than 90% oxygen is useless in case of COVID-19,” said the officer. WhatsApp chats He said that they have accessed WhatsApp chats of a group created by Mr. Kalra to sell oxygen concentrators. They found that people who have purchased these oxygen concentrators from Mr. Kalra have raised concern over the quality and wanted to return it. “Oxygen concentration is of very poor quality with only 45% oxygen in a 7-litre cylinder. It is insufficient for a patient. The machine which you are offering is of no use,” one of the buyers raised a complaint in the WhatsApp group. If during investigation it is found that any COVID-19 patient faced any adverse effects due to these substandard oxygen concentrators, then Mr. Kalra will face more stringent charges for putting a patient’s life at risk. The police said that Chinese oxygen concentrators were purchased for Rs. 12,500 and Rs. 20,669 and sold for Rs. 70,000 and above per piece. Buyers used to queue up outside Khan Chacha restaurant in Khan Market to purchase them.  The experts said that these oxygen concentrators are unfit for COVID-19 patients.

14 May 2021||JAIPUR,||Global tenders may speed up vaccination drive in Rajasthan||After the decision to float global tenders for procuring COVID-19 vaccines from foreign countries, Rajasthan expects to speed up inoculations for those in the age group of 18 to 44 years. The State government decided to issue an expression of interest (EOI) through the National Health Mission as a nodal agency for purchasing one crore doses. CM tweets  Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Thursday as many as 11 States had so far floated global tenders, which would result in the procurement of vaccines at different prices for each of them. The States were forced to purchase vaccines from international manufacturers because of the inadequate supply of vaccine shots, he said. “It would have been better if the Union government had taken out the global tender and distributed the vaccines to the States in a planned manner... We can protect ourselves against the third wave of pandemic only through complete vaccination,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. The decision to import vaccines was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, held through videoconferencing, in which a serious concern was expressed over the fast-spreading infection and the shortage of vaccine shots. The Council of Ministers also approved direct purchase of virus treatment drugs and equipment from the companies. Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the vaccination camps at several places had to be closed because of the paucity of doses, while 20 lakh doses were urgently required for the continuation of inoculations. A proposal for relaxing the financial processes for transportation of liquid medical oxygen for the survival of affected people was also approved at the meeting. The Council of Ministers decided that the Ministers-in-charge would visit the districts regularly to provide relief to the people. It was informed at the meeting that a work order had been issued by the Urban Development Department to set up 105 oxygen plants in 62 urban body areas. Meanwhile, BJP State president Satish Poonia said on Thursday the State was trying to hide its shortcomings on the front of COVID-19 management by blaming the Centre. He said though the Centre was supplying all essential items for treatment of patients, the Congress leaders were making “false statements” and weakening people’s morale.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/global-tenders-may-speed-up-vaccination-drive-in-rajasthan/article34553579.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC: legal aid lawyers, judicial officers need to be vaccinated||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked if legal aid lawyers and judicial officers in the 18-44 age bracket, working to implement Supreme Court orders to decongest prisons due to the pandemic, can walk in for vaccination shots at the centres set up in district courts. “You cannot send someone to war without a gun,” Justice Navin Chawla remarked, adding legal aid lawyers and judicial officers also needed to be protected against the virus. The High Court’s query to the Centre and Delhi government came while hearing a plea by the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA), represented by advocate Ajay Verma, seeking directions to urgently vaccinate judicial officers and legal aid lawyers at the vaccination centres set up in district courts. The Central government said there was no separate classification of lawyers as front-line workers for priority in vaccination. It said the issue of vaccinating the legal aid lawyers was a pan-India concern. Centre’s call Delhi government said lawyers and judicial officers of 45 years or above can walk-in for vaccination at the centres in the district courts, but that was not the case with regard to the 18-44 age group. The Delhi government said it does not have the discretion to allow walk-in of the 18-44 age group and a decision regarding it has to be taken by the Centre. The High Court had earlier asked DSLSA to prepare a list of the legal aid lawyers and judicial officers who would need the vaccination, so that the same can be shared with the Centre and Delhi government for their consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-legal-aid-lawyers-judicial-officers-need-to-be-vaccinated/article34553581.ece
14 May 2021||New Delhi,||Anticipatory bail plea of ‘Khan Chacha’ owner Kalra dismissed||A Delhi court on Thursday refused to grant anticipatory bail to businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators, required by COVID-19 patients, from his upscale restaurants including ‘Khan Chacha’ in the national capital. “Application is dismissed,” Additional Session Judge Sandeep Garg said. Fear of arrest  Fearing arrest, the businessman had moved the court earlier this week to seek bail in the case. During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Mr. Kalra and it is suspected that he has left Delhi along with his family. These concentrators are crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 management. On Wednesday, the court had reserved the order on the pre-arrest bail after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and defense at length. During the proceedings, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had opposed the plea and told the court that Mr. Kalra’s custodial interrogation is required and that bail should not be granted as he is an influential person. “His intention was to cheat the public at large and wrongfully gain. Had Delhi Police not busted the racket, many people would have been cheated,” he said. The prosecutor had also apprised the court about a lab report which showed that the seized oxygen concentrators are not working, have poor quality and their working capacity is only 20.8%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/anticipatory-bail-plea-of-khan-chacha-owner-kalra-dismissed/article34553590.ece

For those falling in the 18-44 age group, she said, Delhi had eight days’ stock of Covishield doses available. Over 41 lakh doses had been administered in the city so far and 74,448 people having been vaccinated in Delhi on Wednesday, she said. “Delhi currently has three days of Covaxin and two days of Covishield stock for those above 45 years of age, healthcare and front-line workers. We request the government to make more doses available for this category,” she said. 40.29 lakh utilised The Capital, Ms. Atishi said, had so far got 43.20 lakh doses for 45-plus citizens, healthcare and front-line workers of which 40.29 lakh had been utilised. Delhi had received 8.17 lakh doses of vaccine doses for the 18-44 category of which 4.27 lakh had been utilised and the remaining doses, primarily Covishield, could last up to eight days, Ms. Atishi said. This, she said, even as the city had already run out of Covaxin stock for the 18+ category and most of the centres administering the Bharat Biotech-manufactured vaccine had been temporarily shut till further orders. “Dispensaries conduct routine immunisation of children on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Residents worried The residents of the Capital, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor stated, had bravely faced the first and second waves of the pandemic but were now “extremely worried” about the fate of their families during the next wave. “The people of Delhi have lost faith in the Arvind Kejriwal government’s capability to fight COVID-19’s third wave as it has totally failed them during the ongoing second wave. It knew from September 2020 that a strong wave will strike the country in the first quarter of 2021 but did little to make preparations to fight it,” Mr. Kapoor alleged. “I quote Delhi’s ruling party’s senior most MLA Shoaib Iqbal who recently said that the Delhi’s health infrastructure has collapsed and we can’t anymore leave the situation in the hands of the Kejriwal government and Delhi be put under President’s Rule to take care of health services,” he wrote. Mr. Kapoor requested the L-G, as administrator of Delhi and as DDMA chief to take over all public and private health services and ensure that hospitals and doctors are prepared for paediatric treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-wants-l-g-to-take-over-health-administration-before-third-wave/article34553584.ece
