Paul has said the States had coerced the Centre into expanding the availability of vaccines, despite being aware of being inadequately prepared. Dr. Paul, Chairman, National Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration, in a press statement on Thursday, said vaccine supply, which was managed by the Centre from January-April, was “well administered” but was not up to the mark in May. The Centre did all the “heavy-lifting”, which included funding vaccine manufacturers, accelerating approvals, ramping up production and bringing foreign vaccines to India. “The vaccine procured by the Centre is supplied wholly to the States for free administration to people. All this is very much in the knowledge of the States. The Government of India has merely enabled the States to try procuring vaccines on their own, on their explicit requests. The States very well knew the production capacity in the country and what the difficulties are in procuring vaccines directly from abroad,” stated his note, which was released by the Press Information Bureau in the form of a ‘Myths Vs Facts’ questionnaire. ‘Not easy at short notice’ “States, who had not even achieved good coverage of healthcare workers and frontline workers in three months, wanted to open up the process of vaccination and wanted more decentralisation. Health is a State subject & the liberalised vaccine policy was a result of the incessant requests to give States more power. The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirm what we have been telling the States from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” the note said. Since May, vaccinations were opened up to everyone aged over 18, and the States, as well as private hospitals, were allowed to procure half the vaccines cleared by the Central Research Laboratory, Kasauli. While total weekly doses averaged a high of 2.5 crore in the first weeks of April, they had steadily fallen to 1.2 crore a week from the first week of May and down to 87 lakh in the week May 22-28, according to data from Co-Win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-responsible-for-vaccine-shortfall-says-govt-adviser/article34662603.ece
28 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Notify coastal erosion as disaster: CM||The State government has urged the Centre to notify coastal erosion as a disaster eligible for assistance from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a favourable decision on this issue as coastal erosion poses a major threat in the nine coastal districts of Kerala. As the Centre has not included coastal erosion on the list of notified disasters, the State is unable to provide adequate assistance to the affected people, Mr. Vijayan noted. Kerala had notified coastal erosion as a State-specific disaster in 2015. “'The Government of India has permitted to use 10% of annual SDRF/NDRF allocation for relief assistance to State-specific disasters. Based on the above, the Government of Kerala declared coastal erosion as one of the State-specific disasters as per G.O.(Ms) No.343/2015/DMD dated July 23, 2015. The Government of India has not declared ‘coastal erosion’ as a notified disaster. Hence the State government cannot utilise the entire SDRF/NDRF for giving assistance to the damage caused due to coastal erosion,” Mr. Vijayan said in the letter. The State had experienced severe coastal erosion under the influence of the recent Cyclone Tauktae, which brought heavy winds and rain to the State, the Chief Minister noted. Mr. Vijayan also urged the Prime Minister to double the relief assistance from the State Disaster Risk Management Fund and the National Disaster Risk Management Fund while framing the new norms based on the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/notify-coastal-erosion-as-disaster-cm/article34662771.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Twitter defaming India, defying laws, says govt.||With microblogging platform Twitter on Thursday expressing concerns over “intimidation tactics” by the Delhi Police and “potential threat to freedom of expression” in India, the government hit back, calling the statement baseless, false and an attempt to defame India to hide their [Twitter’s] own follies. This follows a similar tiff between the government and messaging app WhatsApp on Wednesday after the latter filed a legal challenge to India’s new IT guidelines. The U.S.-headquartered firm expressed concerns over “recent events regarding its employees in India” and said it plans to advocate changes in core elements of the new IT Rules that inhibit free and open public conversation. It, however, added that it will strive to comply with the revised IT laws in India, but sought a minimum of three-month extension of the compliance window. In response, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) said, “The government strongly controverts the claims made by Twitter... India has a glorious tradition of free speech and democratic practices dating back centuries. Protecting free speech in India is the commitment of the world’s largest democracy and its robust institutions.” The Ministry added that the allegation of use of “intimidation tactics” by the police are “completely baseless”. The Ministry said that through its actions and deliberate defiance, Twitter seeks to undermine India’s legal system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/twitter-defaming-india-defying-laws-says-govt/article34662606.ece

28 May 2021||TIRUPATI,||‘Tirumala is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman’||Amid claims and counterclaims on the place of birth of Lord Hanuman, the Pundit Committee constituted by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has unequivocally stated that Tirumala is his birthplace. National Sanskrit University (NSU) Vice-Chancellor V. Muralidhara Sharma, who heads the Pundit Parishat, refuted the claims made by Sri Govindananda Saraswati Swami, founder of Sri Hanumad Janmabhoomi Theertha Kshetra Trust, Hampi, that Anjaneya was born at Anjanahalli on the banks of river Pampa near Hampi in Karnataka. Dr. Sharma said the swamiji could not prove his point beyond doubt with solid evidence, while the Parishat had cited Puranas and epic evidences to buttress its claim. Three-hour debate The Parishat members had a three-hour debate with Sri Govindananda Saraswati on the NSU campus here on Thursday, where the latter was challenged with material evidence drawn from scriptures. The seer was also requested not to belittle the TTD’s endeavour as had been done by him in the past through mails and posts. Spirited debate The spirited debate ended with the moderator Kuppa Viswanatha Sharma declaring the findings of the TTD’s Pundit Parishat as ‘concrete’ and that the arguments of the Hampi seer lacked substance and not backed by proper evidence. The committee’s members Acharya Ramakrishna, Acharya Shankara Narayana, Acharya Rani Sadasiva Murty and convener Akella Vibhishana Sharma were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/scholars-declare-tirumala-as-birthplace-of-lord-hanuman/article34662562.ece
28 May 2021||Pune,||Despite fewer cases, Maharashtra to extend curbs||The Maharashtra government may consider easing some curbs, though the current lockdown-like restrictions are likely to remain in force after May 31, said Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday after a meeting of the Cabinet. A final decision, he said, would be taken by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after talks with the COVID-19 task force members and the Health Department. In other decisions, the Cabinet decided to grant financial aid to those affected by Cyclone Tauktae at rates higher than that prescribed by the Centre. The State will bear the additional financial burden, it was announced. Prohibition revoked The Cabinet also revoked prohibition of alcohol announced in Chandrapur district by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. The excise department said that the committee under former Principal Secretary Ramanath Jha had reported “complete failure” of prohibition here. Former CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said the move was unfortunate and addied this decision during a pandemic shows the government’s priorities. On lifting of restrictions, Mr. Tope said though the active case tally had reduced by 50% over the last month, the positivity rate was high in 21 districts. “A significant reduction in some districts has been offset by a spike in other districts …so, while there is discussion regarding easing restrictions in some parts, the general lockdown will remain in force,” he said. A 14-member task force has been set up under noted paediatrcian Dr. Suhas Prabhu in anticipation of a third wave which is speculated to affect more children, Mr. Tope said. Giving details of compensation for those affected by Cyclone Tauktae, the government said those whose houses were fully or partially damaged would get Rs. 1.50 lakh for total damage and Rs. 50,000 for 50% damage.

The State halted its vaccination exercise on Thursday in the absence of sufficient number of doses. The global expression of interest issued by the Rajasthan government for procurement did not yield the desired results, as bidders sought higher rates. Nine parties, including those claiming to be authorised agents of AstraZeneca and Sputnik, had sent their quotes. Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the global tenders would not help the States much as they could not check the manufacturers’ credentials. “This task can be accomplished by the External Affairs Ministry through the Ambassadors posted in different countries. Ideally, it is the Centre which should float the tenders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajasthan-may-move-sc-for-global-tenders-by-centre/article34663031.ece

28 May 2021||New Delhi,||Student narrates ‘horrors’ of stay at isolation centre||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the city government to treat as representation a plea by a JNU student who had a “horrifying experience at the Sultanpuri Government Isolation Centre” for COVID patients. Madhurima Kundu, a PhD scholar at JNU, said during her four-day stay at the quarantine facility she saw patients suffering severely not only on account of their illness but also due to the negligence of the government authorities in providing them with basic facilities such as sanitation, food, medicines, clean mattresses and blankets, regular doctor visits and proper monitoring of oxygen among others. The Sultanpuri centre is predominantly occupied by patients from the working class from nearby areas and students who were sent there by JNU. ‘No sanitisation’ The petition, filed through advocate Kawalpreet Kaur, stated that the toilets and washrooms at the facility were overflowing with urine and not being cleaned. The bed sheets and blankets, used by earlier patients, were redistributed without washing and sanitisation. The rooms allotted to new patients were not sanitised or cleaned after the previous patient left. There was no light in her washroom and it was fixed only after her repeated requests. Ms. Kundu highlighted that there was no system of calling doctors or nurses at the centre. Patients were required to go down to the reception for every basic thing despite suffering from high fever and severe weakness. “The patients were left on their own to do everything,” she said. On May 3, Ms. Kundu had high fever at night but no doctor was available to attend to her. A fellow patient somehow found a doctor and requested him to examine her. When she requested the doctor to monitor her oxygen levels, the doctor flatly refused and asked her to “take paracetamol” in case of fever. She said many patients who are too unwell to go downstairs are left unattended, without any supervision. “Most of the time, the patients have to wait in a line, sometimes even for an hour in the scorching sun, to obtain basic medicines given by the centre,” she said. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the Delhi government to take her plea as representation and act on it in as early as possible, in accordance with law. The petition has sought orders for doctor visits to patients’ rooms thrice a day. It has also asked for directions to ensure that the facility provides a clean and hygienic environment by sanitising the premises on a daily basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/student-narrates-horrors-of-stay-at-isolation-centre/article34663030.ece

28 May 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata, PM to discuss damage caused by Cyclone Yaas today||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to discuss the impact of Cyclone Yaas that swept past the coastal regions of the State and Odisha on Wednesday. Ms. Banerjee told presspersons on Thursday that she would meet Mr. Modi at the Kalaikunda Air Base in Paschim Mednipur district. “Mr. Modi is coming from Odisha after visiting the cyclone-affected regions and after visiting Digha, he will be coming to Kalaikunda, where we will have a short meeting,” she said at the State Secretariat. This would be the first meeting between the two after Ms. Banerjee was elected the Chief Minister for the third time earlier this month. Ms. Banerjee is set to visit the cyclone-affected areas of Sandeshkhali and Sagar on Friday before meeting Mr. Modi. The Chief Minister also said the State suffered damages amounting to Rs. 15,000 crore due to Yaas.

28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Twitter is refusing to cooperate: Delhi Police||Responding to Twitter’s statement, Delhi Police on Thursday said the micro-blogging website is neither police nor judiciary and that it was refusing to cooperate with the law enforcement agency. “Twitter Inc. is purporting to be both an investigating authority as well as an adjudicating judicial authority. It has no legal sanction to be either. The only legal entity, so empowered by the duly laid-down law, to investigate is the police and to adjudicate is the Courts,” said Delhi Police spokesperson. Terming the statement issued by Twitter “mendacious”, the police said Twitter was trying to “adjudicate the truth”. The police said the website claims to have material information basis “which it not only ‘investigated’ but arrived at a ‘conclusion’” and it must share that information with the law enforcement agency. The police said they had registered a preliminary inquiry based on a complaint by the representative of the Indian National Congress. “Hence, the efforts by Twitter Inc. that portray that this is an FIR filed at the behest of the Government of India is wholly and completely incorrect,” the statement read. “Twitter Inc., while placing the cart before the horse, went ahead and declared that the toolkit was ‘Manipulated Media’. This clearly demonstrates that Twitter Inc. was acquainted with the facts of the case and it had material information which was germane to the inquiry by a duly recognised law enforcement agency,” they said. When served a notice to bring relevant material on record, the police said, “Twitter India’s subsidiary TCIPL’s Managing Director chose to adopt a path of evasiveness” and said he was “merely a sales head, had no role whatsoever in any operations relating to content and thereby refused to join the inquiry”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/twitter-is-refusing-to-cooperate-delhi-police/article34662520.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pfizer vaccine supply may start in July||NITI Aayog Member (Health) V.K. Paul said on Thursday that the Centre was in talks with various vaccine manufacturers and that Pfizer may start supply by July. He confirmed that the Pfizer had asked for vaccine indemnity. “A decision on this will be taken keeping in mind the larger good of the people,” Dr. Paul said at a Union Health ministry press conference on Thursday. When asked about the alleged mix-up of vaccination (first and second doses of vaccine were of different companies) to at least 20 persons in Uttar Pradesh, he said, “There is nothing to be alarmed about. While this isn’t advisable and we urge medical staff to be careful while administering the vaccines, there is no cause for worry. The matter, however, needs to be investigated.’’ Dr. Paul said that there was no need for people to do antibody testing after the completion of COVID-19 vaccination. “The advisable procedure to follow is to get vaccinated and adhere to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour,” he said. Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said the country was registering a decline in new cases for the past 20 days. Twenty-four States have registered a decline in active cases and overall recoveries were exceeding daily cases. “A total of 20.26 crore vaccination doses have been given so far,” he said. The Health Ministry on Thursday said all citizens who are 60 years and over with no vaccination or first dose, along with all citizens below 60 years with disabilities, are eligible for vaccination at Near to Home COVID Vaccination Centres (NHCVC). “NHCVC for the elderly and differently-abled citizens would follow a community-based, flexible and people-centric approach, bringing the COVID vaccination centres nearer to homes,” the Ministry stated. Sessions could be conducted in non-health facility based settings nearer to home, such as a community centre, resident welfare association centre/office, panchayat ghar, school buildings and homes for the aged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pfizer-vaccine-supply-may-start-in-july/article34662538.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC had cautioned govt. on privacy||A 2019 Supreme Court order used by the government to justify its new Information Technology (IT) Rules, which compel encrypted social media messaging platforms to disclose their users’ identity, also cautions the Centre from doing anything which amounts to invasion of individual privacy. On September 24, 2019, hearing a petition filed by Facebook, the top court showed deep concern at the utilisation of social media for committing crime. It said the medium had become a source for pornography. Paedophiles used social media in a “big way”. Criminals exploited it to run weapons, drugs and contraband. Hate and violence were shared and spread through these virtual platforms. The court had even felt that some messages on social media may even threaten national sovereignty. It was in this context the court had called for a “properly framed regime” to allow the government to get information about first originators of messages from “significant” social media intermediaries with end-to-end encryption technology. The court had exercised restraint, too. It warned that de-encryption, “if easily available, could defeat the fundamental right to privacy”. The court had clarified that the government should “ensure that the privacy of the individual is not invaded”. The order had also underlined that traceability should be restricted to “specific circumstances”. But WhatsApp finds traceability under the new rules “disproportionate”. The privacy of each one of its users would be compromised as there was no way to predict which message would be subject to a tracing order from the government. ‘Chilling effect’ In its petition before the Delhi High Court, the social media giant said that it would have to “build an ability to identify the first originator of every message, to be served up to the government forever”. This means even legal users and their messages would be under watch. The effect would be chilling on free speech. “The essential role of the test of proportionality is to enable the court to determine whether a legislative measure is disproportionate in its interference with the fundamental right [of personal liberty/privacy] ... In determining this, the court will have regard to whether a less intrusive measure could have been adopted consistent with the object of the law and whether the impact of the encroachment on a fundamental right is disproportionate to the benefit which is likely to ensue,” the Supreme Court had said in the Puttuswamy case. The principle was reiterated in the Anuradha Bhasin case on Internet freedom. Besides, the 2021 Rules is a subordinate legislation under the Information Technology Act. Neither the Act nor any other law, for that matter, specifically requires a social media intermediary using end-to-end encryption to reveal the identity of the first originator of a message. However, in this case, the subordinate law has overshot the original intent and boundaries of the parent Act.  The role of the test of proportionality is to enable the court to determine whether a legislative measure is disproportionate in its interference with the fundamental right Supreme Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-had-cautioned-govt-on-privacy/article34662523.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||States, Centre spar over wastage||More than 1.84 crore COVID vaccine doses (1,84,90,522) are still available with the States and Union Territories to be administered and 11 lakh doses were in the pipeline and to be received by them within the next three days, said an update from the Health Ministry on Thursday. On Wednesday, the Health Ministry said in a press statement that Jharkhand had “wasted” nearly 37% vaccines while in Chhagtisgarh it was 30%. “Whereas States have been urged repeatedly to keep vaccine wastage below 1%, many States such as Jharkhand (37.3%), Chhattisgarh (30.2%), Tamil Nadu (15.5%), Jammu and Kashmir (10.8%), Madhya Pradesh (10.7%) are reporting much higher wastage than the national average (6.3%),” the release noted. Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, however, tweeted late on Wednesday that these numbers from the Health Ministry were “laughable.” The State’s wastage was 4.65%, below the national average of 6.3%, he said. Health Minister of Chhattisgarh T.S. Singh Deo also tweeted that the figures attributed to Chhattisgarh were “erroneous and completely baseless.” Of the vaccines supplied by the Central government for healthcare and frontline workers and for 45+ year olds, only 0.95% was wasted and for those in the 18-45 age group only 0.29% was wasted. “This is far better than national average of 6%,” Mr. Singh Deo tweeted. Technical errors In a video conference of the States and the Centre on May 21, the Health Minister “agreed”, according to Mr. Singh Deo, that there was a technical error in the Centre’s portal which was inflating the wastage numbers and that the Centre would be coordinating with States to resolve the issue. On May 26, figures from the Centre put Jharkhand’s wastage as 6.44% and Chhattisgarh’s at 7.47%. Some States even show negative wastage, for instance Kerala at -4.16%, suggesting that more vaccine doses were extracted out of vials than what was actually supplied. NITI Aayog Member (Health) V.K. Paul said on Thursday that the management of vaccines by some States was inadequate. He said, “In the non-government of India channel, States are getting 25% of the doses and private hospitals are getting 25% doses. However, the hiccups and issues faced by the people in the administration of these 25% doses by the States leave a lot to be desired.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-centre-spar-over-wastage/article34662540.ece
28 May 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal govt. is now party to Narada case||A five-judge Bench of Calcutta High Court on Thursday heard the Narada case and agreed to make the West Bengal government party to the case. The Bench, which will hear the application again on Friday, agreed to hear first the arguments of the recall application on the May 17 order, where the High Court had cancelled the bail granted to four persons arrested by a city court. The five-judge Bench, which includes Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices I. P. Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Arijit Banerjee, is hearing the matter after a two-judge Bench of Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee had differences of opinion over granting bail to the accused. The CBI on May 17 had arrested four leaders, including two State government Ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, MLA Madan Mitra and former Minister Subrata Mukherjee, in connection with the Narada case. During the hearing on Thursday, Justice Mukherjee said that the Bench was considering all issues, including bail to those arrested. Arguing for the CBI, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta raised the issue of leaders from the ruling party going to the CBI’s office after the arrests. Mr. Mehta said that if this “mobocracy” was allowed then, in the future, supporters of a gangster may lay siege on a CBI office after an arrest. The Court responded by asking how Article 226 could be invoked unless Mr. Mehta could prove that the “mobocracy” had an effect on the CBI court. Article 226 grants High Courts the power to issue certain writs. Appearing for the accused, senior advocate Kalyan Banerjee raised the issue of the High Court cancelling bail to the accused without hearing them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-govt-is-now-party-to-narada-case/article34662527.ece
28 May 2021||Chennai,||1.81 lakh cases, 3,500 deaths reported||India recorded 1,81,513 new COVID-19 cases and 3,562 new deaths till 9.30 p.m. on Thursday. The country has so far reported a total of 2,75,49,683 cases and 3,18,827 deaths. Tamil Nadu reported 33,361 new infections, followed by Karnataka (24,214) and Kerala (24,166). Maharashtra recorded 884 new casualties on the day, followed by Karnataka (476) and Tamil Nadu (474). Maharashtra’s fatalities include backlog deaths which were missed in the previous reports. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Ladakh. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. Around 21.58 lakh samples were tested in the country on Wednesday (the results for which were made available on Thursday), which is around 60,000 fewer tests than those conducted on Tuesday. However, it is 1.03 lakh more tests than those conducted on the previous Wednesday (May 19). India’s average daily test positivity rate (positive cases identified for every 100 tests) continues to decline. It was 10.9% on May 26 compared to 16% recorded a week before. About 18.86 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Thursday, which is 1.53 lakh doses fewer than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. However, it is 7.2 lakh more doses than what was recorded during the same period a week ago. On May 26, India had administered an average of 17 lakh doses daily, which is higher than the 13.63 average daily doses administered until a week before (May 19). Until May 27, about 17% of India’s adult population, 37.1% of the 45+ population and 42.3% of those aged above 60 had been vaccinated with at least one dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/181-lakh-cases-3500-deaths-reported/article34662545.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||World can’t be part vaccinated and part neglected: Jaishankar||On his first visit to the U.S. since the start of the Biden administration, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called the India-U.S. relationship one of the most important relationships in the world. “I think our relationship has come a long way. It is, today, one of the major relationships in the world,” he told former [Trump administration] national security advisor H.R. McMaster, a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, during a webcast discussion on Wednesday. Mr. Jaishankar also said he had a “ big agenda” for the relationship. “My own sense is that in Washington today there is a real appreciation of the potential of this relationship … and it’s true of New Delhi as well,” he said, adding that the challenge today is for countries to learn to work with each other more effectively in a multipolar world. “The United States has not only an enormous ability to reinvent itself, it also has a great ability to assess its situation and re-strategise, in a way. And I do think today that when it comes to the big issues of our day... we have fundamental convergences. Convergences which are societal convergences, which are geopolitical . And I think the challenge before us is how to translate those convergences into actionable policies,” he said. Last July, Mr. Jaishankar had said America needs to “go beyond” alliances and learn how to work in a multipolar world with plurilateral arrangements. Mr. Jaishankar spoke about a world changed by the pandemic. The big take away from the pandemic is when you have a big problem the only way out is global cooperation, he said, describing the need for people to relate to the experiences of other countries. “I think there needs to be that realisation that this could easily happen to us. In many cases, it has happened to us and the right response, therefore is to help each other out and I am glad to say we’ve [India] seen a tremendous outpouring of international support and solidarity at this time.” India has, in recent weeks, received hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assistance from the U.S. government and the American private sector as well. Since the pandemic, Mr. Jaishankar said he was increasingly hearing of “strategic autonomy” or not relying too much on one set of supply chains. “The conversations are beginning to change towards more resilience… how do you de-risk the world,” he said, making an argument for ‘decentralised globalisation’: where there are different centres of production and the world will not be “so completely threatened” as in the last year, when things go wrong. The world is not going to be the same post-COVID, Mr. Jaishankar said. “We can’t have a world which is part vaccinated and part neglected, because that world is not going to be safe. ‘How do we get through the global challenges in a global way?’ I think that’s the big question,” Mr. Jaishankar said, adding that countries pursuing their national interest at the cost of everything else is going to cause problems. His comments were in response to a question on how countries, like the Quad members, could continue to work to preserve their competitive advantages. Mr. McMaster asked about “Hindutva policies that could be undermining the secular nature of Indian democracy” and whether “India’s friends are right to be concerned about some of these recent trends”. Mr Jaishankar’s answer referred to political motives behind the Modi government being depicted in “a certain way.” He said the BJP had moved away from “vote bank politics” and that there was a broader representation, including in politics, of “people who are much more confident about their culture, about their language, about their beliefs.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/world-cant-be-part-vaccinated-and-part-neglected-jaishankar/article34662543.ece
28 May 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Subrahmanyam to be Commerce Secretary||The Modi government on Thursday brought in B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, the Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, as the next Commerce Secretary, Government of India, upon superannuation of Anup Wadhawan on June 30. Mr. Subrahmanyam is a 1987-batch IAS officer of the Chhattisgarh cadre, and was sent on deputation to Jammu and Kashmir in June 2018. He served as the Chief Secretary when the State was bifurcated into two Union Territories in 2019. He is a widely experienced bureaucrat, having worked in the Prime Minister’s Office as Joint Secretary during Manmohan Singh’s tenure. In the Ministry of Commerce, he has been appointed as an Officer on Special Duty for a month, before he takes over as the Secretary when the incumbent Mr. Wadhawan superannuates on June 30. In another crucial development, the government has granted extensions of one year each to the Secretary, Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), and the Chief of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). Samant Kumar Goel is the Secretary, R&AW. He has been given one year’s extension beyond June 30, 2021. He is a 1984-batch IPS officer of the Punjab cadre. His batchmate and Assam-Meghalaya cadre IPS officer, Arvinda Kumar, is the Chief of IB, which is the country’s premier spy agency, while the R&AW is an external intelligence agency of the Indian government. The IB functions under the Union Home Ministry, while the R&AW functions under the Cabinet Secretariat in the Central administration. Besides appointing the new Commerce Secretary and granting extension to the chiefs of spy agencies, the government also appointed three Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officials to be members of the apex income tax policymaking body, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Accordingly, the three officers appointed are: Anu J. Singh, J.B. Mohapatra and Anuja Sarangi, all three IRS officers of the Income Tax cadre belonging to the 1985 batch. The names of these officials were cleared by the Ministry of Finance in February/March this year. The CBDT has been working with just a Chairman, who is on extension till May 31, and two other members, one of whom is also on extension. CBDT Chairman P.C. Mody was given a three-month extension in February this year till May 31. He is a 1982-batch IRS officer and was appointed as the chief in September 2019. Another member on extension is S.K. Gupta, whose extended tenure is ending in July this year. All appointment and extension orders were issued by the Department of Personnel and Training after approval from the Prime Minister-led Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. Additionally, the Centre repatriated the Tamil Nadu cadre IAS officer, Shiv Das Meena, serving as Chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board at the request of the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/subrahmanyam-to-be-commerce-secretary/article34662503.ece

28 May 2021||New Delhi,||Submit compliance reports within 15 days, digital platforms told||The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Thursday asked the digital media platforms to submit compliance reports as per the new intermediary rules under the IT Act within 15 days. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital media Ethics Codes) Rules, 2021, were notified by the government on February 25. These rules, for the first time, bring digital media platforms under government monitoring. It also gives emergency power to the Ministry to block content. The platforms also have to provide a three-tier grievance redress mechanism to deal with complaints about their content. As per the latest notice from the Ministry, so far, 60 publishers have written to it saying they have initiated the process of formation of self-regulatory bodies under the rules. Some of the publishers have also written regarding registration with the Ministry under the rules. The Ministry clarified that there is no requirement for prior registration of digital media publishers with it and only certain information as per the prescribed format has to be furnished. This includes basic information such as URL, contact of the grievance redressal officer and so on. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) urged the government to “exempt and exclude” the traditional television news media and its extended presence on the digital news platforms from the ambit of the IT Rules 2021, arguing that it is already “sufficiently regulated” by various statutes, laws, guidelines, codes and regulations. It has also criticised the new rules saying the IT Act, 2000 and the IT Rules 2021, and “more specifically” provisions such as the blocking of content in cases of emergency, will ‘severely’ impact the freedom of speech and expression of the media. “Since the news channels/broadcasters and their extended digital arms strictly adhere to the statutes and regulations applicable and are governed at multiple levels of redressal mechanism, if the IT Rules, 2021 are made applicable, it will not only lead to harassment of the news channels/broadcasters but will also suppress and violate their fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression and will also restrict news reporting in a fair manner,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/submit-compliance-reports-within-15-days-digital-platforms-told/article34662528.ece
28 May 2021||Chandigarh,||Quick action by local officials help Himachal villagers get jabs||In the absence of smooth Internet connectivity in the remote Dodra-Kwar area of Shimla district in Himachal Pradesh, many residents in the 18-44 age group are finding it difficult to get slots for vaccination. Most of the slots for May 27 were booked by outsiders, forcing local authorities to appeal to all outsiders to cancel their slots to let residents of this remote region get inoculated. The appeal made by B.R. Sharma, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate at Rohru, on May 25 yielded a positive result as many people who do not reside in Dodra-Kwar cancelled their slots for May 27, so that the residents could get the vaccine. “Since the appeal, I received several messages on my phone from people who are not residents of Dodra-Kwar for cancellation of their slots. This is very encouraging as we will be able to vaccinate locals at a faster pace. Our priority is to get people vaccinated in this region as early as possible. The road connectivity to this remote area remains cut-off for months once there is snowfall in the higher reaches,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu over phone. There is poor Internet connectivity in the area, which has a population of around 7,000. A team of government officials has been stationed at Rohru for registering locals on the CoWIN portal for vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quick-action-by-local-officials-help-himachal-villagers-get-jabs/article34662548.ece
28 May 2021||PATNA,||BJP leaders resent curbs on movement of Ministers in Bihar||Leaders of Bihar’s ruling alliance partner Bharatiya Janata Party have expressed their strong resentment at the State government’s decision to place restrictions on the movement of Ministers in their constituencies due to the lockdown. The Bihar government had issued a letter on May 23 restraining movement of Ministers citing violation of lockdown norms. BJP MLAs, MPs and Ministers registered their protest at the party’s virtual meeting on Wednesday. BJP had called the meeting to oversee preparation for the upcoming Sewa Diwas on May 30, to be organised on the completion of seven years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal was present at the meeting. “It’s like murder of democracy. If an MLA or MP cannot move in their constituencies to be with their people during this time of corona, then how can he or she claim to be a public representative?” asked a party legislator. Another MLA wondered “whether both the Deputy Chief Ministers from the BJP quota were consulted by the government before taking such a decision”. The resenting MLAs and MPs said District Magistrates of their areas had been telling them over phone not to visit their constituencies or hospitals or community kitchens. “It’s a dictatorial move by the government. The ruling alliance partners were not even consulted before taking the decision”, said a BJP MLA and former Minister. Party sources told The Hindu that the State’s top party leadership informed the protesting MLAs and MPs that the central leadership had been briefed about it and asked them not to make it an issue. Lockdown in Bihar ends on June 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-leaders-resent-curbs-on-movement-of-ministers-in-bihar/article34662736.ece

Dr. Paul said the country would produce 10 crore doses of Covaxin by October. The earlier estimate was that these production numbers would be reached by September, according to a note from the Department of Biotechnology in mid April. Covaxin production by Bharat Biotech was being increased from under 1 crore a month to 10 crore by October. Additionally, the three PSUs (Public Sector Undertaking) would together aim to produce up to 4.0 crore doses by December. With the constant encouragement of the government, the Serum Institute of India was ramping up Covishield production of 6.5 crore doses a month to 11.0 crore doses, Dr. Paul said. Trials in children would begin soon. “ However, vaccinating children should not be decided on the basis of panic in WhatsApp groups and because some politicians want to play politics. It has to be a decision taken by our scientists after adequate data is available based on trials,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-responsible-for-vaccine-shortfall/article34662501.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||Withdraw new norms in Lakshadweep: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw the new regulations introduced by Lakshadweep Administrator Praful Khoda Patel. In a letter written on Wednesday that was released by the Congress on Thursday, Mr. Gandhi alleged that the new regulations and orders threatened the heritage of the archipelago. “The custodians of its [Lakshadweep] heritage seek to safeguard the archipelago for posterity. However, their future is threatened by the anti-people policies announced by the Administrator of Lakshadweep, Shri. Praful Khoda Patel,” he wrote. “The Administrator’s attempt to undermine the ecological sanctity of the island is evident in the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation... The provisions undermine safeguards pertaining to land ownership, dilute environmental regulations for certain activities and severely limit legal recourse available to affected persons.” “I request you to intervene in this matter and ensure that the above mentioned orders are withdrawn,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/withdraw-new-norms-in-lakshadweep-rahul/article34662508.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Twitter defaming India, defying laws, says govt.||The Ministry said that through its actions and deliberate defiance, Twitter seeks to undermine India’s legal system. “Twitter needs to stop beating around the bush and comply with the laws of the land. Law making and policy formulations is the sole prerogative of the sovereign and Twitter is just a social media platform and it has no locus in dictating what India’s legal policy framework should be,” MeitY said. According to Twitter, with regards to the new IT rules, it is particularly concerned about the requirement to make an individual (the compliance officer) criminally liable for content on the platform, the requirements for proactive monitoring, and the blanket authority to seek information about its customers. It believes this represents dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles. The company also pointed out that it was compelled to withhold some content, constituting legitimate free speech, in response to a non-compliance notice due to the law’s limited scope under Section 69A. Not doing so poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees. Meanwhile, the government said the new rules empower ordinary users who become victims of defamation, morphed images, sexual abuse and the whole range of other abusive content in blatant violation of law, to seek redress. It also reiterated that these rules were finalised after widest possible consultations, including with representatives of social media platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/twitter-defaming-india-defying-laws-says-govt/article34662512.ece

States to push for COVID relief at GST meet||Opposition-ruled States will press the Centre to waive taxes levied on COVID-19 relief material, including vaccines, and seek a speedy payout of their compensation dues as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, reconvenes after a seven-month break on Friday. Hit hard by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the States will also seek an extension of the compensation due to them under the GST regime beyond the original five-year window that expires in June 2022. They will also urge the Centre to enhance their borrowing limits to enable them to raise debt of up to 5% of their Gross State Domestic Product. The Oppositionruled States have joined forces to demand that GST dues be paid at the earliest so they can fund pandemic-related spending.  GST compensation cess collections are expected to fall short by Rs. 1.65 lakh crore this year and an estimated Rs. 63,000 crore is still pending to States from last year. The newly appointed Finance Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and their counterparts from Punjab, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal met virtually at a meeting hosted by the Rajasthan government on Thursday and vowed to ‘remain united’ at the Council’s meeting. These States will also press for a GST exemption on COVID-19 vaccines, whose procurement has now been largely delegated to them, along with waiving of all taxes on goods purchased for fighting the pandemic. Ms. Sitharaman had earlier snubbed a similar plea from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, arguing it would be ‘counterproductive’ and States will get a share of such GST revenues. Kerala’s new Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal told The Hindu that States will seek immediate disbursement of GST compensation arrears and extension of the GST compensation for four to five years in view of the economic crisis arising due to pandemic-induced lockdown. Kerala will also demand that GST compensation be paid as a grant instead of the special borrowing window used to meet part of last year's shortfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-states-to-push-for-covid-relief-at-gst-meet/article34662515.ece

The gang had recorded themselves torturing the victim, believed to be from Bangladesh, and shared the clip with friends in Assam and West Bengal. When it went viral, the North East police as well as their counterparts in Bangladesh initiated a probe. The Assam police even put up images of the accused on Twitter seeking information. By following the chain of forwards, they were able to trace the origin of the video to a cell phone number in Bengaluru. The Bengaluru city police were alerted and special teams, within hours, tracked down the gang on Thursday evening. They were arrested from a rented house at Avalahalli, Ramamurthy Nagar.The arrested men are reportedly labourers. They have been identified as Sagar, Mohammed Baba Sheikh, Ridoy Babu and Hakeel. The identity of the woman, who was part of the gang, is yet to be revealed. Police officials are also concerned as they are unable to trace the victim. “Our initial probe has revealed that the gang brought her illegally into the country by promising her a job. Instead, they forced her into prostitution. She was able to escape but they hunted her down. When they found her, they tortured her brutally and violated her before circulating the video,” said a senior police official. At the time of going to press, special teams had been formed to find the victim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/multi-state-operation-nets-gang-behind-rape-video/article34662517.ece
28 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Flood threat in Odisha following Cyclone Yaas||Flood threat loomed over a few Odisha districts in summer season following heavy rain triggered by the very severe cyclonic storm Yaas on Thursday. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who undertook an aerial survey and chaired a meeting, directed the administration to gear up to face the flood threat and announced seven days of relief for those in submerged areas. “We apprehend a medium-level flood in the Baitarani river system due to heavy rain in its upper catchment. The Collectors of Bhadrak, Jajpur and Kendrapara district have been alerted,” Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena said here. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Yaas moved from Odisha to Jharkhand by dissipating further through Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts on Wednesday night. Under its influence, heavy rain lashed 200 blocks in the coastal districts on Wednesday. Seven blocks received rainfall in the range of 300 to 400 mm. By 8 a.m. on Thursday, Keonjhar received 127 mm followed by Sundargarh (101 mm), Mayurbhanj (96 mm) and Deogarh (62 mm). Kusumi in Mayurbhanj district recorded 515 mm rainfall over two days, while Chandipur in Balasore and Rajnagar in Kendrapara received 427 mm and 420 mm in 48 hours spanning over Tuesday and Wednesday. The Baitarani is flowing above the danger level at Akhuapada and Anandpur in Keonjhar. “The way the water level is rising in the river, there could be flooding in 31 villages under 14 gram panchayats of Dhamnagar block,” said Gyana Dash, Bhadrak Collector. The Water Resource Department has deployed engineers to divert flood water from entering human habitations in the lower catchment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/flood-threat-in-odisha-following-cyclone-yaas/article34662518.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The source of creation||When one starts analysing the how and why of all this wonderful creation, and also the way it is sustained seamlessly through time immemorial, it automatically creates a humbling effect. The enormity of the task of creation and the subtlety and profound implications that surface continue to be awe inspiring. The Upanishads state that Brahman alone is both the instrumental and material cause of creation and that Brahman remains apart and is not affected by it in any way. This uniqueness and many such subtle features of Brahman as the Divine Principle in creation are explained systematically in the Mundaka Upanishad comprising 64 mantras, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. First of all the Upanishad raises the doubt about how this world consisting of the mobile and immobile objects, the conscious and the inert, etc, all have their source in Brahman. The example of potter, clay and pots, is often quoted to show how objects are made in the world by persons who make use of materials and instruments and invest their skill to create a finished object. The Mundaka uses three examples drawn from daily life to show that the two distinct, the Nimitta and the Upadana causes, are in Brahman alone. The spider weaves a web with thread that it sends forth from its body and the wonder is that it takes it back within itself. Unlike the bird that builds a nest with twigs etc collected from outside, the spider builds its home with material from within itself. The next example of plants growing on earth is to show that what is manifested is only an appearance of the form of the original cause. The third example shows how even lifeless objects such as nails and hair grow in our living body. The truth is that all similarities and differences are subsumed in Supreme Brahman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-source-of-creation/article34662533.ece

The plea was filed by advocate Mamta Sharma. “Issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to cancel the examination for Class 12 and devise an objective methodology to declare the result within a specific time-frame,” Ms. Sharma urged. Can’t be made to suffer Ms. Sharma said the CBSE and ICSE notifications deferring the exams to an unspecified date should be quashed. It said students cannot be made to suffer uncertainty in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis. posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The petition said there should not be any uncertainty regarding exams crucial to the future academic study of Class 12 students. Last year, the top court had asked the Boards to declare Class 12 exam results on the basis of their earlier grading. The petitioner said the same methodology could be used this year too. Both Boards cannot remain mute spectators and opt to wait and watch for the pandemic wave to ebb. Delay would put the future of the students in peril, it said. Ms. Sharma said the Boards had already cancelled the Class 10 exams.

A senior Ministry official told The Hindu that it was yet to receive the draft regulation from the Lakshadweep administration. The official said the regulation was drafted by the Lakshadweep administration and the Union Home Ministry had no role to play. Administrating authority The Union Home Ministry is the administrating authority for the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. Any proposed change to the laws in Lakshadweep is to be brought through regulations, instead of a Bill as is the case in other UTs with a legislature such as Delhi and Puducherry. These regulations are then put up for public consultation and once the response is received, it is sent to the Union Home Ministry. “The Ministry will examine the regulations, and only after it clears them will the draft be sent to the Union Cabinet for approval. Till now, the Ministry has not received the regulations,” said the official. The draft regulation proposes seven years’ imprisonment for the consumption or the sale of beef, and those who have more than two children cannot contest in the panchayat elections. The draft was placed in the public domain seeking comments on April 28 and the last date to send suggestions was May 19. Several political leaders, including the Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to intervene and withdraw the new orders and regulations introduced by Administrator Praful Khoda Patel. Mr. Patel, a former Gujarat Minister, took over as the Administrator on December 5 last year after the passing of Dineshwar Sharma, former Director, Intelligence Bureau.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yet-to-receive-draft-regulation-govt/article34662514.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||27-DE-Rocky-Delhi HC Black Fungus drug import||The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed duty-free import of Amphotericin B, used for treating mucormycosis (black fungus) disease, till the Central government takes a final decision on waiving the customs and other duties on the drug. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh added that the importer of the drug would have to furnish a bond stating they would pay the duty fees if the Centre came to a decision that it would not allow any such waiver. The court observed that since the drug is currently in short supply, the Centre should “seriously consider” waving off the duty fees for the time being. Central government standing counsel assured the court that the issue of waiving the import duty on Amphotericin B will be communicated to the government during the day itself and a decision will be taken soon. The counsel also assured that Customs department will clear all consignments relating to COVID-19 any delay. Another Centre’s counsel also informed the court that the drug was exempted from duty if sent by a relative or friend free of cost from abroad. The court’s direction came while hearing a plea by a patient who could not source the Amphotericin B for himself. It referred to a recent judgment passed by another judge of the High Court holding as unconstitutional the imposition of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on import of oxygen concentrators by individuals for COVID-19 patients. The court also asked the Centre to act on a “war footing” to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of the live-saving drug.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/27-de-rocky-delhi-hc-black-fungus-drug-import/article34662532.ece

28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai’s hospital occupancy drops noticeably over two days||For the first time during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chennai has seen a sharp drop in the number of patients in hospitals over the past two days. The decline in hospitalisations has come as a relief to the city, which struggled to find beds for sick patients for the best part of May. For instance, the city had only 180 vacant intensive care unit (ICU)- and oxygen-supported beds on May 11, as per the State’s media bulletin. On Thursday, there were 1,496 vacant ICU- and oxygen-supported beds. The number of people occupying oxygen-supported beds, which continued to rise and reached 8,866 earlier this week, reduced by 400 on Thursday. As a consequence of this, and with the increase in capacity, the number of vacant oxygen-supported beds rose from 800 earlier this week to 1,417 on Thursday. The number of people in hospitals, including those occupying non-oxygen-supported beds, came down from around 14,000 in the second week of May, when cases reached their peak, to 13,307 on Thursday. While hospitalisations in Chennai would include patients from the neighbouring districts as well, this noticeable decline can be attributed largely to the decline in cases, combined with the rising number of recoveries being reported in the city.  Sustained efforts Meanwhile, the bed capacity in the city, particularly oxygen-supported beds, continued to rise amid sustained efforts by the administration. From the roughly 7,500 ICU- and oxygen-supported beds available in the first week of May, the capacity of beds went up by more than 60% to 12,136 beds on Thursday.  Other indicators The number of fresh cases being reported and the test positivity rate (TPR) also indicate that the city has possibly started to come out of the second wave. The number of fresh cases getting reported declined sharply in the past few days. While 5,169 new cases were reported last Sunday, there were just 2,779 cases on Thursday.

28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister inaugurates 100-bed triage centre||The Government Stanley Medical College Hospital has set up a 100-bed facility — COVID-19 Ambulance Triage Centre — on the Government Bharathi Arts College ground. On Thursday, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin inaugurated the facility where patients brought in ambulances would be triaged immediately, thereby preventing drop in oxygen saturation levels during the waiting period. Of the 100 beds, 60 would be for male patients and 40 for women. A total of 100 oxygen concentrators with 10 litre capacity were installed at the facility. To save time, blood tests, ECG and X-ray would be done at the centre, according to a press release. In the second wave of COVID-19, patients have started to come in a very serious condition needing oxygen support. Due to the waiting period, the oxygen saturation level dropped in some patients, resulting in severe breathlessness before they were wheeled into the hospital. Stagnation of ambulances could be considerably reduced by triaging and hence, ambulances would be readily available for the next sick patient, the release added. The hospital would post doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in three shifts at the ambulance triage centre to handle patients with COVID-19 and provide appropriate care. Once an ambulance arrives at the centre, the doctor will enter the vehicle, assess the patient, check the vital parameters, including clinical status, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and respiratory rate, and code them based on the clinical condition in specified colours — patients with oxygen saturation of less than 90% are coded as red, while those with oxygen saturation level between 90% and 94% are coded yellow. While green is for positive patients without co-morbidities, blue is for patients who had tested negative, and orange for those with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. After assessment, each ambulance would be given a sticker bearing the corresponding colour code and the patients would be transported to the respective wards without delay in the same vehicle. By clearing ambulances early, the waiting time for patients in ambulances would be reduced considerably. Early identification and management of high risk patients is made possible. With the addition of the 100 beds, 130 beds in ‘A’ block and 120 beds in ‘B’ block, 60 new ICU beds, the hospital has a total of 2,410 beds for patients with COVID-19. Of this, 1,750 are oxygen-supported beds and 210 are ICU beds, the release said. P. K. Sekar Babu, Minister for HR & CE, Dayanidhi Maran, MP, P. Akash, Regional Deputy Commissioner, GCC, R. Narayana Babu, DME, and P. Balaji, Dean of the hospital, were present on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chief-minister-inaugurates-100-bed-triage-centre/article34662846.ece
28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State’s fiscal deficit at Rs. 92,305 crore for 2020-21||Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure) stood at Rs. 92,305 crore for fiscal 2020-21, according to un-audited provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Last fiscal, the State was hit by lower revenue collections due to the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on the one hand and increasing expenditure to tackle the pandemic, on the other. As per provisional figures, the State’s total receipts (including State’s own tax revenue (SOTR) and the share of Central taxes among others and excluding borrowings) stood at Rs. 1,74,255.66 crore, while the total expenditure stood at Rs. 2,66,560.73 crore, resulting in fiscal deficit. The total receipts for 2020-21 declined by 2.8% from Rs. 1,79,282.03 crore in 2019-20. The total expenditure increased by 14.7% in 2020-21, from the year-ago figure of Rs. 2,32,320.64 crore. State’s own tax revenue The SOTR, which accounts for 70% of Tamil Nadu’s total revenue, was flat at Rs. 1,01,140.09 crore in 2020-21 when compared to last year. Among the components of SOTR, liquor revenue, which gets partly reflected through State excise duties and stamps and registration fees, showed a positive growth in 2020-21, while State GST, VAT collections and land revenue showed negative growth. State excise duties grew by 8.5% to Rs. 7,821.66 crore in 2020-21, from Rs. 7,205.97 crore in 2019-2020. Taxes on sales, trade, etc. (which reflects tax on petroleum products and sales tax on liquor) declined by 2.3% to Rs. 43,490.05 crore in 2020-21 from Rs. 44,517.53 crore in 2019-20. The State’s GST collection declined by 1.12% to Rs. 37,942.08 crore in 2020-21 from Rs. 38,374.49 crore in 2019-20. Revenue from stamps and registration fees increased by 7.54% to Rs. 11,675.11 crore in 2020-21 from Rs. 10,855.65 crore in 2019-20. Central taxes The State’s share of Central taxes declined by 5.56% to Rs. 24,924.51 crore from Rs. 26,392.41 crore in the same period last year. Tamil Nadu’s revenue expenditure increased by 13.3% to Rs. 2,30,332.73 crore in 2020-21, when compared to Rs. 2,03,236.86 crore in 2019-20. The State’s revenue deficit stood at Rs. 61,320.46 crore in 2020-21. Revenue deficit is the difference between the government’s revenue receipts and revenue expenditure, and says that the government’s earnings are not adequate to meet its day-to-day operational expenses. The interim budget presented by the then AIADMK government, before the Assembly poll, had pegged the revenue deficit at Rs. 65,994.06 crore and fiscal deficit at Rs. 96,889.97 crore for 2020-21. The actual figures will be known when the new DMK government presents the full budget. With the intense lockdown announcement to curb the second wave of COVID-19, the stress on Tamil Nadu’s finances is likely to continue this fiscal too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-fiscal-deficit-at-rs-92305-crore-for-2020-21/article34663022.ece
28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Monitoring officers appointed for 3 districts for coordination||In view of the surge in COVID-19 cases in Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Erode districts, the Tamil Nadu government on Thursday deputed three IAS officers to coordinate steps being taken by various agencies to curb the spread of COVID-19 in these districts. While M.A. Siddique and C. Samayamoorthy have been named monitoring officers for Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts respectively, R. Selvaraj has been named for Erode. The decision to appoint monitoring officers was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, in which senior officials and Collectors of six districts — Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Madurai, Tiruchi and Salem — took part virtually. During the meeting at the Secretariat, Mr. Stalin instructed the Collectors to consolidate their efforts in the coming week or two to ensure that the spread is controlled, an official release said. Though Coimbatore and Salem districts have a higher percentage of vaccination coverage, the drive to vaccinate those in the 18-44 age group has to be intensified in the other districts, he said. Containment efforts in the six districts are key to controlling the spread of infection in the State during the second wave, he said. The Chief Minister said because of focused and intense efforts taken in Chennai, the spread in the city and its neighbouring areas was under control to some extent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/monitoring-officers-appointed-for-3-districts-for-coordination/article34663025.ece
28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘3 out of 11 new vaccines have progressed to clinical trial stage’||The Centre on Thursday told the Madras High Court that its Department of Biotechnology (DBT) had been supporting research and development of 11 new COVID-19 vaccines by private and public sector laboratories in the country. Three of those had progressed from the proof of concept to the clinical development stage and were currently undergoing clinical trials, it said. The submission was made before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, who were seized of a public interest litigation petition taken up by the court suo motu to monitor the fight against COVID-19. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) R. Sankaranarayanan said the regulatory and testing processes had been simplified for offshore vaccines too. He said the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) had decided to allow the conduct of bridging trials of offshore vaccines simultaneously with its vaccination, following due safety and quality protocols. “This will enable earlier introduction of offshore vaccines and cut short the time required for the in-country bridging trial by four months,” he said. The court was also told that the DBT had facilitated and supported two public sector undertakings — Indian Immunologicals Limited in Hyderabad and Haffkine Institute in Mumbai — to produce Covaxin, which had been licensed by Bharat Biotech International Limited. Responding to an observation made by the court during the last hearing of the case that the proposed future allocation of vaccines to Tamil Nadu appeared to be skewed and somewhat disappointing, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, through senior Central government standing counsel K. Srinivasamurthy, said the allocation was being made on the basis of average consumption by each State. Tamil Nadu was likely to get 11.52 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group in June, the court was informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/3-out-of-11-new-vaccines-have-progressed-to-clinical-trial-stage/article34663020.ece
28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Searing heat to continue over north T.N. for two days||For the second consecutive day on Thursday, several places in north Tamil Nadu continued to sizzle. Searing heat may persist in the northern parts on Friday too as the day temperature is set to rise by two or three degree Celsius, according to the Meteorological Department. With Cyclone Yaas weakening, dry and hot northwesterlies swept through the region. The mercury level crossed the 40-degree mark in Chennai for the second day. The weather station in Nungambakkam recorded 40.1 degree Celsius while Meenambakkam registered 39.6 degree Celsius. Officials of the Meteorological Department said strong northwesterly winds delayed the onset of sea breeze in coastal areas. This led to a spike in day temperatures in places like Vellore, Tirupattur and Madurai. The department forecast an increase in day temperature by 2-3 degree Celsius in Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Chennai and its neighbouring districts on Friday. Light rain There are chances of light to moderate rain in one or two places in the Western Ghats, Kanniyakumari and Tirunelveli districts till the month-end due to convective activity. Kanniyakumari and Valparai received 4 cm and 2 cm of rain respectively till 5.30 p.m. on Thursday. Dry weather would prevail over other parts of the State and the day temperature would hover around 40 degrees Celsius in Chennai till Saturday. Officials expect the day temperature to fall in a few days as there may be a change in wind direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/searing-heat-to-continue-over-north-tamil-nadu-for-2-days/article34662837.ece
28 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Transpersons’ plea will be considered sympathetically: A-G||The Madras High Court on Thursday recorded the submission of Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram that the State government would consider a plea to distribute COVID-19 cash relief of Rs. 4,000 to the transgender community, sympathetically, without insisting on ration cards. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy recorded the submission made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by transgender rights activist Grace Banu and adjourned the case to June 7 for the government to report the progress made in this regard. In an affidavit filed through her counsel C. Prabhu, the litigant said there were more than 50,000 transpersons in the State, though the available government data showed that there were only 11,449 transpersons, of whom 2,541 had been issued ration cards. Pointing out that the government had announced a COVID-19 cash relief of Rs. 4,000 to all rice ration cardholders, and had begun distributing the first instalment of Rs. 2,000 to each of them, the petitioner said the restriction that the relief would be given only to ration cardholders would lead to exclusion of many transpersons who did not possess ration cards. The petitioner recalled that during the first wave of COVID-19, the State had distributed cash relief of Rs. 1,000 to not just rice ration cardholders, but also transpersons without ration cards. The litigant added that hardly any transpersons had been issued identity cards, ever since the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019 and the statutory rules framed thereunder in 2020 had come into force. Even before the 2019 enactment and the statutory rules came into force, only 6,553 transpersons had been issued identity cards in the State, and the others could not be expected to obtain ration cards without producing identity cards, the petitioner said. It was also brought to the notice of the court that transpersons had several doubts over COVID-19 vaccination since they were either on hormone therapy or undergoing sex reassignment surgeries. Therefore, awareness programmes must be conducted, the litigant said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transpersons-plea-will-be-considered-sympathetically-a-g/article34663026.ece

Sankara Iyer was probably one of the few musicians who remained a link between the glorious years of Carnatic music, which flourished on the banks of the Cauvery and subsequent generations of talent. He had a childlike enthusiasm when it came to teaching music and used to sing endlessly. A bachelor, he lived with his nephew R. Chandrasekaran in Tirunelveli for 15 years after suffering a stroke. “Whenever a young musician called on him, he would first ask his name. Then he would ask him to sing and would promptly join him. He would go on explaining the nuances of the raga and the keerthana and he never asked money from any student,” recalled nagaswaram player Injikudi E.M. Subramanian, his student at Annamalai University. A colourful raconteur, he would narrate anecdotes behind his compositions. He once explained why he included Megharanjani , one of the four Ranjanis in his Ranjanimala Keerthana . “I was waiting for a train in a station in north India. The radio station from Karachi broadcast a performance and the singer beautifully rendered Megharanajani . I decided to include in Ranjanimala ,” he once said. The other ragas of Ranjanimala are Ranjani , Sriranjani and Janaranjani . Born in Thogaimalai near Tiruchi, he had his initial training under his grandfather Krishna Iyer. Thanjavur became a prefix to his name after he lived there with his sister’s family for many years.                   The Music Academy conferred the Sangita Kala Acharya on him in 1996.

The district had 996 positive cases on April 27 which escalated to 4,734 on Thursday. The district's TPR stood at 30.87% as of Wednesday against the 10% it had on April 26. The COVID-19 data released by the Health Department also showed that the active cases of the disease increased more than five times during the period in the district. Coimbatore district’s active cases stood at 37,488 on Thursday which was 6,948 on April 27. Commenting on the situation, wherein Coimbatore topped the State in terms of the daily caseload on Wednesday and Thursday, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said that the next 10 days will be “very crucial” for the district. According to him, the onus was on “proper containment”. “Containment of COVID-19 affected pockets have to be very perfect in the coming days. Health workers have been instructed to conduct house visits to ensure proper containment. Early referral of family members of infected persons, even if they don’t have symptoms, has been advised. Proper isolation of such people will help in reducing the spread,” he said. Though the district has the capacity to conduct 19,000 tests a day, the Health Department did not have the plan to increase tests. To coordinate containment strategies in the district and effective handling of the situation, the government sent M.A. Siddique, Principal Secretary/Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, to Coimbatore, he said. District Collector S. Nagarajan said that the daily caseload was expected to come down in the next few days due to various interventions being done. K. Kolandasamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, said that hospitals in Coimbatore, a medical hub, were witnessing high flow of COVID-19 patients from neighbouring districts which could also be a reason for the current rise in the number of cases. “Thickly populated areas, closed/contained places and places having more number of hospitals have high chances of having new infections. People who come along with COVID-19 patients to hospitals and then visit other places are potential carriers of the disease,” he said. Meanwhile, a private laboratory in Coimbatore was found to have sent swab samples it had collected to Maharashtra as it could not run them beyond the capacity. “The lab had the capacity to run 500 samples per day. However, they collected more samples and sent them to Maharashtra. The results which were pending for some days returned on Thursday and it reflected in the daily caseload,” said Mr. Radhakrishnan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-witnesses-more-than-4-fold-rise-in-daily-caseload-in-last-one-month/article34662711.ece

Additional research was done into sourcing relations and trade flows, using trade databases and publicly available supplier base information, says a press release. Further, 15 of these workers were interviewed in October last year to understand the impact of COVID-19. Many of these units were directly or indirectly part of the supply chain of some of the international brands. The press release said that the SOMO-Arisa report uses 11 indicators for forced labour developed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to assess the working and living conditions of spinning mill workers here. Of these, five were found to be most relevant: abuse of vulnerability, deception, intimidation and threats, abusive working and living conditions. Majority of the workers interviewed had received incorrect information during their recruitment, about the working and living conditions in their prospective jobs and when they began working, the found that their wages were lower than expected, working hours were longer than they had been told, and annual leave was unpaid. They also found that money was being deducted from their wages for food and accommodation, contrary to what they had been told during recruitment, the report alleged. “Forced labour should be considered a major risk throughout the entire Tamil Nadu textile sector,” the report said. The aim of SOMO and Arisa is to help enable structural improvements to employment, working, and living conditions for workers in the Indian textile and garment industry, and in particular, for the most vulnerable worker groups, it added. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) Executive Director Siddhartha Rajagopal said the methodology of the study is “defective” as the sample size is not representative. The report tries to “generalise stray incidents.” He added that the findings are baseless and motivated to discredit the Indian spinning industry and tarnish the image of India in the overseas market as a supplier of goods adopting fair labour practices. The Southern India Mills’ Association (SIMA) secretary general K. Selvaraju said the study does not represent the entire spinning sector in Tamil Nadu. The sector has over 2,000 mills, employing nearly seven lakh workers. The mills in the organised sector are regularly monitored by several departments of the government. Further, the migrant workers who went to their home States during the first wave of the pandemic have returned to work, and did not go away to other States or sectors. The study does not give details about the mills or workers. There may be “stray instances” of violations in the smaller units but that does not represent the industry. The SIMA and Texprocil plan to conduct awareness camps on the new labour codes, take up a third party audit at the mills on labour compliance and educate the mills in six months on labour compliances. “We strongly advice payment of the stipulated minimum wages, weekly off, etc. All the major textile industry associations are working hard with the member units for the last few months on labour issues,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-spinning-mills-said-to-have-forced-labour/article34663029.ece

28 May 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Nine feared dead for want of oxygen||At least nine patients were feared dead in the isolation ward ofGovernment Hospital here on Thursday, according to relatives. However, Collector P. Madhusudan Reddy, told reporters that three persons had died. Officials from the Health department said the Government Hospital here could not take in more patients. The new GH at Surakudi Road had 300 beds and out of which 200 had oxygen facility. The patients were shifted to the new premises. Since many patients from private hospitals were already admitted there, there was confusion for a while. A few patients could not get oxygen and died. The relatives blamed it on poor planning by the staff in shifting them from the old premises to the new facility. In-patients, who were continuously dependent on oxygen had trouble in getting it and led to the death, they said. However, the Health officials said that three patients, who were even otherwise critical, had died and denied that Oxygen shortage was the cause. The Joint Director (Health) Illango Maheswaran, RDO Surendran and others said that 230 MT of Oxygen was available and it was more than sufficient to handle the 179 patients in the new facility. Not convinced, the relatives of the patients, who had died, demanded action and a thorough probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nine-feared-dead-for-want-of-oxygen/article34662783.ece
28 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Mini COVID-19 Care Centres to be set up in 100 villages||In the wake of rise in fresh cases in rural areas, the district administration plans to establish Mini COVID-19 Care Centres at 100 village panchayats. Deputy Director of Health Services K.V. Arjun Kumar said that earlier nearly 80% of the positive cases were from urban areas and the rest in rural areas. But, now, rural areas contribute 40% of the cases. Around 10,000 RT-PCR tests are conducted in the district every day - equal number in both rural and urban areas. In blocks like Tirupparankundram, Madurai East and Madurai West, higher number of COVID-19 positive cases had been recorded, Dr. Arjun Kumar said. Identifying this trend in the earlier stage, the district administration has decided to set up Mini COVID-19 Care Centres, said District COVID-19 Monitoring Officer B. Chandra Mohan. “Earlier identification, isolation and treatment will help in breaking the chain of COVID-19 in rural areas,” he added. Additional Director of Panchayats A. Chelladurai said that while they have identified around 130 village panchayats with more number of cases, Mini COVID-19 Care Centres will initially be set up at 100 village panchayats. Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy inaugurated one such facility at Puliyampatti village of T. Kallupatti block on Thursday. Members of self-help groups and anganwadi workers were engaged in door-to-door screening to identify residents with Influenza-like-Illness symptoms. They will also collect details of those who had completed their COVID-19 vaccination in each household. Samples will be lifted from the symptomatic persons for RT-PCR test. Positive people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with good vitals will be given treatment at the Mini COVID-19 Care Centres, said Dr. Chandra Mohan. “Since many households in rural areas do not have separate rooms for self-isolation, these centres will be of help to them,” he said. Manpower Each mini centre will have a minimum of 10 beds. A trained health worker will be present at the Centre to monitor patients under the supervision of the medical officer of the Primary Health Centre concerned. “If the patient’s severity level increases, the patient will be taken to the bigger treatment centres,” said Dr. Chandra Mohan. The mini centres also help in reducing the burden on tertiary healthcare centres like Government Rajaji Hospital, said Mr. Chelladurai. All the Mini COVID-19 Care Centres were likely to become functional in the next few days, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mini-covid-19-care-centres-to-be-set-up-in-100-villages/article34662787.ece

28 May 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||With good storage in dams, farmers await water release||Widespread rainfall along the catchment areas in western ghats since December has enabled a comfortable storage level in Mullaperiyar dam, Vaigai dam and other reservoirs in Theni and Dindigul districts. As per data from the PWD, the water level in Periyar dam was 130.60 feet on Thursday while it was 112.60 ft. during the corresponding period last year. In Vaigai dam, the level was 66.27 ft (39.67 ft last year). Storage in Shanmuganadhi, Sathayar, Manjalar and Marudanadhi dams is also comfortable and 30% more than last year. Buoyant over the good storage, farmers in Cumbum valley in Theni district have appealed to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to announce the release of water for irrigation for the first crop by June 1. It will benefit farmers in Theni, Dindigul and Madurai districts. According to the officials, when the storage level crosses 120 ft. in Periyar dam, the water can be released. Similarly, the combined Periyar credit also stood at 7,723 mcft, which was more than sufficient as 4,000 mcft was enough to release water. In Madurai district, farmers who depend on Periyar Main Canal - from Peranai to Kallandiri - expect the water release to start preliminary activities on paddy fields. Close to 10,000 hectares of paddy crop would be raised as first crop. Water level Water level in Papanasam dam on Thursday stood at 129.15 ft.

28 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Aavin begins procurement from non-members of coop societies||The Tiruchi District Milk Producers’ Union, popularly known as Aavin, has begun procuring milk from farmers, who are not members of cooperative milk societies. The move comes in the wake of a section of private dairies refusing to procure milk from farmers, who have ‘buy back’ arrangements with them, due to disruption of supply chain after imposition of total lockdown. While Aavin procures milk directly from its member societies in different parts of Tiruchi, Perambalur and Ariyalur districts, private dairies have their own network of farmers, who raise milch animals in Thuraiyur, Karattampatti, Thottiyam, Musiri, Thathaiyengarpettai and other rural areas. Although the farmers supply milk to private companies, more than 70% cattle growers mainly patronise the Tiruchi District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union. According to industry sources, on an average, Tiruchi Aavin procures 4.5 lakh litres of milk from its member societies daily. The daily procurement of milk by private companies pegs at 2 lakh litres in normal circumstances. However, it is said that except a few organised private dairies, most of the small dairies have reduced the procurement of milk from farmers by 30% to 40% due to the impact of total lockdown, forcing them to sell milk at throwaway prices in their villages. Hit by revenue loss, some farmers brought it to the notice of the State government and Aavin management. A senior official of Aavin in Tiruchi told The Hindu that the Minister for Dairy Development had instructed the officials of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers’ Union to procure milk from farmers, who were not part of the cooperative milk societies. Based on it, instructions had been given to the societies. Priority was being extended to procure milk from farmers, who were once part of the cooperative societies and switched over to private firms. There was no limit for milk procurement. The official added that the procurement would generally come down in April and May due to peak summer. However, on an average, it has been procuring 4.8 lakh litres a day over the last few weeks. Procurement of milk from non-member societies could be among the reasons for a high quantum of milk procurement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aavin-begins-procurement-from-non-members-of-coop-societies/article34663137.ece

28 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Volunteers set up COVID-19 helpline||Volunteers affiliated to the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) and the Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIO) have set up an Information and Counselling Centre for COVID-19 patients at Noor ul Huda Masjid in Alwarthope in the city. The volunteers provide guidance for patients including availability of beds in hospitals, connect them to distributors of oxygen concentrators and provide tele-counselling through a team of doctor-volunteers. The centre, which works from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. seeks to clarify all questions a patient who has contracted COVID-19 might have. “There are many who call us, anxious about symptoms and what might happen to them. The fear of the infection is worse than the infection itself,” I. Nawaz Khan, Social Service In-charge - Tiruchi, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind told The Hindu . As many as 30 volunteers were manning two helpline numbers. “We have deployed them in shifts of two hours each. We do not want the volunteers, who are young, to burn-out either,” Mr. Khan said. The volunteers monitor the Tamil Nadu government websites, several WhatsApp groups and keep in touch with doctors at all COVID-19 treating hospitals in the city to provide information on bed availability. The group also has around 20 doctor-volunteers who take tele-consultations free of cost. “We have doctors from across Tamil Nadu who have volunteered to talk to patients to alleviate their stress and to guide them to get the necessary medical treatment,” he said. Sometimes, the helpline also gets requests from patients for food. A team of around four members ensure that it is provided. The team also distributes around 100 food packets for destitutes living in various parts of Tiruchi. The Minister for Municipal Administration, Urban and Water Supply, K. N. Nehru had inaugurated the volunteer group a few days ago. “On the first day we got around 35 calls, and a few days later, on Wednesday, we got over 40 calls. As the awareness of our availability increases, we will get more calls,” Mr. Khan said. People with COVID-19 symptoms and those who need guidance of a doctor, information on hospital beds or any COVID-19 related query can call 82703 40296 or 99526 95247.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/volunteers-set-up-covid-19-helpline/article34663146.ece

Palaniswami about disruption to oxygen supply to COVOD-19 patients in treatment, Medical and Family Welfare Minister M. Subramanian said there were no deaths in Tamil Nadu due to oxygen shortage. He was talking to reporters here on Thursday after reviewing COVID preventive measures with officials in the district. “Till the new government took charge (on May 7), Mr. Palaniswami was heading the caretaker government. The daily medical oxygen stock till then was only 250 tonnes. With increasing viral infection the demand rose up to 575 tonnes. However, we managed with the available stock and there were no deaths due to oxygen shortage,” he said. Mr. Subramanian said Tamil Nadu had increased oxygen stock to 650 MT in the last 20 days. The government would award a tender for vaccination on June 6 and the State was expected to get 3.5 lakh doses in six months. “We have got 80 lakh doses from the Centre and another 70 lakh doses will come by then,” Mr. Subramanian said. Stating that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had consulted industrialists, traders, voluntary organisations and an all-party MLAs’ committee, the Minister said there was no need for a centralised committee to review COVID situation, as suggested by BJP MLA Vanathi Srinivasan. Stating that Ms. Vanathi was holding a national-level party post, he said she should use that position to fulfil the additional demands of the State. T.R. Baalu deputed The Chief Minister had deputed DMK MP T.R. Baalu to New Delhi to coordinate with various Ministers and officials to ensure timely oxygen supply, Remdesivir and vaccines. Mr. Subramanian also took stock of COVID-19 situation in Theni district.

For over the last year, A.N. Saravanan says they have fed over 50,000 persons. Porridge made of an assortment of rich kitchen condiments that include cumin, black cumin, fennel seeds, asafoetida, mint, garlic, ginger, rice, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, onions, coriander, salt, oregano and fenugreek are served to the public by a group of volunteers. Mr. Saravanan’s kitchen is put to work at 7.30 p.m., “because the water needs boiling time.” The porridge is ready by 5.30 a.m, he says. The condiments are boiled to reduction in containers before the porridge is whipped up by the early hours of the morning. “I bought special barrels from Tirupathur during the lockdown a few weeks ago,” he says. This year, he restarted serving up his porridge through groups of volunteers in different locations since April. With no fear of the pandemic, and armed with volunteer cards, the group of men are distributing barrels in different locations starting from MC Palli and along the way, where the local volunteers distribute it to the people.“But outside the government hospital here, our own group distributes the porridge to the families of patients, or anyone who wants to drink,” he says. Ask Mr. Saravanan of an approximate quantity of porridge his staff whips ups, and he says over 1,000 litres per day. As for the funds to keep the flames burning, Mr. Saravanan says he pumps back his earnings from the building works he takes up for the government for feeding the public “with a healing-centric Siddhar based diet,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-glass-of-kindness-in-the-form-of-rice-porridge/article34662710.ece

The Industrial Associations of Coimbatore appealed to the Union Finance Minister to announce a stimulus package for MSMEs that are affected by the pandemic and lockdown. The interest moratorium for six months has been debited with the entire six months interest on March 31, this year. Further, one-year interest moratorium for principal repayment will start for all the units from June. The units that are already under stress due to interest moratorium and price increase of raw materials, will not be able to meet the payment deadline set by the banks. Tiruppur Exporters’ Association president Raja M. Shanmugham said in a press release that the units should get three moratorium for all existing loans. The Coimbatore and Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association president C. Sivakumar said in a press release that the Goods and Services Tax on job working units should be reduced to 5 %, the penalty for those who pay the tax beyond the stipulated time should be withdrawn given the pandemic impact, and there should be more relaxations in GST returns filing, etc. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman A. Sakthivel said the Central government should direct State governments to exempt garment exporting units from lockdown as these factories cater to seasonal needs of international customers.

At least three families claimed to have had close sightings of the animal which had a dark grey coat. Following the complaint, the Forest Department staff visited the place on Thursday and opined that the elusive animal could be a jungle cat ( Felis Chaus). The staff examined the pug marks of the animal. They ruled out that the pug mark was not of a leopard. “A woman who supplies vegetables to my family spotted the big cat three days ago in an okra field. She told me that the animal frightened her. A few others from the locality also sighted the same animal,” said N. Rangarajan of Siva Nagar. A.M.N. Siva, forest range officer, Coimbatore, said that the animal spotted by the villagers could possibly be a jungle cat. According to the officer, the jungle cat, which feeds on birds and rodents among others, would not cause any harm to humans. Meanwhile, the Department late on Thursday decided to send a biologist to the location and examine the pugmark to ascertain the identity of the animal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kalapatti-residents-complain-about-presence-of-an-unusual-animal/article34662724.ece

Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has instructed officials to file a case with the jurisdictional police against the procession under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Officers at Shahapur police station said the COVID-19 nodal officers were yet to approach them with acomplaint. Meanwhile, Mr. Patil said the Agnihotra rituals would continue till the second week of June and would be observed by 300 families. Mr. Patil had attracted the attention of the State by joining a public Agnihotra event organised by his followers in old Belagavi area. A slow-burning fire with wood and medicinal herbs was taken around the old city in a push cart. According to the leader, around 50 families had performed the ritual in their homes. He claimed that the ritual was meant to “rid the city of COVID-19 virus droplets from the air”. He also argued it was not a violation of the lockdown norms. He claimed ancient Indian medicinal systems like Ayurveda stressed on the importance of such rituals. “This is our effort to remind ourselves about Agnihotra and other native medicinal practices,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-dc-promises-action-over-ritual/article34662664.ece

28 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP shuts down PHAST portal over fears of data breach||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has woken up to a security lapse in the collection of COVID-19 test data that includes health records of citizens collected for its PHAST (Public Health Activities, Surveillance and Tracking) portal. This breach, which allows a hacker to access information by running a script, was highlighted by the Free Software Movement of India. After they showed how the data could be easily accessed just with the phone numbers, BBMP on Wednesday, shut down the site. The sensitive data that was published on the portal included patients’ name, age, gender, patient ID, ICMR test ID, lab name, test result (positive/ negative), sample collected and received date, sample type, hospital name (if the patient is hospitalized), status of symptoms. This information was published on the portal by a BBMP contractor. The Free Software Movement of India has urged officials to not only conduct a security audit but to also take action against the software company for “its carelessness in building software without any security.” In a letter to BBMP Special Commissioner (Health and IT) P. Rajendra Cholan, Kiran Chandra, general secretary of Free Software Movement of India, said it was not hard for a data broker to harness these details by writing an automated script. “The IT Rules of 2011 clearly states that health record information is ‘sensitive’ data and the collection, storage and disclosure of such data must be bound by ‘Reasonable security practices and procedures’. This is a clear violation of IT Rules (2011) and shows an appalling lack of attention to protecting individual’s personal and sensitive data. The lack of proper security practices for sensitive health record data, especially in the midst of the peak of the pandemic can lead to misuse, exploitation and poses a catastrophic risk overall,” the letter read. Srinivas Kodali, also from Free Software Movement of India, said that it was still unclear how many people were making use of this data. But he stressed on the immediate need for the civic body to take up a cyber security audit, as mandated under the IT Act. He pointed out that this was not the first time such issues of personal data breach had happened in the BBMP and cited data leak from the civic body’s call centres, which lead to the alleged bed blocking scam. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta clarified that the site was made accessible to the public in October last year for citizens to download their COVID-19 certificates, to access which they had to key in both the SRF ID and mobile number. However, when the SRF ID generation started to get delayed, a decision was taken to do away with it and just keep the mobile number field. “This was neither a design fault or any security lapse. It was a feature to allow easy access,” he said. However, he admitted that an additional security feature, such as OTP, could have been introduced. He added that BBMP would once again check the data design. Stating that security audits are taken up regularly, he said administrative action would be taken to set right any lapses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-shuts-down-phast-portal-over-fears-of-data-breach/article34662646.ece

Yediyurappa amid the COVID-19 crisis has not gone down well with the high command, which has chosen to ignore the issue for now. “This is not the time for anyone to raise the issue of leadership change as people are suffering because of the pandemic,” a prominent Central party leader told The Hindu . Indicating that Central leaders would not spend time on it, he added, “There is no proposal before the high command to change the Chief Minister for now.” Minister C.P. Yogeshwar and MLA Arvind Bellad were camping in New Delhi apparently to meet the party high command on the issue of leadership change, while a few more MLAs were expected to join them. However, they had to return to the State as the leaders did not show much interest in holding consultations on the issue. Safe only for now? However, it appears that Mr. Yediyurappa is safe only for now as there is no clarity on what will happen in the State once the pandemic crisis eases. Some State unit senior leaders feel there is a possibility of the Central leadership taking a fresh look at the issue after normalcy returns. However, the Chief Minister’s camp argues that the high command may not venture into disturbing the status quo if recovery from COVID-19 is prolonged, as not much time will be left then for the next Assembly elections, due to be held in 2023. Meanwhile, a section of party old-timers, upset with Mr. Yediyurappa’s style of functioning, appears to be persistent with the demand for convening a legislature party meeting in the presence of the party’s Central observers. Speculation is rife that they are trying to collect signatures of like-minded legislators and forward the petition to the party high command in three or four days. Their contention is that the Mr. Yediyurappa-led government has not been handing the COVID-19 situation well and there is interference in administration by Mr. Yediyurappa’s son Vijayendra. They had also flagged the issue of the JSW land sale, which the government put on hold on Thursday. They have underlined the need to direct the Yediyurappa government to handle the pandemic efficiently. However, they have not set any time frame for holding the meeting.  COVID-19 is my only priority right now... If some leaders went somewhere, they were given the rightanswer and sent back B.S.

28 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccine doses in private hospitals under scrutiny||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed both the Centre and State government to consider issuing directions to private hospitals on the vaccination process. It did so after taking note of the situation created by restricting COVID-19 vaccines only for frontline workers and priority groups for those aged 18-44 in all government vaccination centres, but not in private hospitals. A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the directions while hearing PIL petitions related to issues cropping up due to COVID-19. Pointing out several anomalies in the vaccination process in Karnataka, the bench noted that Covaxin, supply of which is much lesser than required, is being utilised only for the second dose for those aged above 45 years in government centres. But private hospitals are administering this vaccine, both the first and second dose, for anyone over the age of 18. Private hospitals are administering Covishield first and second dose to anyone over the age of 18, the bench noted. Submission by PHANA The bench recorded the statement of H.M. Prasanna, President of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association, that the State government has issued advisory to use Covaxin only for the second dose for those above 45 years. He pointed out that private hospitals, as on date, are entitled to administer both the doses of both the vaccines for all persons above the age of 18 without any restriction as long as people register on the Cowin portal. On a query by the court on why the State government did not impose such restrictions on private hospitals, Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi said that the private hospitals are ‘partners’ with the government on COVID-19 health management and, hence, it did not impose restrictions. The State government’s restrictions have created a scenario in which those belonging to 18-44 age group cannot get the first dose of any of the two vaccines at government centres unless they are frontline workers or belong to a priority group, but can get the first dose in private hospitals by paying a fee, the bench said. Meanwhile, the bench directed the State government to ensure that frontline workers and specified priority groups are not prevented from taking the vaccine merely because they were unable to register for the same, and the authorities must evolve a mechanism for their registration for the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccine-doses-in-private-hospitals-under-scrutiny/article34662644.ece

His friend would contact those family members, and depending on how desperate the situation was, offer to arrange for a bed at a price,” said a senior police officer. Varun allegedly used his position in the war room to arrange for a bed. “They would share the money they took from the patients’ families.” “We have taken custody of the accused, and are investigating their bank account details and transactions to ascertain how many patients they took advantage of,” the senior police officer added. The police are yet to determine whether more people were involved. Since it took over the investigation, the CCB has arrested as many as 11 people in a scam where hospital beds were reportedly being blocked in the name of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in home isolation, only to be sold to other patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bed-scam-two-arrested/article34662653.ece

28 May 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Positivity rate dips but mortality remains high||Even though the number of fresh COVID-19 infections and the positivity rate has begun showing a marked decline in Karnataka over the last few days, there appears to be no such respite in case fatality rate (CFR). The number of new cases, which had surpassed the 50,000 mark in the first week of May by reaching 50,112 on May 5 and reporting anywhere between 47,000 to 50,000 till May 9, has substantially decreased to reach 22,758 on May 25. The daily positivity rate, which had shot up to almost 40 per cent by recording 39.7 per cent on May 17, has eased to less than 20 per cent by reporting 19.48 per cent on May 26. However, the daily tally of deaths due to COVID-19 continues to mount. The CFR, which remained less than 1 per cent on most days during April, went up from the first week of May before crossing the 2 percent mark last Sunday (May 23) when it reached a staggering 2.4 per cent. As many as 626 COVID-19 deaths were reported in the State on May 23, the highest so far. How mortality went up Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology C N Manjunath, who is also the nodal officer for laboratories and testing in the State’s COVID-19 Task Force, said there is always a “lag period” of two to three weeks after decline in daily infections and positivity rate for the CFR to come down. He attributed the increase in CFR to the mortality of accumulated sick persons, who had been hospitalised for more than 10 days. Dr. Manjunath said the decline in new infections and positivity in large cities like Bengaluru will be followed by a corresponding decline even in other districts and rural parts of the State after a gap of two to three weeks. ‘No need to extend lockdown, but...’ When asked if there would be a need for extending the lockdown in the State, Dr. Manjunath felt that the June 7 deadline would be enough provided the restrictions on gathering of people for social, political or religious purposes remain in place for another six months while ramping up the vaccination process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/positivity-rate-dips-but-mortality-remains-high/article34662648.ece

The project has been launched in 45 wards and will soon be extended to other parts of the city. The first such pan-city project in Asia, it will be be spearheaded by COVIDactionCollab (CAC), a nationwide network of over 300 organisations working on COVID-19 relief and recovery, and supported by Skoll Foundation and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Dr. Angela Chaudhuri, Health Lead, CAC, said, “While there have been many experiments and studies on finding traces of the COVID-19 virus in sewage, Bengaluru will be joining the Netherlands, Finland, and Israel in a path-breaking surveillance system with experts from all over the world supporting the initiative.” Over the last year, scientists around the world have discovered that waste-water testing can serve as a cost-effective early warning system, often predicting an increase in COVID-19 infections before the number of cases has risen. As part of the initiative, a ‘Precision Health Platform’ will test sewage from both sewered and non-sewered waste-water in Bengaluru to identify clusters of new infections. The platform will aid early detection of clusters, even before tests start showing cases, helping policy-makers to make early interventions, CAC said. “The system will cover over 75% of Bengaluru’s nine million population by generating over 90 data points per week, signalling the emerging COVID-19 clusters or signalling a COVID-19 cluster’s exit from an area. We are happy to be the first in India to launch this platform,” said Rakesh Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department and Administrator, BBMP. CAC will provide training to sanitation workers and lab technicians on collecting and transporting sewage samples to labs for testing, analysing and safe disposal.

Kumaraswamy, in May 2019, had decided to execute an absolute sale deed in favour of JSW Steel Ltd, which operates a 12-million tonne steel plant in Toranagal, saying that the firm had fulfilled all commitments under the lease-cum-sale agreement. The BJP, then in the Opposition, had strongly opposed the sale of land. Congress MLA H.K. Patil had flagged the issue first when the Kumaraswamy-led government decided on absolute sale of land to the company. The JD(S)-BJP coalition government headed by Mr. Kumaraswamy in 2006-07 executed the lease-cum-sale agreement with JSW Steel. Mr. Anand Singh, who quit the Congress and resigned from the membership of the Legislative Assembly in 2019, opposing the Kumaraswamy-led government’s decision to sell land to JSW Steel, had strongly opposed the April 26 Cabinet decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/move-to-sell-land-to-jsw-steel-on-hold/article34662674.ece

Once the cases come down there, it will be possible to lift the lockdown in the district. The spread of the virus is moderating in the district and the test positivity rate has come down after the lockdown. Now, it is time to concentrate on the plantation areas, he says. It has been found that the plantation areas are more vulnerable to COVID-19. The government had exempted the plantation sector from the lockdown as it provided livelihood to a large number of persons. However, Elappara, Pallivasal, Kumily, Munnar, and Devikulam grama panchayats have shown an increase in cases. Testing stepped up While the cardamom plantations are mostly concentrated in Udumbanchola taluk, tea plantations are more in Peerumade and Devikulam taluk. The district administration had banned daily arrival of workers from Tamil Nadu to the cardamom plantations in border areas. Testing level has also been increased in these areas. The counter measures against the disease in the plantation areas are being done by the Health Department in association with estate managements. Unlike in forest settlements, where the community system of living is followed, an accurate tally of the number of infected persons in the plantations is difficult to compile. Any delay in timely diagnosis will result in the spread of the virus as estate workers live in single-line quarters. Officials said nearly 400 people have tested positive in the plantation grama panchayats of Devikulam and Munnar so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/idukki-to-focus-on-pandemic-fight-in-plantation-areas/article34663127.ece

He was inaugurating an online protest convened by Janakeeya Prathirodha Samithi on Thursday. In a press statement, CPI(M) leader Elamaram Karim said the Centre was trying to repeat what it was doing in Kashmir, in Lakshadweep. The CPI’s Binoy Vishwam lamented that even MPs were being denied permission to visit Lakshadweep. AICC secretary in charge of Kerala Vishwanathan Perumal is expected to meet Mr. Patel on Friday, to apprise him of concerns of islanders, it is learnt. “The reforms are a denial of the Constitutional rights of the islanders. Seeds of hatred are being sown in the peaceful locale,” said Hibi Eden, MP. “Islanders were not consulted while rolling out the sequence of new laws, from the Goonda Act to the pre-condition that a medical board ought to examine a patient’s condition for being airlifted to Kerala for treatment.

Govindan has said the government will rejig local bodies to equip them to become pivots of job creation through linkages with productive and service sectors. Spelling out his priorities, Mr. Govindan told The Hindu over the phone that the government would review the merits and shortcomings, if any, of the decentralised planning being implemented in the State as part of People’s Plan Campaign over the past 25 years. The plan process had been able to guarantee basic amenities, including housing, educational, health care and means of livelihood, for people in the lower strata of society. “Kerala is the only State where basic amenities are available for people to lead a quality life, especially those from the scheduled and backward communities and financially weaker sections among upper castes.” The government now wanted to further carry forward these achievements. Its mission now was to turn local bodies into major centres that could provide jobs. Poverty audit Among the priorities of the government was to launch a people’s audit to identify a small section of people who still live in poverty. The local bodies would be able to intervene in efforts to provide job training and jobs to the educated unemployed, including homemakers. The government would take the initiative to involve information technology companies to ensure jobs to this section. Noting that the government had already taken steps to strengthen the agricultural sector by fixing floor price for farm produce in its first term, the Minister said the government’s focus was to guarantee better quality of life to all sections. The Left Democratic Front’s promise to implement a pension scheme for homemakers was part of this plan, he said. Waste treatment He said the government would implement the proposed Rs. 2,500-crore World Bank-aided project for centralised garbage treatment. A Statewide ward-level sanitation drive would be launched on June 5 and June 6 under the aegis of the local bodies in association with the Health Department to combat COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-to-be-made-job-portals/article34662817.ece

In fact, as early as 2019, NITI-Aayog Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant had approved “Holistic development of identified islands” for the development of islanders on the ecologically protected isles of Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar.

However, sources said the issue acquired a political dimension when Mr. Patel decided to tackle the multiple power centres in Lakshadweep, including MP representing the islands P.P. Mohammed Faizal, village panchayats, and the district panchayat. Mr. Patel told The Hindu over the phone on Thursday that he had no issues either with the MP or the locally elected representatives in Lakshadweep. “I have no problems with anyone,” he said. “The people of Lakshadweep are in such a pitiable State even after 70 years of freedom.

Police, Health and Revenue authorities heaved a sigh of relief as the TPR plummeted to 16.82%. The State’s TPR average is 17.87%. Particularly gleeful was the police force led by District Police Superintendent Sujit Das S. The police had employed 1,000-odd personnel, including women, on round-the-clock duty to ensure the lockdown in the tightest manner. On May 13, when Malappuram was widely portrayed as a COVID-19 volcano, the district’s TPR was 43%, the highest in the State. And, it continued to remain on top in coronavirus infection for the next several days even as other districts began to ease restrictions. “We earned a lot of flak for the stringent measures we took. But everything was for the wellness of the district and its people. Today, with the test positivity rate having dipped to 16.82%, we have every reason to cheer,” said Mr. Sujit Das. Although Malappuram registered 4,212 positive cases on Thursday, concerted efforts by the police, Health, Revenue and other departments by involving civic body members paid dividends by bringing down the TPR. As many as 4,505 persons recovered from the disease on Thursday. However, District Medical Officer K. Sakeena warned that people should remain at home to check the spread of the virus.

The Cabinet, at its meeting held on April 26, 2021, had decided to sell the land to JSW Steel. This decision had been criticised by the Opposition and a section of BJP leaders. Briefing presspersons after a Cabinet meeting, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Cabinet has decided not to implement its earlier decision following a petition filed in the High Court and the pending case in the Supreme Court. “The earlier decision is put on hold. It will not be carried out,” the Minister said. The decision was criticised by many, including Minister for Infrastructure Development Anand Singh. The party high command too had reportedly expressed its views against the sale of land and it was conveyed to the government during Mr. Bommai’s meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah during his Delhi visit a few days ago.  The coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy, in May 2019, had decided to execute an absolute sale deed in favour of JSW Steel Ltd, which operates a 12-million tonne steel plant in Toranagal, saying that the firm had fulfilled all commitments under the lease-cum-sale agreement. The BJP, then in the Opposition, had strongly opposed the sale of land. Congress MLA H.K. Patil had flagged the issue first when the Kumaraswamy-led government decided on absolute sale of land to the company. The JD(S)-BJP coalition government headed by Mr. Kumaraswamy in 2006-07 executed the lease-cum-sale agreement with JSW Steel. Mr. Anand Singh, who quit the Congress and resigned from the membership of the Legislative Assembly in 2019, opposing the Kumaraswamy-led government’s decision to sell land to JSW Steel, had strongly opposed the April 26 Cabinet decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-puts-on-hold-plan-to-sell-land-to-jsw-steel/article34662551.ece

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa chaired a meeting with Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar, Advocate-General Prabhuling Navadgi, and senior officials of the Water Resources Department and took the decision. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told mediapersons that a petition would be filed before the NGT seeking the recall of its order. The NGT, acting suo motu based on a media report, had ordered the appointment of the joint committee and the submission of a report on or before July 5. The NGT also directed the joint committee to assess the damage caused to the environment in case of any construction made and to determine the compensation payable by the authorities responsible for it. The State government has questioned the NGT decision since the case is pending before the Supreme Court as Tamil Nadu has challenged the construction of the project. Karnataka had decided to construct the reservoir across the Cauvery in Kanakapura, proposed for catering to the drinking water needs of Bengaluru and Ramanagaram district. In 2018, Tamil Nadu moved a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against the State for “wilful disobedience” of the apex court order on sharing Cauvery waters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mekedatu-karnataka-to-challenge-ngt-decision/article34662552.ece

District Forest Officer (Chittoor East-Wildlife) G.G. Narentheran said that after attacking the two persons, the elephant moved towards the thin forest cover behind the Collectorate located on the Chittoor-Vellore highway. The elephant is one of a three-member “bachelors’ group,” which entered Chittoor district from Tamil Nadu forests in January. The group roamed the fields and hilly terrain in the Nagari plains between Narayanavanam and Karveti Nagaram for four months. The herd killed a night watchman, and injured four villagers in Puttur and Karveti Nagaram ranges. One of the trio turned a loner in early March, and was reportedly electrocuted in a sugarcane field near Narayanavanam on May 22. The two other jumbos also got separated and turned into loners. One of them entered the Chittoor west division on May 18 night, but the other created a flutter near Chittoor, attacking two persons on Wednesday. The officials expressed confidence that the last of the bachelors’ group would be driven into the West division, which hosts the Koundinya sanctuary with over 50 elephants, including resident and migrant population of jumbos. Mr. Narentheran said an immediate relief of Rs. 1 lakh was given to the family members of Vajravelu, who was killed by the elephant. “We will represent with the government for extending Rs. 5 lakh ex gratia to the victim’s family,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-steps-up-efforts-to-track-rogue-elephant/article34662555.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has sought field-level inputs. Traditional occupations have been badly hit, and many who are dependent on them are vulnerable,” said Mr. Gopala Krishna. Referring to the life of the toddy-tappers, he said: “Persons engaged in the occupation have to tap toddy thrice every day. In such working conditions, they are prone to the risk of contracting COVID-19.” The Minister distributed face masks to the toddy-tappers in the segment, and advised them to be cautious while selling toddy to customers. Mr. Gopala Krishna directed the officials of the Agriculture Department and the managements of various food processing units to ensure a safe working environment for the workers to prevent the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-studying-lockdown-impact-on-traditional-occupations/article34663155.ece
28 May 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Village pools Rs. 50 lakh for CCC in E. Godavari||The local residents of Gollala Maamidada village in East Godavari district have set up a 30-bed COVID Care Centre (CCC) in their village by raising Rs. 50 lakh through contributions, to ensure emergency healthcare within the reach of the villagers. The district officials have permitted the villagers to convert the Primary Health Centre into the CCC, which was inaugurated by Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy on Thursday. In the first wave of COVID-19 that broke out last year, the village was a hotspot in the district with hundreds of locals infected by the virus. The local people formed a social media group where the issue has been discussed and a decision has been arrived at to pool funds to set up the CCC. Anaparthi MLA Satti Suryanarayana Reddy, senior journalist Sabbella Sivannarayana Reddy and a few other individuals played a key role in translating the idea into a reality. Mr. Muralidhar Reddy appreciated the initiative and assured the local people of necessary support from the government and deployment of medical and health staff to run the CCC. Isolation facility Another local resident and founder of Gollala Maamidada Education Society D.R.K. Reddy has offered his college buildings to convert them into a 300-bed home isolation facility for patients from across the district. It is likely to be opened this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/village-pools-rs-50-lakh-for-ccc-in-e-godavari/article34663166.ece
28 May 2021||KHAMMAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana police tighten vigil along inter-State border||The police have tightened vigil on remote rural roads in Kallur, Yerrupalem and various other mandals along the border with Andhra Pradesh to curb unauthorised inter-State vehicular movement and strictly enforce the COVID-19 lockdown. In several border villages, the local youths volunteered to complement the efforts of the police to maintain constant surveillance on the rural roads to help break the chain of COVID-19 transmission, sources said. The move comes amid reports of some errant motorists using alternative short-cut routes to circumvent the border checkposts in view of the round-the-clock strict vigil at the border points. Apart from ramping up surveillance at the regular border checkposts, the police have mounted vigil on the rural roads in the border villages at Vennavalli and Raghunadhagudem in Kallur and elsewhere in the district. As many as 15 checkposts along the inter-State borders and an equal number of checkposts along the internal roads in border mandals have been functioning round the clock. This apart, 37 police pickets have been set up at all the entry and exit points all along the rural roads across the district to enforce the lockdown curbs. As the strict lockdown regulations are in force, vehicles having the mandatory e-passes and those involved in emergency and essential services as per the stipulated norms are being allowed to pass through the border checkposts. More than 1200 vehicles were seized for allegedly violating the lockdown regulations across the district over the past fortnight. In two separate incidents, the Thallada and Mudigonda police seized a huge quantity of liquor bottles while being illegally transported to the border villages by suspected belt shop organisers during vehicle checking drives two days ago, sources added. Khammam Police Commissioner Vishnu S Warrier on Thursday visited the border checkposts in Bonakal and Madhira mandals. He monitored the enforcement of the lockdown norms in the two border mandals. On Wednesday, Mr. Warrier visited the border checkpost at Muthagudem in Penuballi mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-tighten-vigil-along-inter-state-border/article34663109.ece
28 May 2021||Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Reforms will benefit islanders: Collector||The reforms rolled out in Lakshadweep are aimed at the betterment of islanders. Vested interests are behind campaign to portray the administration in poor light, Lakshadweep Collector S. Asker Ali said on Thursday. The reforms were aimed at optimising the potential of the isles, mainly in the tourism, fisheries and agriculture sectors, he said, replying to concerns over protests against the reforms spearheaded by new administrator Praful Khoda Patel. “The protests do not reflect the sentiment of the residents of the islands,” Mr. Ali told mediapersons here. On the decision to remove beef from the noon meal scheme and to ban slaughtering, he said a policy decision had been taken in this regard. Fish and eggs were healthier for children. Moreover, fish was readily available in the islands and it would help local fishermen sell their catch, said Mr. Ali in the first official response after protests arose over the new rules being imposed in the islands. While admitting that prohibition was in vogue in the isles, Mr. Ali said the Administration could exempt resorts and other properties, which were given licence to serve liquor within their premises during a specified time span, from the ambit. Liquor was served only to tourists and not sold to islanders, he said. About concerns of potential rights violations if the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act (having provisions similar to the Goondas Act — like the one permitting preventive detention without trial for a specified time) was invoked in the hitherto peaceful isles, Mr. Ali said this was aimed at reigning in cases of narcotics, illegal trade and POSCO, which were of late “increasing” in the isles. Such preventive steps were important from the security and strategic point of view. While acknowledging that protests were on in Kochi and many other parts of Kerala, Mr. Ali rebutted reports that there were largescale protests in the isles against the reforms introduced by the administration. Lakshadweep isles had similar geographical peculiarities as the Maldives. But tourism infra was very limited. The administration was working in tandem with the NITI Aayog to augment infra in the three isles. On many cargo ships which used to call at Beypore being diverted to Mangaluru, he said they saved 75 nautical miles distance and nine hours time, apart from Rs. 200 per tonne of cargo. To pass resolution Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Assembly would pass a resolution expressing solidarity with the people of Lakshadweep. Their protest against the island administration had evoked a “strong sentiment” in Kerala, he said. Earlier, Speaker M.B. Rajesh said he had received several requests to move a resolution in the Assembly to pledge solidarity with the residents of Lakshadweep.

28 May 2021||KOTTAYAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Family wants death of nurse in U.K. probed||The relatives of a 41-year-old Keralite nurse from Kottayam, who died last week at Redditch, United Kingdom, have approached the Union and State governments seeking a probe into ‘the mystery behind her death.’ The deceased, Sheeja Krishnan of Chirakkadavu near Ponkunnam, had been staying in the U.K. along with husband Baiju and two children for about 18 years. The initial reports about her death, reportedly due to cardiac arrest, had emerged earlier last week. Voice message A follow-up inquiry by her relatives in Kottayam, however, revealed that the woman had committed suicide by hanging herself at her house. Adding to their suspicion, they also recovered a voice message by her, in which she had accused her husband of domestic violence. “The voice clip, sent to one of her friends just hours before the death, clearly suggests that she has not received justice,” said Shaiju Krishnan, her brother. According to him, the family is awaiting her post-mortem report to decide whether to initiate prosecution proceedings against the husband. ‘Bring back her body’ They have approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan seeking a probe into the husband’s role in her death while also bringing back the mortal remains to home. “Efforts are on to apprise the local municipal authority at Redditch as well as the Indian High Commission office in the U.K.,” added Mr. Krishnan. Official sources pointed to certain technical issues involved in bringing back her body, which also required the consent of her husband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/family-wants-death-of-nurse-in-uk-probed/article34662561.ece
28 May 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Recreation therapy’ helps police personnel beat virus||In an attempt to ensure speedy recovery of the police personnel who have contracted coronavirus, the Prakasam Police have set up a 100-bed COVID Care Centre where the patients are not only being provided with better treatment but also all the care to boost their morale. As part of the initiative launched by Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal, the patients undergo ‘recreation therapy’ at the COVID Care Centre. According to the SP, providing the state-of-the-art healthcare facilities including oxygen concentrators are not enough to ensure a speedy recovery, but the ambiance where they are being treated also matters. “Many police personnel and their family members, after contracting the infection, go into depression. I have been insisting that mental stamina coupled with good treatment can ensure a speedy recovery,” said Mr. Kaushal. Arrangements have been done for light music for about 250 personnel and their family members undergoing treatment at the COVID Care Centre. The women personnel undergoing treatment are also being encouraged to take a break from the routine and exhibit their artistic talent by taking part in rangoli competition. Physical exercises Around 200 personnel, after undergoing treatment at the COVID Care Centre, have recovered and resumed their duties again. For them, the day starts with a morning walk, physical exercises, yoga and meditation at the sprawling grounds near the CCC. “I have contracted the infection for the second time. I underwent treatment at the Government General Hospital when I was infected for the first time. The CCC has all the arrangements to ensure that we recover in a good ambiance,” said Ongole I Town CI Ch.Sitaramaiah.  The personnel thanked Dr. Bhanumathi, Medical Officer, Prakasam District Police Welfare Clinic Unit, for providing the best healthcare services in a congenial atmosphere at the CCC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/recreation-therapy-helps-police-personnel-beat-virus/article34662619.ece

28 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tiny harbinger of rain widely sighted||Sightings of Little Bloodtail or Lyriothemis acigastra , a small, colourful and elusive dragonfly whose life cycle is tied to the southwest monsoon, has been widely recorded in Kerala. Large numbers of the dragonfly are known to emerge from aquatic larval stage with the first rain of June. They disappear as the southwest monsoon wanes by September. In 2015, a colony of this species of dragonfly was discovered by Jeevan Jose from Kadavoor village in Ernakulam. Over a span of six years, Little Bloodtail had been spotted in Kasaragod, Kannur, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki. Dragonfly enthusiasts have recorded the observations in the Facebook group ‘Dragonflies of Kerala’. A note on their behaviour, ecology and distribution in the State was published in the May 2021 issue of Journal of Threatened Taxa . Historically, the species was known to be found in Tibet, Myanmar, Bangladesh and northeast India, but was first spotted in Kerala only in 2013 at a few locations in Kannur district. The diminutive insect measures less than 4 cm in length, and the male is blood-red in colour with black marks. In the female of the species, the red is replaced with yellow. The wings are transparent. Mystery survival “It remains a mystery how the eggs or larvae of this species survive the dry period as the irrigation canals of Kadavoor, in which it was observed laying eggs, run dry by January,” says Muhamed Sherif, who compiled the observations of the Little Bloodtail. “This dragonfly shuns bright sunlight, preferring to feed in the evenings or on overcast days,” says Vivek Chandran, a researcher who was part of the study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tiny-harbinger-of-rain-widely-sighted/article34662565.ece

Mango is grown in 1.1 lakh hectares in the district, from where a whopping 5 lakh metric tonnes of produce goes to juice and pulp making units. Horticulture Commissioner S.S. Sridhar, accompanied by Collector M. Hari Narayanan, paid a visit to the Vapour Heat Treatment Plant in Tirupati and also interacted with mango farmers from Kothapeta village in Pulicherla mandal. It was in this context that Mr. Sridhar announced to bring the pulp units to the negotiating table. “If required, we will consider bringing traders from the neighbouring States for such deals to ensure a remunerative price for the mango farmers,” he said and assured the pulp units to solve the problems they are facing. Speaking to the members of a Farmer Producers’ Organisation (FPO), he said the table varieties of the fruit would get value addition once they get processed at the VHT plant, fetching better returns to the farmers. Assistant Directors Subba Reddy, Koteswara Rao and other officials were present on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-firm-on-remunerative-price-for-mango-growers/article34662612.ece
28 May 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Community medicine experts have key role in tackling pandemic||While the treatment for COVID-19 is being administered by specialists, there appears a greater need for roping in experts from community medicine faculty to get to the root of the problem. The strains identified during the second wave are clearly more virulent, and a rough estimate pegged the number of cases and deaths at double those witnessed during the first wave. The spurt in the number of clinical cases and higher mortality, rise in the use of oxygen and shortage of beds witnessed in public and private hospitals were clearly in tune with the prediction. It is here that the importance of involving the community medicine faculty, which deals with epidemiology and biostatistics, gets crucial. Though all health officials and administrators in medical and non-medical fields apply the principles for controlling the pandemic, it needs a qualified epidemiologist to lead the efforts. For reasons not known, community medicine specialists are generally restricted to teaching and research rather than being deployed on the field. When contacted by The Hindu , G. Ravi Prabhu, professor and head of Community Medicine at Sri Venkateswara Medical College, acknowledges the prevalence of the belief and attributes it to the general assumption that public health measures are easy to comprehend and do not require epidemiologists. “It is hence the COVID control measures are largely carried out by partially-qualified epidemiologists,” Dr. Prabhu adds. Team approach Administrators have, of late, found the need for a team approach to tackle the pandemic and appointed nodal officers for every hospital to ensure better coordination. Chittoor Collector M. Hari Narayanan recently held a meeting with the community medicine experts of SVIMS and Ruia hospitals. Even among medical personnel, treatment specialists such as general physicians, chest physicians, anaesthetists and emergency medicine experts found the need to work in tandem with epidemiologists and microbiologists to continuously monitor the epidemic trend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/community-medicine-experts-have-key-role-in-tackling-pandemic/article34663156.ece

A Learning Management System (LMS) model has been put in place for the schools to follow after its implementation on a pilot basis in the five urban local bodies of Vijayawada, Tirupati, Ongole, Srikalahasti and Narsapuram. Based on the positive feedback, the authorities concerned have decided to integrate the LMS module with video-conference for easy execution. Schedule soon The online schedule will be communicated to the students shortly. Currently, the schools are closed due to the pandemic, and the officials have been asked to start online classes at the earliest. The Municipal Commissioners have been asked to give priority to Class 10 students and ensure that the students and their parents are explained the significance of the online classes by the headmasters, Ward Education and Data Processing Secretaries, and ward volunteers. The Department of Municipal Administration will conduct an orientation programme for the Ward Education and Data Processing Secretaries, headmasters, school supervisors and subject experts on how to conduct the online classes. The headmasters have been asked to ensure conduct of classes strictly as per the schedule, and keep a vigil on the students’ attendance. Meanwhile, leaders of the Municipal Teachers’ Federation (MTF) say that instead of online classes, the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) should design a programme that can be telecast through Doordarshan channels and viewed by the students of all schools. Federation’s State president S. Ramakrishna said, to make the online classes module successful, the government should first address certain issues. ‘No access to Net’ Most children in municipal schools come from economically poor background and many households do not have access to smart phones and Internet. Such children would be left behind, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-mulls-online-classes-for-municipal-school-students/article34663161.ece

The Minister inspected a model of ‘Sanjeevani’ at the Pandit Nehru Bus Station, where APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director R.P. Thakur explained him the technical specifications of the new initiative. The Minister said, with the virus spreading to the rural pockets , people in many Agency areas were having problems due to lack of medical facilities. Emergency medical services, crucial to save persons infected by the virus, was a challenge. Recognising the dire need, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested creating emergency medical services by utilising these buses, the Minister said. Mr. Venkataramaiah said as a pilot, 17 RTC buses were redesigned to suit the purpose by the Amba Coach Factory in Krishna district, while Green Co. company had donated 50 oxygen concentrators and three A/C units. Alternative current supply would ensured for smooth functioning of the oxygen concentrators and the A/C units, he said, adding that these vehicles would extend medical services at places such as Buttayagudem Primary Health Centre and K.R. Puram ITDA PHC in West Godavari district. Each bus has 10 beds. In areas with no hospital, or has a dearth of beds with oxygen, 10 persons can be treated at once in each of these vehicles, he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rtc-turns-buses-into-mobile-hospitals/article34663158.ece

This has been facilitated by filling the gaps in the upper cofferdam by Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL). Changing the natural flow of the gigantic river on such a level is a first-of-its-kind and is an engineering marvel, a press release issued by the MEIL has said. “The Godavari flood water will be diverted through the approach channel to the spillway, and then released to the spillway channel by lifting the gates. Water will rejoin the main river through a pilot channel,” according to the release. The Godavari water from Bhadrachalam reaches Dowleswaram. Due to the closure of the upper cofferdam, the water flow will stop at this point. It will be released downstream of Dowleswaram through the spillway. Till date, 7,56,777 cubic metres of rock filling work has been completed in the upper cofferdam, and the lower cofferdam works are nearing completion, according to the release. Top priority is accorded to speeding up the construction of the upper and lower cofferdams, which are crucial for completing the Polavaram project within the stipulated time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/water-to-be-diverted-to-spillway/article34663162.ece
28 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan sending wrong message by not wearing mask, says Naidu||The TDP on Thursday came down heavily on the YSRCP government in the State for what it called its ‘utter failure to rise to the COVID-19 challenge and save innocent lives’. On the first day of the two-day Mahanadu, held in online mode, the party leaders alleged that the government was preventing the opposition parties and service organisations from reaching out to the COVID-19 victims in need of help. Citing instances of organisations that offered to set up quarantine centres but were denied permission, they said the government was neither doing anything to mitigate the woes of the large population affected by the pandemic, nor allowing others to do so. Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu found fault with the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for not wearing a mask when among the public. “What message is he sending to the people of the State?” he questioned. Alleging bias in the inoculation drive, he said the ruling party cadres were utilising most of the stocks, leaving the general public high and dry. The TDP chief accused the Chief Minister of inefficiency in handling the first wave of the pandemic, which, he said, had further intensified in the second wave. “At least now the government should wake up to the harsh realities and focus completely on containment of the virus to prevent the third wave, which is expected to target children,” he said. Vaccination He said though the Centre had asked the States to go ahead and buy the vaccine and inoculate the 18-45 age group people, the State had not made use of the advice. He demanded that the government spend Rs. 1,600 crore on purchase of vaccine and save the lives of the people in the State. Anandaiah’s preparation Mr. Naidu wondered why the government was against the distribution of ayurveda practitioner Anandaiah’s herbal preparation even after Ayush experts had certified it to be harmless. He demanded an explanation from the Chief Minister on the reason for the ‘arrest of Mr. Anandaiah’ who was distributing the medicine to people free of cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-sending-wrong-message-by-not-wearing-mask-says-naidu/article34663075.ece

28 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rural areas hit hard by second wave of COVID||The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected rural areas on a much larger scale as compared to the first wave last year. During the first wave, the spread of the virus was largely limited to rural pockets in Narsipatnam and Anakapalle (Rural) mandals. However, this time, a large number of cases have been reported from the Agency areas as well, a senior official in the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) informed The Hindu . As predicted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the spread of the virus in rural areas could be the next big worry, the official said.  Fever survey is key The key to tackling the pandemic in rural and tribal areas lies in the fever survey, said ITDA Project Officer S. Venkateswar. “We have already completed eight rounds of survey and we are in the ninth round now. Each survey is taken up for three days and it is done by Asha volunteers, and it is basically done to weed out the persons with symptoms from the rest of the community, said District Collector V. Vinay Chand. Locals step up Appreciating the efforts of local sarpanches and local youth, the Collector said that in many parts of rural areas and Agency areas, the locals have come out to start their own isolation centres. The moment a person with symptoms is identified during the fever survey, he or she is moved to the isolation centre if there is no provision of isolation at home. Once admitted, a Rapid Antigen Test is conducted and if required, swabs are sent to Trunat centres at the nearest CHC, said Mr. Vinay Chand. Hospitals If one tests positive, an isolation kit is provided for mild cases and those who need hospitalisation are sent to hospitals. In the rural areas, there are 11 CHCs with 15 beds in each. Some of the beds are compatible for B- or D-type oxygen cylinders. “We have around 200 oxygen concentrators and they are being dispatched to the CHCs,” the Collector toldThe Hindu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rural-areas-hit-hard-by-second-wave-of-covid/article34663171.ece
28 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI(M) opposes decision on Mudasarlova Park revamp||CPI(M) Greater Visakha City Committee secretary and 78th ward corporator B. Ganga Rao on Thursday opposed the reported decision of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) to develop Mudasarlova Park in the city at an estimated cost of Rs. 50 crore. In a letter to the GVMC Commissioner, the CPI(M) city secretary recalled that the corporators had opposed the decision when it was proposed by the Mayor in the council meeting on April 9. It was said that only a DPR would be prepared for the project. But now, it seems that a unilateral decision has been taken on the project. A tender was called for the project in the past and was later cancelled. Mr. Ganga Rao said that development of the park in PPP mode would be detrimental to the interests of the public. He called for integrated development of the city with importance given to parks in Gajuwaka, Malkapuram, Muralinagar, Gopalapatnam, Pendurthy and Anakapalle, where there are no major parks. Mr. Ganga Rao said that at a time when scores of people were dying every day in the district, the priority of the government should be COVID-19 control and saving the lives of the public. About 45 Urban PHCs, proposed in GVMC in the past, have not been started yet. He demanded that vaccination centres should be opened in all the 98 wards of GVMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-opposes-decision-on-mudasarlova-park-revamp/article34663167.ece
28 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||City sizzles under heatwave||The city reeled under heatwave conditions for the second consecutive day on Thursday. This is attributed to the very severe cyclonic storm Yaas, which crossed the coast near Balasore in Odisha on Wednesday. Visakhapatnam airport recorded 41 degrees Celsius on Thursday evening, while Waltair (city areas closer to the coast) recorded 41.4° C. The temperature recorded at the airport was lower compared to the 42.2° C recorded on Wednesday. Waltair had recorded 41.4° C on Wednesday. Waltair recorded 8.2° Celsius above the average normal temperature of 33° C on Wednesday. The average normal temperature at Visakhapatnam airport is 36.4° C during this time of the year. The temperature recorded on Wednesday was 5.8° above normal. The steep increase in temperatures is attributed to the cyclone, which sucked up the moisture from the coastal areas into the system. The normal moisture in the atmosphere, which ranges between 70 and 80% in Visakhapatnam, dipped to 18% in the city on Wednesday. “The cyclonic system draws strong moist winds from the lower troposphere, arresting the sea breeze. The troughline from the centre of the cyclonic system is running south westwards, along and off Andhra coast. The absence of moist current and dry hot winds blowing from the north west caused the marked rise in the day temperature,” P.V. Rama Rao, a retired Director of the IMD, told The Hindu . The maximum temperatures are likely to be 2 to 4 degrees above normal at isolated places in north coastal Andhra Pradesh on May 28 and 29, in south coastal Andhra Pradesh on May 29, 30, 31 and in Rayalaseema on May 30 and 31, according to the IMD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/city-sizzles-under-heatwave/article34663169.ece

The ganja, meant to be sold in some Northern States, would have fetched nearly Rs. 2 crore, police said. According to primary information by the police, based on credible information, they intercepted a van near Degree College junction and busted the case.

They were allegedly supposed to shift the ganja till the highway, from where a few other unidentified persons were waiting to take over. In order to escape police checking, the smugglers hid the ganja bags under a load of mangoes in the van. However, upon checking, the ganja was seized.

28 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Eatala under pressure not to join BJP||Eatala Rajender is under tremendous pressure not to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at this time as it is likely to be a political suicide and will only give political advantage to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). This is what the political leaders of various parties and groups expect now from Mr. Rajender. A collective opinion of this line of thinking was conveyed to him by Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) chief M. Kodandaram and former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy, who met him on Thursday. In the wake of reports that BJP is wooing him but without any promise of a political post, the meeting of Mr. Kodandaram and Mr. Reddy with the rebel TRS leader assumed significance. Mr. Kodandaram is said to have informed him that Mr. Rao’s wish would be fulfilled as he has politically convenient relationship with the BJP that would any day prefer Mr. Rao over Eatala. Poor strength First, Mr. Rajender will be sending a signal to Mr. Rao that he was frightened with all the charges and cases being booked against him and it will also give the TRS an opportunity to force a by-election in the near future. There is no way Mr. Rajender can win on the BJP platform given the party’s not so great strength in Huzurabad constituency. “He will secure more votes if he contests as an Independent as people would see him as a political rival hounded by Mr. Rao, and Mr. Kodandaram made this scenario clear to him,” TJS political advisory committee member P. Srisail Reddy said. Mr. Vishweshwar Reddy apparently told Mr. Rajender that even if he wants to join BJP, he should clear his name from the allegations made against him. Or else it will send a signal of seeking protection from the corruption charges. “Don’t fall into KCR’s trap but take the fight to KCR’s den is what I suggested to him,” Mr. Reddy told The Hindu . Mr. Vishweshwar Reddy said the former Health Minister looked more confident now than a couple of weeks ago as people believe that he is being hounded by Mr. Rao using all his power. The more he is targeted, the more sympathy he will generate among the public. Political leaders who have been meeting him say Mr. Rajender has all the potential to become a rallying point of anti-KCR forces in Telangana if he stays in TRS and fights back. Mr. Vishweshwar Reddy argued that he should continue his demand for an enquiry by the CBI or a High Court judge to pressurise Mr. Rao. “Attack is the best defence,” he told Mr. Rajender.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-under-pressure-not-to-join-bjp/article34663104.ece
28 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Young giraffe in Nehru Zoo dies of pneumonia||Bubli, a four-year-old female giraffe at Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, breathed its last on Wednesday, following a brief illness. It was suspected to be suffering from pneumonia. The animal had sleeplessness and lost appetite for the past one week and was on medication. It was being treated by the veterinary team at the zoo, a source at the zoo told The Hindu . With its death, the 380-acre zoo is left with only two giraffes — Tsunami Basant and Sunny. Zoo Director and Curator Siddhanand Kukrety and V.V.L. Subhadra Devi, respectively, did not respond to the repeated calls by this correspondent. Bubli, along with Sunny (6), were brought from Alipore Zoological Gardens, Kolkata as part of an exchange programme in March 2019. A month later, after quarantine, the newly acquired pair of giraffes were put in their enclosure for public display. “Both of them were in good health and have acclimatised themselves to the zoo. But, for the past few months not many animals are being taken care of like earlier. Bubli was sick for a long time and it came to the notice of the higher-ups only a week ago,” an animal caretaker at the zoo said. All the samples have been collected and sent to Telangana State Veterinary Biological & Research Institute for further detailed examination. Finding a mate Before their arrival, the 17-year-old male giraffe Tsunami Basant was leading a solitary life for the last 10 years, for want of a mate. The 13-foot-tall animal was born on Basant Panchami day at the National Zoological Park, Delhi, after the 2004-tsunami; hence the name Tsunami Basant.. In the event of a zoo failing to find a mate for a single and unpaired animal within a period of six months, the single animal should be transferred or exchanged or given on breeding loan to any other zoo in accordance with the rules specified by the Central Zoo Authority. After several national and international attempts, the NZP officials had found a young female giraffe for Tsunami Basant at Kolkata zoo in December 2017. The giraffe from Alipore Zoological Gardens, panicked in its cage because of the welding work taken up after loading the animal on a flat-bed trailer. As she was getting agitated due to the sparks and fumes, the animal tried to get out of the cage placed on a trailer. When the giraffe jumped out of the cage, it slipped and fell on the ground resulting in serious neck and leg injury, causing instantaneous death, the official said Giraffes are extremely sensitive and social animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/young-giraffe-in-nehru-zoo-dies-of-pneumonia/article34663070.ece
28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS case baffles epidemiologists||Southern States where COVID positive cases continue to remain high like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, along with low caseloads of Telangana, have been following an ‘uniform formula’ of reduced testing, contact tracing and surveillance, compared to the first wave of the pandemic, say top epidemiologists. “The higher tests per million are showing high cases per million along with test positivity. As the rate of tests goes down, the cases are going down and test positivity too, goes down. This has been the nature of the COVID second wave,” said Indian Institute of Public Health-Public Health Foundation of India’s Giridhara R. Babu. Participating in a recent virtual webinar hosted by the Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad chapter, he said that the Telangana case has been mystifying. “Telangana State has been an honourable exception. When all other States, including Kerala, show high number of cases, it has been showing low number of cases and even deaths. No statistic can explain the status in the current scenario. It can’t be explained by any epidemiological knowledge as it has lower tests, cases and deaths per million,” said the public health expert in Karnataka COVID advisory panel. “An extreme observation is either the burden of the disease is really low, with no impact on lives, livelihoods or mortality but that would be an exception or definitely, the public health surveillance needs to be strengthened,” he asserts. Mortalities per million in TS has been just 81.7 when it has been 342.7 in Karnataka, 251.6 in TN, 194.1 in Kerala and 186.7 in AP. While Kerala has been maintaining the testing rate along with increase in cases, AP, TN and Karnataka have decreased the number of tests. Even if it has been for the operational feasibility or any other reason, it was imperative to ramp up testing considering the high COVID incidence in these States. Dr. Babu called for a “syndromic approach to find the right cases and testing them along with contact tracing as an important element of learning” since lower tests per million with higher test positivity was a “matter of concern”. “Last year, States had an effective contact tracing, testing and community participation strategy along with isolated quarantine centres with Karnataka even tracing up to 42 contacts, but this has been dispensed with now,” he claimed. One reason being the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issuing a directive prioritising tests for those with influenza like illness and the primary contacts, leaving the asymptomatic and the secondary contacts. “AP and Karnataka have therefore, changed the testing policy,” he explained. While urban burden is ‘reasonably’ known despite under reporting, virus spread was not being adequately captured in the rural population because testing is confined to cities and district headquarters. The way out to “decrease the test positivity and bring the cases down is to have strict containment measures, isolate positive cases and increase the tests,” affirmed Dr. Babu. The future wave or pandemic could be tackled only by strengthening public health workforce, primary healthcare and pooling in community resources in slums and residential welfare associations for an effective field surveillance to capture the first signs of disease and containment, the epidemiologist added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-case-baffles-epidemiologists/article34663084.ece
28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Expedite paddy procurement’||Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar directed District Collectors to speedily complete the ongoing paddy procurement. Directing them to complete the process before the month-end, he wanted them to ensure that shortage of labour and gunny bags are addressed through procurement from the local markets. Steps should be taken to ensure availability of sufficient number of vehicles for transporting paddy. Efforts should also be made to keep a tab on the unwarranted cuts that are being imposed by the millers. The Civil Supplies Department should take steps to ensure smooth conduct of the procurement process and Collectors were asked to conduct detailed review with district agriculture officers for ensuring availability of adequate stocks of seed and fertilizer at points of sale in view of onset of the monsoon. The Chief Secretary gave the instructions during a video conference with District Collectors to review the arrangements for paddy procurement, supply of seed/fertilizer and vaccination to persons identified under the super-spreader category. The Collectors were asked to strictly follow the line list and limit vaccination to categories decided by the government. The Collectors were directed to ensure administration of Covishield vaccine to super-spreaders. Visits ENT hospital Earlier, the Chief Secretary, accompanied by senior officials, visited ENT Hospital and interacted with patients there. He enquired about the surgeries that were conducted and the treatment that was being given to patients affected with Black Fungus. He went round each ward, enquired about the treatment being provided and the health condition of the patients. The government is taking all necessary measures to extend best treatment to patients, he said exhorting them not to get panicky. The ENT Hospital was identified as nodal hospital for Black Fungus cases with 250 beds equipped with necessary facilities, medicines and injections.

28 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Food delivery executives back on road||Food delivery executives are back zipping on the road unimpeded in Hyderabad three days after police stopped, penalised them and seized the vehicles of hundreds across the city. “If we wear the Swiggy or Zomato T-shirt we are not being stopped. It was a one-day scare,” said Mohammed Alam, who was waiting to pick up his order from a restaurant in Jyothi Nagar area. “I am getting 25-30 orders per day which was the norm before the lockdown,” said Mr. Alam who does deliveries in the western part of the city in Tolichowki and Manikonda areas. Other delivery executives, including the ones from e-commerce firms, shared similar experiences of being allowed to move unimpeded through the city. “In fact, I am making more deliveries now than earlier. This is better than pre-lockdown days as there is hardly any traffic when we are moving around,” said Sandeep Reddy, while making a delivery in Attapur area. Are there any new written orders after Monday so that these delivery executives are allowed to move freely? “No. We just had an internal communication from the CP (Commissioner of Police). We are following those orders,” said a police official manning the check-point near the Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazaar. It was at the same location on Monday, when almost all e-commerce delivery personnel on two-wheelers were stopped, and let go after 5 p.m. The delivery executives as well as app-based firms and restaurants were caught unawares on Monday as the Government Order imposing the lockdown explicitly allowed movement of delivery executives. On Thursday, knots of delivery executives could be spotted at different road junctions waiting for orders. “We’re operational with limited options for food and other essential deliveries basis local directives,” said a spokesperson for Swiggy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/food-delivery-executives-back-on-road/article34663093.ece
28 May 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||Genco mulls de-scoping some works||With the project works running behind schedule due to the COVID-19 impact and general slackness, the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TSGenco) is mulling de-scoping of some works pertaining to the 5×800 megawatt Yadadri Thermal Power Station (YTPS) from the executing agency BHEL, in an attempt to make up for some lost ground. After the commencement of works in October 2017, the first two units of the project were to be commissioned within 36 months from date zero and the next three units over the next 12 months. However, the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic hit the work for about six months last year and the ongoing second wave has derailed the progress again. “Better planning and deployment of workforce and provision of some basic facilities by the executing agency would have contained the COVID-19 impact. There’s not even a health centre to attend to general health issues of workers at the site,” a senior engineer of TSGenco, monitoring the YTPS works said, when contacted. During a recent visit to the worksite by Minister for Energy G. Jagadish Reddy and Chairman and Managing Director of TSGenco D. Prabhakar Rao, the executing agency was told to set up a healthcare facility with a couple of doctors and a few paramedical staff to attend to the primary health issues of the workforce. The agency was asked to arrange at least 20 beds and deploy doctors and paramedics at the health centre. However, the proposal has not made any headway even five days after the visit, although it was suggested to create the makeshift healthcare facility in 10 days’ time. “Such a facility is a must at any project worksite having thousands of workforce. The Genco had its health centres at KTPS 800 MW unit and KTPP 600 MW unit worksites,” the senior engineer recollected. The Genco authorities said their management has been pursuing speeding up of work regularly at the CMD level by speaking and writing to BHEL-CMD but there has been no proper response. “What is required from the executing agency management is transactional approach and not transcendental, as being followed now in planning and execution to meet the target of completing the work by 2022-23 end,” the Genco authorities said. “The agency has not been paying required attention on YTPS works including BoP work (balance of plant) so much so that even the formation of deck for one unit has not been completed so far. Although the work on some components has made good progress, if not as desired, some other components require a big push,” CMD of TSGenco D. Prabhakar Rao told The Hindu . He stated that the sluggish pace of some components is making them seriously consider de-scoping of BoP works to make make up for some lost time and keep pace at least with the revised reschedule. On the progress of works so far, he said against completion of at least 50% of the project works by now, the actual achievement is 35.75%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/genco-mulls-de-scoping-some-works/article34663096.ece

The government has also proposed to conduct the exams in two sessions — morning and afternoon sessions by utilising two different sets of question papers to ensure maximum physical distancing in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who would be unable to appear for the exams due to COVID-19 or other reasons will get another chance to take the exam.

28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Warning to pvt. hospitals against excess billing||Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao has warned of stringent action to be initiated against private hospitals found collecting excess fee and billing inappropriately. The action could range from withdrawal of permission to offer coronavirus treatment to de-recognition of the hospitals in cases where complaints of serious nature received against them are proved right. “Investigation is under way into the complaints we received against some private hospitals. Appropriate action will be initiated once the process is completed,” he said. According to Dr. Srinivasa Rao, the department had received 88 complaints against 64 of the around 1,200 private hospitals so far. These included complaints relating to excess and inappropriate billing, drugs related grievances and failure to provide patients’ information. A majority of 39 complaints were received from GHMC limits, Medchal-Malkajgiri (22) and Rangareddy (15). Show cause notices had been served on these hospitals with a deadline of 24 to 48 hours for submitting their explanation relating to the complaints. “We have cancelled the permission given to a hospital for offering COVID treatment in the recent past. We will dereocgnise the hospitals if need be, based on the investigations,” he said. Dr. Srinivasa Rao said there was a significant decline in the number of new cases registered throughout the State. The enforcement of lockdown and conduct of household survey were yielding fruitful results in bringing down the cases. Asked about the global tenders floated for procuring vaccines, he said the tenders evoked good response with manufacturers of Astrazeneca and Sputnik getting in touch with the department. Household survey Even as 11,814 persons with COVID symptoms were identified in the COVID OPs, the household survey launched by the department was yielding good results. Over 17,000 multi-disciplinary teams were deployed to conduct the household survey for identifying symptomatic persons and distributing health kits to them. The senior official informed that a special drive for vaccination of high risk groups was being taken up to ensure their safety from Friday. Accordingly, 2.1 lakh doses of vaccine had been supplied to GHMC area and another 1.45 lakh doses for high risk group persons identified in other places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/warning-to-pvt-hospitals-against-excess-billing/article34663086.ece

28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Get instructions over lockdown exemption to lawyers: HC tells AG||Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed Advocate General B.S. Prasad to secure instructions from State government over granting exemption to advocates and their clerks from lockdown restrictions. The judge was hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer T. Jayanth Jaosoorya seeking exemption for advocates and their clerks from lockdown restrictions. Passing the direction to the AG, the judge also instructed the petitioner to include Chief Secretary as party in the petition as the latter is empowered to take a call on the matter. Appearing for the petitioner, lawyer Vishnuvardhan Reddy told the court that lawyers and their clerks had to step outside during the lockdown since they have to carry out all their professional work from their respective offices. Travelling to and fro the offices is becoming difficult for them in the backdrop of lockdown rules which prohibit movement of people from 10 a.m. to 6 a.m., he said. The judge sought to know why the lawyers or their clerks had to move outside since all the courts are operating in virtual mode. Mr. Reddy contended that most of the lawyers work from their offices which are located away from residences since the infrastructure like computers, printers, files and documents were located there. He told the court that lawyers had to accompany their clients (who are facing criminal charges and had to go to police stations) as per amended provisions of the criminal procedure code. Lawyers were unable to go to police stations along with their clients as they were not exempted from lockdown restrictions. He cited the examples of AP, Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala where advocates and their clerks were exempted from lockdown. Mr. Reddy requested the court to pass orders directing the State government to give similar relaxation in Telangana as well. The matter was posted to Monday for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/get-instructions-over-lockdown-exemption-to-lawyers-hc-tells-ag/article34663099.ece

Most of these isolation centres were set up in the gram panchayat and local school buildings with arrangements for free food and accommodation. In Penuballi and several other mandals, the isolation centres were established in the spacious buildings of private educational institutions. The move is intended to help those infected with coronavirus recover at the State-run isolation centres and access medical assistance besides preventing the spread of COVID-19 at the village-level. Though the isolation facilities were being mostly utilised by those who don’t have separate rooms for self-quarantine at their homes, the field level health functionaries are motivating all the COVID-19 infected persons to stay in the isolation centres in their respective villages.

28 May 2021||GURUGRAM,||Pandemic takes a toll on mental health||“The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that mental health problems could be the next pandemic after COVID-19 fades away,” said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) senior fellow Akshay Kumar, who is also a consultant in the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Science at Artemis Hospital. Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Kumar, said he was overwhelmed daily by the number of clients seeking counselling for mental health issues during the pandemic. Most of the cases pertained to anxiety and depression. “People fear they might get infected or a family member might catch the virus. Many have suffered loss of livelihood or business or job. Even those who are working fear they might lose their job. A chief executive officer of a multinational company in Gurugram, one of my clients, suffered loss of appetite and developed insomnia fearing that he might lose his job. He is doing well at work but you tend to think illogically when you are anxious. Another client, an eminent engineer, had fully recovered from COVID-19 but felt he could not breathe without oxygen support. Many of my clients have lost their loved ones. They are not able to come out of the shock,” said Dr. Kumar. “Most of my clients happen to be male. They are usually the breadwinners and are impacted more by uncertainty over jobs and livelihood. But there is no official data by the WHO saying that one gender is impacted more that the other,” Dr. Kumar said, adding most of his clients are in the 18-50 age group, and both men and women come to him for help. Shweta Sharma, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Asia Hospital, said there could be a “tsunami of psychiatric illnesses” in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, anxiety and panic disorders, generalised anxiety disorder and mood disorders will be at the top of the list and the impact on mental health could be long-lasting. There are many vulnerable groups who will suffer from psychological distress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, suicide and suicidal behaviour due to economic recession, insecure job situation, unemployment, lower socio-economic status. The affects on mental health will last several years after the pandemic ends. Delay in seeking professional help because of stigma surrounding mental health will cause more issues," said Dr. Sharma. Jyoti Kapoor, senior psychiatrist and founder of Manasthali , a mental and emotional well-being platform, has been running a helpline with the support of her friends and interns to help those facing mental health issues. Calls on battling anxiety “Most of those calling us are in the age group of 30-50, but many call on behalf of their elderly parents or teenage children. We receive calls about teens battling anxiety and depression. A 16-year-old boy showed serious signs of withdrawal after one of his grandparents died due to COVID-19 and later his parents also got infected. Used to being able to move around freely, teenagers are now forced to stay indoors with no real social contact. Long hours of online classes are also a source of stress for them with frequent glitches,” said Dr. Kapoor. Dr. Kumar said it was “very important” to talk about the mental health issues arising out of the pandemic. “Awareness about mental health is on the rise. Before the pandemic, people were reluctant to talk about mental health issues, stress and anxiety. Even the media is raising the issue. It was not so earlier. But it is still not enough,” he added. Pursuing your passion, developing new hobbies, spreading good news, meditation, and staying in touch with family and friends over the phone and through social media are some of the ways to battle anxiety and depression, Dr. Kumar said, adding that people should not hesitate to take professional help if required. “Usually, we tend to ignore signs of depression and anxiety. So the first thing is to acknowledge if you are depressed. Create a personal space for yourself inside your home, spend some quality ‘me time’. Keep personal and professional lives separate.

28 May 2021||New Delhi,||North-east riots: HC grants bail to two accused, says no substantial evidence||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to two persons accused of murder and other charges related to the northeast Delhi riots, noting that there was no substantial evidence such as CCTV footage linking them to the crime. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait granted bail to Sunny alias Lalla and Brij Mohan Sharma alias Gabbar while directing them not to “directly or indirectly influence any witness” in the case which is pending trial at a local court here. “This court finds that there is no CCTV footage or any other electronic evidence available on record except the call detail record, which establishes the presence of petitioners in the area in question, but again the fact that these petitioners are residing in the same area, so their location has to be in the same area, cannot be lost sight of, ” Justice Kait said. ‘Call details’ “As far as their involvement in the alleged incident is concerned, how their call details connect them to the offence in question, is subject to trial,” the High Court added. The case relates to the murder of 25-year-old Irfan who died on February 26 last year after receiving head injuries. During investigation, the statement of the mother of the deceased, who is allegedly the only eyewitness to the incident, was recorded. She stated that on February 26, 2020 about 7.30 p.m., she along with her son was going to fetch milk, when they were attacked by eight or 10 persons of their locality in Kartar Nagar. She claimed that her son was attacked with iron rod, bat and iron pipes. She named Gabbar, Lalla, Pankaj and subzi wala, as the attackers she could identify, they being residents of the same locality. In view of her statement, the two petitioners were arrested on March 28, 3020 and in their disclosure statements they admitted having been involved in the alleged incident with other co-accused. However, they refused to undergo Test Identification Parade (TIP proceedings). Later the bail application of Lalla and Gabbar were dismissed by local courts here. The duo then moved the High Court for bail. The duo’s counsel argued that statements of eyewitness were contradictory not only with regard to the aspect whether she was walking with the deceased or the deceased was ahead of her but also use of weapon of offence. The counsel further argued that the wife of deceased stated before the media persons that she and her mother-in-law were at home at the time of alleged incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/north-east-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-two-accused-says-no-substantial-evidence/article34663055.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC to hear plea against media ‘sensationalising’ Sushil trial||The Delhi High Court agreed to hear on Friday a plea against media ‘sensationalising’ the trial of wrestler and Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar, who has been arrested in connection with the murder of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankhar at the Chhatrasal Stadium here. The plea by a law student alleged that media reporting of the case had damaged Mr. Kumar’s career and reputation. ‘Stop reporting’ It accused that media had now transformed itself into ‘janta adalats’ or ‘public courts’ and started intervening in the proceedings of the court. The petition sought making standard rules for reporting in criminal cases by considering the right of the accused. It also sought a direction “to stop from reporting in this case of Sushil Kumar... which are kind of distorted and malignant facts with sensational keywords”. The first information report registered includes Sections 302 (murder), 308 (culpable homicide), 325 (causing grievous hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnapping), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (Indian Penal Code).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-to-hear-plea-against-media-sensationalising-sushil-trial/article34663057.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC asks govt., Centre to reply to plea for update on COVID patients’ condition to family||The High Court on Thursday asked the Centre and Delhi government to give their stand on a plea seeking that family members or attendants of COVID-19 patients should be kept updated about their condition and treatment being provided. An HC Bench issued notice to the Ministry of Health and Delhi government on the plea by an NGO, which highlighted that presently families only receive news about the death of a patient or demand for deposit of the hospital charges. The NGO, Manav Awaaj Trust, said providing the daily updates about patients’ condition would “develop confidence and trust in the system of governance”. It asked for direction “to frame a policy and/ or guideline for communication of status report” every 24 hours to family or attendants of patients about their condition, treatment provided and details of the attending doctors. “The community at large is losing confidence, trust and faith in the working of the government and private hospitals in the absence of a system or machinery where the attendant is briefed or updated about treatment administered to the patient and actual status or condition of the patient thereof regularly on daily basis by the hospital authorities,” the plea said. “Only news reaching them is either of death of the patient or demand for the deposit of more fee. That the family members/attendants are time and again neglected by the hospitals, but for the clearance of bills,” the NGO said. In a separate petition, the Bench sought response of the Centre and Delhi government on a plea seeking directions to them to ensure adequate supply of COVID-19 vaccine for the residents, especially in 18-44 age group, of the national capital. The petition filed by 43-year-old advocate Vivek Gaur, who contended that the residents of the capital should not suffer as result of the “blame game” between the Centre and the Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-asks-govt-centre-to-reply-to-plea-for-update-on-covid-patients-condition-to-family/article34663049.ece

A vacation Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.R. Borkar said if the private hospital was to discharge Mr. Babu before June 1, then it should first inform the court and take permission. Mr. Babu tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month and was initially brought from the Taloja prison to JJ Hospital. He was later shifted to GT Hospital. His wife Jenny Rowena subsequently filed a petition in the HC seeking interim bail and medical aid for him. Their counsel Yug Chaudhry had argued that Mr. Babu developed a severe eye infection and ran the risk of losing vision in his left eye. On May 19, the HC permitted Mr. Babu to be shifted to Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai for treatment at his own cost.

28 May 2021||Mumbai,||Cong. alleges BJP hand in fight against Maratha quota||The Maratha reservation row in Maharashtra is set to escalate as the State unit of the Congress on Thursday alleged that a BJP office-bearer was leading the organisation that had been fighting against the quota for the community. “It is the BJP’s policy to pretend that it supports Maratha reservation on one side and run a campaign on the other to prevent it. An organisation called Save Merit, Save Nation, which is fighting against Maratha reservation in the Supreme Court, has a direct connection with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Founder of this organisation, Dr. Anup Marar, is the East Vidarbha coordinator of the BJP’s medical front,” Sachin Sawant, Maharashtra Congress general secretary, said. The apex court quashed the reservation for Marathas earlier this month. Mr. Sawant said the institution did not exist at the time of the court battle in the Mumbai High Court. “However, after the High Court ruled in favour of reservation, the organisation started functioning. A BJP office-bearer is bound by the rules and regulations of the party. Why didn’t the BJP stop him,” Mr. Sawant asked. The BJP did not comment on Mr. Marar’s connection with the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-alleges-bjp-hand-in-fight-against-maratha-quota/article34662761.ece

28 May 2021||Washington DC,||Biden orders probe into virus origins||U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that he has asked American intelligence agencies to “redouble” their efforts to analyse the origins of COVID-19, to determine whether it emerged from human-animal contact or via a laboratory accident. With this, Mr. Biden adds significantly to the growing pressure on China to be more open about the origins of the SARS-COV-2 virus, an outbreak of which was seen first in early 2020 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which houses the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Mr. Biden said he had reviewed a report on the origins of the virus, authored by his National Security Adviser (Jake Sullivan) and intelligence officials and that the intelligence community had “coalesced around two likely scenarios”, yet not reached a “definitive conclusion” as to the origins of the virus. Currently, there is “low to moderate confidence” attached to each of the two theories on the virus’s origins, Mr. Biden said. Definitive conclusion “I have now asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days,” Mr. Biden said in a statement, adding he had asked that specific questions for China be drawn up with input from U.S. national labs. “The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence,” Mr. Biden said. A World Health Organisation (WHO) investigation concluded, earlier this year, that the lab leak theory was “extremely unlikely”. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told a WHO ministerial meeting earlier this week that experts should be given the independence to fully assess the origins of the virus. On May 14, a group of scientists, including from Harvard, Yale and Stanford, published a letter in the journal Science saying an accidental lab leak and “zootonic spillover” (i.e., from animals) remained “viable” theories. The Trump administration had floated the idea that the virus might have got out of control after a laboratory accident. However, Donald Trump had muddied the waters around the issue including by referring to the SARS-COV-2 virus as the ‘Wuhan virus’ or ‘Chinese virus’ — contributing, some argued, to violence against Asians in the U.S.  Wuhan amendments “The U.S. government has reasons to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019,” a State Department fact sheet released in the last days of the Trump administration said. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that three WIV scientists were sick enough in November 2019 to need hospital care. “Now everybody is agreeing that I was right when I very early on called Wuhan as the source of COVID-19,” Mr. Trump said in a statement released on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the Senate unanimously approved two Wuhan-related amendments, the Washington Post reported. One amendment would block U.S. funding for virus ‘gain of function’ research and the other would prevent U.S. funding for WIV.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-orders-probe-into-virus-origins/article34662490.ece
28 May 2021||Geneva,||Gaza attack may constitute ‘war crimes’||Israel’s recent deadly air strikes on Gaza may constitute war crimes, the UN rights chief said on Thursday, as countries discussed launching a broad, international investigation. Addressing a special session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Michelle Bachelet voiced deep concern about the “high level of civilian fatalities and injuries” from the attacks on Gaza. “If found to be indiscriminate and disproportionate in their impact on civilians and civilian objects, such attacks may constitute war crimes,” she warned. She also said her office had “not seen evidence” that the buildings targeted in Gaza, including residential homes, medical facilities and media offices, were “hosting armed groups or being used for military purposes”, as claimed by Israel. Ms. Bachelet also stressed that rockets fired by Hamas were “indiscriminate and fail to distinguish between military and civilian objects,” and were thereby “a clear violation of international humanitarian law.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made her statement at the start of a special one-day council session focused on the recent flare-up of violence. Before a truce took hold last Friday, Israeli air strikes and artillery fire on Gaza killed 254 Palestinians, including 66 children, and wounded more than 1,900 people in 11 days of conflict, the health ministry in Gaza says. Rocket and other fire from Gaza claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel were wounded. OIC calls for inquiry At the rights council, countries were debating a proposal to set up a broad, international investigation into violations surrounding the latest violence, but also into “systematic” abuses in the Palestinian territories and inside Israel. The proposal calls for an unprecedented level of scrutiny on abuses and their “root causes” in the decades-long West Asia conflict. The draft resolution presented by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) calls for the council to “urgently establish an ongoing independent, international commission of inquiry... in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and in Israel”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gaza-attack-may-constitute-war-crimes/article34662486.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S.-China engagement era has come to an end: top U.S. official||The more than three-decade long era of engagement between the United States and China that saw the world’s two largest economies develop closely interdependent relations “has come to an end”, a top official of the Biden administration has said. “The period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end,” Kurt Campbell, who is the Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs and the top U.S. official for Asia, said at a Stanford University event. He said “competition” would henceforth be “the dominant paradigm” and U.S. policy would work under “a new set of strategic parameters”, Bloomberg News quoted him as saying. Policy shift Mr. Campbell’s comments underline the shift in U.S. views on China from the time of the Obama administration as well as the broadly bipartisan consensus on the current direction of relations, following four turbulent years for the relationship under the previous Trump administration. Mr. Campbell said “Chinese policies under [President] Xi are in large part responsible for the shift in U.S. policy,” Bloomberg News reported, adding that he cited “clashes on China’s border with India, an economic campaign against Australia and the rise of China’s ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy’” as examples that suggested “China is determined to play a more assertive role.” He described the Chinese President as “deeply ideological but also quite unsentimental” and said the two top Chinese diplomats who had held talks with top Biden administration officials in Alaska in March - Politburo member Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi - were “nowhere near, within a hundred miles” of Mr. Xi’s inner circle. He said the U.S. believed “the best way to engage a more assertive China is to work with allies, partners and friends.” Reacting to his comments, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday that “using ‘competition’ [to] define or dominate China-U.S. ties is a total mistake that will only lead to confrontation and conflict.” “Even if there is competition, it should be sound competition that helps to reinforce each other and pursue common progress, rather than a vicious competition to beat each other. China firmly rejects U.S. moves to exclude and contain China in the name of competition,” he added. Also on Thursday, People’s Liberation Army Senior Colonel and China’s Defence Ministry spokesperson, Tan Kefei, asked about the U.S. Indo-Pacific military strategy, hit out at countries looking “to establish selective and exclusive military alliances, to gang up or to create the ‘New Cold War’ featuring bloc confrontation,” coming amid increasing Chinese criticism of the India-Australia-Japan-U.S. Quad grouping. “The strategy of intensifying military presence and highlighting military competition will only aggravate regional tensions and endanger world peace and stability,” he said, adding that “the U.S. side should not, on the one hand, claim to put up new defence hotlines [with China] while on the other hand keep ramping up military deployments in the Asian Pacific region, frequently conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, and even deliberately initiate dangerous circumstances where aircraft and vessels nearly collide.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-china-engagement-era-has-come-to-an-end-top-us-official/article34662492.ece

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||China slams Biden statement on COVID-19||China on Thursday hit out at the statement of U.S. President Joe Biden calling for a transparent investigation into the origins of COVID-19, including examining the possibility of laboratory origins, accusing Washington of “turning a blind eye to the facts”. “On the China lab leak hypothesis, the joint WHO-China study team report clearly states that ‘a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely’. This is an authoritative and official conclusion based on science,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday. On the WHO mission’s visit to Wuhan, he said China arranged “field visits to different biosafety laboratories, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology” and “experts went to every place they asked to see”. Some experts on the mission, however, said they had limited access to both labs and to raw data of early cases that they had sought. The team “spent three hours at the institute” and “had little to go on beyond assurances from the institute’s own staff,” team members told the Wall Street Journal this week. WHO Director General Tedros said in March after the report’s release that the lab leak theory “requires further investigation” and “all hypotheses remain on the table”. Mr. Zhao said the U.S. “clamouring for additional investigation” had “shown they don’t care about facts or truth and have zero interest in a serious science-based study of origins”. “Their one aim is to use the pandemic to pursue stigmatisation and political manipulation to shift the blame,” he said. “With 33 million confirmed cases and 6,00,000 deaths from COVID-19, both the highest in the world, the US, instead of examining its own behavior, attempted to scapegoat China.” He said “the motive and purpose” of U.S. calls for investigation “relying on its intelligence apparatus is crystal clear” and alleged its intelligence agencies had “a notorious track record”. “Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even boasted, ‘I was the CIA director, we lied, we cheated, we stole. We had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment.’ How can anyone trust the findings from an ‘investigation’ conducted by such an intelligence organ with no credibility to speak of?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-slams-biden-statement-on-covid-19/article34662493.ece
28 May 2021||Seoul,||Kim promises to build North Korea socialism||North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed an “uncompromising struggle” against anti-socialist elements at home, state media reported on Thursday, as he tries to fortify his power amid pandemic-related difficulties and U.S.-led economic sanctions. The comments by Mr. Kim, the third member of his family to rule the impoverished nuclear-armed country, come as doubts increase about both North Korea’s economy and whether it will engage in serious disarmament talks with Washington. There are also worries that the North is continuing to build a strengthened atomic arsenal that directly threatens the U.S. The Biden administration, which took over after dramatic, but unsuccessful, direct diplomacy between Mr. Kim and former President Donald Trump, has described its North Korea policy review as “calibrated and practical.” But some experts say Washington won’t relax sanctions — a step North Korea badly wants — until the North first takes denuclearisation steps. That may be unlikely because Mr. Kim is seen by many outside analysts as viewing his weapons as his government’s only guarantee of survival. In a letter to workers, Mr. Kim said “the struggle against the anti-socialist and non-socialist practices is a do-or-die battle to defend the working-class purity and lifeline of our style of socialism,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kim-promises-to-build-north-korea-socialism/article34662498.ece

But on the ground, since the Oslo Accords were signed, there has been little progress on the two-state solution and Israel has only tightened its occupation of Palestine over the years. In a conversation moderated by Stanly Johny , Nathan Thrall and A.K. Ramakrishnan discuss the past, present and future of the Palestine question. Edited excerpts:  The most recent phase of the Israel-Palestine crisis was more than the bombing of and rockets from Gaza. There were also protests from the Gaza Strip through the Israeli cities to East Jerusalem and West Bank. How do you look at this development? Nathan Thrall:This [escalation] was rather different from the escalations that we saw in Gaza in 2014, 2012, 2009 and 2008. The Palestinian citizens of Israel protested in large numbers and they’re being arrested in large numbers today. That is something that occurred during the First Intifada. At the beginning of the Second Intifada, when what Israel calls “the October events” took place, 13 Palestinian citizens of Israel were killed in protests. So, there is a precedent for this. But it did feel different from the escalations of the last decade or so. It sent a clear message to the world and much of the Israeli public that after over 70 years of Israeli policy to fragment the Palestinian people, treat them differently, and subject them to different rules and restrictions, the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the Palestinian people at large are one. This is an enormous challenge to the existing paradigm of the international community, the two-state solution. Most of the world has treated the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as though it’s more or less a dispute over the occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza. The paradigm has been more or less that of a border dispute. But when the Palestinian people come together and show that the Palestinians of the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza are just one part of the Palestinian people and this is a national struggle of all the Palestinian people who are still united as one, that paradigm starts to make a lot less sense. If you look at it from the point of view of the Palestinian people, or from a historical point of view, we can argue that the two-state solution doesn’t make sense. But practically, what do you think can be done? A.K. Ramakrishnan:What is significant is to recognise that from 1967 onwards, Palestinian territories have been under Israeli control. And that is where the narrative has to change from two entities fighting against each other for a particular piece of land to the very conception of a colonial order. If the reality of the coloniser-colonised equation is recognised, one can think about what solution is possible. And in addressing that aspect of resolving the conflict, this recognition of the complete control of Israel is the first step. But that’s precisely what is being resisted by the Israeli government. Most of the peace processes that we have seen are mechanisms for postponing any kind of permanent settlement of the issue. So, that’s why there is a dead end to the peace process, because it’s not driving us anywhere towards any acceptable solution. The two-state solution has been the internationally accepted solution to the problem. But there have been practical impediments such as increasing illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. And the very question of contiguous territory for the Palestinians to establish an independent state of their own is not available in a practical sense, because under Israeli occupation, there has been change in the geography of the Palestinian territories over decades. So, practical problems regarding the two-state solution exist, particularly the status of Jerusalem and the future of Palestinian refugees outside the occupied territories and outside historical Palestine. The whole idea of the Israeli Jewish people and the Palestinian people living together in a democratic state is still treated as a utopia. But what is important is to recognise that the events in the current phase of the conflict are leading to newer thinking and therefore, when one thinks about a solution, one has to take into account the new narratives that are emerging out of newer types of struggles. The two dominant political factions of the Palestinian side have directly or indirectly accepted the idea of two states. In that context, and given the other challenges, is a one-state solution a utopia? NT:It’s correct that the main political parties among the Palestinians have supported a two-state solution — de facto in Hamas’s case, but this is the consensus position among Palestinians. Now, it’s important to note that the Palestinian support for a two-state solution does not derive from a vision of what would be most just or most desirable. At the start of the Zionist movement, at the end of the 19th century, the Jews in Palestine made up about 3% of the population in 1882 and Palestinians were the remaining 97%. Over time, we have seen the slow takeover of Palestine and the transformation of it into the land of Israel. Palestinians wouldn’t come up with a solution that would give them a disconnected state without true sovereignty and a mere 22% of their homeland. The two-state solution is based on Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 War, but the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded before the 1967 War, the conflict factor was founded before the 1967 War, the project of Palestinian liberation and return of the refugees all precede the 1967 War. So, the roots of the Palestinian national movement are much deeper. Now, it’s clear that a two-state solution isn’t happening. Even the two-state solution, the more realistic version of it, where the Palestinian state is demilitarised, where Palestinians have tunnels that they can use to go under sub-sovereign Israeli territory in order to reach Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, where most of the settlements [in the West Bank and East Jerusalem] will be annexed to Israel, where Gaza and the West Bank are disconnected from one another — even that proposal of the Geneva initiative, made during the Second Intifada, isn’t happening. There’s no two-state solution happening. Everyone recognises that this is the case. It would take power that the Palestinians currently do not have in order to really bring about any solution. So, the situation we’re looking at now is a continuation of what the human rights organisations have all deemed meets the definition of crime against humanity of apartheid. And really, any alternative to that is a utopia. So, what does Israel want? Does it want to continue this system of occupation forever? How long will it be able to do it? AKR:The Israeli government wants not only the status quo of its occupation and its colonial policies to continue, but also expand its control and annex more territories that it occupies. What is preventing it from totally decimating Palestinian life and their resistance is the voices coming not only from the Palestinians within the occupied territories, but also the Palestinians from within the state of Israel; and from across the world. Therefore, the pressure that the Israeli population, both Jews and Arabs, can have on their government to change its policies; the popular pressure on the American government to change its continued strong support for the state of Israel; and international pressure [to restrain Israel] from doing what it is doing against the Palestinians all matter. There are questions on whether states in the international community are ready to accept this reality of day-to-day oppression of a set of people. But within Israel and within the U.S., pressure is much more significant. Nathan, in your book you have written that Israel has made concessions in the past, but only when it was forced to do so, whether due to international pressure or violent Palestinian resistance. Now, you have a Democratic administration in Washington. Do you see any kind of meaningful pressure coming from the White House, or the liberal flank of the Democratic Party, on Israel, that would force Israel to make some concessions to the Palestinians? NT:From the White House, I do not see any possibility of real pressure that would result in a true change to the status quo. From the liberal or progressive wing of the Democratic Party, I see a long-term possibility of change. If we’re talking about the present Congress, look at the very simple Bill that doesn’t change U.S. aid to Israel, but simply calls for the U.S. to examine its role in a policy like the detention of Palestinian children. Even something as simple as that, which still isn’t touching aid, which is the really big thing for Democrats, is not realistic in the present Congress and probably not in the next one either. So, it’s a very long road. But the trends in the U.S. do seem to suggest that that constituency is going to grow. And some of the people who are behind it are among the most popular politicians in America, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. So, it is possible that we will reach a point in the distant future at which the U.S. can put significant pressure on Israel in the way that it had before. It’s also very important to remember the critical role of the Palestinians in bringing about the pressure — the pressure can’t just come from growing sympathy for Palestinians in Congress or among progressives or internationally. The Israeli narrative is that it is fighting terror. The Israelis, the Americans and the European Union have all designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation. So, is Hamas actually weakening the greater Palestinian movement or making it stronger? AKR:If the Palestinian voices have to be heard, we have to recognise the diversity of voices amongst the Palestinians. In the initial days [of the Palestinian resistance], several Palestinian organisations, including Fatah and PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], took the armed struggle as their way of placing the Palestine issue before the international community and to resist Israeli occupation. But then under [PLO Chairman Yasser] Arafat’s leadership, the PLO came to the negotiating table, took the diplomatic path. The First Intifada was more or less non-violent. It is in that context that Hamas emerged, in 1987. And Hamas became part of the armed resistance. The whole point of talking about Hamas as something which is really distinct from other Palestinian entities would not be a good thing to do. Because there is already an attempt to separate the West Bank Palestinians and the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip. Some people even talked about three states. This time, the Palestinian identity is being asserted in a big manner. Therefore, I would view the kind of ideological division between Fatah and Hamas, between various Palestinian organisations, as something that comes up as part of what to do in a very dire condition of occupation. What kind of strategy they have to adopt, or what kind of ideology the Palestinians have to follow is up to them. But this whole narrative of seeing the Palestinians as being divided... they may have differences, but I think on the basic question of liberating Palestine, the question of an independent Palestinian state, the Palestinians are united, and that is the core of the Palestine question.  It would take power that the Palestinians currently do not have in order to really bring about any solution.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Culture, increasingly fractured and unplanned||We have been given to understand from the publicly known plans for the “Central Vista Redevelopment Project”, that the National Museum of India is to occupy what are currently the South Block offices of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Defence, and the Ministry of External Affairs, as well as the North Block offices of the Home and Finance Ministries. These buildings were designed by Herbert Baker. The Parliament House building designed by Edwin Lutyens is to be turned into another museum, apparently a ‘museum of democracy’. The national capital could, in that case, potentially have a grand plaza of three extraordinary interconnected museums in the vicinity of the Rashtrapati Bhavan itself. What a spectacular statement they would make to the people of India and the rest of the world. The problem is that we would have to wait for the North and South Blocks to be emptied for the Museum to move there. The new residences and offices of the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of India are to be positioned at the bottom of Raisina Hill, sandwiching the cultural plaza between the most high security premises in the country. The approach via Rajpath will be closed, and restricted access to this public space is inevitable whenever there is any movement of very important persons. There was a method to why Lutyens arranged plots for the four cultural buildings on Queensway (Janpath), which intersected strategically at a safe distance away from Rashtrapati Bhavan on Kingsway (Rajpath). Janpath had the plots for the Archaeological Survey of India, the National Museum, the area that later became the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), and the intellectual repository of India — the National Archives. Together, they formed a cultural district, set within public gardens, an avenue where you looked up Raisina Hill in awe at Rashtrapati Bhavan on the one side, as you looked toward the historic Purana Qila beyond India Gate on the other. Disaggregation as leitmotif That kind of vision of urban planning for a single, linked cultural district seems to have been tossed out entirely. The IGNCA can now no longer utilise its open spaces for pavilions welcoming the people of India. It was a fine idea to have the land for the many living cultural traditions of India and their documentation at IGNCA just across the road from the classical or historical art in the National Museum. The educational arm of the Museum, called the National Museum Institute, deemed a University, has already been relocated to Noida while the Archaeological Survey of India’s prized collections have been relegated to Greater Noida. The National Museum’s collections may also have to be split up: some in the Red Fort, some in storage, some awaiting their new home. Disaggregation, rather than unification of India’s cultures and communities seems to be the leitmotif. The aim of a museum of history, especially one that goes by the title of a National Museum, is to be able to speak to its public and speak to the wider world about the history of India. In the past few decades, redefining a ‘national’ project has become necessary in a world where families and identities are hyphenated. People are Indian while simultaneously belonging to some other part of the world. Speakers of multiple languages, Indians may also be from language groups — Punjabi or Sindhi, Nepali or Bhutia, Tamil or Tibetan — that are spoken by communities split between different countries. Our national identity has never been more this and that. The relocation of our National Museum provides an opportunity to think through its narrative at a decisive moment when India needs to see what it is projecting through its display, and be aware of whom it is leaving out, or relegating to different parts of the city. Aggregation of the differences then, would have been a more advisable approach. The public’s expectations of what they hope to learn from a visit to a museum is quite different nowadays to the intentions with which museums in India were created. Our history museums on the other hand serve to provide information as deemed appropriate by archaeologists of the early 20th century: with galleries divided into old-fashioned colonial themes such as Buddhist or Hindu art, Islamic art, or, separated by material: painting, bronze and stone for instance, rather than seeing them as historically contemporaneous. Gone are the days when objects could be lined up with the pithiest labels identifying the object’s iconography, its date and the dynasty whose reign it may have been made in. Even history textbooks have moved away from examining the succession of political dynasties to social processes instead. Museums must serve the requirement of telling multiple histories from varied perspectives for diverse audiences. Handle with care What does shifting a museum practically mean? The National Museum contains fragile Harappan terracottas, the ashes of the Buddha and sculptures as fine as filigree. At the same time it has sculptures that weigh many tonnes requiring a feat of engineering to shift. There are bronzes: from the iconic “Dancing Girl” to Chola bronzes, coins and more coins of gold, silver, copper and bronze from every epoch of Indian history and precious jewellery that was from the collections of the Nizam of Hyderabad. There are entire walls of painted ancient caves from Chinese Central Asia brought to India by Sir Aurel Stein, and there are grand Egyptian stone statues, and in fact entire wooden chariots from South Indian temples. There are extraordinary Mesoamerican ceramics from the Heeramaneck collection and delicate textiles from every part of South Asia and, not to forget, the endless rare manuscripts and paintings on birch-bark, palm-leaf and paper. The sheer scale of arranging for the packing and moving each of these items will present a logistical nightmare. Over the years that I was employed at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, I had the opportunity to observe how aspects of that museum’s award-winning refurbishment were undertaken. The museum immediately employed more qualified conservation personnel and trained its existing staff. Every single object had to have its own special packing case and fragile objects had data loggers within climate-controlled cases. Each object was given a barcode number which was connected to an online location index that allowed curators, the conservators and researchers such as me access to the collections even while they were in storage. More importantly, they allowed the inventory to be safeguarded. Insurance indemnification also demands that every object has its own file documenting its condition at the time of packing to compare it against when it was reopened. Who will author and assess shifts in the condition of our objects before and after the move? Vacancies for 92 posts at the National Museum had to be closed a couple of years ago because finding qualified specialists in India could not be completed for years on end. As per its own documents, the museum has more than 2,06,000 objects but the official Museums of India website still only has a fraction of the collection on it. If a museum is a repository of our inheritance, then should we not know what we own before it is stored away? The choices ahead Last year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art shut down to undertake a similar move. Rebuilding that museum with a comparable square footage is costing over $750 million. Refurbishing old buildings such as the North and South Blocks to provide the facilities necessary costs money and takes time. It requires exceptional skill, and few architects have the necessary experience in adapting historic buildings for narrating current and future curatorial concerns, the movement of objects and people, fitting them with state-of-the-art storage, security, offices, lighting, climate control and improving their floor loading capacities. The largest Pallava and Chola sculptures in the National Museum weigh many tonnes obviously putting stress on heritage buildings. Worryingly, in a recent appeal made to the Supreme Court of India to encourage the shift of India’s top offices out of North and South Blocks, the government’s lawyers argued that the buildings were structurally unsafe and “are ill-equipped to meet even the basic fire and earthquake safety norms”. Will they, then, be safe enough to house our country’s greatest wealth and treasures? When will the personnel for this be hired? How long will it take and how much will it cost to make them safe? None of these details is publicly available yet. Perhaps the courts and Parliament will decide it is not wise to split an entire cultural district at this moment in time. Or, perhaps, this move offers us an unprecedented opportunity to build our nation’s capacities in the field of museum management like never before. Either way, the epitome of our collective wealth as a nation is in the balance. Naman P. Ahuja is a curator and Professor of Art History at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Nine-pin bowling aimed at free speech, privacy||The life of Indian Law rather than being shaped along mathematical exactitudes finds itself at the receiving end of an experiential tussle. This tussle has aimed at every stage to bargain for a Fundamental Right in return for some negotiation, sometimes with the desire of the coloniser and at others with the dominant ideology at the Centre. There are ambiguities The subject of concern now is the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (https://bit.ly/3oR8ISk) which threaten to deprive social media platforms of their safe harbour immunity in the event of non-compliance with the said rules. While there are positive aspects about the said guidelines, there are, equally, glaring ambiguities and stifling susceptibilities that should render these contrary to past Supreme Court of India precedents such as K.S. Puttaswamy . The Rules must be credited for they mandate duties such as removal of non-consensual intimate pictures within 24 hours, publication of compliance reports to increase transparency, setting up of a dispute resolution mechanism for content removal and adding a label to information for users to know whether content is advertised, owned, sponsored or exclusively controlled. Gagging a right However, the Supreme Court, in the case of Life Insurance Corpn. Of India vs Prof. Manubhai D. Shah (1992) had elevated ‘the freedom to circulate one’s views as the lifeline of any democratic institution’. It went on to say that ‘any attempt to stifle, suffocate or gag this right would sound a death knell to democracy’ and would ‘help usher in autocracy or dictatorship’. And so, it becomes increasingly important to critically scrutinise the recent barriers being imposed via these Rules against our right to free speech and expression. The problem started when these Rules came to life. They were framed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY). The Second Schedule of the Business Rules, 1961 does not empower MeiTY to frame regulations for ‘digital media.’ This power belongs to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. In the given case although MeiTY has said that these rules shall be administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, however this action violates the legal principle of ‘colourable legislation’ where the legislature cannot do something indirectly if it is not possible to do so directly. To propound the problem at hand, the Information Technology Act, 2000, does not regulate digital media. Therefore, the new IT Rules which claim to be a piece of subordinate legislation of the IT Act, travel beyond the rule-making power conferred upon them by the IT Act. This makes the Rules ultra vires to the Act. Fair recourse, privacy issues An intermediary is now supposed to take down content within 36 hours upon receiving orders from the Government. This deprives the intermediary of a fair recourse in the event that it disagrees with the Government’s order due to a strict timeline. Additionally, it places fetters upon free speech by fixing the Government as the ultimate adjudicator of objectionable speech online. The other infamous flaw is how these Rules undermine the right to privacy by imposing a traceability requirement. The immunity that users received from end-to-end encryption was that intermediaries did not have access to the contents of their messages. Imposing this mandatory requirement of traceability will break this immunity, thereby weakening the security of the privacy of these conversations. This will also render all the data from these conversations vulnerable to attack from ill-intentioned third parties. The threat here is not only one of privacy but to the extent of invasion and deprivation from a safe space. These regulations in the absence of a data protection law, coloured in the backdrop of recent data breach affecting a popular pizza delivery chain and also several airlines highlight a lesson left unlearnt. On fake news The problem here is that to eliminate fake news — rather than defining its ambit as a first step, the Rules proceed to hurriedly take down whatever an arbitrary, ill-decisioned, biased authority may deem as “fake news”. Lastly, the Rules create futile additional operational costs for intermediaries by requiring them to have Indian resident nodal officers, compliance officers and grievance officers. Intermediaries are also required to have offices located in India. This makes profit making a far-fetched goal for multinational corporations and start-up intermediary enterprises. Therefore, not only do these Rules place a barrier on the “marketplace of ideas” but also on the economic market of intermediaries in general by adding redundant financial burdens. Our concluding words on the rapidly diluting right to free speech are only those of caution — of a warning that democracy stands undermined in direct proportion to every attack made on the citizen’s right to have a private conversation, to engage in a transaction, to dissent, to have an opinion and to articulate the same without any fear of being imprisoned.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Addressing vaccine hesitancy||COVID-19 vaccines have been developed at a record pace thanks to the collaborative efforts of governments, industry, academia and other organisations. The primary purpose of vaccination is to protect individuals against severe infection. Vaccination also protects populations by providing ‘herd immunity’, if done on a large scale. Globally, vaccinations against polio, small pox, meningitis and so on have seen huge success. But there seems to be problem in vaccinating people against COVID-19. The possibility of a significant number of people not getting vaccinated thwarts our collective ability to reach the herd immunity threshold of 70-85% against SARS-CoV-2. As we mitigate the problems surrounding vaccine shortage and logistics, the issue of vaccine hesitancy needs to be urgently addressed. Vaccine hesitancy The results of a 2020 Gallup poll, conducted before the vaccine roll-out, were published on May 3, 2021. In the poll, one in three adults worldwide (32%) said they would not take the COVID-19 vaccine. India performed better in this poll with only 18% stating that they won’t take the vaccine. But vaccine hesitancy has gone up in India since then, due in part to largely overblown reports of complications or even deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context-specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. The influencing factors include a lack of awareness of the extent of benefits, fears based on inaccurate information, lack of access to vaccine, civil liberty concepts, cost, cultural issues, and various layers of confidence deficit (mistrust of intent, lack of confidence in the system) sown by conspiracy theories and disinformation. Disinformation is rife, especially on social media. Among those who are extremely hesitant are the ‘anti-vaxxers’. The rest comprise those who delay getting vaccinated, accept vaccines in principle but are sceptical of their use, accept certain vaccines but not others, etc. ‘Free riders’ are those who do not want vaccines, but wish to derive the benefits of herd immunity. The consequences of vaccine hesitancy are disastrous. If herd immunity does not develop, disease outbreaks and pandemics will prevail. The slower the vaccination rate, the wider the spread of infection and the greater the chances of mutations and the emergence of new variants. The right message To allay vaccine fears, our messaging needs to focus on simple facts. Vaccines have been widely tested. The side-effects that may last a couple of days are a very small price to pay to vastly reduce getting seriously ill from disease. The less than one-in-a-million chance of getting serious side effects far outweighs the effect the disease is likely to have. Addressing the strategies to blunt disinformation, especially on social media, Lisa Rosenblum says in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that quashing rumours and conspiracies with truth and reliable information alone may not suffice. Before attempting to persuade people, we need to understand the basis of their fear, hesitancy and the anti-vax attitude. By challenging untruths, we inadvertently feed the perception that we are actively suppressing the “real” truth. She concludes that often, the most educated sceptics will be against explanations of scientific facts. While not different from prior vaccine drives, the objective now is to reach more people faster with a message that doesn’t just provide more science but includes guidance. Providing practical information through social media, alternatives to apps for those lacking easy access to vaccines, and taking the help of well-informed frontline workers will all help. T.S.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Weathering storms||India’s capacity to withstand multiple, near-simultaneous shocks is being tested, with a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm, Yaas, striking Odisha, just a week after an even stronger Cyclone Tauktae wreaked havoc along the west coast. Yaas, which put up an unnerving display of tornadoes and rain, smothered the north Odisha coast as it made landfall, but the preparatory mass evacuation from habitations appears to have limited the loss of life. Yet, thousands have lost houses and property. West Bengal and Jharkhand also bore the brunt of the weather system’s force, as it punched its way inland from May 26, weakening into a deep depression. All coastal States facing the Bay of Bengal have always been in the path of severe cyclones, the majority following the withdrawal of the monsoon, but their vulnerability may be growing as pre-monsoon and post-monsoon storms increase in frequency and strength. Moreover, for the second year running, States have been hobbled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 season comes as another reminder that India will have to improve its resilience to cyclones. Governments are, no doubt, more sensitive to loss of life today and are raising the capacity of the disaster response forces, but much work needs to be done when it comes to protecting assets and creating fiscal instruments to help people rebuild their lives. While the full extent of displacement and losses from Cyclone Yaas is yet unknown, past experience points to a growing threat to overall well-being from such catastrophes. The World Meteorological Organization in its State of the Global Climate 2020 report described Cyclone Amphan that hit Bengal in May last year as the costliest cyclone on record for the North Indian Ocean, with economic losses to India of the order of $14 billion. In human terms the extreme event displaced 2.4 million people. What stood out in its aftermath was corruption in the distribution of relief, putting West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in a spot. The Amphan experience should convince Chief Ministers that they must insure people against losses from catastrophes using a system of documentation that makes relief and rehabilitation funds non-discretionary. Half a century of economic wisdom postulates that governments are best placed to compensate people, since they can spread the cost of the risk of disasters across the population. But the challenge is to address the risk of cyclones and other extreme weather events using specific funds, making citizens members in a social insurance model. Moreover, considering the negative climate change impact on tropical cyclones, rebuilding should use a green, build back better approach. Cyclones will otherwise take the shine off economic progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/weathering-storms/article34662466.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Incorporating limits||Speech is free, but it is a freedom that comes with responsibility. And responsible speech is not just something that does not contain abuse, defamation or incitement to violence. It is increasingly seen as expression that tends not to discriminate against or incite hatred towards groups based on race, gender, caste, religious belief, sexual orientation, nationality or immigration status. The world has moved away from a free speech doctrine based on a formal equality among different viewpoints to one that discourages the targeting of any vulnerable section. The term ‘hate speech’ and calls for laws that specifically seek to punish it arise from this inclusive understanding of the basis on which speech is restricted in modern democracies. In this backdrop, the proposal to incorporate provisions against hate speech in the penal law is quite welcome. A committee appointed by the Union Home Ministry, tasked with recommending changes in criminal law, is now seeking to formulate new provisions that will make hate speech a separate offence. The term ‘hate speech’ may not be used, but the panel is examining recommendations made by the Law Commission and the Expert Committee headed by T.K. Viswanathan, on adding Sections 153C and 505A to the IPC. The proposed Section 153C would target speech that gravely threatens any person or group with intention to cause fear or alarm, or incite violence towards them, and prescribe a sentence of two years in prison and a fine. Section 505A, on the other hand, proposes to punish speech or writing that causes fear or alarm among a group, or provokes violence against it, on grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, place of birth or disability. The Committee for Reforms in Criminal Laws attracted criticism when it was formed last year, as many feared a hurried process without adequate and wide consultation. Some lawyers and activists said it was not inclusive and questioned its ability to gather a wide range of opinion in the midst of a pandemic. While such points of criticism remain, it appears that the panel would go ahead and make its recommendations soon. In the context of the hate speech provisions, it must direct its efforts to define narrowly the sections it proposes to formulate and avoid the pitfall of using vague and overbroad terms that would fall foul of the Constitution. Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, it may be recalled, was struck down by the Supreme Court because it failed to define some terms that sought to criminalise offensive and annoying messages. Ever since this 2015 decision, some governments see a lacuna in the law concerning offensive messaging over the Internet. If at all new sections are to be introduced, it should be clear that what is sought to be punished is incitement to violence or advocacy of hatred, posing an imminent threat to public order or a targeted group. Only then will it be a valid curb on free speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/incorporating-limits/article34662465.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||In Lutyens’s Delhi, where some buildings will soon be memories||On crisp winter afternoons in Delhi, in the pre-pandemic era, a reporter could do the rounds of the busy bureaucratic corridors on foot. The capital is not much of a walker’s paradise, except the small pocket called Lutyens’ Delhi. A routine day would begin in the dark and slippery corridors of Shastri Bhawan that houses nearly half a dozen ministries including Education, Culture, Social Justice, Information and Broadcasting, and Women and Child Development. The building with its narrow windows, stacked one over the other like a child’s jenga set, rations sunlight. But though the corridors are dank, the officers’ rooms are well lit. A hop across Shastri Bhawan is Krishi Bhawan that houses the earthy ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development, among others. But Nirman Bhawan down the road is where I used to go if I was in dire need of stories. Going down Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg is a rewarding experience. It provides a majestic view of Raisina Hill. The North and South Block flank the highest office of the land, the Rashtrapati Bhawan, which faces India Gate down the road. Going past the peanut sellers, the teeming bus stand and the multitudes of people, one could appreciate the orderly tree alignment on the India Gate lawns. Nirman Bhawan houses the important Health Ministry. But my usual haunt was the Urban Development Ministry and the corridors of the Central Public Works Department where elaborate flower arrangements marked the Urban Development Minister’s office lending it a cheery air. Often, after negotiating the bureaucratese, asking multiple questions on a relatively unknown concept, jotting the key phrases down in my notebook and memorising the rest just in case the official refused to part with documents, I would be in no hurry to head back to office (this was in the pre-online days) and instead take a detour towards Janpath. Janpath runs parallel to Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg, but could very well be in an alternate world. The pace on this road is relatively unhurried. The bus stops are not populated like they are on Rafi Ahmed Marg. There are fewer hawkers and little traffic. If Rafi Marg is printed in colour film, Janpath, at least from the National Museum to the National Archives, should be printed in sepia tones. Till two years ago, the barracks next to the National Museum had the headquarters of the Archaeological Survey of India. Their offices are as moth-eaten as the objects they excavate or examine. This is where I would have long chats with officials on why overnight renovations were being carried out on age-old structures or gently nudge them for information on who gave approval for an excavation in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, based on some seer’s dream. Now, Rafi Marg is dug up. Shastri Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan and Nirman Bhawan are all going to be demolished. There are signboards prohibiting people from taking photographs. There are no hawkers thanks to the pandemic. In a few years, all these familiar places, the landmarks of Delhi, visited by the most powerful and the least, will fade in memory when the Central Vista becomes a reality. Newer ways of control will be found in the shiny buildings to keep us pesky journalists at bay. My hope is that we will still find our way around it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-lutyenss-delhi-where-some-buildings-will-soon-be-memories/article34662477.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Tagore and Non Co-operation||Attempts have been made in certain quarters to make political capital out of a few letters written by Dr. Rabindranath Tagore from far-off countries based on a few newspaper cuttings regarding the evils of Non-Co-operation. It has been sought to be made out that the poet is entirely against the movement, disapproves of the very principle of Non-Co-operation and that he, on his return back to the country, will whole-heartedly throw in his weight and influence against the present struggle. We have no doubt as to how soon , and how far, the fond hopes cherished by these enemies of freedom and partners in autocracy, of having found a new and not unworthy ally, will be shattered once the Poet sees everything for himself and learns by direct experience the new born spirit of freedom and sacrifice in his countrymen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tagore-and-non-co-operation/article34662475.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Refugee relief||The Union Government is greatly disappointed at the world Powers’ poor response for help to the refugees from East Bengal. Authoritative sources indicated here to-day [New Delhi, May 27] that whatever had been received so far as aid to the refugees “is a drop in the ocean.” However, the Government of India is confident that in the next few months, there will be a better understanding by leading nations of the seriousness of the refugee problem faced by this country. In fact, the entire rehabilitation policy of the Government is based on the assumption that it should be possible for the refugees to return to their country in the next six months. This is the period, the Government believes, within which world Powers would be able to exert influence on Pakistan to create conditions of normalcy in East Bengal as a result of which the refugees could get back. Meanwhile, it is learnt the average daily inflow of refugees in the last two days has registered a slight fall. It is now 50,000 as against 60,000. The Union Government has also tightened up security measures on the border with a view to preventing infiltrators getting into our country in the guise of refugees.

28 May 2021||MUMBAI,||Uncertainty, risks cloud outlook: RBI||Embattled by new waves of COVID-19 infections and mutant strains of the virus, the slow pace of inoculation in several parts of the world and vaccine protectionism, the global and domestic outlook has once again turned grim and overcast with extreme uncertainty and downside risks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its annual report for 2020-21. “Country experiences underscore the paramount need for speedy and universal vaccination on a war footing — the virus will mutate as long as it stays with humans; nobody is safe until everyone is safe,” the RBI added. Consumption revival key A durable revival of private consumption and investment would be critical for sustaining economic growth post-pandemic, the RBI said. “For a self-sustaining GDP growth trajectory post-COVID-19, a durable revival in private consumption and investment demand together would be critical as they account for around 85% of GDP,” it added.  Price pressures The RBI also cautioned that demand-supply imbalances could continue to exert pressure on the prices of pulses and edible oils, even as prices of cereals could likely see softening on the back of bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21.  The RBI also expects global crude oil prices remaining volatile in the near term.  ‘Monitor bad loans’ The regulator also asked banks to closely monitor bad loans and prepare for higher provisioning in the wake of the second COVID wave and the Supreme Court order lifting the ban on classification of non-performing assets. The waiver of compound interest on all loan accounts that had opted for moratorium during March-August 2020 may put stress on banks’ financial health, the central bank said. The apex bank, however, expressed confidence that banks were better positioned than before in managing stress in their balance sheets in view of higher capital buffers, improvement in recoveries and a return to profitability. Stating that the gross non-performing assets ratio of scheduled commercial banks declined to 6.8% by end-December 2020, from 8.2% in March 2020, the Reserve Bank said prudent provisioning had resulted in an improvement in the provision coverage ratio to 75.5% from 66.6%.                “As growth revives and economy gets back on track, it is important for the government to adhere to a clear exit strategy and build fiscal buffers, which can be tapped into in events of future shocks to growth,” the central bank said.

28 May 2021||Mumbai,||RBI balance sheet grew 7% in 9 months to March||The size of the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet, which is reflective of activities carried out by it in pursuance of currency issue function as well as monetary policy and reserve management, has increased by 6.99% to Rs. 57,07,669.13 crore during the nine-month period ended March 31. “The increase on the asset side was mainly due to increase in foreign and domestic investments by 11.48% and 13.75%, respectively,” it said in the Annual Report for FY21. On liabilities, the increase was due to growth in deposits, notes issued and other liabilities. While income for the year decreased 10.96%, expenditure declined 63.1%, The year ended with an overall surplus of Rs. 99,122 crore compared with Rs. 57,127.53 crore in the previous year, representing an increase of 73.5%, it added. Shift to April-March year On account of the transition to April-March accounting year from July-June accounting period, the reserve bank has come out with data for nine months for 2020-21 as compared to twelve months for the previous year. Earlier this month, the Central Board of Directors of RBI had approved the transfer of the Rs. 99,122 crore surplus to the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-balance-sheet-grew-7-in-9-months-to-march/article34662456.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centralise vaccine buys to minimise costs: EY||India can minimise the vaccination bill by following a fully centralised procurement model that would reduce prices rather than States pursuing purchases on their own, EY India said in a report on Thursday, calling for an urgent recast of the ‘current ad hoc and non-transparent vaccine distribution strategy’. If the country maintained the vaccination rate of 2.31 million doses per day recorded over March and April, with the current interstate distribution pattern, it would result in ‘a hopeless situation’, the consulting firm noted, adding that the pace of vaccinations had already fallen further in May. “At an all-India level, it would require 748 days to achieve full coverage of the population of 18 years and above (eligible population),” EY India said. ‘Too many days’ “But, in terms of coverage of individual States, some States would require far too many days. For example, Uttar Pradesh may require 1,553 days, while Bihar may require 1,351 days and Tamil Nadu may require 1,217 days,” it added. Stressing that the Centre had a primary role in ensuring countrywide vaccine coverage, EY India’s chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava, who was a member of the Advisory Council to the 15th Finance Commission, said that the Rs. 35,000 crore provided in the Union Budget for vaccination was meant to be transferred to the States. “If Centre becomes the only governmental agency to procure vaccines, the average price per vaccine would be much lower than if individual States get involved in floating global tenders. For vaccinating India’s total population aged 12 years and above at 108.5 crore, total required doses would be 217 crore considering two doses per person,” EY India observed, adding that a single purchase agency would be able to reap economies of scale and have more bargaining power. ‘Clearly avertible’ “At an average price of Rs. 300 per dose, the total vaccination cost would be Rs. 65,108 crore. If States’ involvement pushes up the average price to say Rs. 500 per dose, total vaccination bill to the country would unnecessarily go up to Rs. 1.09 lakh crore. This cost enhancement, which may be higher if the average vaccine price increases even more, is clearly avertible apart from avoiding the confusion ensuing from States’ involvement in vaccine procurement and implementation,” Mr. Srivastava pointed out. Observing that vaccination and extended lockdowns were the only policy instruments available to control the pandemic, he said, “There is clearly a trade-off between the duration and spread of the lockdowns... and the erosion of growth on the other [hand]. “The more extensive the lockdowns, the larger would be the loss in GDP growth,” Mr. Srivastava added.  Revenue shortfall Estimating a shortfall of Rs. 2.3 lakh in the Centre’s revenues overall, Mr Srivastava said the fiscal deficit may slip to 7.9% of GDP for the year from the budgeted 6.8% figure but emphasised that the government should not compress expenditure at this point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centralise-vaccine-buys-to-minimise-costs-ey/article34662464.ece
28 May 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Residential sales to reach pre-COVID size post FY23’||The residential real estate demand will touch pre-pandemic levels only after 2022-23, a ratings agency said. The top-six markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, the National Capital Region (NCR), Kolkata, Pune and Mumbai will collectively grow 5-10% by area in 2021-22 on improved affordability and work-from-home needs, Crisil said. Pune and Mumbai will show a contraction because of the stamp duty cut-fuelled demand in the previous fiscal year, it said. “Demand in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, the National Capital Region (NCR) and Kolkata is set to rise 40-45% this fiscal after plunging 25-45% last fiscal, propelled by better affordability and lower base,” its director Isha Chaudhary said. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune are likely to see a contraction of 10-20% this fiscal, after a 5-15% growth last fiscal, with end-users concluding transactions to benefit from lower stamp duty, Ms. Chaudhary added.  “Absolute demand will catch up with pre-pandemic levels only after fiscal 2023,” Crisil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/residential-sales-to-reach-pre-covid-size-post-fy23/article34662455.ece

28 May 2021||Gdansk (Poland),||Villarreal triumphs in marathon shootout||Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli kept his composure to score in a nerve-shredding, seemingly never-ending shootout then denied David de Gea as his side won its first major trophy by beating Manchester United 11-10 on penalties in the Europa League final on Wednesday. After a tense encounter finished 1-1 following extra time, Rulli stepped up after every on-field player scored their spot kicks and he comfortably beat De Gea, who finally buckled under the pressure in the unfamiliar role of taking rather than facing a penalty. The win gave Villarreal coach Unai Emery a record fourth title in the competition, leaving United without a trophy since its Europa League triumph in 2017. Gerard Moreno stretched to reach Dani Parejo’s free kick and steered the ball past De Gea to open the scoring in the 29th minute, only for United to level when Edinson Cavani poked the ball home after collecting Marcus Rashford’s deflected shot on 55 minutes. The shootout win also booked Villarreal’s place in next season’s Champions League. United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said his players had to remember the pain of the defeat for the future. Villarreal was the better side in the first half of extra time after Emery made all five changes before fulltime, contrasting with Solskjaer, who did not make his first change until the 100th minute. The five substitutes he did make all scored their penalties in an enthralling shootout but the 11th kick was a bridge too far for De Gea.  The result: Villarreal 1 (Moreno 30) drew with Manchester United 1 (Cavani 55). Villarreal won 11-10 on penalties after extra-time.    By the numbers   3 – The total number of shots on target across the 120 minutes, the lowest tally in the final since Porto v Sporting Braga in 2011 (also 3)  4 - Unai Emery is the first manager to win the UEFA Cup/Europa League four times (2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 & 2020-21) surpassing Giovanni Trapattoni  5 - United has faced Villarreal more than any other opponent without ever winning in its entire history, drawing all five contests  6 - United has lost six of its last seven penalty shootouts in all competitions  7 - Villarreal is the seventh side to lift either the UEFA Cup or UEL without a single defeat that season after Tottenham (’71-72), B.

28 May 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Humpy gearing up for online tournament||Koneru Humpy is no fan of playing chess at lightning speed. Neither is she one of playing online. Yet, she did pretty well at the Women’s Speed Chess championship last year, making the final of the last leg and finishing seventh overall. It had taken her some time before accepting FIDE’s invitation. She is, however, looking forward to the second edition of the tournament —beginning on June 10 at chess.com — with more enthusiasm. “It is going to be a strong tournament with so many top players in the field,” Humpy told The Hindu over phone on Thursday. “I will be preparing for it by playing against the computer.” Experience With few chess events taking place over physical boards because of COVID-19, she said the online events helped players to have some kind of tournament experience. “It may be a while before I get to play a game sitting across a chessboard, as I don’t want to take unnecessary risks,” said the World No. 3. “I had to pull out of the final leg of the Women’s Grand Prix, which is now taking place in Gibraltar.” That decision has come at a cost for Humpy, though. Having done so well in her first two legs, even a third place in Gibraltar would have given her the Grand Prix title. She is now considering whether to play at the Chess World Cup to be held at Sochi, Russia, from July 10. “It is a very important tournament and I would not normally want to miss it, but one has to think of the pandemic situation, too” she said. “I have some more time to decide.” Stiff competition About the Speed Chess event, she said she was expecting stiff competition. “Players like Alexandra Kosteniuk and Kateryna Lagno are rather strong,” she said. “The tournament could be an unpredictable one, especially since it is going to be a knock-out affair, unlike the last one.” Humpy is one of the eight players seeded directly for the tournament. Eight will come through a qualifying event, which opens on Friday. The event carries a prize-fund of $66,000. It will conclude on July 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/humpy-gearing-up-for-online-tournament/article34662623.ece

I hope not to lose here at Roland Garros. What I can do is fight.” Victory in the final in Paris on June 13 will take Nadal past the record of 20 Majors he currently shares with Roger Federer. Special place “Roland Garros is a very special place for me,” said Nadal. “Favourite or not, that is not the question. “What matters is to play well, and the one who plays the best will be whoever has the most chances of winning the tournament. “My goal is to be the one who plays the best.” Longevity Despite his remarkable history in Paris, Nadal, who turns 35 on June 3, admits he remains stunned at his longevity in a sport where he has been present in the world top 10 since 2005. When asked if he could have imagined still playing at 35, he said: “Ten years ago, no. But if you had asked me the question two years ago, maybe I would have answered yes. “Ten years ago, I had so many physical problems that it was difficult for me to imagine that my career would last so long,” added the Spaniard whose career has been plagued by a series of knee injuries.

The three clubs also defended their attempt to remake European soccer, saying the sport is headed for an “inevitable downfall” unless there are major reforms. Remaining holdouts The three clubs are the remaining holdouts among 12 founders of the failed Super League and have refused to renounce the project. They released a statement on Tuesday, a day after UEFA said it had opened proceedings against them for “a potential violation of UEFA’s legal framework.” Its statutes include a section on “prohibited groupings” of clubs or leagues forming without UEFA’s permission or outside its control. The proceedings could lead to the clubs being banned from the Champions League. Century-old clubs “Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid, all of them more than a century old, will not accept any form of coercion or intolerable pressure, while they remain strong in their willingness to debate, respectfully and through dialogue, the urgent solutions that football currently needs,” the clubs said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rebel-clubs-refuse-to-cow-down/article34662586.ece

28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Challenges chasing Pratyusha||For WGM B. Pratyusha life continues to pose challenges ever since she became only the third Woman Grandmaster from the Telugu-speaking States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in 2021 January. Only last week, the former Asian under-18 gold medallist was relieved to see her mother Satyadevi come back home from the hospital after a grim battle with COVID-19 which had also dwindled her financial resources. Online coaching “Well, now I have started online coaching to about 20 players and taking classes at some academies abroad. Though it was difficult initially, I got used to coaching now and also feeling that my game is improving because of the in-depth study I had to make to teach these boys and girls,” she explained. The 23-year-old Pratyusha, now dependent only on the scholarship of Airports Authority of India, is struggling on the financial front as the pandemic put the brakes on her aspirations since last year when it broke across the world. Her ELO was stuck at 2329 since last May because of the disruption in the competition schedule. “I must say that the long break came at the wrong time. I was at the peak of my career when I earned the WGM title. After that I played only one on-board event and a few online (mostly for charity),” Pratyusha said in a chat with The Hindu from her residence in Narsipatnam (Visakhapatnam). “I was not even sure where my life was heading ever since the pandemic broke out early last year,” she said. “I need a decent job for sure to hire a GM for training to realise the dream of being a world champion one day,” she said. “Frankly, it should take me just two months of full-time preparations to be ready for the challenges for on-board competitions at the highest level,” said Pratyusha who represented India in the 2016 Olympiad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/challenges-chasing-pratyusha/article34663062.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘More awareness needed against racism’||Denied entry into a restaurant on the basis of his skin colour recently, former Grand Prix driver-turned TV expert Karun Chandhok says more awareness needs to be created against racism through Formula 1 though it has already taken “impressive” steps to address the issue. Chandhok competed in Formula One between 2009-2010. He is now a well-respected commentator and alongside seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, one of the few non-white faces seen in the paddock. Speaking to PTI from the UK after posting about his recent experience at a restaurant on social media during the Monaco GP last week, Chandhok said he would not dwell on the past but focus on contributing to make the sport more diverse including having more Indians on board. Country not revealed He didn’t reveal in which country the incident took place. “I’m not really interested in talking about the past (about that incident) — the key is to talk about the future. We need to understand and learn why more non-white people haven’t been able to get involved in the sport. Formula 1 plus Lewis via his Hamilton Commission are doing some very important research to understand that. “Historically, this is a sport where over 90% of the people involved have been white and therefore as one of the few people from a minority ethnic background, I’m very encouraged to see that F1 as a sport and the teams as participants are taking steps to change that balance,” said Chandhok, one of the two Formula One drivers from India. F1 launched #weraceasone initiative last year to tackle racism and inequality in the sport. Chandhok said it will take time for the sport to become truly diverse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/more-awareness-needed-against-racism/article34662627.ece
28 May 2021||Southampton,||Nice to start getting on grass pitches: Williamson||New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson said it was a nice feeling to finally get some quality training outside after spending a lot of time indoors. New Zealand will be locking horns against England in a two-match Test series, beginning on June 2. After this series, the Black Caps will take on India in the final of the World Test Championship (WTC). “The guys are pretty excited to see the sun out, so it was nice to get out and start getting on some grass pitches after being indoors for a few days, and trying to make some adjustments which you try to do when you turn up to a new country,” stuff.co.nz quoted Williamson as saying. The 19-man New Zealand squad has been split into two teams for their only warm-up match before the first Test against England at Lord’s. “Warm-up games are important in trying to get the guys acclimatised in terms of time in the legs, and bowlers get their loads in. It will be nice to add a little bit of match intensity to make those steps forward to the first Test match. It’s nice to have that preparation and practice and hopefully guys get what they need,” said Williamson. Earlier, New Zealand’s practice ahead of the two-match Test series against England had been hampered by rain in Southampton, but head coach Gary Stead said that his side is on the right track because of some quality sessions back home. Since arriving in Southampton, the Kiwis were not able to train outdoors in a proper manner due to the wet weather. The Met Office had reported that the UK was at its 10th wettest May since the records began in 1862. “I guess when you come to an English summer you still expect to get outside occasionally. It’s been a little bit frustrating, because you come over and guys just want to get a feel for the different conditions here,” Stead said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nice-to-start-getting-on-grass-pitches-williamson/article34662591.ece
28 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Need to bring back former champions into coaching: Gopi Chand||Chief National badminton coach Pullela Gopi Chand said it is important to bring back former champions into coaching programme for developing sports in the country. Gopi cautioned against the over-dependence on foreign coaches and said it was imperative to have a right mix of foreigners and Indians in the system. He was speaking at the virtual inauguration of High Performance Coach Education Programme, launched by SAI and National Centre for Sports Coaching here on Thursday. “I think foreign coaches are very important for our development. But it is also important for us to have a right mix of foreign and Indian coaches to reach the next level. However, in events where we don’t have expertise, it is good to have foreign support in the beginning. “But if we are having foreign coaches continuously then we are not doing justice to our system. It is important that we learn from foreign coaches and gradually wean away from them,” he said. “Moreover, I think probably an Indian coach wants us to win more than a foreign coach, who cares more about the extension of his contract. For sports where we have consistently done well, the need is to bring back former champions into the coaching programme. SAI’s role “SAI has done some great work and in the next couple of months, we will have a former set of players joining the coaching programme. It will help us bring in majority of Indian coaches into the system.” Gopi said as a country, India was slowly evolving in sports and that it was important to devise our own system for sports development. “We face far more challenges than smaller nations. We have to take into consideration our geography as the places are far from each other, people are different, timings are different and we have people with different mindset.” Gopi felt it is important for sports to follow and emulate successful models like education where people are driven and where the system is more transparent. He called for more coordination between government, associations, schools and academies for parents to believe and feel confident that the system will take care of their wards if they have talent. Encouragement He stressed on the need to encourage coaches at the grassroots level to “hand over” the wards to be trained at the next level. “The transfer of talent is important and there is a tendency of the coaches at grassroots level to hold on to players far longer than they are capable of. We must look at a system where coaches are encouraged to pass on players to the next level.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/need-to-bring-back-former-champions-into-coaching-gopi-chand/article34662625.ece
28 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Rijiju launches education programme for coaches||Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju formally launched a High Performance Coach Education Programme at the National Centre for Sports Coaching under the aegis of NSNIS Patiala on Thursday. The course, spread over six months, will have seven modules. At least 250 top SAI coaches will form the core group of nurturing the best sports talent in the country as coaches. Each batch will have a limited capacity of 20 students only. “We go to smaller countries (for training) and we think foreign coaches have an edge over Indian coaches,” Rijiju said during the virtual launch in the presence of chief national badminton coach P. Gopi Chand, Union Secretary (Sports) Ravi Mittal and Director-General SAI Sandip Pradhan. “We speak about Atmanirbhar Bharat , it is the Prime Minister’s vision and is applicable across the board. So, we need to be Armanirbhar in sports too,” he said. “This can happen when we have only Indian coaches across all disciplines in Indian sports. We cannot be running around (to other countries) for a coach. “Our long-term goal is putting India among the top 10 nations in the Olympics and it is not unrealistic,” Rijiju said. “I think this kind of Higher Performance Programmes for coaches is the key towards achieving that,” he said. Gopi said this kind of programme would help in the emergence of Indian coaches and lower the reliance on foreign coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rijiju-launches-education-programme-for-coaches/article34662628.ece

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A celebration of the everyday||You cannot change the world with a song, but you can resist through a song, exclaims Shadi Zaqtan, a songwriter, singer and composer from the old city of Ramallah, Palestine, in the documentary series Occupied . The five-part series is the only Indian film to be selected for the Athens International Film and Video Festival, and will have its global première on October 24. Directed by Hyderabad-based filmmaker, Pranav Pingle Reddy, Occupied was filmed in 2016-2017. The trailer of Occupied was unveiled by actors Rana Daggubati and Shruti Haasan on May 24. The ongoing crisis in Palestine has once again brought the land and the plight of its people into focus. Pranav looks at Occupied as an attempt to go beyond the news headlines. “What does it mean to live in Palestine? I wanted to look at the daily lives of people,” he says. Celebration of life Each episode focusses on a young artist who uses art — music, calligraphy, poetry, dance and craft — as a form of resistance, as a way of celebrating life within the restrictions, and questions what freedom is all about. “Everyone in Palestine has a story to tell; it is up to you if you want to listen,” says Pranav. Occupied was filmed in sync sound in different locations in Palestine over 35 days by the three-member crew of Pranav, Prithvi Chahal and Arvind Menon, who took on multiple tasks while filming. The 30-year-old recalls what it meant to idealistically embark on the project in his mid-20s. The inherent interest in art and history stemmed from his father and aunt. His father, writer Pingle Ramesh Reddy, and aunt, Anuradha Reddy, have actively engaged in art, history and heritage conservation. Pranav was keen to study in a university that had history to it, and was not just a building. He pursued Masters in Film and Television production at the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, specialising in cinematography, production and direction. “I worked on documentaries that narrated stories of women empowerment, refugee crisis... subjects that moved me,” he says. Signs from the universe “I was keen on exploring stories from the Middle East, particularly Palestine. I didn’t have much money back then and didn’t want to borrow from my family. The universe, however, conspired to make things happen when someone paid me dues for a two-year-old commercial project and another corporate film came up. I pooled in the amount, spoke to like-minded people in Hyderabad such as Mahnoor Yar Khan (who has worked extensively in Palestine as an artiste and drama therapist) to get an idea of what to expect in Palestine.” Mahnoor warned him to go with minimal equipment to not attract too much attention. The instruction was to not take the drone, but Pranav was adamant: “She thought I was crazier than her,” he laughs. He made sure the three-member crew would use smaller cameras, but could not ignore the drone. Art for resistance Pranav says Palestine is an experience, not a mere place to take in the sights. He was moved by the indomitable spirit of the people who endure checkpoints each day as they commute, and try to smile through it all: “They go through a lot — houses being damaged and neighbours providing shelter as long as it takes to rebuild the house, only to be destroyed again. Yet, they carry on.” His team filmed as much as they could, returning with a huge volume of footage, which he says will require three years of editing and post production. In Pranav’s words, Occupied is a celebration of life and hope in Palestine, set against the backdrop of persecution and marginalisation, with a singular belief — in the end, love always wins.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-celebration-of-the-everyday/article34662728.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||17 again||Director Radha Mohan is currently making gentle enquiries about K-Pop to his daughter, who is in Class X and is crazy about Korean pop music. This is not for a future project, but just to stay in touch with the current generation. “Most of my ADs (assistant directors) are just out of college. I learn a lot from their way of thinking,” says Radha Mohan, who debuted in the Tamil film industry in 2004. He is still making films, but the platforms have changed. This Friday, his latest comedy-caper Malaysia to Amnesia will release on Zee 5. Starring Vaibhav, Vani Bhojan, Karunakaran and MS Bhaskar, the film revolves around an entrepreneur taking a flight to meet his girl after lying to his wife. “We knew from the outset that this was going to be an OTT film,” says Radha Mohan, in a telephonic interview, “Usually, after a shot, we look at the monitor thinking about the way it will play out on the big screen. With this film, we kept thinking about how it will look on a mobile screen. We worked on the picture and sound based on this.” Comedy is one of his strong points, he feels. Fans of his evergreen Mozhi (2007) will remember the Prithviraj-Prakashraj and MS Bhaskar portions fondly. “It [comedy] comes naturally to me,” he says, “But I try to lace it with an emotional touch. I have done that in Malaysia to Amnesia as well. Comedy is all about the timing that the actors bring in... I usually give them a bound script so that they can go through and come up with their own improvisations.” Also known for his strong female characters in films like Abhiyum Naanum and Mozhi , Radha Mohan believes that it is most important for directors to stay updated. “When digital filmmaking came into vogue in 2010, I immediately jumped on the bandwagon, making Payanam in that format. The minute a director keeps saying, ‘ Antha kaalam maari varuma’ (there is nothing like the past), it signals his downfall. The mantra is to stay updated with what’s in vogue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/17-again/article34662726.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Unlocking Loki||“Everyone has been asking ‘when are we going to see Loki’s real power?’,” starts Michael Waldron, as he animatedly dives into the upcoming Loki miniseries, starring Tom Hiddleston. “To have six episodes to explore his power has been so liberating because just from a ‘pure superhero abilities’ perspective, we wanted to explore the awesome stuff he can do, and also dramatically too.” Last we saw the Norse trickster god, he had a giant purple hand wrapped around his neck. The shocking demise of Loki at the hands of the mighty Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War broke the hearts of millions everywhere. What would the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) be without his quick-witted jests and pranks and devilish smile? In 2019, the announcement of Loki , fans already speculated that it would take place in one of the Marvel Universe’s alternate timelines — and they were right. Dissecting and peeling back the layers of the multiverse has been “thrilling” for Waldron, director Kate Herron and the series cast and crew. “It’s a new sandbox, a new corner of the universe to play in. It was certainly a challenge to define the rules of these spaces, the Time Variance Authority and how these branching timelines work. It wasn’t just about going ‘anywhere’ it was about going ‘anywhen’.” In the series, Loki is seen tumbling into the hands of the regulation-body Time Variance Authority, headed by Mobius (played by Owen Wilson). Explaining that “it was a blast” to tip the scales for Loki while making room for his inevitable naughtiness, Waldron says, “It was a chance for our writers’ room to delve into some therapy, if they ever had to go to the DMV (US Department of Motor Vehicles). While we were writing the show, I was in the process of getting a new passport. And you go back to work and go ‘ugh, you’ll never guess the bureaucratic red tape I have had to deal with! But we got excited, too, and were like ‘That’s the TVA!’ so we used that. Taking an organisation that is so soul-crushing by-the-book, so to speak, in their managing of time and dropping the most chaotic character in all of the MCU smack-dab in the middle of that is just amazing juxtaposition.” Waldron, who has worked on projects such as Rick and Morty , and is set to produce MCU’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , has nothing but high praise for Hiddleston and his versatility as an actor and storyteller. It was integral that he pushes Hiddleston’s boundaries. “That’s where the collaboration between writers and actors is such a joy...when you push one another,” he explains, “and my goal from day one was to tell a story of Loki that had never been told before. Now we are starting with this version of Loki at the end of the first Avengers film. So it was our responsibility to not retread old ground. Tom was more than game for that, in fact, he wanted to do that and go deeper into Loki’s shapeshifting identity.” Probably one of the best surprises is Owen Wilson thrown into the mix. So what about Wilson struck a chord with Waldron? “ I love Owen and he is so great in this show; his energy and vibe is so different from Loki’s. They [Owen and Hiddleston] both have natural comedic abilities and they can have a purely dramatic conversation and they could play off one another’s energies and make certain the right moments funny and right moments dramatic. I didn’t even have to set up punchlines to get laughs in this show!” Loki streams on Disney+Hotstar Premium from June 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/unlocking-loki/article34662727.ece

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Staged for the people||Renowned for his contribution to community theatre in Punjab, thespian Gurcharan Singh Channi (1951-2021) passed away last week. A recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi’s national award for community theatre, he was an alumnus of the National School of Drama (NSD), and served as chairman of Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi. Deep-diving into inquiry, questioning existing socio-cultural frameworks, and raising uncomfortable questions were important aspects of his theatre-making. A few years ago, during a brief interview after a Punjabi theatre festival, he said, “You have to leave behind what you think you know to create something original.” He believed that self-awareness was the means to explore theatre that would resonate with the deepest concerns of our times. “We live in a jail inside our head. We all carry the baggage of norms, customs. We are constantly making judgements about life and how it should be led. But to make honest choices, we need to let go of this baggage and embrace various perspectives.” Call of the stage The theatre veteran made some radical and difficult choices in his young days. As a Science undergrad, an informal mimicry act at Sikh Missionary College, Patiala put him in the spotlight. Novelist Devendra Satyarthi suggested he take up theatre. The theatre department had incidentally just been started at Chandigarh’s Panjab University, headed by leading dramatist Balwant Gargi. Though Channi knew nothing about theatre at that time, he took his chance and was rigorously mentored by Gargi before he went on to learn at NSD under another theatre legend, Ebrahim Alkazi. Journey to screen In the 1970s, Channi moved to the small screen with his production work at Jalandhar Television Centre and teaching tenure at FTII, Pune. He directed and featured in telefilms, made several documentaries, and was a Fulbright Scholar at the Boston University College of Communication. His tryst with the lens inspired him to delve deeper into social and political issues of the time. His spine-chilling television series Bandhak , Sehar and Naqoosh revolved around violence in Kashmir. He explored history, mythology and cultural heritage and came up with fascinating subjects. His insightful and well-researched film, Dharamkshetra Kurukshetra, , exploring whether the battle of Kurukshetra actually occurred, garnered much interest. Telefilm Tuttu evocatively brought to life the love story of a youngster with an intellectual disability. He also acted in Punjabi films — Shareek and Punjab 1984 . Connecting with communities During the Emergency, Channi decided to return to Punjab and devote himself to his first love, theatre. Though he continued to make documentaries, his passion for street theatre made him examine its multiple dimensions. By 1976, he began staging community theatre, leading to the landmark plays — Daffa 144 and Disturbed Area . Both productions were acclaimed for their authentic and radical approach in dealing with issues of political conflict and state violence. Main jala di jaungi took a hard look at gender violence and dowry deaths while Mera Bharat mahan unravelled the world of corruption and Khuli hawa ki talaash mein raised concerns about ecology and environment. Channi’s work emerged at the intersection of agitprop theatre and playful political satire. “For whom do we do theatre?” he asked. “Community theatre is vastly different from the urban elite proscenium theatre. It is open, lively, very creative, and thrives on improvisations,” he said. Over the years, Channi worked with diverse groups, using theatre-in-education for students, applied theatre for hospital patients, and connecting with vulnerable communities to express their concerns. His work embraced bold activism as well as therapeutic effects of drama. He remained true to the medium, believing that theatre is a way of free expression and liberation. “It is important to think of each person as a possibility,” he said, “and theatre offers a way of unlocking that possibility.” Remembered by friends, fans and students as a jovial and sensitive person, his legacy continues to inspire artistes towards courageous community work.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking the solitude||It was a joy to watch stalwarts of four Indian classical dance styles, Bijayini Satpathy (Odissi), Methil Devika (Mohiniyattam), Rama Vaidyanathan (Bharatanatyam), and Aditi Mangaldas (Kathak) at ‘Anvesana: Reflections in Solitude’, a digital dance festival. “It is fascinating to look into the minds of a creator. Does a physical lockdown mean a lockdown of spirit and creativity?” asked Lata Pada, artistic director, Sampradaya Dance Creations, Canada, which organised the festival. While providing opportunities for young artistes with virtual projects such as the one based on Maya Angelou’s autobiography, A Caged Bird Sings , and ‘Danceconnects’, which invited videos from dancers across the globe, Lata conceived ‘Anvesana’ for senior artistes, who have had forced periods of solitude in the absence of performances and tours. The dance festival was supported by the Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council, City of Mississauga, and Department of Canadian Heritage. The dancers were given about six to seven months to come with new works of 30 to 40 minutes. Part of the proceeds of the festival was given for Covid-19 relief efforts in India. Leaving behind none of the fleet-footed sensuality of Nrityagram’s Odissi, Bijayini Satpathy’s style is evolving with a slower intensity, broader chaukas, one-legged positions held longer, and less groundedness. Almost like a flower blooming, petal by petal. Gradual build-up Her production, the ‘Call of Dawn’ has three pieces in raag Ahir Bhairav; Bijayini challenging herself to not make them sound or appear repetitive. The dancer is in fine shape, going au naturel with grey hair. Bijayini presents the narrative of a young girl who, while worshipping Shiva, experiences her own sensuality behind the imagery of Ardhanareeshwara. With confidence she decides in the subsequent Nazrul Geeti ‘Aruno kanti’ that she cannot marry the awe-inspiring Shiva, and chooses the charming Krishna instead. The Pallavi (Sukanta Kumar Kundu), is a celebration of anticipation, just like the Chakravaka lovebirds. The short performance gradually picks up pace, as does the music (Bijayini, Srinibas Satapathy, Shivashankar Satapathy and Bindumalini Narayanaswamy) and lighting (Sujay Saple). The haunting melody of ‘Ta nom ta ta nom’ cuts through the darkness as the Ardhanareeshwara sloka unfolds. This is the slowest piece, filmed in partial darkness, with little reflections of the ripples from an uruli adding lighting effects on the dancer’s face as she portrays the Ardhanareeshwara imagery. The Nazrul Geeti has less embellishment and is sung at a brisker pace. The aerial shots during the raas segment are interesting. The last, a traditional piece, is the most colourful and vibrant. The camera (Mahesh Bhat) is unobtrusive except for some excitement during the pallavi. Strong on abhinaya Methil Devika banks on her exceptional abhinaya to present the story of Ahalya from Valmiki Ramayana. She spoke of how Valmiki had treated Ahalya briefly but sensitively, unlike later commentators whose interpretations came from a harsher, male-dominated socio-cultural standpoint. According to Valmiki, she was cursed to remain invisible, subsisting on air, until Rama steps into her hermitage and blesses her. Clarity and simplicity are the hallmarks of the session. Devika is as graceful and minimalistic as Mohiniyattam is meant to be. We can see calmness in the most dramatic of moments — during the lustful Indira’s entry and when Gautama catches the erring couple. Strong emotions are shown without losing the grace of the style. The beginning is rather poetic — Rama questions Viswamitra about the deserted hermitage. As the translation of the Sanskrit text scrolls across the screen, the camera focusses on the hasta abhinaya (hand gestures). Devika’s ekaharya abhinaya, a soloist playing different roles, is on point and clear. Her facial expressions keep up as Devika switches characters. She delineates the story and has explanatory texts running across the screen as well. The music flows smoothly, with the ragas changing at opportune moments. Devika breaks the storyline into melodious swara passages every now and then, gliding gracefully through the dipping movements without disturbing the mood. The lighting (Madhu Ambat) is restrained, most ingenious when showing the passage of time when Ahalya is invisible. The jerky camera work is the only spoilsport that creates abruptness in an otherwise seamless piece. Beyond the grammar A result of the “time spent without the urgency of performance-oriented practice” is Rama Vaidyanathan’s ‘Moving Boundaries,’ which tries to negotiate the boundaries of her dance. Bharatanatyam has a rigid grammar, so the adavus are a good starting point. Dramatic opening — Rama in an araimandi position patiently executing the basic first Thattu adavu, ‘Thayya thai’. She later tries to explore the same beat through multiple movements. The same goes for the ‘Tha thai thai tha’ adavu adding a tisra twist and for the elaborate theermana adavu ‘Kitathaka tharikitathom’. The process of unlearning continues with songs from Thirumular’s Thirumanthiram (second century), an ode to Shiva as the Brahman. Rama keeps to the literal meaning of the songs, which suits her theme — freedom in the dance arena ( Ananda aada rangam ), when boundaries merge ( Bhootanda peydanda ), and when boundaries lead the way ( Addangathai yennai addaki ). Especially striking is ‘Bhootanda’ (Mayamalavagowla raga, Adi tala), the song peppered with dramatic elements such as a tanam, layering in the neraval, and swaras, the dance included bits of a tisra alarippu alternating with the song, steps set in khanda beat following the rhythm within the words and more. She uses free-style non-traditional steps that follow the upper, middle and lower octaves of the beautiful music (Sudha Raghuraman). Metaphors like a soaring kite, raindrops, a peacock’s happy dance, symbolising a dancer without shackles, are effectively used and caught on camera (Inee Singh). The last scene is the most dramatic — the dancer in araimandi practising ‘Thayya thai’ illuminated by the same band of light (Gyan Dev). A return to the fold perhaps? Camera keeps time ‘Lost…in the forest!’ is all about the sthayi of the pandemic. As Aditi Mangaldas says, “Dance needs to breathe the air of the now.” Stunning music (Shubha Mudgal), arresting visuals such as eerie, empty frames moving in the wind, and brilliant tatkaar in ‘ Naav mein nadiya’ (Boat in the river), a poem by Kunwar Narain. It is about the chills of a gloomy night, a dark river, life and loss. The camera seems to be in a frenzy. When the dancer twirls, it twirls too and at some point it looks like both may collide. Aditi explains that the camera’s movements were intentional, to add to the sense of being lost. She stands by the window watching helplessly, waiting, or sometimes reaching out as Shubha sings, ‘ gehra hai, andhera hai.. ’ (it is deep, it is dark). The fleeting moment of hope is gone. Hope building up and dwindling, is a constant through the piece, as the dancer searches for safe ground. Aditi’s next piece is lighter, a Bharatendu Harishchandra poem, Chhan chhan chhip chhip ( translated as ‘now seen… now not), tells of the moon rising and hiding. The protagonist is a deer that is startled by the appearance of two moons, one in the sky and the other, a reflection in the water. The tihais in teen taal are brilliant, the dancer turning into a deer on the sam every time. The camera seems excited with aerial angles, but when it tries to keep pace with the dancer at eye-level, it’s disturbing. As she leaps across the forest as a deer, Aditi’s energy is unstoppable — she executes a 33-chakkar sequence as the deer sees the moon emerges from the clouds. Overall, a festival with thought-provoking pieces during these times of despair.  The Chennai-based author writes on classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/breaking-the-solitude/article34662427.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The black soil spoke||The transformation of Rayangala Srikrishna Rajanarayana Perumal Ramanujam Naicker into the writer Ki. Rajanarayanan (KiRa) followed a most unlikely path. A late bloomer, who did not write much until his late 30s, got the honour of a state funeral, denied even to R.K. Narayan and Jayakanthan and which the government of Tamil Nadu usually reserves for filmstars. Consumptive in his youth, the timely discovery of streptomycin saved him, and KiRa died shy of his centenary, alert in body and mind. He dropped out of school in Class VII, entering a school building only when caught in the rains — in a twist to the Tamil saying, KiRa would add that even then he ended up watching the downpour — but ended up as a university professor. In a notoriously petty literary world, KiRa won universal adulation, respected by fellow writers and celebrated by three generations of readers. KiRa inscribed a new landscape on the literary map. Deep in the south of Tamil Nadu is a vast tract of black cotton soil, called karisal. Skirted by the Thamirabarani river, the soil, though fertile, is dry. Both monsoons give this region the miss. It was only in the late 16th century, with the arrival of Telugu-speaking peasant castes, that the land came under the plough. This region and its people are the setting for all of KiRa’s works. KiRa was born in Idaiseval, an islet of red land in a sea of black soil, off the highway between Madurai and Tirunelveli, near Kovilpatti. The prodigious writer, G. Alagirisamy (1923–1970), KiRa’s childhood friend, was his earliest inspiration. Another abiding influence was the connoisseur Rasikamani T.K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar (1882–1954), whose life’s mission was to downsize pedantry and expose inferior poetry. KiRa joined the Communist Party of India during its radical phase at the time of Independence. Though he distanced himself from the party soon, he was active in peasant politics until the time of C. Narayanaswamy Naidu in the early1980s. KiRa’s earliest stories, with themes centring on rural poverty and exploitation were carried by leftist journals such as Saraswathi and Thamarai, and his first book of short stories was published by New Century Book House. The disillusionment following Independence is an underlying thread in these stories. By the 1960s, KiRa had fashioned a new voice. Tamil has distinct spoken and written registers. While the best of writers reserve the spoken register to capture conversation, KiRa innovatively wove the spoken register into the narrator’s voice. Through a narrative peppered with colourful idioms, phrases, riddles, proverbs, suggestive euphemisms in scare quotes,  and even idiosyncratic spellings, he recreated — some would say he romanticised — the karisal world. Rather than experimenting with form like many of his contemporaries, KiRa trusted on the eccentricities of his characters and their offbeat lives. Unlike the peasants of, say, Premchand’s stories, KiRa’s peasants are smart and sharp, using their wit and experience to face the demands of a harsh world. Recognition came late. Though his landmark first collection, Kathavu , was published in 1965, it was with his first novel, Gopalla Gramam , published in 1976, did he stir a sensation. Overturning conventional narrative forms, this grandfatherly tale of the Telugu-speaking Naicker community’s migration to the deep south to strike root in the karisal takes on Marquezian proportions with its origin myths, branch stories, and oral traditions. At this time, the poet Meera (M. Rajendran) had established a niche publishing house, Annam, in out-of-the-way Sivagangai. From as early as 1974, Meera was in conversation with KiRa to publish his work. What followed over the next two decades is the stuff of literary legend. In a moving acknowledgement, KiRa once called Meera ‘that unmai (true) Tamil professor’. Meera created new opportunities for KiRa to expand and vary his output. A particularly daring move was to publish a dictionary of the karisal dialect, when no market for such a book existed. For all the criticism from linguists and lexicographers, the dictionary, a veritable cultural compendium, also affords reading pleasure from flyleaf to flyleaf. In 1984, to mark KiRa’s 60th, Annam published a festschrift — the first ever for a creative writer — as well as an anthology of karisal writers who had followed in KiRa’s footsteps. Anthologies of folk tales and oral lore followed. For someone with a distaste for classical literature, KiRa was, paradoxically, immersed in Carnatic music. Almost singlehandedly he brought to wider attention regional stalwarts such as Vilathikulam Swamigal and Karukurichi Arunachalam, thus emerging as no less than the chronicler of the karisal region. Popular Tamil magazines Junior Vikatan and Ananda Vikatan offered KiRa a platform, and he wrote a column ‘Karisal Kattu Kadithasi’, and a novel, Gopallapurathu Makkal , a sequel to Gopalla Gramam . Accompanied by K.M. Adhimoolam’s dazzling ink sketches, KiRa reached a mass audience in the mid-80s. A brilliant judge of popular taste, he plied his readers with what they relished, his interest in salacious stories finding a new platform. Controversies notwithstanding, readers lapped up everything he offered. Once KiRa shifted base to Pondicherry University, his fans were spared the trouble of reaching remote Idaiseval. A brilliant raconteur and conversationalist, KiRa enthralled visitors with his colourful and risqué tales. Following T.K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar, he was an unflagging correspondent, and his letters were collected and published in book form. As he once said, he yearned for the evening post much like he did a cup of coffee. KiRa lived a full life. Always one for company, Ki. Rajanarayanan would have preferred a good turnout at his funeral, with friends sipping karuppatti kapi and sharing stories of times past through the night. A state funeral must seem like poor compensation.  The writer is a historian   and Tamil author.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-black-soil-spoke/article34662409.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Anatomy of a drum||When his prospective guru in higher studies asked Erickavu N. Sunil to present his talent, the teenager played the mridangam with reasonable confidence. “You have a good timbre and command over speed, but the fingering needs rework,” said Mavelikkara Velukutty Nair. The response hurt the boy, but he remained tenacious. In Thiruvananthapuram, 120 km south of his village near Haripad in Alappuzha district, Sunil knew he had found his mentor. “I was only 15 then, just out of school. Yet I had already been learning the mridangam for a decade,” he recalls. “My new teacher made me begin from scratch.” The quest to master the mridangam prompted Sunil to migrate to the State’s capital, where he has lived for three decades now. Starting in 1992, Nair began mentoring Sunil at home, where the youngster would drop in from his college hostel. “If there are solid techniques underlying my artistry, it’s owing to my re-learning,” says Sunil. When Nair died in 2012, Sunil was working with an IT firm, and was at the same time a busy concert percussionist. While the aesthetics of the mridangam continued to bewitch him, the physics of the instrument had also grown on him as a subject that he thought merited research. He embarked on this mission armed with a background in science and technology. Sunil’s quest has now given us a book, the first of its kind. Resounding Mridangam: The Majestic South Indian Drum has eight chapters packed with content that ranges from profiling the instrument, the rhythms it employs, the various schools and major practitioners to, uniquely, its anatomy — as scrutinised by a techie. So, what prompted this exploration down untried corridors? Primarily, it was the syllabus for courses in mridangam across universities, says Sunil, who has topped percussion competitions at the Kerala and national levels. “Overall, 90% of the study material is uniform. Fair enough. But there’s rarely a mention of the science behind the array of beautiful sounds that the mridangam generates,” he says. What’s more, Sunil noticed that there wasn’t yet a book that comprehensively covered the mridangam’s past masters. “Yes, there will be accounts of Dakshinamurthy Pillai (1875-1936) and the three celebrated 20th-century titans Palani Subramania Pillai, Ramanathapuram C.S. Murugabhoopathy and Palakkad Mani Iyer. But after them, each work only covers a slim list of maestros from the region,” he points out. “I decided to include more, and started to gather information on famous as well as somewhat obscure virtuosos from all over the peninsula.” The book covers 217 stalwarts of the instrument. “I decided on 1950 as their cut-off year of birth. Those coming later are pretty well known in today’s Internet era,” says Sunil. “I will be adding more to the table in future editions. I have been getting valuable inputs lately, including from some unexpected quarters.” Mridangam exponent Trichy Sankaran lauds the author’s use of his “extensive scientific knowledge to deal with the structure and physics” of the instrument, revealing the reasons for its tonal quality, nodal points, and harmonic vibrations. “Sunil discusses the evolution of the mridangam concisely,” adds the Toronto-based professor, terming the chapter on the rise of bani s (styles) an “excellent addition”. Aesthete Achuthsankar S. Nair, who heads the Department of Bioinformatics at the University of Kerala, praises the book for touching upon the harmonics of waves. “The study of microtones, which caught the attention of Nobel laureate C.V. Raman, finds a full discussion,” he says, acknowledging its appeal for curious physicists too. Musicologist B.M. Sundaram describes the work as “painstaking”, while percussionist Karaikudi Mani praises the “well-thought-out and chronologically-designed narration on the nuances of layam ”. Veterans A.V. Anand, Kamalakar Rao and T.R. Rajamani are pleased by the overview the book provides, as well as the micro-level nuggets of information. “The reader will require several years to assimilate the depths of the writings,” says vocalist Neyveli Santhanagopalan. Sunil has ordered the 217 maestros chronologically. The roll begins with Marathi-born Narayanaswamy Appa, who founded the Thanjavur school of mridangam-playing in the 19th century. At the end comes Andhra Pradesh’s septuagenarian Dandamudi Sumathi Ram Mohan Rao, one of the rare women in the field. “The book takes stock of the talams in Hindustani music too. Also, it gives the Western equivalent of quite a few keywords in Carnatic,” says Sunil. It was the author’s son Bhagath Sunand, an arts buff, who designed the cover.  The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/anatomy-of-a-drum/article34662435.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||How 45 shlokas were set to ragas||Sringeri is the first amnaya peetams established by Adi Sankara in the south, and Sri Sureshwaracharya was the first pontiff of the Sringeri Mutt. ‘Sadasivendra Stavah’ is a set of 45 Shlokas composed by Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati, the 33rd pontiff of the mutt. Legend has it that when the acharya was travelling across Karur district, his palanquin refused to move at one point. The acharya got down and began walking. When he reached Nerur, he decided to meditate there at the samadhi of Sadasiva Brahmendra [whose aradhana was on May 21]. After three days of deep meditation, he composed ‘Sadasivendra Stavah’. The acharya was also instrumental in getting the complete works of Adi Sankara published under the title Sankara Granthavali . The late Carnatic vocalist, V. Subramaniam, set to tune Sadasivendra Stavah , which had struck a deep chord in him. Besides music, VS took delight in learning the scriptures. It was not easy though to set to tune the 45 Sanskrit shlokas. There were days when he would be disheartened about not being able to make much progress on the mega project. Yet he persisted and was determined to complete the task he had undertaken. According to V. Subramaniam’s disciple Maalavika Sundar, on December 2, 2010, when she and the other two students, Meenakshi Ganesh and Bhavana Iyer, were sitting in his music class, he asked Maalavika to write down the ragas that he wanted to tune the shlokas in. He wanted to set them in Ragamalika to bring variety into the tunes and he opted for Kanda Chapu tala, which suited the meter of the shlokas. Soon, everything seemed to fall in place effortlessly as the music flowed out of him. He quickly notated it while Maalavika transcribed the notation. Within 10 days, Sadasivendra Stavah came together in musical perfection. Once he had completed it, he taught it to Meenakshi, Maalavika and Bhavana, making sure they grasped the nuances and practised flawlessly in one voice. The ragas he used are Nattai, Hamsadhwani, Abhogi, Nattakurunji, Shanmukhapriya, Kannada, Brindavanasaranga. Khamas, Kuntalavarali, Desh, Kaanada, Behag, Kapi, Hamsanandhi, Bageshree, Sindhubhairavi and Suruti. After tuning the 45 shlokas, VS suddenly felt that verses 22 to 24, that were set in raga Vasantha, should be changed to Khamas. The invocatoryShlokaswere sung by him in Bhairavi, in praise of Vagdevi Sharada, and then there are dhyana shlokas. The rendition ends with the famous ‘Kothanda deeksha’ shloka, followed by the kriti ‘Pibhare Ramarasam’ in Yamuna Kalyani. VS went on to release Sadasivendra Stavah as a CD that had R.K. Sriramkumar on the violin, Mala Chandrasekhar on the flute, Jayalakshmi Sekar on the veena, and J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam. Meenakshi, Bhavana and Maalavika provided vocal support to their guru. It was recorded at Sruthilaya studios. It was a labour of love and devotion for each of the participants and the whole recording came together perfectly in one attempt. The CD was released by Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswami during his sashtiabthapoorthi celebrations in Sringeri, who also titled the CD as ‘Guru Keerthanani’. Veteran vocalist R. Vedavalli complimented VS, saying he had imbibed the ability to tune compositions from his great guru, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Incidentally, it was Semmangudi who had earlier set to tune the 23 kirtanas of Brahmendra, with many musicians to this day following his patantharam.  The writer is the wife of V. Subramaniam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/how-45-shlokas-were-set-to-ragas/article34662431.ece
28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Looking beyond concerts||With time on their hands and normalcy nowhere in sight, Carnatic musicians are busy creating interesting and thematic music series on YouTube. Unlike during the first lockdown, which saw a surfeit of random and generally poor quality programming in a frenetic need to stay visible, these series are more about researching the nuances, about knowledge-sharing, and documentation. Backed by the latest technology, the professionally produced series offer excellent options for musicians to engage with listeners in the absence of live concerts. Senior vocalist Geetha Raja sings with her students in her videos. “I wanted to document less-heard kritis in the authentic Dhanammal bani taught to me by my guru, T. Brinda. Her teaching was so consistent that if a few of her students got together now, we could render a kriti in unison without any rehearsal,” she says. Geetha taught her students these rare pieces, including padams and javalis, over several weeks, and then the group did some dry runs as well before recording. She also provided her students notations for the songs as a ready reckoner during practice sessions. “Padams, in particular, require maturity and repeated singing to convey bhavam . The videos motivated the students to not only perfect their singing, but to also discipline themselves to, for example, consistently singing each sangati twice.” She hopes the series will serve as a permanent record of a particularly hallowed patantaram. Animated series ‘Little Heroes’ is an animated series by violinist Rajeev Mukundan and his vocalist-wife, Krithika Natarajan. Rajeev, a gaming engineer from Carnegie Mellon University and a talented digital cartoonist and caricaturist had been toying with the idea of animated musicals using Carnatic music. When Krithika saw Baby Yoda on Disney’s The Mandalorian , she wondered what the Trinity might look like, recreated as children. “That’s when I got down to work on the idea immediately,” says Rajeev, who drew the characters and scenes. The simple animation is accompanied by a little description. Rajeev and Krithika read up on Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri to get a sense of what they might have been like as children and then embellished it with their own imagination. To depict the characters in an instantly recognisable manner was a challenge — which is why, for example, young Syama Sastri is shown with his characteristic beard. As Rajeev sketched the scene, Krithika worked on the music and its arrangement. She selected a piece by each composer and taught it to her young students, aged between five and nine. “The children and their parents worked very hard. We showed them the illustrations to enthuse them.” The music and the sketch influenced each other. The couple have a list of other iconic Indians from various walks of life; and hope to work on them and eventually compile it all into a picture book. Nostalgia and laughter tinged with poignancy mark Carnatic vocalist Palghat R. Ramprasad’s PMI Stories. The grandson of Palghat Mani Iyer (PMI), Ramprasad has been releasing a weekly video on his YouTube channel. “It has been my desire to compile little-known anecdotes about thatha and other great musicians of yesteryear, which my family has been privy to. My father and uncle have regaled me with these stories,” he says. Ramprasad began by writing these on his social media handles. “Some of my musician friends thought I should bring them out as videos in Tamil.” The object of this series, he says, is three-fold — academic (current-day musicians, aspirants and organisers could gain from glimpses into the thought process of the stalwarts), clearing misconceptions about artistes (Mani Iyer supposedly putting Dakshinamurthy Pillai ‘in his place’) and looking at controversial issues (Was Mani Iyer really against the use of microphones?). Through his ongoing series, ‘Layaaswaada - Taste of Rhythm’, ganjira exponent G. Guru Prasanna wishes to raise awareness about different aspects of laya that might otherwise go unnoticed. The episodes feature over 30 leading vocalists, instrumentalists and percussionists from across the Southern states. Topics include aspects of ‘laya vinyasa’ in various nadais, laya in playing for compositions, koraippu , yati patterns, laya in melodic elements such as alapana, compositions, niraval, kalpanaswaras, tanam, pallavi and more. Seven episodes have so far been released every fortnight. ‘Perumal and Providence’ is a three-volume audio production featuring several well-known young musicians. Professionally mixed and mastered by Ishit Kuberkar with recording engineers Ashwin George and M.T. Aditya, the coordinators are Sumesh Narayanan, who has done the rhythm arrangements, and Ravi G., who handled keyboard programming and ideas for many of the interludes. Says Sumesh, “Aditya Balasundaram of Coimbatore wanted a production that commingled pasurams and his father’s favourite kritis, involving many instruments too, reminiscent of the yesteryear Vadya Vrinda. We planned it during the lockdown last year.” The lead vocalists are K. Bharat Sundar and R. Ashwath Narayanan. The pasurams to accompany each kriti were selected by Madhusudhanan Kalaichelvan, using parameters like the meaning of the song, its kshetram , context etc. The first volume showcases two ten-verse pasurams . Bharat Sundar, who tuned and sang Thirupaan Azhwar’s ‘Amalanadhipiran’ says, “Setting it to tala was the key task since it does not have a metre.” For Ashwath, who tuned Thirumangai Azhwar’s ‘Thirunedunthandakam’, the main challenge was correct word splits. “These were eight-line verses with long words.” Both were set to ragamalikas with coordination to ensure no repetition of ragas. The second volume features an excerpt from a pasuram sung in viruththam format, followed by a conventional instrumental rendition of a kriti. To be released soon, Volume 3 is a multi-layered creative confluence, intertwining film and Western influences, electronic music, choruses, harmony and more, with pasurams and traditional Carnatic renditions. “We wanted to show that Carnatic music can be packaged in a contemporary and fun manner,” says Sumesh. The team was given complete creative freedom in execution. Sayee Rakshith plays the violin on many of the tracks besides being an integral part of the overall musical arrangements. “We derive inspiration even from completely unrelated sources. For instance, the arrangements in one song are heavily influenced by A.R. Rahman. It was truly spontaneous.” Adds Ravi, “We began with how we, as listeners, might enjoy this production. We took on multiple roles and went with the flow.” The series also features Mylai Karthikeyan (nagaswaram), Vishaal Sapuram (chitravina), Ramana Balachandran (veena), L. Ramakrishnan and Parur Ananthakrishnan (violin), K. Sathyanarayana (keyboard), B. Vijayagopal, J.B. Sruthi Sagar and Sujith Naik (flute) and Adyar Silambarasan (thavil). G. Chandrasekara Sharma (ghatam) and Anirudh Athreya (kanjira) have provided additional percussion support. Lockdowns have meant that some artistes had to send in their recordings from their respective locations, which were later mixed at the studio with additional layers of sound. In engaging with rasikas in alternative ways, musicians across the board hope to leave permanent, timeless imprints of their work and their legacies, that can go beyond kutcheris .

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||History in every stone||‘Mundeshvari temple is considered the oldest functional temple in the country’ — I have come across this clichéd-sounding line multiple times. And it set me thinking. How old is it then? Is it older than Benaras and its many temples? So I decide to visit Mundeshvari temple in Bhabua, 100 km from Benaras, to find some answers. I also chance upon a reference to the temple in Saba Dewan’s classic, Tawaifnama, where she writes: “Some recent scholars are of the opinion that the goddess installed in the Mundeshvari temple might well have been a deity worshipped originally by the aboriginal population, described in the Vedic and post-Vedic texts as asura and daitya. In the long-drawn-out struggles between the forces of invading Brahmanism and the indigenous population of the Kaimur area, the goddess seems to have been usurped and made part of the Hindu pantheon”. Along with two colleagues I plan a trip from Benaras. We cross over into Bihar and pass through a huge gate bearing the name of the temple. At the foot of the hill atop which the temple stands (the temple’s height is reportedly 182.8 metres.) we see many people in colourful clothes. The atmosphere is festive. Some are returning from the shrine while others are on their way up the hill. As we vend our way up, we come across multiple species of trees including arjun, peepal, chilbil (Indian elm), semal (silk cotton) and bael (wood apple). Nature and the arts have a close connection with all Indian temples. Temple design Fiona Buckee in her paper, ‘The curious case of the octagonal temple: An architectural analysis and revised history of the temples of Mundesvari Hill,’ 2020, describes the temple thus, “It is a sandstone Shiva temple built to an octagonal plan, with four doorways opening out in the cardinal directions and large central niches flanked by smaller side niches on each of the interceding walls. It lacks a spire”. She adds that it is “unusually broad, stretching 14m across from door to opposite door, which, combined with its truncated roof and heavy base mouldings, gives it a low-lying, heavy-set appearance”. Archaeological remains are scattered all around the temple. I try to absorb the history, and wonder if more temples existed on the hilltop. I then come across a sign that proves me right. It reads thus: ‘The large number of loose sculptures and architectural members scattered around the temple are perhaps part of the shikara and mandapas of the temple which collapsed long ago’. Most people here appear to be locals. While some wait in a queue to get inside, others prefer to pray in silence sitting amidst the stones. There are deities installed in the open as well. This temple is known for its offering of goats, but no animals are killed now; the sacrifice is symbolic. It is said that the goats fall unconscious as a priest chants mantras and showers flowers and rice on them. Then they regain consciousness as he repeats the mantras. Travellers’ accounts The temple, like so many of our ancient places of worship, presents a beautiful view of the landscape. I tried to imagine it during Hiuen  Tsang’s time (636 - 638 AD). According to the temple website, the Chinese traveller wrote about a “shrine atop a hilltop flashing light, at about a distance of 200 lee southwest to Patna”. Thomas and William Daniell, who produced the first published records of the site, came here in 1790. Buckee’s paper further states that, “rather than being seventh century, the octagonal shrine was built about a millennia later, in the sixteenth-seventeenth century, incorporating doorways and mouldings salvaged from the ruins of the seventh century temples that once graced the hilltop. This in no way denigrates the importance and sanctity of the monument or the site.” It is rather, she says, “yet another milestone on the long timeline of architectural patronage and worship at this remarkable hilltop”.

28 May 2021||May 28 2021 00:00 IST,||An endearing guru||It was a warm summer morning in Bengaluru. I took the metro from Malleshwaram to Jayanagar and arrived at Nrityakalamandiram, the dance school established by the renowned B. Bhanumathi. I straightened the pleats of my practice sari and held my breath as I slowly opened the squeaky wooden door. I saw a group of children learning dance steps in a far corner of the spacious room. Some girls in salwar-kameez were laughing and helping each other with stretches. Another cohort was busy memorising sollukattus sitting on the the red mosaic floor. If I had to describe the mood in that room, it would be one of joy of learning and the warmth of the guru. The veteran dancer-guru passed away on May 24. Beginning her journey in dance at the age of 10, she trained under legendary gurus K.N. Dandayuthapani Pillai, Kalanidhi Narayanan and Venkatalakshamma. A shot put player in school, she was inspired by the inimitable Kamala Lakshman to puruse Bharatanatyam. Well defined movements and subtle and effective abhinaya defined Bhanumathi’s dance. Undeterred zeal A stickler for tradition, her commitment to maintaining the authenticity of K.N. Dandayuthapani Pillai’s compositions was well-known. Unlike some of his other students who established careers in cinema, Bhanumathi, who came from a humble background, remained focussed on dance. Her journey wasn’t without challenges. In several interviews and during conversations, she indicated the struggles she faced in vadyar ’s class, but she did not give up. Bhanumathi’s greatest contribution, however, was her ability to nurture students and pass on her craft with patience, love, precision and humility. “When she would tell us to perform at an event, we wouldn’t even ask where the performance is or who the organiser is,” says Rashmitha Nair, one of her senior students. “That was the trust we had in her. We would just show up.” Preethi Bharadwaj recalls how the guru never stopped her from performing with other dance troupes. “She would always encourage me. She was generous and wanted her students to gain as much knowledge as they could.” Her students also point out her endearing and fun-loving side. They remember how she once drove a car wearing a helmet since she had forgotten to remove it after a two-wheeler drive. Or how she would sometimes forget the venue of the performance. She was part of the textbook committee on dance in Karnataka, besides contributing to help document Dandayuthapani Pillai’s legacy. One of her productions, ‘Bharatanjali’, likely her most successful group choreography, was presented across the world. She won many awards, including the Rajyotsava, Karnataka Kalashree, and Shantala Natya Sri. As guru Bhanumathi walked into the room, there was a definite shift in energy. We students stood in parallel lines and her thattukazhi guided our invocatory item. When I went to take her blessings on my first day in class, she whispered in Tamil in my ears: “Be gentle with yourself. The strength and endurance will come.”     The author is a performer          and researcher.     Bhanumathi’s commitment to maintaining the authenticity of K.N. Dandayuthapani Pillai’s compositions was well-known||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/an-endearing-guru/article34662438.ece

28 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||6.5 lakh evacuated people to be screened for COVID in Odisha||Odisha will screen around 6.5 lakh people, who were evacuated to different cyclone and other shelters ahead of very severe cyclonic storm, Yaas, hitting the coast. “During evacuation of people, due precautions were taken keeping the outbreak of COVID-19 in mind and masks were distributed. As there was emergency situation like cyclone, we cannot rule out lapses. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has suggested that health of all evacuated persons should be monitored,” said State Special Relief Commissioner P.K. Jena. “Rapid response teams, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and anganwadi workers would check their health status through door-to-door survey to find out if they have any COVID-19 symptoms. If situation demands we will carry out mass testing of these people to ensure that the COVID-19 situation does not go out of control,” he said. The State had evacuated about 6.5 lakh people, including 1.52 lakh in Balasore, 1.20 lakh in Bhadrak, 1.05 lakh in Kendrapara and 1 lakh in Mayurbhanj district. According to officials, the Chief District Medical Officers had supplied a list of COVID-19 patients who were in home isolation. They were shifted to either temporary medical centres or dedicated buildings which are to be sanitised later. The State had also suspended COVID-19 testing, vaccination and door-to-door survey in Balasore, Bhadrak and Mayurbhanj in view of the cyclone from May 25 to 27. Partial suspension was ordered in a few other districts. Testing resumes However, in view of an improvement in the situation, testing was resumed at many places on Thursday. Recognising the risk involved in evacuation of people during the pandemic, the Odisha Chief Minister had requested the people to wear double masks in shelters and wash their hands with soap and sanitiser before the cyclone hit the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/65-lakh-evacuated-people-to-be-screened-for-covid-in-odisha/article34663040.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||COVID-recovered woman develops complications||A woman, who recovered from COVID-19, developed perforations in the lower end of the food pipe, upper part of the small intestine, and the large intestine due to white fungus infection in a “very rare” case, said Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The 49-year-old woman had undergone mastectomy (removal of breast) due to cancer and had also received chemotherapy till four weeks ago. Rare case “The probable explanation for the perforations is a combination of three states leading to immunosuppression: a malignancy [carcinoma breast], recent chemotherapy, and a superimposed COVID-19 infection,” said Anil Arora, Chairman of Institute of Liver, Gastroenterology and Pancreaticobiliary Sciences of the hospital. But he said the general public do not have to worry about it as it is a “ very rare” case. “Out of the about 2.6 crore cases of COVID-19 in the country, there has been no other reported case where there was perforation in the lower end of the food pipe, upper part of the small intestine and the large intestine,” Dr. Arora added. All the perforations have been repaired and the woman is still in the ICU, but recovering, according to the hospital. The woman was admitted to the SGRH on May 13 with complaints of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. “White fungus is there in everybody’s body and usually it is a silent fungus, which doesn’t harm people and mostly remains in the mouth and gut,” the hospital spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-recovered-woman-develops-complications/article34662757.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Delhi government’s Home department and the SHO of Alipur police station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls, even as the Centre opposed the plea on the ground that it was “misconceived”. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi, appearing for the MHA, the Home Department and the Station House Officer of Alipur PS, argued that the plea for an independent SIT probe was “unwarranted”. The ASG said that the petition was seeking constitution of an SIT comprising officers “independent of the Central government” which was not possible. The court, however, directed that a status report under the signature of a Joint Commissioner of Police be filed before the next date of hearing on July 26. The plea claimed that on January 29 the farmers’ camp at Singhu borderwas attacked by some miscreants “with assistance and guidance of the police personnel” deployed there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/respond-to-petition-for-sit-probe-into-attack-on-farmers/article34662744.ece
28 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kin take body for cremation in e-rickshaw||Pandemic-induced lockdown cost Pawan Kumar Sharma’s family a dignified last journey as they were forced to take him to the cremation ground in an e-rickshaw, fearing they wouldn’t afford ambulance fare. Pawan (40), a resident of Shastri Park, was unemployed because of his neurological treatment and his two brothers – Kishan (50) and Balram (48) – are street vendors. Pawan’s wife Lakshmi used to work in a factory in Gandhi Nagar but is out of work as the factory is shut. Mr. Balram said Pawan, father of two daughters aged 11 and 3, was fine till Wednesday afternoon and brought milk from the market. “He loved tea and would have it a few times a day. Our mother made tea for him and he had lunch, after which he lied down on the cot. After a while, he just collapsed,” the brother said. They managed to find an autorickshaw and the two brothers rushed him to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. “As it was a natural death, we didn’t want a post-mortem and we decided to cremate him straight away,” Mr. Balram said. Out of work, they were barely able to make ends meet. “I used to make ladies purse at home and Kishan used to sell toys. Due to the lockdown, we have no work and are unable to earn. We are managing food with much difficulty as our father’s family pension has not started even though it’s been more than a year and a half since he passed away,” Mr. Balram said, adding that due to lack of funds, they decided not to go for an ambulance. Their neighbour Deepak Bansal, who was with the family, said he had asked an unknown person at the hospital if he could call 102 and arrange an ambulance. But he allegedly told him the call wasn’t connecting. However, Mr. Balram said they weren’t keen on getting an ambulance because of monetary issues. “We asked an autorickshaw driver but he refused to take the body. An e-rickshaw driver then agreed for Rs. 150,” he said. Free cremation At Nigambodh Ghat, volunteers of Centre for Holistic Development spotted the e-rickshaw and sought details after which they ensured that the cremation was conducted for free. “The government gives free electricity to the living but after death, they have to pay Rs. 1,500 if the body goes to CNG crematorium,” said Sunil Kumar Aledia, who runs CHD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kin-take-body-for-cremation-in-e-rickshaw/article34662749.ece
28 May 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccination eludes 18-44 group for fourth day in the Capital||There was no free vaccination, either Covishield or Covaxin, for the 18-44 age group in Delhi government schools for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday, said AAP leader Atishi. “This is the fourth day of no vaccination for 18-44 group in any of the government schools of Delhi. Both Covaxin and Covishield’s stock has ended for the youth. This is a cause of concern as youth was the only group which does not have any vaccine hesitancy and has been coming in large numbers to register themselves on CoWIN and getting vaccinated,” Ms. Atishi said. There was no vaccine stock for the 18-44 age group for the fourth consecutive day, according to a bulletin by the government. Also, there is no stock of Covaxin left for vaccinating people of 45 years of age and above, healthcare, and front-line workers, as per the bulletin. “Delhi has not received any new supply of vaccines yet. However, Bharat Biotech and SII, both have stated that the Central government will be designating the amount of vaccines being supplied to States. It is a request to the Centre to supply vaccines as Delhi has been facing a lot of adversities ever since the pandemic started,” Ms. Atishi said. She said that fewer people are now being vaccinated daily and most of that too is happening in private hospitals, which are inoculating at “expensive rates” of Rs. 1,000 per dose. A lot of vaccines are available in the international market which have not been approved by the Centre yet, but are approved by the WHO, she said. “This includes vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. Even the World Health Organisation [WHO] has approved them, but the Centre hasn’t done that yet,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/vaccination-eludes-18-44-group-for-fourth-day-in-the-capital/article34662754.ece
28 May 2021||CHANDIGARH,||HC flays Punjab police in rape case||The Punjab and Haryana High Court came down heavily on the Punjab police in a case of alleged rape of a 38-year-old widow by policemen, stating that it was highly deplorable to see the insensitivity with which police acted in constituting a special investigation team (SIT) with “all-male members”. Justice Arun Monga, hearing a petition by the victim apprehending bodily harm and tampering with the evidence, on May 25 directed the Punjab government through its Director-General of Police to constitute a new SIT. Justice Monga said, “The allegations and factual averments contained in the petition are so grisly and frightful, one can only hope, as is contended by the learned State counsel, that the same are fictitious. The State counsel argues that, in fact, a honey trap was laid by the petitioner, which later boomeranged on her. If that be not so, then it is a case which reflects the sordid state of affairs in Punjab police, particularly in the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) at Bathinda. The very protectors-enforcers of law and order have turned into predators, making a young 38-year-old widow mother victim of their lust.” The petitioner has alleged that her son, who was suffering from COVID-19, was picked up by the CIA men on May 6 from their residence after the woman declined to succumb to the sexual favour sought from her.  ‘False case filed’ The plea said that an FIR, allegedly a false one, was registered against her son by planting contraband on him so as to arm-twist the petitioner. Eventually, under duress to get her son released, she yielded to the sexual demands of the CIA staff. Justice Monga said, “It is rather intriguing, given the nature of sensitive investigation, that no lady police official has been involved, which is even otherwise the requirement of law in cases of this kind.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-flays-punjab-police-in-rape-case/article34663043.ece
