18 May 2021||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI/MANGALURU,||Tauktae fury: six killed in Maharashtra||Cyclone Tauktae began the process of landfall on the Gujarat coast around 8.30 p.m. on Monday as the State braced for the impact of surging wind speeds of up to 210 km an hour. Earlier in the day, six persons were reported killed in Maharahstra, as the “extremely severe cyclonic storm” ran parallel to the Maharashtra coast and wound its way to Gujarat. “Landfall process is continuing, it will take another three hours to complete its landfall process,” the IMD said in a tweet at 9.16 p.m. At least 1.5 lakh people were moved to safer areas in Gujarat with Tauktae expected to hit the coast between Porbandar and Mahua in Bhavnagar district, east of Diu, as the Army and NDRF personnel were deployed in the State. “Focus is to save lives, speedy clearance of routes to ensure movement of oxygen and standby arrangements at COVID hospitals,” an Army tweet said. The storm is expected to whittle down to a “very severe cyclonic storm” — still rustling up wind speeds of up to 170 kmph — and by early Tuesday become a “severe cyclonic storm”. Wind speeds are expected to remain around 100 kmph during Tauktae’s track over land for most of Tuesday. It is expected to peter out into a “depression” near Jodhpur by Wednesday. Storms are common in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in May, ahead of the monsoon onset — predicted to be May 31 this year — though climatologists have said there is an increase in the number of such storms in the Arabian Sea in recent years. Tauktae is the fourth cyclone in as many years over the Arabian Sea in the pre-monsoon months. Havoc in Maharashtra Six people died and nine were injured as the cyclone passed parallel to Maharashtra’s coastline, leaving a trail of damaged homes and uprooted trees. In Mumbai, with the heavy rain coinciding with high tide, strong winds and heavy rain lead to hundreds of trees being uprooted and waterlogging in low-lying areas. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the highest windspeed in the city of 114 kmph was recorded at 2 p.m. at the Colaba observatory. The IMD had upgraded the warning to extremely heavy rainfall in Mumbai during Monday afternoon and evening, predicting winds will continue and escalate up to 120 kmph. The administration moved over 12,400 citizens to safety from coastal Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad districts. Two fishing boats capsized in Devgad, in Sindhudurg, leaving one sailor dead. Another sailor was rescued, while three others are missing. While three deaths were reported from Raigad, two people died in Thane district. Four of the nine injured were from Mumbai, two each from Ratnagiri and Raigad and one from Thane. In all, 2,542 houses were partially destroyed. Flights diverted The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), whic suspended all flight operations from 11 a.m on Monday, resumed operations at 11 p.m. More than 55 flights, both incoming and outbound, were cancelled and seven incoming flights were diverted to other airports. Naval operation In a daring operation involving the Coast Guard, the Navy and the Dakshina Kannada district administration, all the nine crew stranded on board the tug Coromondel Supporter IX , were rescued on Monday morning. The vessel had run aground on a rocky formation off the Karnataka coast near Mangaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tauktae-fury-six-killed-in-maharashtra/article34582889.ece
18 May 2021||Chennai,||‘Job losses bode ill for the economy’||Rising unemployment, including among the salaried class, and shrinking real incomes have led to a lack of demand that bodes ill for the economy, said Mahesh Vyas, managing director at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). “Unemployment rising is not a good sign at all for the economy,” he said. “Labour participation rate recovered soon after the lockdown was eased last year, but has run out of momentum even before it could recover fully,” Mr. Vyas added. Unemployment rose to 8% in April, from 6.5% in March, the CMIE said. The labour participation rate (LPR) was 40% in April. “The LPR is about two percentage points below what it was before April 2020. This is a very serious matter for a population of our size,” Mr. Vyas said. Post-lockdown recovery Observing that the economy had recovered after the lockdowns were eased in 2020, he said, “All supply side indicators saw a robust turnaround. But where is the demand?” Asserting that the lack of demand was a bottleneck for further growth, he said, “Income and consumer sentiment have also been hit. Income is lower than it was a year earlier. 90% of families have seen income shrinkage (i.e., real income, adjusted for inflation).”  Domestic demand is key “We can’t depend on exports. It is domestic consumption that will help the economy,” Mr. Vyas said, adding that it was critical to put money in the hands of the consumer now. Significantly, the size of the salaried class shrank for the third consecutive month in April, with 3.4 million jobs lost. During 2019-20, there were 85.9 million salaried jobs. As of April 2021, there were just 73.3 million, he said in a separate note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/job-losses-bode-ill-for-the-economy/article34582891.ece

Also known as Mucormycosis, the Black Fungus was reportedly spreading due to misuse of steroids and hence the State needs to be cautious if medicine kits given to Covid patients contained any steroid drug, the HC said. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of PIL petitions on coronavirus related matters. Advocate General B.S. Prasad said he would require instructions from Public Health Director G. Srinivasa Rao on the matter. The bench also directed the government to treat the 15 teachers, who contracted coronavirus while attending duties for recently held different elections in the State and died, as ‘Covid Warriors’. All benefits given to Covid warriors should be extended to these teachers as well. Responding to another submission of lawyer Poojitha, the bench said the government needs to address on priority basis the issue of children being orphaned with their parents succumbing to COVID-19. It directed the Women and Child welfare department to file an affidavit on how it was going to rehabilitate them and measures to check their illegal adoption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-asks-ts-govt-how-it-will-tackle-black-fungus/article34583325.ece
18 May 2021||Bengaluru,||‘No decision yet on SSLC, II PU exam cancellation’||Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Monday said no decision had been taken to cancel SSLC or II PU examinations. Both the examinations, scheduled to be held in May and June, have been postponed owing to the second wave of COVID-19. The new examination timetable is yet to be decided. He appealed to students to study for the exam and not get distracted. The move to postpone the examinations was welcomed by students, parents, and school managements. According to the calendar of events, the 2021-2022 academic year is scheduled to begin on June 15. While the CBSE and the CISCE have cancelled class X examination and decided to assess students based on their previous assessment, teachers of State syllabus schools have said that the assessment conducted this academic year is inadequate to grade them for class X. The Department of Public Instruction had asked schools to conduct two formative assessments, but most private schools have even conducted summative assessments online. However, a significant chunk of students, particularly those from government schools, have not submitted a single assessment for the 2020-2021 academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-decision-on-sslc-ii-pu-exam-cancellation/article34582933.ece

A vacation Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B.R. Gavai expressed concern about the health of Mr. Raju and directed that he be admitted in the Army Hospital. The Bench referred to the magistrate’s remarks that Mr. Raju required medical examination. The magistrate had noted the contention raised by Mr. Raju’s counsel that his client, a sitting MP, was subject to “third degree” methods by the police and he could hardly walk. Besides, Mr. Raju had undergone a by-pass surgery last year. The High Court, too, had directed for medical examination. In its order, the SC said the medical examination at the Army Hospital should be conducted in the presence of a judicial officer nominated by the Telangana HC Chief Justice. Mr. Raju had in recent months revolted against his party’s leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-orders-medical-exam-of-ysr-congress-mp/article34582881.ece

Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ had convened the meeting with State Education Secretaries to discuss implementation of NEP 2020, the COVID-19 situation, and online education. However, he had called for the participation of the Education Secretary alone, and not State Ministers of Education. In a letter to the Union Minister on Sunday, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said it would be appropriate only if the Education Department Minister participated along with officials in such a high-level meeting. He further said that he was ready to participate and share views on the implementation of the NEP. “Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had said that I should take part in it as the Minister of the department and we subsequently wrote to the Centre as well about my participation in the meeting. But there hasn’t been any response, and we chose not to participate,” Mr. Poyyamozhi told reporters at Tiruchi on Monday. “We are not looking to fight with them [Centre], but want to be able to participate and put forth our views on the NEP and other issues,” he added. The DMK had strongly opposed the National Education Policy when it was announced in 2020 and had demanded that it be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-skips-meeting-with-union-minister/article34582882.ece

A statement by the Health Ministry on Monday noted that the reporting rate of these events in India is around 0.61/million doses, much lower than the four cases/million reported by the United Kingdom’s regulator Medical and Health Regulatory Authority . Germany has reported 10 events per million doses. There were no potential thromboembolic events reported following administration of Covaxin vaccine. Bleeding and clotting cases following COVID-19 vaccination in India are minuscule and in line with the expected number of diagnoses of these conditions in the country, a report submitted by the National AEFI to the Health Ministry noted. Analysis in India The Ministry said that after alerts were raised in some countries on post-vaccination “embolic and thrombotic events” on March 11, 2021, particularly with the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, a decision was taken to conduct an urgent, in-depth analysis of the adverse events (AE) in India in the light of the global concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-few-clotting-events-after-covishield-jab-aefi-panel/article34582890.ece

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawall and S.P. Tavade was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dhananjay Kulkarni challenging the Secondary School Certificate’s (SSC) decision to cancel the exams. The PIL sought for a direction from the court to hold the examinations and not mark students without an assessment. On April 20, State Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad said in a statement that, “With rising infections in the State and the country, and after national and international boards declared a cancellation of Class X exams, we have decided to cancel them. Students will be marked on the basis of their internal assessment.” Mr. Kulkarni’s advocate said each Board had a different marking system and students faced a lot of issues while applying for Class XI. The Centre should have a uniform policy, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-formula-yet-on-marking-class-x-students/article34583359.ece

Given the continuing surge and the steps taken to increase the number of beds, healthcare providers have called for immediate measures to recruit additional manpower at all levels — doctors, staff nurses, technicians and hospital workers. The State’s active case-load has increased 3.5 times over the last month. Several government hospitals that have been running to capacity are facing manpower shortage, with staff members already overworked. Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramaniam recently announced that 2,000 doctors, 6,000 staff nurses and 2,000 technicians would be recruited. Efforts to augment manpower should be made on a war footing, a section of government doctors said. K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, said in the last 15-20 days, the increase in case load was disproportionate to the manpower at hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-hospitals-battle-manpower-shortage/article34582967.ece

18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Armed forces on alert as Tauktae begins landfall||The armed forces mobilised men and assets in preparation for Cyclone Tauktae. Gujarat being a critical supplier of oxygen from ports to other States, efforts were on to ensure the routes were kept open and also opened at the earliest after the cyclone made landfall, an Army officer said on Monday after a coordination meeting chaired by the Gujarat Chief Minister through videoconference. Maj. Gen. V.K. Sharma, General Officer Commanding of the Army’s Division at Ahmedabad, also attended. “The priority is to ensure zero loss of life. The Army is also providing all possible assistance for making standby arrangements including oxygen, power supply and physical safety at all COVID hospitals,” the officer said. The Army has mobilised columns and Engineer Task Forces to the western coast from various parts of the country. It is continuously monitoring the situation for likely intensity, maximum impact areas and anticipated relief effort in coordination with the civil administration and other agencies, another officer said. “Since the maximum impact is likely to be in Saurashtra, including Union Territory of Diu, 10 integrated teams are poised to be employed for aid to civilian authority in Diu. Ten teams have been sent to Junagarh area,” the officer said. Navy on standby “The Navy has kept 11 diving teams on standby while 12 flood rescue teams and medical teams have been earmarked for immediate response and deployment,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was informed on Monday at a review meeting held through videoconference, the Defence Ministry said. Repair and rescue teams have also been formed to undertake urgent infrastructural repairs post cyclone. Three naval ships — Talwar, Tarkash and Tabar — are on standby with aid and relief material. The other ships on the Western seaboard are also on standby for assistance to fishing and small boats stranded due to rough weather while the maritime reconnaissance aircraft are continuously broadcasting cyclone warnings to fishermen, the statement said. The IAF has deployed aircraft to transport personnel and material of the National Disaster Response Force to Ahmedabad. On Sunday, it deployed two C-130J and one An-32 aircraft for transportation of 167 personnel and 16.5 tonnes of load of the NDRF from Kolkata to Ahmedabad. Another C-130J and two An-32 aircraft carried 121 NDRF personnel and 11.6 tonnes of load from Vijayawada to Ahmedabad while two C-130J aircraft transported 110 personnel and 15 tonnes of cargo for the NDRF from Pune to Ahmedabad. The Navy also launched multiple search and rescue operations in response to SOS calls from ships. In response to SOS by an Indian vessel adrift in the Arabian Sea, a naval helicopter was dispatched early on Monday for rescuing the stranded crew of Indian flagged tug ‘Coromondel Supporter IX’, which was adrift north west of Mangalore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/armed-forces-on-alert-as-tauktae-begins-landfall/article34582808.ece
18 May 2021||New Delhi,||Arrests illegal, say Cong. leaders||Legal experts in the Congress questioned the arrest of Trinamool Ministers by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday. Four people — Ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool MLA Madan Mitra and former Trinamool leader Sovan Chatterjee — were arrested earlier in the day in connection with the Narada sting case where the leaders were seen taking cash on camera. But all were later granted bail by a court. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, in a series of tweets, called the CBI action as “malafide”, and questioned the Governor’s power to sanction arrests instead of the Speaker. No official word The Congress, which targeted the Trinamool over the scam in earlier elections, however, officially did not issue any statement. “Clear indicators of malafides of Central #Govt &#Cbi re #WB arrests. Necessity of arrest must exist before arresting. Power of arrest never means obligation to arrest. #Narada is a decade old; even tapes are of 2016; matter also came to #SC; why necessity/urgency 2arrest NOW,” Mr. Singhvi said. “Grave doubt if #Governor, whose partisan conduct is clear, merely cos he swore in Minsters in 2011, has exclusive power 2grant sanction! Why sanction after 5yrs of 2016 tapes & sudden arrests in 2021. Bad #WB election losers? #Vendetta? Electoral verdict 2b reversed?” he asked. Mr. Singhvi, who is a Rajya Sabha member from Bengal and was supported by the Trinamool, alleged that the Ministers could not be proceeded against without the Speaker’s sanction and claimed that the arrest lacked jurisdiction. Former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar said the arrest for alleged corruption was “a brazen attempt to browbeat Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after her triumph in the recently held Assembly election”. “The imprint of partisan politics is writ large in the blatant abuse of prosecutorial processes by the CBI against political adversaries of the ruling BJP. Resorting to arbitrary criminal prosecution and custody of the accused by enforcement agencies, to deprive citizens of their fundamental liberties is clearly against the first principles of our libertarian Constitution,” Mr. Kumar said. He said the detention militated against the recent judgments of the Supreme Court. “The insistence by the CBI on detaining the accused who are public men of high standing and not expected to tamper with the course of justice is clearly an abuse of authority.”  The imprint of partisan politics is writ large in the blatant abuse of prosecutorial processes ...

18 May 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. police start patrolling the Ganga||Following Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s instructions to prevent people from disposing of bodies in rivers, the police in several districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh have started patrolling the Ganga and villages located on its banks. A number of bodies in a semi-decomposed state were found floating in the Ganga in Ghazipur and other districts recently, leading to suspicion that they could be of COVID-19 victims either abandoned or disposed of in the water due to financial constraints or waiting list at the cremation grounds. In Ballia, on the border with Bihar, where the bodies were first sighted, the police are patrolling the river on boats as well as carrying out regular patrols in villages, said Vipin Tada, Superintendent of Police, Ballia. Nine teams from five police stations along the Ganga have been deployed for the patrolling, he said. “We appeal to people that if they face any problems or are unable to cremate the body and require financial assistance, they can take help from police or administration,” the SP said. In Ghazipur, the district administration, while appealing to people to refrain from disposing bodies in the river, announced that it would provide financial assistance of Rs. 5,000 to those unable to bear expenses of cremation. River patrolling was done in Varanasi too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-police-start-patrolling-the-ganga/article34582846.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||‘CBI action is a declaration of war’||Former BJP leader and Union Finance Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet, Yashwant Sinha , who recently joined the Trinamool Congress, said the action of the Central Bureau of Investigation against the party’s leaders in the Narada case was unparalleled in Indian political history and was aimed at weakening the Chief Minister. Excerpts:  Do you believe that the CBI’s action against the Trinamool Congress Ministers and leaders is an act of vengeance against the party? It goes beyond that. It is a declaration of war against a State government by the Central government. They are using every agency they have, starting from the Governor to Central agencies like the CBI, to punish the Trinamool Congress for winning the election. This is absolutely brazen. While they are acting against the Trinamool leaders, they are not acting against those who migrated to the BJP from Trinamool and are also accused in the case. Only the Modi-Shah combine can act with such brazenness. The Trinamool government already has a fractious relationship with West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar. Do you expect the tensions to escalate in this third term? Mr. Dhankar has been specially selected for West Bengal because he will do exactly what the Prime Minister and the Home Minister tell him. He has absolutely no concern for democracy, constitutional values or limits of his authority. He is determined to annihilate the State government by interfering in their activities. He was completely wrong when he went out to so-called violence-affected areas. At a time when COVID-19 is raging, it doesn’t seem to be of any concern for the Centre. Politics is supreme for the Modi-Shah combine. Don’t you fear that the administration will fall on the wayside if this kind of hostility between the Centre and the State is to continue? That is exactly what the Centre is aiming at. They want Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to be totally preoccupied with all these events so that she won’t be able to devote her time to controlling the pandemic and the development of the State. My recommendation is that though it may take a lot of energy, she has to fight on both ends — against the Centre and also to control the pandemic. Are there any parallels to this kind of Centre-State relationship in the recent political history of India? No, never. Not even in the worst situation when Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency; things were not so brazen as they are today. You quit the BJP protesting against the policies of the party. Why don’t we see any voices of reason within the BJP speaking against the government, especially for the mismanagement of the pandemic? The BJP today consists of slaves. They are slaves of Modi and Shah. Even a person like Rajnath Singh or Nitin Gadkari, who have their own following within the BJP and their respective States, have been completely subdued and subjugated. They don’t have the courage to go against any of these people. Rest of them just don’t matter, they are just so many heads of cattle. There will be no implosion from within, unless the writing becomes clear on the wall and they realise that Modi-Shah do not have the capacity to bring them victory in the polls any more. Then there could be some movement within the BJP.  Only the Modi-Shah combine can act with such brazenness||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-action-is-a-declaration-of-war/article34582822.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Who are the four arrested in the Narada sting video case?||Four years after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered an FIR in the Narada cash scam naming at least nine top Trinamool Congress leaders, the agency arrested four of them on Monday at its Kolkata headquarters in Nizam Palace. Of those arrested, two are Ministers in the newly formed Mamata Banerjee Cabinet — Firhad Hakim, Transport Minister and Chairman, Board of Administrators, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), and former Mayor, and Subrata Mukherjee, Panchayat and Rural Development Minister. The Narada sting operation, carried out some time in 2014 by journalist Mathew Samuel and telecast in 2016 ahead of the Assembly election, showed top leaders of the Trinamool from Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari (both are now with the BJP and Mr. Adhikari is the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly) to Mr. Hakim, Saugata Roy, Sovan Chatterjee and Madan Mitra, accepting wads of money. Mr. Hakim, who also holds the Housing portfolio, has been leading the fight against COVID-19 in the State. Soon after he was sworn in, he announced a host of measures, from setting up new safe homes to oxygen parlours, as cases began to mount. In an interview to PTI , he said, “We are now fighting a big battle against the coronavirus. We have to bring the healthcare system of the State back on track. It was derailed by the frequent visits of the Union Ministers and outsiders during the election.” The 62-year-old, said to be close to the Chief Minister, won his Kolkata Port seat by a margin of over 60,000 votes. He was a councillor at the KMC from 2000 to 2015 before winning the contest for Mayor in 2018, the first Muslim Mayor since Independence. After Mr. Roy left the party in 2017, Ms. Banerjee has leaned on Mr. Hakim, popularly known as ‘Bobby’. At his home office in Chetla in south Kolkata, he meets people in the morning to listen to their issues. Ahead of the poll, Trinamool poll strategist Prashant Kishor had met all KMC councillors and Mr. Hakim to drive home the point that they must spread the word on the series of welfare schemes the ruling government had launched. An important leader of the minorities, Mr. Hakim campaigned hard in the run-up to the recent election to help consolidate their vote for the Trinamool. Among the other three picked up for questioning, Mr. Chatterjee, also Mayor of KMC for two terms and a close aide of Ms. Banerjee, joined the BJP in 2019, but quit the party after he was denied ticket from his favoured Behala constituency. Subrata Mukherjee, also a former Kolkata Mayor, is one of the senior-most leaders and another trusted aide of Ms. Banerjee, who returned to power for a third term in May after a landslide victory. The 74-year-old Mr. Mukherjee held on to the prestigious Ballygunje seat in the Assembly poll, which he had first won in 1971, still campaigning door-to-door. An old Congress hand, trade union leader and Minister in the Siddhartha Shankar Roy government, Mr. Mukherjee joined the Trinamool Congress in 1999. He is known for the work he did as Mayor from 2000 to 2005 when the Left Front government was in power. With friends across parties and considered to be close to Jyoti Basu, he got work done for the city without trouble. When Ms. Banerjee won for the first time in 2011, Mr. Mukherjee was made the Panchayati Raj Minister. Mr. Mitra, a former Transport Minister in the Trinamool government, was sent to jail over the Sarada chit fund scam, but after his release in 2016, he clawed back into reckoning. Though he lost the 2016 Assembly election from Kamarhati, he won it for the Trinamool this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/who-are-the-four-arrested-in-the-narada-sting-video-case/article34582833.ece
18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||States showing interest in Sputnik V||Many States have approached Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, marketing partner for Sputnik V in India, to procure the Russian vaccine, a member of the company’s management team said on Monday. Their interest assumes significance in the backdrop of the vaccination programme in the country slowing down due a shortage of vaccines and more people becoming eligible with the Centre earlier this month permitting vaccination of those above 18 years of age. “As of now, 8-9 States have approached,” Global Head of Integrated Product Development Organisation Sauri Gudlavalleti said at the launch of a pilot programme for the vaccine at Apollo Hospitals here on Monday. Last week, announcing the roll-out of the two-dose vaccine, Dr. Reddy’s said the MRP per dose was Rs. 995.40, which includes a 5% GST. The company had received the first consignment of 1.50 lakh doses from Russia on May 1 and 60,000 doses of the second dose component of the vaccine on Sunday. The cost is expected to come down with the commencement of domestic production. Six companies have entered into agreements to produce 850 million doses a year, and the made in India Sputnik is expected to be launched by July.  Sputnik Light To queries on plans to bring Sputnik Light, a single dose vaccine launched by Sputnik V developers, he said the data forming the basis for its approval in Russia was being studied. It was expected to be submitted to the regulator in India in the next few weeks. President – Hospitals Division of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, Dr. K. Hari Prasad, said the pilot phase would allow Dr. Reddy’s and Apollo to test the arrangements and cold chain logistics, since Sputnik had to be stored at minus 18 degrees C, and prepare for the launch. “We are doing a trial run from today to fix any logistics issues and to prove that they are safe, by vaccinating around 50,000 staff and families of Dr. Reddy’s, across the country. The cost will be Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,250, including vaccination and vaccine administering,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-showing-interest-in-sputnik-v/article34582844.ece
18 May 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Remdesivir production stepped up’||The Centre on Monday told the Madras High Court that seven Indian licencees of patented anti-viral drug Remdesivir were manufacturing only 27 lakh vials a month as on April 1 this year though their installed capacity was 38.8 lakh a month. Now, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in certain parts of the country, the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has permitted them to produce 1.19 crore vials a month. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) R. Sankaranarayanan said the patent for Remdesivir was held by Gilead of the United States and only seven Indian companies were manufacturing the drug here under licence agreements. The DGCI, V.G. Somani, jumped into action immediately when the demand for the drug increased recently. In order to enhance the production capacity of the seven licensed manufacturers, the DGCI approved 35 additional manufacturing sites, apart from the 22 already in existence. It resulted in enhanced manufacturing capacity of 70 lakh vials as on April 23 and 1.19 crore vials as on May 15. Consequently, the Centre increased the allocation of Remdesivir to 53 lakh vials to various States for the period between April 21 and May 16. The Union Ministry of Health is also procuring Remdesivir from other countries. On the other hand, India was completely dependent on imports with respect to critical care drug Tocilizumab, the ASG said, referring to a report submitted by the DGCI and added that only limited stocks were being imported. Nevertheless, he added that there were other drugs produced domestically. He said drugs such as Itulizumab, Dexamethasone and Methyl Prednisolone were either equivalent to or better than Tocilizumab.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/remdesivir-production-stepped-up/article34582848.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Why and how of creating a district||On May 14, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh declared Malerkotla the 23rd district of the State. This led to an angry response from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who took to Twitter to say that the Punjab government’s decision of declaring its only Muslim-majority town a district was “a reflection of the divisive policy of the Congress”. Section 5 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887 says the “State government may, by notification, vary the limits and alter the numbers of tehsils, districts and divisions into which the State is divided”. How are new districts carved? The power to create new districts or alter or abolish existing districts rests with the State governments. This can either be done through an executive order or by passing a law in the State Assembly. Many States prefer the executive route by simply issuing a notification in the official gazette. How does it help? States argue that smaller districts lead to better administration and governance. For example, in 2016, the Assam government issued a notification to upgrade the Majuli sub-division to Majuli district for “administrative expediency”.  Are there any exceptions? The State government has been vested with unfettered powers under Section 5 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887 to create new districts, says K.B.S. Siddhu, former financial commissioner (revenue) of Punjab. “This power is generally held temporarily in abeyance only during active census operations or during the delimitation exercise of Lok Sabha/Vidhan Sabha constituencies,“ Mr. Sidhu says. Does the Central government have a role to play here? The Centre has no role to play in the alteration of districts or creation of new ones. States are free to decide. The Home Ministry comes into the picture when a State wants to change the name of a district or a railway station. The State government’s request is sent to other departments and agencies such as the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Intelligence Bureau, Department of Posts, Geographical Survey of India Sciences and the Railway Ministry seeking clearance. A no-objection certificate may be issued after examining their replies. What has been the trend? According to the 2011 Census, there were 593 districts in the country. The Census results showed that between 2001-2011, as many as 46 districts were created by States. Though the 2021 Census is yet to happen, Know India, a website run by the Government of India, says currently there are 718 districts in the country. The surge in number is also due to bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh into A.P. and Telangana in 2014. Telangana at present has 33 districts and A.P. has 13 districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-and-how-of-creating-a-district/article34582815.ece

However, they fired indiscriminately, which was retaliated and resulted in an encounter. Both the trapped militants were killed,” Inspector- General of Police Vijay Kumar said. According to an Army spokesman, two pistols, one hand grenade and three under-barrel grenade launcher grenades were recovered from the site. The police identified the militants as Wasim Bashir Pandit and Mudasir Ahmad Khanday from Pulwama’s Kakapora and Bargam. “Both were part of groups involved in several terror crimes, including planning and executing of attacks on police and security forces,” the police said. They said the nearest family members of the deceased will be allowed to participate in the last rites. Mr. Kumar said only five militants were active in Srinagar. “There were six active militants in Srinagar. One was recently killed in a gunfight at Anantnag’s Kokernag area. Other five local militants will be killed or apprehended soon,” he said. Mr. Kumar said a vast network of militant supporters active in Srinagar district have already been arrested and booked under the Public Safety Act. “Many are still on the police radar.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-al-badr-militants-killed-in-srinagar/article34582816.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi urges more doctors to offer telemedicine services||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday interacted with doctors across the country dealing with the second wave of the pandemic, urging them to include oxygen audits, forming teams to provide telemedicine services to those undergoing home isolation and in rural areas and the new challenge of mucormycosis. The meeting, held over video conferencing, saw the Prime Minister also stressing on psychological care along with physical care. “This long battle against the virus must be challenging for the medical fraternity, but the faith of citizens stands with you in this fight,” he is reported to have told the doctors. He appealed to doctors to form teams for telemedicine, train final year MBBS students and interns to ensure that all tehsils have telemedicine services, and that home isolation should be guided by SOPs (standard operating procedures). He briefed doctors on the efforts being made to ramp up capacity of medical resources required, and said vaccination of health care workers had paid dividends in terms of safety. The doctors shared best practices and their experiences through both the waves of the pandemic, including proper and improper use of medicines.

According to the Indian Medical Association (IMA) registry, 244 deaths have been recorded in the second wave with the youngest physician who died being Dr. Anas Mijahid, 25, from Delhi. “While last year we lost nearly 730 doctors across India, this year in a short period of time we have lost 244 doctors. The second wave is proving extremely fatal for all and especially those at the forefront of the battle. We have to actively increase vaccination cover among the medical staff to ensure that they have protection against the virus,” said IMA president J.A. Jayalal. The following are the figures of fatalities according to the IMA registry: Andhra Pradesh (21), Telangana (19), Maharashtra (13), Tamil Nadu (10), Karnataka and Odisha (8 each), Madhya Pradesh (5), Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir (3 each), Assam, Gujarat, Haryana and Kerala (2 each) and Goa (1). The Health Ministry on Monday said the Central government has so far provided more than 20 crore vaccine doses (20,76,10,230) to States/UTs, free of cost. Of this, the total consumption, up to May 16 and including wastage, is 18,71,13,705 doses (as per data available at 8 a.m. on Monday).

18 May 2021||New Delhi,||ICMR drops plasma therapy from COVID treatment norms||The use of convalescent plasma has been dropped from the recommended treatment guidelines for COVID-19, according to a late Monday advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The National Task Force of the ICMR, along with experts from the Health Ministry, periodically updates guidelines on recommended modes of treatment. Registered doctors anywhere, however, are not bound by the task force recommend- ations. Though a trial by the ICMR on 400 patients last year — called the PLACID trial — had found no significant benefit from the use of plasma, it continued to find a place in the recommended guidelines. Some experts have said the use of such plasma may have even played a role in facilitating new worrisome mutations to the virus. The most recent study published in the British medical journal The Lancet on May 14 reported that in a double blinded trial involving about 5,000 patients who got the treatment in the U.K., again no benefit was found in reducing mortality, or on improving patient outcomes. The ICMR guidelines still recommend Ivermerctin and hydroxychloroquine for mild disease but has underlined “low certainty of evidence”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/icmr-drops-plasma-therapy-from-covid-treatment-norms/article34582811.ece

Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ had convened the meeting with State Education Secretaries to discuss implementation of NEP 2020, the COVID-19 situation, and online education. However, he had called for the participation of the education secretary alone, and not State Ministers of Education. In a letter to the Union Minister on Sunday, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi had said it would be appropriate only if the Education Minister participated along with officials in such a high-level meeting. He had said that he was ready to participate and share views on the NEP implementation. “Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had said that I should take part in it as the Minister and we subsequently wrote to the Centre. But there hasn’t been any response, and we chose not to participate,” Mr. Poyyamozhi told reporters at Tiruchi on Monday. “We are not looking to fight with them [Centre], but want to be able to participate and put forth our views on the NEP and other issues,” he added. “Many of our suggestions which we had put forth when the draft NEP was released were not taken into consideration. There are many aspects that need further discussion including the three-language policy, and the NEP also does not say much about how it is going to help underprivileged students or about reservations,” Mr. Poyyamozhi said. Stating that a centralised policy would be ineffective, the Minister said the specific needs of the State with regard to education were being ignored in the framing of such a policy. He said it was important to put forth Tamil Nadu’s concerns about the NEP to the Centre through this meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tamil-nadu-skips-officials-only-meeting-with-union-hrd-minister/article34583303.ece

Information provided by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation in response to an RTI application said a total of 4,473 bodies were cremated at Satya Nagar crematorium in 2020. In the first six months of 2020 (January to June), the average number of cremations per month was 83 at the Satya Nagar crematorium. In July 2020, 360 cremations were recorded and August registered the incineration of 712 bodies. September registered 1,288 cremations. October, November and December recorded 955, 442 and 221 respectively. The total bodies cremated at Satya Nagar in the second half was eight times of the bodies disposed of during first six months of 2020. “The second half [of 2020] saw a dramatic rise in deaths across the State. Ironically, the State’s [official] total COVID-19 death toll is almost half of the bodies cremated at one crematorium,” said Pradip Pradhan, who obtained the information through the RTI Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bodies-at-one-crematorium-outnumber-odishas-virus-toll/article34582823.ece

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||A few clotting events after Covishield jab: AEFI panel||Bleeding and clotting cases following COVID-19 vaccination in India are minuscule and in line with the expected number of diagnoses of these conditions in the country, a report submitted by the National AEFI to the Health Ministry noted. The Ministry said that after alerts were raised in some countries on post-vaccination “embolic and thrombotic events” on March 11, 2021 particularly with AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine [Covishield in India], a decision was taken to conduct an urgent, in-depth analysis of the adverse events (AE) in India in the light of the global concerns. The committee noted that as of April 3, 2021, 75,435,381 vaccine doses had been administered (Covishield: 68,650,819; Covaxin: 6,784,562). Of these, 65,944,106 were first doses and 9,491,275 second dose. Since the COVID-19 vaccination drive was initiated, more than 23,000 adverse events were reported through the CoWIN platform from 684 districts. Of these, only 700 cases (of the 9.3 cases /million doses administered) were reported to be serious and severe in nature. “The committee has completed an in-depth case review of 498 serious and severe events, of which 26 cases have been reported to be potential thromboembolic (formation of a clot in a blood vessel that might also break loose and carried by the blood stream to plug another vessel) events, following the administration of Covishield vaccine, with a reporting rate of 0.61 cases/ million doses,” said the release. It added that it is important to know that thromboembolic events keep occurring in the general population as background and scientific literature suggests that this risk is almost 70% less in persons of South and South East Asian descent in comparison to those from European descent. Meanwhile the Health Ministry has separately issued advisories to Healthcare Workers and Vaccine Beneficiaries to encourage people to be aware of suspected thromboembolic symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine (particularly Covishield) and report preferably to the health facility where vaccine was administered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-few-clotting-events-after-covishield-jab-aefi-panel/article34582805.ece

Suresh, Deputy Director-General of Coast Guard (Operations & Coastal security). “Our fishermen are the most vulnerable in cyclone and other adverse weather phenomena in view of smaller size of their boats and limited protection gears with them,” Mr. Suresh told The Hindu in a written interview. “The painstaking efforts put in by the Coast Guard has paid dividends by resulting in no loss of fishermen life at sea as the cyclonic storm Tauktae crossed Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep islands,” he stated. There were a few rescue operations which have been taken care of, Mr. Suresh said. We are also keeping a close eye on a few developing rescue situations off the coast of Maharashtra and have deployed ICG ships, he said.  Weather alert As part of preventive measures, the Coast Guard has undertaken massive deployment of assets which Mr. Suresh said has translated into 117 ship days and 116 aircraft hours so far ensuring safe return of more than 7,000 boats, alerting/safe routing of 464 merchant vessels and timely rescue of 38 personnel. “The Coast Guard Remote Operating Stations are incessantly relaying weather alert messages in vernacular languages on MMB radio for the seafarers and fishermen. Navtex warnings are being issued regularly and International Safety Net has been activated to alert the vessels in/transiting through area,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-fishing-boats-have-returned-coast-guard/article34582809.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gaza’s rockets are part of resistance, says collective||Rockets fired by Palestinians against Israel are part of a “resistance” which is supported by international law, a group of writers and artists led by Arundhati Roy and Nayantara Sahgal has said. In a statement, the collective accused the Israeli government of killing Palestinian children and blamed Israeli settlers for illegally trying to snatch Palestinian land. “Palestinians in Gaza fired rockets at Israel. The rockets did not start or define the brutality that followed. The rockets came as as part of a resistance — backed by international law — of an illegal occupation,” the statement said. It said Israeli retaliation with “extreme force” killed civilians, including children. The collective urged the Egyptian Air Force to provide a ‘no-fly zone’ above Gaza strip, and pointed to the lack of political will in the Arab world to protect the Palestinians. The group, consisting of some of the leading artists, authors and actors, drew attention to the U.N. General Assembly resolution 1514 of 1960 that supported the decolonisation process. “In early May, Israel attempted to illegally evict Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah (Jerusalem). This eviction is part of the ‘continuous nakba’, as the Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury puts it. These families had settled in this part of Jerusalem when they had been expelled by the Israelis from their homes, and now they were to be expelled again,” it said.  The collective, which includes actor Ratna Pathak Shah, Naseeruddin Shah, novelist Githa Hariharan and economist Prabhat Patnaik, said narration of the latest fighting in Gaza should not deprive Palestinians of their “dignity and right to resist”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gazas-rockets-are-part-of-resistance-says-collective/article34582813.ece

The union also alleged that despite assurances by the Chief Secretary on May 1, a day before the counting, that unwell teachers and staff would not be asked to be on duty, those who were absent due to illness faced suspension and salary cuts. Uttar Pradesh Prathmik Shikshak Sangh president Dinesh Chandra Sharma said many with heart diseases died of “tension”. The union released a list of the 1,621 people. As reported by The Hindu on May 2, COVID-19 safety protocols were not followed at counting centres, Mr. Sharma said. “What’s worrying is that even after so much of loss of life, administrative officials in districts are harassing primary teachers,” he said. The union demanded that a compensation of Rs. 1 crore each be provided to the kin of the staff and teachers who died during polling duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/1621-teachers-died-of-covid-in-up-says-union/article34582819.ece

The defence added that custodial interrogation was not required in the time of a pandemic. The Narada tapes, which were allegedly shot some time in 2014, were made public in 2016, months before the State went to the polls then. The purported videos showed about a dozen Trinamool leaders, MPs and Ministers accepting cash on camera from an operator of a fictitious company. In March 2017, the Calcutta High Court directed the CBI to probe the tapes. The agency filed an FIR against 13 persons in April 2017, including the four persons arrested on Monday. The TMC described the arrests as “political vendetta” and questioned why BJP leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were both named in the FIR, had not been arrested. Mathew Samuel, who carried out the sting on behalf of the portal Narada News, also asked why Mr. Adhikari, now a BJP MLA and leader of the Opposition, had not been quizzed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-trinamool-ministers-among-4-held-by-cbi/article34582820.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Quash FIRs on posters criticising vaccine policy’||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court to direct the Delhi Police Commissioner to stop the registration of first information reports (FIRs) against persons who have voiced their dissent against the Centre’s vaccination policy and COVID-19 management by pasting posters and brochures in public places. Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav said “free speech and expression” was guaranteed under the Constitution. ‘Not a criminal offence’ The Supreme Court in the Shreya Singhal judgment had held that sharing of information on social media was not a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act. The petitioner referred to the fact that the apex court, while hearing the suo motu case on COVID-19 management, had specifically told State authorities to not take penal action against those who seek medical help or vent their grievances about COVID-19 management on social media.  ‘Innocent persons’ “Contrary to this, authorities are registering FIRs against the innocent persons over their hate speech against the Hon’ble PM with regard to his official functions over the second wave of COVID-19 crisis and government vaccine policies,” the petition said. The petition mentioned the “arrest” of over 20 persons in Delhi in connection with posters against the Prime Minister regarding the vaccination policy. “At least 25 first information reports have been registered in connection with posters that surfaced across the capital questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the vaccination policy in a sarcastic tone. Police said that at least 25 persons had been arrested in connection with the cases,” Mr. Yadav said in the petition. The petition urged the apex court to quash the FIRs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quash-firs-on-posters-criticising-vaccine-policy/article34582825.ece

The court took strong exception to the police’s report that said the politicians were “actually helping people in getting medical aid”.  ‘Openly advertising’ “What is the point of this kind of vague and whitewashed report? Point is, if some political leader is openly advertising that he will provide the medicine free of cost, then you have to find out where he is getting these medicines from. Does he hold a licence to distribute the medicine?” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked. “Just because some political figures are involved, there is no reason not to investigate,” the Bench said. It directed the Delhi police to submit a fresh status report within a week explaining how the COVID-19 drug that was in such short supply in the market was procured by a “few persons”. The police’s counsel sought six weeks to submit the status report, but the court rejected the plea. “These people have no business buying and hoarding the medicines in the name of getting some goodwill, while others are getting these medicines at all kinds of prices,” the Bench said, posting the case for further hearing on May 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/interim-report-on-leaders-hoarding-medicine-vague/article34582828.ece

18 May 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||HC seeks clarity on last rites of COVID victims||The High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government to clarify on whether death certificate from hospital/medical officer is required for burial or cremation of COVID-19 victims on private land/farms owned by their relatives. A Special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction while hearing a batch of PIL petitions on issues related to the pandemic. This requirement of death certificate from hospital/medical officer has cropped up as the government, on April 21, permitted the burial/cremation of COVID-19 victims to avoid crowding at crematoriums and burial grounds and to ensure the swift disposal of dead bodies in a decentralised manner. This permission was granted following requests from a large number of family members of deceased persons, said the April 21 notification. However, it was contended on behalf of the petitioner, T.K. Sarvesh Kumar, that the “revised guidelines on dead body management in the context of COVID-19”, issued on August 6, 2020, had made the issuance of death certificate in the prescribed format mandatory only in case of inter-district or inter-State transportation of bodies. As the issuance of death certificates by hospitals/medical officers has not been made mandatory in case of burial/cremation on private lands/farms, there is a possibility of disposal of dead bodies of COVID-19 patients in private burial/cremation without a medical certificate on cause of death. Also, there could be serious violations of the elaborate safety protocol to be adhered to during burial/cremation as there is no State regulation or control of last rights performed onprivate lands/farms, the petitioner pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-clarity-on-last-rites-of-covid-victims/article34582850.ece

18 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fever survey workers face hurdles||Residents in a few neighbourhoods are reportedly not allowing fever survey workers from visiting homes, alleging danger of fresh infection. The Greater Chennai Corporation has warned that its officials would file police complaints against such residents who prevented workers from doing their duty. The Corporation has deployed about 12,000 fever survey workers in 15 zones of the city for surveillance of fever cases. On Monday, fever survey workers who visited households in ward 32 to check SpO2 and body temperature were prevented from entering the premises. According to representatives of sanitation inspectors, during one of the visits by fever survey workers to a patient’s residence on the ground floor, a person on the first floor of the building started quarelling with the workers. “Residents argued with the workers and told them not to visit their place. They alleged that the fever survey workers were the reason for COVID infections in the neighbourhood and asked them details about the officials who sent them,” said a worker. Police’s reluctance After the argument, Corporation officials sought help from the police. “But the police came to the location only after three hours. Even after coming three hours late, the police did not take any action against the residents who were arguing with the workers,” said a worker. After fever survey workers approached the Puzhal police station, the police reportedly sent them away advising them to file the complaint through the zonal officer concerned. “Now, the fever survey workers are afraid. They are concerned about their safety during their visit to residences of patients without the help of the police,” said a sanitation inspector. Deputy Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese said fever survey workers had been vaccinated and took precautions to prevent any infection. “There have been a few such incidents earlier. We resolved the issues. Residents have been asked to cooperate with the fever survey workers as they have been sent under the Disaster Management Act,” said Dr. Varghese.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fever-survey-workers-face-hurdles/article34582973.ece
18 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘We are exploring every avenue’||The DMK government is exploring every avenue to get oxygen as the sudden increase in COVID-19 cases has pushed up the requirement in hospitals. In an interview, Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu says the requirement is dynamic.   “A lot of patients come to government hospitals after reaching the critical phase, and this has resulted in a sudden spurt in oxygen demand. We have geared up for medical oxygen production in the State, even as we are importing it and bringing it from other States,” he said. Edited excerpts:  What is the requirement in Tamil Nadu? Is there any crisis? As such, there is no crisis, but oxygen requirement has obviously increased. Following the request from our Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre has increased the liquid oxygen allotment to Tamil Nadu from 220 metric tonnes a day to 519 metric tonnes a day. The government is making efforts on a war footing to meet the requirement. How many industrial units have the facilities to make oxygen? Not all units can make medical oxygen. The government is keen on producing wherever it is possible. One of the major sources is Sterlite in Thoothukudi, which has a capacity to make 35 metric tonnes a day. Unexpectedly, the production was stopped owing to a snag. It is being attended to, and we hope the production will commence very soon. There was a unit in the SIPCOT Industrial Estate in Tirunelveli district, which stopped production in 2013. We will revive it in the first fortnight of June. We are also studying the possibility of reviving the oxygen plant at BHEL, Tiruchi. JSW’s capacity has been increased from 10 metric tonnes a day to 16 metric tonnes a day. We are going to utilise CPCL’s oxygen-manufacturing capacity by putting up a 150-bed temporary hospital nearby. How are you managing the existing demand? We are tapping into all sources. Our endeavour is to bring our entire allotment from east India seamlessly. We are coordinating with the Indian Air Force, the Railways and steel plants... To bring the liquid oxygen, ISO cryogenic containers are required. Since they are in short supply, we have organised five containers from the Netherlands with the support of INOC company and we received four from the Government of India. On Sunday, we brought 80 metric tonnes from Rourkela to the southern districts. So far, we have brought over 350 metric tonnes from Odisha...  Our endeavour is to bring our entire allotment from east India seamlessly||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-are-exploring-every-avenue/article34582994.ece
18 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Indian-origin researcher makes splitters for ventilator||A team of researchers in the United States has come up with splitters for ventilators that will address the shortage of the life-saving equipment. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Bengaluru, recently approved the equipment. IndVentr is the Indian partner making the device. The team validated the device in India, and the first batch has been delivered to two hospitals in Kerala. By the month-end, 100 more units will be deployed at several hospitals. Called iSAVE (Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy), the equipment re-purposes the flow valves of a ventilator to provide customised support to two patients. Ventilator support to groups of patients in emergencies has been tried out with limited success, as there are concerns about contamination and the right parameters of the patients being ensured. Excess or too little flow of oxygen could harm the lungs. The team took up the challenge when COVID-19 surged through the U.S., and hospitals struggled with a huge inflow of patients. By the time the team validated its device, the flow of patients had fallen. Earlier this year, Shriya S. Srinivasan and her team were in discussion with Indian health officials. But the interest in their equipment was low. The team then began talking to smaller countries, such as Ecuador, Lebanon, Brazil and Italy. Dr. Srinivasan, a biomedical engineer, is the daughter of immigrant parents. She visits India frequently to give bharatanatyam performances. She did her Ph.D in medical engineering and medical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School. She took up Project Prana on the sidelines of her ongoing post-doctoral work. “The right amount of pressure and tidal volume make sure that the lungs receive the correct requirement of oxygen. With the digital respiratory monitor, it is easy to monitor both patients,” Dr. Srinivasan says. “The goal is to alleviate the human resource limitation, while making nursing and monitoring safe for both the nurse and the patients.” Easy to assemble The equipment can be assembled with an existing ventilator in less than 10 minutes even by an inexperienced staff member. “It has been rigorously tested, and the research and the findings have been published in the medial journal, Science Translational Medicine ,” she explains. The device has been validated on pig models. The researchers used a large and small animal each and compared the values for individual ventilation and combined ventilation, which showed no significant changes, she says. “The device is such that a small person and a large person can be ventilated at the same time, providing versatility to the equipment. Training manuals and videos to help have been prepared.” As the pandemic surged in India, IndVentr received funds to make the equipment. “Our mission is equitable access to care. Last year, Seattle, Boston and New York hospitals were running out of ventilators. We jumped in; as biomedical engineers, we had the tools and it was our duty. My team brought in anaesthesiologists, pulmonologists, respiratory therapists and engineers who could design holistically and with patient safety in mind,” she says. The team got help from Philips Healthcare and submitted iSAVE to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorisation. It ran the Michigan Test Lung System on the device. Prakash Bare, head of IndVentr Consortium, says that three weeks ago, when the consortium realised that the biggest surge was happening in India, it raised funds and started manufacturing. So far, it has made 100 units. “We basically have the certification process in multiple countries. So far, we have only access to south India, but there is a big requirement in the north. We are trying to find somebody to collaborate with,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/indian-origin-researcher-makes-splitters-for-ventilator/article34582985.ece
18 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||School Education Department revamped||In a major restructuring of the School Education Department in Tamil Nadu, the Director of School Education post has been done away with, while the Commissioner of School Education has been granted more powers. In a reshuffle of officials announced a few days ago, K. Nanthakumar, who was the Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, was transferred and posted as the School Education Commissioner. Mr. Nanthakumar took charge on Monday. A senior official told The Hindu that the last two officers (IAS cadre) posted as the Commissioner of School Education had less powers, while the Director of School Education, a non-cadre post (not occupied by an IAS officer) had more powers. “That way, two officers were doing almost the same thing but the Commissioner had lesser powers than the Director. Henceforth, the Commissioner of School Education, an IAS cadre post, would remain with all the powers and the Director of School Education post would cease to exist,” the official said. The move to do away with the post of School Education Director has raised concerns among teachers’ associations in the State. In a statement, the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers’ Federation appealed to the government to roll back this move. “A School Education Director is an official who has worked with the department for over 20 years and is someone who can guide the department. It is not a good idea to centralise the power and do away with the post of Director, who is integral in coordinating with the CEOs, DEOs, teachers and parents on a day-to-day basis,” said Patric Raymond, general secretary, TNGTF. The Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary Graduate Teachers’ Association has appealed to the Chief Minister to reconsider the decision. “The teacher community is strongly opposing the move,” their statement read. The Tamil Nadu Asiriyar Munnetra Peravai, too, said the government should consider the welfare of the Department and roll back the decision to scrap the School Education Director’s post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/school-education-department-revamped/article34582979.ece

18 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC bats for non-COVID-19 patients||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the State government to ensure that the oxygen needs of non-COVID-19 patients are also taken care of without any compromise. It also stressed that the bodies of COVID-19 patients should be removed immediately from the hospital wards since their presence might demoralise other patients, adding that those bodies should be disposed of in a dignified manner. Passing interim orders on a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court to monitor COVID-19 related activities, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said, “While the State takes care of the COVID-19 patients and the emergency it faces on that account, the needs and concerns of the others must also be kept in mind. “Patients other than those afflicted by COVID-19 should be able to receive oxygen in the usual course and the local authorities should take appropriate measures to ensure continuous supply for such purpose,” the judges said. They also took note of a complaint made to them regarding bodies being kept in hospital wards for hours together due to reported non-availability of space in mortuaries. ‘Follow protocol’ “Surely, the authorities need to remove the dead bodies as soon as possible but it is also to be appreciated that the number of deaths may be more than the mortuary facilities available at the hospital. However, the other aspect of the matter cannot be excused: if there has been a COVID-19 death, even though the overwhelming factors may have been the other co-morbidities suffered by the patient, the protocol has to be maintained so that the body is disposed of in accordance with such protocol and the body does not become a source for further infection,” the Bench said. Apart from a battery of lawyers, the court permitted a concerned citizen, Vaishnavi, also to make her submissions. She brought to the notice of the court that many elderly patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or other problems were being deprived of regular supply of oxygen, and it was difficult to find an alternative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-bats-for-non-covid-19-patients/article34582995.ece

Subramanian cautioned the people against steam inhalation, which is being promoted on social media as a therapy against COVID-19. Steam inhalers have also been installed at a few public places. “Without a doctor’s advice, people should not resort to steam inhalation, which could lead to a rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19,” he said in a statement. Mr. Subramanian said the government had put in place a treatment protocol in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization, and people should not resort to self-medication, which could prove fatal. Steam inhalation could affect the lungs and lead to the transmission of the infection to those close by, he said. The Minister said steam inhalation could not be considered a therapy. People should not resort to home remedies, but should consult a doctor immediately after testing positive for COVID-19. The contagion could affect the lungs. “Do not resort to steam inhalation by following social media posts,” he said.

Sponsored by Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana, Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy flagged off the vehicles with oxygen concentrators of five litres capacity each at the Corporation’s Central Office at Panneerselvam Park on Monday. Each concentrator could supply oxygen to four patients at a time, thus helping save lives while waiting at the hospital. Since the concentrators do not require refilling, it could be used continuously for two to three hours. Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu patients could utilise the service free of cost. More vehicles would be added in the coming days, he added. Currently, all the 550 beds at the hospital were occupied and patients were forced to wait for hours in the ambulances to get admitted. Since COVID-19 cases are on the rise, work began to add 500 more beds to the existing capacity. While 300 beds will be ready within 10 days, another 200 beds will be ready in 25 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-on-wheels-for-patients-at-perundurai-hospital/article34583035.ece

Senthil Balaji on Monday said that there were no chances for irregularities in computing and collecting power tariff and warned that the department would take stern action if there were any irregularities. Mr. Balaji said that with the COVID-19 lockdown in place, Tangedco staff were unable to visit houses and take the meter readings. “There are no chances for irregularities. For instance, if a user has used 400 units, it would be split into two. The first 100 units would be free and user has to pay only for remaining 100 units. In past years, the deduction was done in total bill but today, of total units used, it is split into two and user has to deduct 100 units in ‘first split’ and pay for remaining units. Similarly in ‘second split’, user has to deduct 100 units and pay for remaining”, Mr. Balaji said. He said leaders of PMK and MNM had issued statements on collecting deposit charges but requested them to issue statements on specific users. He said that a circular had been issued on May 10 not to collect deposit charges. The Chief Minister had extended time for paying the bills and said that based on usage, deductions would be made in future bills. No consumer would have to pay for units they had not used and the Chief Minister was clear about it.

Rural bodies say they were starved of funds to even pay salaries to their staff. Though the district administration had been claiming that it had been taking numerous measures in its fight against the virus, nothing was tangible.

Ministers Thangam Thennarasu, Anita R. Radhakrishnan and Geetha Jeevan, MP Kanimozhi, Collector K. Senthil Raj and Superintendent of Police S.

The remaining 15 tonnes of the life-saving gas was given to private oxygen suppliers, who are supplying it to private hospitals where COVID-19 patients have been admitted. Though the original destination of this ‘Oxygen Express’ was Thiruvallur district, Mr. Thennarasu, considering the adverse situation emerging in the southern districts after Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant let them down, discussed the issue with Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to ensure the diversion of the train to Thoothukudi. “While Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant will start generating oxygen within a couple of days, steps are being taken on a war footing to ensue oxygen generation in the plants which are not in operation now. We are extending all possible help to these inoperative plants to ensure early generation,” Mr. Thennarasu said. Sources in Sterlite Copper said their oxygen plant was expected to load the first tanker after the repairing work on Wednesday afternoon. “Moreover, overhauling of the second oxygen plant is also going on to ensure early production of the gas,” said the sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-express-from-rourkela-arrives-at-thoothukudi/article34583097.ece
18 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Renovated facility in Srirangam becomes operational||The renovated crematorium in Srirangam zone of Tiruchi Corporation is being utilised to cremate COVID-19 victims. The crematorium in Ambedkar Nagar, which lay idle for several years, was renovated under the civic body’s general fund and thrown open to public use since Saturday. The building itself was constructed in 2016 and lay in disuse. It was recently renovated keeping in mind the increasing number of bodies due to the pandemic. Speaking to The Hindu , an official of the civic body in charge of the crematorium said there were two burners, each of which could cremate about five bodies a day. The gasifier crematorium was being used to cremate bodies not infected by COVID-19, but with Oyyamari crematorium being pushed to its capacity, bodies were being diverted to the other two crematoriums in the city. The Srirangam crematorium, the newest of the lot, was also pressed into service. “We cremate around eight to ten bodies a day now. Most of them are COVID-19 patients,” an employee told The Hindu . Tiruchi Corporation faced stiff opposition from residents of Karumandapam over cremation of COVID-19 patients in the crematorium in their area and, therefore, not too many bodies were diverted there. At least 10 bodies were cremated in the four crematoriums in the city, many of which were COVID-19 cases. A senior official of the civic body said that at least 50% of them were people from other districts. “Families are not allowed to take the bodies to their hometowns if the patient died of COVID-19. Therefore, they cremate the body here itself.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/renovated-facility-in-srirangam-becomes-operational/article34583366.ece

A police press release said the law enforcers were serving with utmost dedication in enforcing the complete lockdown with a view to curbing the spread of COVID-19. Stern action as per law was being initiated against those found wandering in the city without any genuine reason. The city police urged the public to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines stipulated by the government during the pandemic period and appealed to them to extend their full cooperation to the government’s efforts to curb the spread of the viral infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/30000-booked-for-not-wearing-mask/article34583372.ece
18 May 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Collector initiates steps to take care of children of hospitalised COVID patients||Collector V. Vishnu has made arrangements for taking care of children whose both parents have been admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment. As the treatment and quarantine of COVID-19 positive patients require a minimum of two weeks, the children would suffer if their relatives too refuse to take care of them. Hence, Mr. Vishnu has made this arrangement in ‘Saranalayam’, a home being run by the Roman Catholic Diocese in Tirunelveli Junction to take care of the children. “This arrangement will ensure food and protected environment for the children in the temporary absence of their parents,” Mr. Vishnu says. On getting information about the admission of their COVID-19 positive parents in the hospital, the officials attached to the Department of Social Welfare would visit their home to take care of the children. After screening the children for the viral infection first, they would be taken to ‘Saranalayam’. They would be handed over to their parents only after they recover completely from the viral infection. Mr. Vishnu has also made arrangements for admitting the children orphaned by COVID-19 in this government-approved home. “If there is no one to take care of the children after the untimely demise of their parents, they will be admitted to the home. It will ensure their safety and unhindered education with the support of the government,” Mr. Vishnu said. When Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu chaired a review meeting here on Monday, he, along with Mr. Vishnu and other officials, inspected ‘Saranalayam’ to ascertain the facilities available there for taking care of the children. Those who come across the children of COVID-19 parents or the children orphaned by the viral infection, the officials may be alerted through Childline 1098, District Welfare Committee 94866 57783, 97903 11746, 99441 39546, 99433 74692, 93603 68631, 0462 – 2321098 or the District Child Protection Unit 99447 46791, 0462 – 2551953, 2901953.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-initiates-steps-to-take-care-of-children-of-hospitalised-covid-patients/article34583099.ece

According to officials, an average of 12.89 mm of rainfall was recorded over a 24-hour period in the Nilgiris since Monday morning, while there was significantly more rain on Friday and Saturday, especially in Gudalur, Pandalur and Kundah taluks. However, despite the rain, water level at the Parsons Valley Reservoir remains at around 20 feet, which is only around 30% of its total capacity. Municipal officials said the water stored at the reservoir would be sufficient to meet the consumption demands of the town for the next month. Water levels had also increased slightly at the Kundah Dam, Upper Bhavani and Emerald Dams, officials said. Meanwhile, Forest Minister K.

There are four gasifier crematoriums situated at Oyamari, Karumandapam, Konakarai and Ambedhkar Nagar in Srirangam, all owned by Tiruchi City Corporation. Of them, the Oyamari crematorium on the banks of the Cauvery receives the maximum number of bodies for cremation. According to sources, the number of bodies being brought for cremation has almost doubled over the last few weeks. On an average, until April, six or seven bodies were cremated at the crematorium. It has gone up to 12 to 15 a day. With the arrival of about two bodies every one hour, the crematorium faces immense pressure. Ambulances carrying the bodies are forced to wait to hand over the remains to relatives for the last rites. The corporation, which handed over the crematorium at Oyamari to a non-government organisation in December last for operation and maintenance, has fixed Rs. .1,500 for a body. But the distressed relatives of COVID-19 allege that they are forced to pay exorbitant charges, ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 in addition to the stipulated fee. It is alleged that the operators invariably collect the additional fee before loading the body into the furnace. In some cases, depending upon the situation, the workers collect more than Rs. 3,000 per body. “It is unfortunate that a few workers make use of the opportunity to collect money. It adds to the sufferings of relatives, who lost their near and dears to the deadly virus,” says K. Janardhanan, a retired forest official residing at Bheema Nagar. Denying the allegation, a representative of the NGO says no one is asked to pay more than the stipulated fee. The fee collection is transparent, and there are plans to create more facilities at the crematorium. When contacted Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that he would look into the complaints and ensure adherence to the stipulated fee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-crematorium-fleecing-families-of-covid-19-victims/article34583364.ece

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Government hospitals struggle with shortage of manpower||“There is a huge shortage of manpower. In places such as Chennai and Madurai, the doctor-patient ratio is 1:30, while the nurse-patient ratio is 1:25 or 1:30. At medical college hospitals, the majority of the patients are on oxygen support, with one nurse needed for 15 patients. There is one hospital worker for 40 patients,” he said. A senior doctor of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital said the hospital had seven doctors and as many nurses for 60-70 beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and one doctor and one nurse for 30 beds in wards. “This should be doubled. If the manpower is increased, it will reduce the physical and mental fatigue of the frontline workers. This will definitely improve the outcome of management...,” he said. At the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, there is one doctor for every 50 patients and two or three nurses for 50 patients a shift in the regular COVID-19 wards. In the ICU, there were three staff nurses and a doctor for 30 patients. “Ideally, there should be one staff nurse for 10 patients. They have plenty of work to do... There should be one doctor for 25 patients. One of the main issues is that if four or five patients fall sick at a time, it will be difficult to attend to all of them simultaneously. This is what is happening now,” one of the doctors said. Manpower shortage also meant that the staff members had frequent COVID-19 duties. A. Ramalingam, general secretary of the Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association, said the outcome of a patient in the ICU depended on nursing care. “A nurse has to take care of several needs of the patient and administer injections and IV fluids. Nurses play an important role in critical care. The government has to execute its plans fast and prioritise the requirements. Appointments should be made on a time-scale basis as there are no takers for contractual appointments,” he said. A doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital said several posts of doctors were reduced in the restructuring exercise under the Government Order 4 (D) 2. “Now, the beds are being increased and patients are flooding both the outpatient department and the admission ward. The GO should be revised,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-hospitals-struggle-with-shortage-of-manpower/article34582996.ece

It is difficult for a trader to come to the market, buy vegetables, return to his shop and sort out the vegetables for sale before 10 a.m. So, there is a steep drop in sales. This has resulted in fall in sales at the markets, too. Some traders open the shop very early in the morning so that retail traders from nearby towns can come and purchase the vegetables, says a wholesale trader at Anna Market. M. Rajendran, president of TK Market Vegetable Traders’ Association, said the TK Market opens by 6 a.m. or so and closes for customers by 10 a.m. “Last year, when there was lockdown, we sold vegetables in small trucks. This year, with restricted timing there are no customers. A lot of vegetables are going waste too. We thought of closing the market for a few days. But, since it is an essential commodity, we cannot do so. We hope the officials concerned will discuss the issue and come out with solutions,” he said. Galil Rahman, president of the City Fruit Merchants Association at Karuppa Gounder Street, said the association, with 54 members, plans to close the shops for a few days. “We are incurring heavy loss. We get fruits from different States. It is almost impossible to unload the fruits and sell them before 10 a.m. We sell to other States too. There is a lot of wastage. We are looking at discussing and arriving at a decision on whether to shut the shops for a few days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reduction-in-business-hours-affects-vegetable-fruit-traders/article34583026.ece

18 May 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Call on extending lockdown to be taken in two or three days||The State government will take a call on extending the lockdown beyond May 24 over the next two or three days even as the government on Monday allowed the district administrations to further tighten strictures depending on the ground situation. “We are currently discussing the lockdown. We are yet to take a call and will do so in the next two or three days,” Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa told reporters here after chairing a virtual conference with district administration officials. “The lockdown ends on May 24. There is still time.” Earlier in the day, Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar and Health Minister K. Sudhakar had indicated that the Chief Minister could take a decision after the meeting in the evening. But sources said the government was likely to take a call on lockdown extension only after the Chief Minister’s interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with the Deputy Commissioners of 17 COVID-affected districts, on Tuesday. With the lockdown on for nearly a fortnight now, resulting in a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, the State government is under pressure from within and outside the party over the continuation of restrictions. Some Ministers have expressed concern about continuing the lockdown without offering any succour to those whose livelihoods have been affected. The Opposition is also seeking a livelihood package for the affected. Sources said the government was likely to announce continuation of the lockdown for about a week, and it would subsequently be extended by another week, as it would take at least four or five weeks for the COVID-19 curve to flatten. MHA guidelines Mr. Yediyurappa on Monday told the district administrations that they could decide on further tightening the rules in consultation with the district in-charge Ministers. “The decision should be dependent on the gravity of the situation on the ground,” he said. The Chief Minister also directed the administrations to implement the guidelines released by the Ministry of Home Affairs in semi-urban and rural areas. “In light of the COVID-19 cases increasing in rural areas, I have directed the administrations to focus on villages,” he told reporters. The government has also allowed the local purchase of medicines to address any issues of shortage. The districts have been given freedom to establish need-based infrastructure, including COVID Care Centres, makeshift hospitals, and oxygen requirement estimation, among other things. “Home isolation has to be implemented strictly and COVID Care Centres set up in rural areas where home isolation becomes a problem,” Mr. Yediyurappa said, suggesting that hostel buildings and community halls could be used for the purpose. While he asked the district administrations to ensure medical kits for all those in isolation, he said that quick segregation had to be done through physical or phone triaging.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/call-on-extending-lockdown-to-be-taken-in-two-or-three-days/article34582959.ece
18 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Despite slight decline in cases, TPR still high||Although there has been a slight decline in the number of new cases in the last one week, the State’s average Test Positivity Rate (TPR) for the last seven days (May 10 to May 16) continues to remain as high as 31.16%. What is worrisome is that the TPR in at least 14 districts is higher than the State average during the seven days prior to May 15. At 41.26%, Ballari has the highest TPR followed by 35.69% in Uttara Kannada. Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Gadag, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Udupi, Dharwad, Kodagu, Bengaluru Urban, Bagalkot, Shivamogga, and Vijayapura have a TPR higher than the State average. TPR in the last seven days is the lowest in Chitradurga and Bidar at 9.28% and 9.67% respectively. Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), who is also the head of Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, said TPR will increase when the background prevalence is really high and the number of tests done are less. “TPR is estimated using the formula comprising the number of positive cases in the numerator and the total number of tests done in the denominator. Test positivity will increase when the denominator is small or the numerator is high,” he explained. ‘It is disadvantageous to reduce the number of tests when you have a high prevalence in the community as the TPR will not come down. This is what is happening in Karnataka,” he said. Dr. Babu asserted that the ideal thing to do during a surge in cases is to increase the number of tests to ensure that most infected people are detected and isolated. “This will help in containing the transmission and breaking the chain. However, by decreasing the number of tests we have reversed the gains that had been accrued in Karnataka where consistently a high number of tests were done throughout since the beginning of COVID-19 response,” the epidemiologist said. V. Ravi, member of TAC, who is also the nodal officer for genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said the TAC had never recommended less than 1.5 lakh tests a day. “At a stage during mid-April we also recommended that nearly 2 lakh tests should be done daily. But the tests have come down in the last fortnight, maybe due to logistical difficulties and an acute shortage of test kits. This is because there is a high demand from all States now during the surge,” he said. Asserting that people will have to come forward for testing, he said: “Otherwise they have to isolate themselves if they have come in contact with an infected person. Lockdown helps in minimising contact, but people should also have social responsibility.” Admitting that daily tests had reduced during the last fortnight, Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), said this was mainly because movement of people had come down during the lockdown. Moreover, ICMR had also recommended syndromic approach and asked States to focus on targeted testing of symptomatic individuals, he said. Following Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s directions to officials on Monday to carry out house-to-house surveillance, the number of tests conducted daily will again increase in the coming days, he said. “Earlier, a lot of asymptomatic people were being tested. Also, many who wanted to travel were also getting tested but we have stopped that now. We have now decided to increase the use of Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) by 30% and those who test negative on RAT will undergo RT-PCR tests,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/despite-slight-decline-in-cases-tpr-still-high/article34582945.ece
18 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||After experts’ advice, State to declare black fungus as a notifiable disease||Karnataka is all set to declare mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, as a notifiable disease. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who held a meeting with experts on black fungus on Monday, said a notification to this effect will be issued shortly. This decision has been taken following a recommendation by an expert panel headed by H.S. Satish, ENT HOD at Victoria Hospital. The panel comprises ophthalmologists K. Bhujang Shetty from Narayana Nethralaya, B.L. Sujatha Rathod from Minto Hospital, apart from a few other senior doctors. Although there are reports that 97 people in the State have contracted the disease, as a post-COVID-19 complication, and four have succumbed to it, there is no accurate data from across the State. ‘Registry important’ Dr. Shetty said it was important that the State has a registry of people infected with black fungus. “This is essential to chalk out treatment protocols and strategies on prevention,” he said. “We have recommended that this should be declared as a notifiable disease just like TB so that every case is reported to the State both from private and government doctors. As this involves, ENT, ophthalmologists, neurologists, and general medicine doctors. among other specialists, there is no single point of contact for patients and making it a notifiable disease will help,” he said. Addressing presspersons, Dr. Sudhakar said till Sunday (May 16), 97 people have contracted mucormycosis in the State and four have died. “The government has information on infected persons and treatment will be provided to them accordingly. As the fungus enters through the nasal cavity in immunocompromised patients (those with diabetes, cancer, HIV, and who have undergone organ transplants) and early symptoms can be seen in the nose, COVID-19 patients will undergo an ENT check up before discharge from hospitals from now on,” the Minister said.  Treatment started Appealing to people not to panic as it does not spread like COVID-19, the Minister said free treatment for the infection was started at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bengaluru from Monday. “We are also notifying regional centres for black fungus treatment at the Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, the Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences, the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences in Kalaburagi, the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences at Hubballi, Kasturba Medical College, and Wenlock District Hospital in Mangaluru. These centres will become functional from Thursday,” he said. The infection can mainly occur in some oxygen-dependent patients if hygiene and proper protocols are not followed while using the nasal mask and oxygen concentrators. It is important that doctors and paramedical staff should follow proper protocols, he said. Calling upon people not to panic over reports of shortage of medicine for this disease, the Minister said: “We have placed orders for 20,000 doses of Amphotericin B, the anti-fungal injection used in the treatment of black fungus. The Centre has approved 1,050 vials out of which 450 vials have been supplied to our State. A single patient needs 40-60 vials of this medicine.” Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has urged the government to include black fungus disease in the official list of diseases and offer free treatment to those who report. “Each injection is being sold between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 7,000 in the black market. The patient needs three such injections daily and for a month,” he pointed out. “The government needs to study the black fungus disease and review the treatment protocol for COVID-19. Multiple reasons are being attributed by the medical fraternity for the spread of black fungus,” he added. Medical facilities The State will set up medical facilities to treat black fungus disease in the State. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday told reporters that the facility has already been set up at Bowring Hospital in Bengaluru. These facilities will come up in Mysuru, Hubballi, Shivamogga, Kalaburagi, and Mangaluru over the next few days, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/after-experts-advice-state-to-declare-black-fungus-as-a-notifiable-disease/article34582942.ece

The Union Minister said that it will take time for the surge in the COVID-19 cases to come down and to check further spread, lockdown will be implemented strictly. Regarding black fungus cases, he said that he spoke to experts on the issue and also the Union government’s Health Secretary over telephone regarding supply of adequate quantity of medicine required for the treatment of this condition. “I have also spoken to the State Health Minister and the Secretary concerned regarding purchase of requisite medicine,” he said. Mr. Joshi said that although the number of positive cases in the country was high, the mortality percentage was less. But even if one person died of the pandemic, it will be a matter of grief, he said. He said that the district has oxygen stock that will suffice the requirement for the next eight to 10 days. So, more oxygen beds will be added now. The 50 tonnes of oxygen that arrived from Kuwait will be distributed among various districts of North Karnataka, he said.

18 May 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Savadi directs officials to mandatorily admit patients in COVID Care Centres||In a slight deviation from the fresh guidelines that the government has issued asking asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to be in home isolation, Deputy Chief Minister and Raichur in-charge Laxman Savadi told officials to mandatorily admit all COVID-19 patients to State-run COVID Care Centres (CCCs). “To break the COVID-19 chain, you should mandatorily admit all COVID-19 patients to COVID Care Centres established by the government. You can convert private lodges, apart from government buildings such as hostels, into COVID Care Centres for this purpose. I have given clear directions during my last visit to the district and you need to strictly follow them,” Mr. Savadi told Lingsugur Tahsildar Chamaraj Patil during his visit to the taluk on Monday. As per information Mr. Savadi shared in a COVID-19 meeting held at the Taluk Panchayat Conference Hall, only 27 COVID-19 patients have been admitted to COVID Care Centres. “Only a meagre number of patients are admitted to COVID Care Centres and it is not good. You should shift all patients who are in home isolation to COVID Care Centres. Those who are stable can be put in hotels and lodges and other cases that are relatively serious could be admitted to hospitals. The Transport Department has initiated a drive to roll out oxygen-laden buses to provide the lifesaving gas. We have provided 30 oxygen cylinders for the purpose and you should keep them in buses that are always on the move helping patients in need. Oxygen-generating facilities should be put in place in buses which will be parked outside COVID Care Centres,” he told the officials. Taking note of the closure of factories that produce oxygen during lockdown, Mr. Savadi directed the officials to identify every industrial unit where oxygen was produced and take them into their control to generate oxygen and supply it to patients in need. “The State-owned Hutti Gold Mines has initiated a process for establishing a 100-bed hospital on its premises in Hutti. It is a commendable job. The company should procure 50 oxygen generating machines that could each produce 10 kiloliters of liquid medical oxygen,” he said. Mr. Savadi also visited Lingsugur Taluk Hospital and took stock of the facilities in place for handling the COVID-19 crisis. Lok Sabha member from Raichur Raja Amareshwar Naik, Hutti Gold Mines Chairman Manappa Vajjal, Lingsugur MLA D.S. Hulageri, Raichur Deputy Commissioner R.

18 May 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||People pour out their woes||Hit hard by the pandemic situation and the inadequate response from government agencies during a health crisis, people of Shahabad in Kalaburagi district poured out their problems to Mines and Geology Minister and district in-charge Murugesh Nirani when he visited the Shahabad Community Health Centre on Monday. “COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in the district and people in the area are hit hard. Government health servants are not responsive to the people’s woes. Most of the health staff are not available at the Community Health Centre when people are in dire need,” a few people told Mr. Nirani. Responding to the unexpected resentment from the people, Taluk Health Officer of Shahabad Deepak Patil pleaded helplessness due to the sudden rush of patients owing to the fast-spreading pandemic against limited resources to handle the demand. “Shahabad was just upgraded as a taluk recently and all the required infrastructure, including human resources, are yet to be provided to facilitate full-fledged functioning of the taluk. After the outbreak of the pandemic, a large number of patients are turning up at Community Health Centre seeking treatment and we are unable to handle the situation owing to the limited resources. The Community Health Centre needs to be upgraded to a taluk hospital so that it gets more resources and enables us to cater to the increasing demand,” Dr. Patil said. Adding to Dr. Patil, Shahabad Community Health Centre Administrative Officer (Provisional) Mohammed Abdul Raheem said that the posts of a general medical officer, non-communicable diseases doctor and anaesthetist are lying vacant. “The centre saw a footfall of around 350 outpatients every day. The number has dropped to 150 now. Since the pandemic is spreading fast in the rural areas, we need to open a COVID Care Centre here,” he said. In his response, Mr. Nirani announced that a COVID Care Centre will shortly be opened at the Shahabad Community Health Centre and five oxygen cylinders will be provided for the purpose. He also directed District Health and Family Welfare Officer Sharanabasappa Ganajalkhed to deploy a gynaecologist who will work for three days a week in the Community Health Centre. “We have also taken an initiative to convert the Shahabad ESIC Hospital into a COVID Care Centre and work is on. Once it is functional, we will put in all efforts to upgrade it into a full-fledged hospital,” Mr. Nirani said. Lok Sabha Member from Kalaburagi Umesh Jadhav, legislators Basavaraj Mattimadu, B.G.

18 May 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||All nine on board tug Coromondel saved||In a coordinated effort involving the State and Union governments, all nine crew members on board tug Coromondel Supporter IX, which ran aground mid-sea on “Mulki Rocks” off the Kaup coast on Sunday, were rescued on Monday morning. With the Arabian Sea calming down a little following the exit of Cyclone Tauktae from the region, the Karnataka Coast Guard deployed speed boats from its ship ICGS Varaha and rescued five crew members. Meanwhile, four were airlifted by the Indian Navy’s advanced light helicopter IN 702 that joined the rescue operations from the Southern Naval Command, Kochi. The crew members, who appeared to be normal, were rushed to New Mangalore Port Trust’s hospital for examination and observation. While the Coast Guard had been struggling to rescue the crew since Sunday morning amid the raging sea and keeping a watch on Coromondel from a distance through ICGS Varaha, the Dakshina Kannada administration got in touch with the government seeking the Centre’s assistance. Though the Navy was ready to execute the rescue operation by Sunday evening, inclement weather did not permit it.

18 May 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A telemedicine initiative by farmers||The surge in COVID-19 cases in rural areas and the lack of adequate beds in hospitals have led to some out-of-the box thinking from a group of farmers to make consultation available by phone. This is resulting in early identification of symptoms and commencement of treatment to help avoid hospitalisation and deterioration of health to the point where oxygen saturation level dips and ventilator or oxygenated beds, which are increasingly difficult to come by, are needed. An initiative of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, called ‘Gramina Janara Corona Seva Pade’, was launched recently with a helpline (97400 69310) dedicated to creating awareness on early diagnosis and treatment. The group includes specialist doctors as well and its objective is to infuse confidence among people who contract COVID-19 and allay fears which are resulting in people hiding early symptoms and refusing to get tested fearing isolation or quarantine, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of Karnataka Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association. As this group has been floated by farmers, rural folk feel more confident in speaking out and are not hesitant to seek advice, as a result of which there are days when between 40 to 60 callers are received and counselled on phone, explained Chinnaswamy Vaddagere, who writes on agricultural issues in the local media and is member of the group. “There was this farmer from H.D. Kote who lived in a remote hamlet bordering the forests and called the helpline as there were no doctors or private health facility in his vicinity. The doctor who attended to the caller learnt of the symptoms and prescribed the medicines, besides advising him to take rest. He recovered totally and called back to express his gratitude,” said Mr. Shanthakumar. Another farmer, from Jayapura, cited his symptoms and the doctors called him for testing before commencing treatment. “In a crisis period, timely advice and information is crucial and this is what the WhatsApp group is doing,” said Mr. Shanthakumar. Apart from telemedicine, the group also gives thrust to dispelling vaccine hesitancy among the rural populace. Though it was initially meant to counsel farmers in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar, the number has been forwarded to other networks of farmers and the general rural populace, as a result of which there have been calls for assistance, information, and counselling from many other districts as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-telemedicine-initiative-by-farmers/article34582954.ece
18 May 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||CFTRI ready for tests using dry swab method||The CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysuru is ready to carry out COVID-19 tests through the new dry swab RT-PCR method that promises quicker results, paving the way for more testing when the rate of infection is high. The method, developed by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, which is also a constituent of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), had been approved by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). CFTRI director Sridevi Singh told The Hindu that it was two or three times faster than the conventional RT-PCR method. “It is an easier way of testing. It is economical also.” CFTRI presently is carrying out COVID-19 tests on the swabs collected through the RT-PCR method. The institute has conducted more than 2.25 lakh tests since the pandemic set in. The number of tests, which had reached 2,000 per day during the second wave, had been reduced to around 800 daily in the past one week. “The conventional method, which takes around three hours, involves RNA extraction. But this step is eliminated in the dry swab method,” she said, adding that testing centres now used automated RNA extraction equipment and any breakdown in machinery delayed the testing process further. Dr. Singh also said the dry swab method incurs less cost. “We need extensive consumables for RNA extraction. We don’t need them in the new method,” she said. CSIR director-general Shekar C. Mande has already written to the Chief Secretaries of all the States on the dry swab RT-PCR tests. CFTRI has already carried out a validation exercise of the dry swab tests. “We tested around 70 samples and the results had a good correlation with the traditional method,” Dr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cftri-ready-for-tests-using-dry-swab-method/article34582957.ece

The reporters associated with ‘Madhyama Spandana’, which was formed for extending help during the COVID-19 crisis last year, responded to an SOS call from a village near Parane, a few kilometres from Murnad, as the locals were reluctant to help the victim’s family perform the last rites over fears of contracting the infection. Four reporters and another person rushed to the village, about 40 km from Siddapura, and wore the PPE kits provided by the local panchayat to assist the family, whose house is located in hilly terrain, in the midst of rain. Rejith Kumar Guyya, who works for a Kannada daily in Siddapura, said, “As reporters, we were aware of the situation and did not hesitate to offer help to the family as journalists related to Madhaya Spandana have been helping COVID-19 patients and their families since last year as a service whenever they could get time. The reporters have supplied food kits, medicines and other essentials to the needy, sometimes spending from their own pockets. The group has helped poor people get beds in hospitals as well.” The reporters – Rejith, Pappu Thimmaiah, Praveen and Anish, and another person Shareen – armed with personal protection equipment, went to the victim’s house taking all necessary precautions and carried the body for the last rites. “We helped the victim’s son carry out the rituals as per the family traditions. If proper precautions are taken, there is no need to fear the infection. This is the first time we, as members of the Madhyama Spandana, took part in the last rites of a COVID-19 victim,” Rejith said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/scribes-help-family-perform-last-rites-of-covid-19-victim/article34582952.ece

Torrential rains, coastal erosion, and strong winds that lashed the district over the past few days destroyed 29 and damaged 653 houses in six taluks. The initial loss is estimated at Rs. 4.48 crore. Cultivation in around 1,450 hectares was destroyed. Incessant rains and sea erosion damaged 116 km of road in the district. The fisheries sector suffered damage to the tune of Rs. 4.27 lakh. The rain and wind caused extensive damage to the electricity transmission network in the district. Officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) said at least 1,477 transformers were damaged. Several electric poles got uprooted and power lines were snapped after trees fell on them. Power supply was restored in most of the places after employees toiled day and night in the past couple of days.

18 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Price cap sans quality parameters||The fixing of maximum retail price of face masks, fingertip pulse oximeter and other medical items by bringing them under the ambit of the Kerala Essential Articles Control Act has created chaos in the market. It is widely believed that the move could lead to a shortage of these products. While issuing the order on price, the Food and Civil Supplies Department had not mentioned the quality specification of the products, which has led to confusion, complain traders. Maximum retail price The order had fixed the maximum retail price of a Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kit at Rs. 273, an N95 mask at Rs. 22, a triple layer mask (Rs. 3.90), a face shield (Rs. 21), a 500 ml bottle of hand sanitiser (Rs. 192) fingertip pulse oximeter (Rs. 1,500) and oxygen mask at Rs. 54. Legal action, including imprisonment up to a year and fine, awaits those convicted for violating the Act. The government order, said Shibu Vijayan, public health expert, was silent on the quality specifications of these products or the outlets where they would be available. Clarity There needed to be clarity on both these fronts, failing which low quality materials would flood the market. It would adversely impact COVID care and management, cautioned Dr. Vijayan. Production cost R. Devadas, State president of the All Kerala Scientific and Surgical Dealers Association, said many medical shops had reportedly stopped selling these products as the price fixed did not match even the production cost. One has to sell the products at a price lower than the procurement price, which is untenable, he said. The dealers have approached the government with a plea for price revision. In a representation to the Chief Minister, they proposed prices of around 20 items, many of which were double the price fixed by the government. They suggested Rs. 500 for a piece of the Personal Protection Equipment against the Rs. 273 decided by the government. Some of their other suggestions along with the government prices are: N95 mask (FFP2) Rs. 50 (Rs. 22); face shield Rs. 50 (Rs. 21); triple layer mask and triple layer mask with melt-blown/nose clip Rs. 5 (Rs. 3.90). The association concurred with the government on the price of items like fingertip pulse oximeter and hand sanitiser. Govt. version P. Venugopal, secretary, Civil Supplies Department, felt that the confusion over pricing was created to sabotage the price regulation drive. The notification is intended to prevent hoarding of products and end fleecing of consumers, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/price-cap-sans-quality-parameters/article34583119.ece

18 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Heavy rain, winds cause widespread damage to crops in Ernakulam||Standing crops, including banana, tapioca, paddy, and cowpea are among the worst hit by the heavy rain and winds that battered the district last week and early Sunday. According to a tentative estimate, the farming sector has lost about Rs. 40 crore. Agriculture department sources said that around 3,100 farmers had lost crops in about 233 hectares. Flooding hit mostly tapioca cultivation while heavy winds uprooted banana plants and long-term crops like rubber, nutmeg and coconut. Bad weather conditions apart, pineapple farmers have said they are through a bitter harvest with the lockdown. They are sitting on a harvest of 5,000 tonnes of ripe fruits, unable to sell the fruits because of the fresh restrictions imposed to contain COVID-19 as Ernakulam district went into triple lockdown, sources in the Pineapple Growers’' Association Keralam said. A farmer at Bethanippadi, Kolathuruth in Valakom panchayat near Muvattupuzha said he was unable to sell more than a tonne of golden melon after he harvested the crop as the fields started being flooded in heavy rain. P.A. Kunjunju also said that there would be another tonne of the crop ready to be harvested. “But there is no hope of selling the golden melon because of the lockdown”, he said. He said he had been distributing the harvest free to community kitchens and people, who wanted them. A senior farm officer said that low lying areas in places like Maaraadi had seen vast swathes of tapioca crop go under water. About 10 hectares of tapioca crop near Valakom has been flooded too. “We hope the water recedes today. If that happens at least a portion of the crop may be saved”, said the officer. More than 400 tapioca suffered loss of crop in 44 hectares, the initial estimates said. Vegetables in about 40 hectares too have been lost to the bad weather. Another hectare of other tuber crops too have been hit while around 45 hectares of paddy crop too has been damaged in the rain between May 11 and May 15.

Official sources said the accused, identified as Vijeesh Varghese (36) of Avaneeswaram in Pathanapuram, was nabbed from a hideout in Bengaluru. The police team, which nabbed the accused, brought him to Pathanamthitta by Monday noon. In February He had gone into hiding along with his family members ever since the fraud came to light in February. The accused, an ex-navy official who worked as a clerk in Branch 2 of Canara Bank in Pathanamthitta, allegedly used the system passwords to close the fixed deposit accounts of a few customers and transfer the amount to the accounts of his wife and some relatives. The case followed a complaint lodged by the bank management on February 14. By the time the fraud came to light, the accused had already escaped with his wife and two children. The police later traced his car to an apartment complex in Kochi. Preliminary investigations revealed that the accused, with his pleasant demeanour and efficient performance, easily gained the trust of his colleagues and customers. “No one had any doubts about him till he closed the FD account of a customer who happened to be the wife of an employee of another branch on February 11. As soon as the fraud came to his notice, the employee alerted senior officials and a follow-up examination brought the fraud to light,” said an official. Based on the finding, five employees of the bank, including the branch manager, were immediately placed under suspension. The investigation, however, is yet to confirm the involvement of any other person in the fraud. Over 14 months The police had taken steps to freeze the bank accounts of the accused and his relatives. A detailed investigation later revealed that the accused swindled Rs. 8.13 crore in 191 transactions over a period of 14 months. The probe is now slated to be handed over to the Crime Branch unit.  He allegedly closed FDs, transferred money to relatives’ accounts||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/key-accused-in-rs-8-cr-bank-fraud-nabbed/article34583074.ece

Twenty access points to the State capital were sealed to streamline entry and exit through six other points viz. Vetturoad, Maruthoor, Vazhayila, Kundamankadavu, Pallichal, and Chappathu. The arrangement led to serpentine queues of motorists at these locations during the initial hours of the day with the police screening all vehicles. Access was permitted only for those involved in essential or other services exempted from the lockdown, and others requiring emergency medical attention. District Collector Navjot Khosa said e-curfew passes would be issued for home nurses, caregivers and others with justifiable purposes. Since around 90 of the 100 wards in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation have become containment zones, perimeter control has been put in place to regulate public movement. ‘Misusing permission’ City Police Commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyay said there had been attempts to misuse permission granted. There has been a tendency to travel unnecessarily, claiming medical reasons. Such activities will be dealt with stringently, he said. Police sources said the rush on the roads could be partly attributed to the functioning of shops selling essential commodities. The district administration has permitted such outlets to function on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Ambulances in trouble The move to barricade byroads drew flak with many ambulance drivers complaining of having to wait in queues while transporting patients to hospitals. This prompted the police to designate emergency routes to the Government Medical College Hospital, General Hospital and other major hospitals in the city. The coastal and rural parts of the district witnessed heightened alert. Vehicles from Tamil Nadu were permitted entry at the Inchivila inter-State border only after furnishing passes obtained from the COVID-19 Jagratha portal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/access-to-capital-city-only-via-six-points/article34583081.ece

During the period from May 14 to 17 (till 8.30 a.m.), when Tauktae took shape and intensified, Kerala recorded 268 mm of rainfall, a stunning 861% departure from the normal, officials of the IMD Meteorological Centre here said. While 27.9 mm is deemed normal for the May 14-17 period, the State registered an increase due to the heavy rainfall unleashed by the turbulent weather conditions over the sea. All 14 districts recorded a percentage departure of 600% or above during this period. Pathanamthitta topped the list with a percentage departure of 1,087% from the normal. Kasaragod, at the bottom of the list, recorded 600% more than the normal, K. Santhosh, director, Meteorological Centre, said. Rainfall wise, summer 2021 has been generous to Kerala. Between March 1 and May 17 this year, Kerala received 138% more than its normal rainfall. While 235.1 mm is normal, the State averaged 559.5 mm. This amounts to a large excess in IMD parlance, which denotes a percentage departure above 60%. All 14 districts have, in fact, recorded a large excess so far, with Kannur topping the list with 235%.

The test positivity rate (TPR), which has been showing a decline for the past three days, went down to 24.74% on Monday.

18 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cyclone-induced rain claims seven lives so far in State||The rain havoc in the State has claimed seven lives since May 12, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode reported two deaths each while Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Idukki reported one death each. The heavy wind and rain which lashed the State under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae destroyed crops in 14,444.9 hectares and 310.3 km of roads under the Local-Self Government Department.

Sixty-eight houses were destroyed and 1464 houses damaged across the State. Thirty-four anganwadis, ten schools and 11 primary health centres also were damaged in the natural calamity, the Chief Minister said. While the cyclone has moved away from the Kerala coast, the threat of sea erosion persists, Mr. Vijayan said, indicating that a high-wave alert had been issued for coastal districts. The turbulent weather had forced the State to relocate more than 1,400 families to relief camps. As of 3 p.m. Monday, 5,235 people from 1,479 families have been shifted to 175 relief camps, according to the Chief Minister. High-wave warning A high-wave warning has been sounded for the Kerala coast till Tuesday night in view of the rough weather in the Arabian Sea. The Kerala coast from Pozhiyoor to Kasaragod is likely to be lashed by high waves till 11.30 p.m. on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noted. Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Ponnani (Malappuram), Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod are likely to experience intermittent surges, according to a joint bulletin issued by the IMD and the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS). With Cyclone Tauktae moving further north, the intensity of rainfall in the State has decreased further. However, northern Kerala districts are likely to get isolated heavy rainfall till Tuesday. Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod are on yellow alert.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Talks over, LDF govt. 2.0 takes definitive shape||The CPI(M) is likely to follow a similar template for selecting Ministers to ensure more party persons gained administrative experience and rose to leadership positions. However, it might retain veterans like Health Minister K. K. Shylaja. The Communist Party of India (CPI) will keep four Cabinet posts and the Deputy Speaker’s office. Its State council is meeting here on May 18 to finalise the party’s nominees. The Kerala Congress (M), Janata Dal (Secular), and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) may get one Cabinet post each. The KC(M) is likely to nominate Roshy Augustine to the Cabinet and N. Jayaraj as the LDF Chief Whip.The CPI(M) had urged the Indian National League (INL), Congress (S), Kerala Congress (B) and Democratic Kerala Congress (DKC) to hold a Cabinet rank for two-and-a-half years and concede the remaining term to another single-member ally.The calculus triggered speculation that Democratic Kerala Congress MLA Antony Raju, who hails from the Latin Catholic community, a critical demographic in Kerala, and Indian National League legislator Ahammad Devarkovil would serve the first term and step down in favour of KC(B) legislator K. B. Ganesh Kumar and Congress (S) leader Kadannappally Ramachandran. The Loktantric Janatan Dal with a single member might have to settle for a board or corporation. Swearing-in ceremony Governor Arif Mohammed Khan will administer the oath of office and secrecy to the Ministers at a low-key ceremony at the Central Stadium here on May 20. Mr. Vijayan said not more than 500 people would attend the ceremony at 3.45 p.m. Attendees should wear double masks and be seated by 2.45 p.m. He dispelled criticism that the number of attendees was high, given the triple lockdown regulations in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/talks-over-ldf-govt-20-takes-definitive-shape/article34583128.ece

18 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Testing inadequate in Chittoor despite high positivity rate||The district, which has been reporting 2,000-plus cases for the last ten days, saw a slight fall in Monday’s tally with 1,621 cases. While this is not unusual on weekends due to reduced testing and fewer staff at the testing centres, the positivity rate in the district during the last three days stood at 32%. On May 14, of the 8,128 tests conducted, as many as 2,808 turned positive followed by 2,466 out of 7,865 on May 15 and 2,300 out of 7,415 on May 16, with a three day average positivity rate at 32.3%. The district’s cumulative coronavirus tally reached 1.6 lakh while the toll reached 1,100 as on Monday. Of this, 40% of the cases and more than 180 casualties were reported during the second wave of the pandemic, i.e., from mid-April till date. As per information, Chittoor district remains in the second place in the State on the list of total positive cases and occupies the top spot when it comes to the total casualties since the outbreak of the pandemic. Despite the alarming figures, testing remains inadequate, says a senior medical officer attached to the laboratory tests. “Compared to the first wave, the number of tests currently going on are not sufficient. Till a few weeks after the second wave had commenced, the number of tests daily all over the district remained around 3,000, while it gradually rose to 8,000-plus only a few days ago,” he says. When the spread was at its peak last year, the number of daily tests remained over 10,000 and the positivity rate was considerably low. “We need to ramp up testing to 15,000 a day, with focus on rural areas,” the official maintained. It is observed that the delay by three-to-four days in getting the results has prompted several persons to opt for rapid tests, while many of those who tested positive are going into home isolation without informing the officials concerned. The rude handling of the queue lines at some centres by the field staff is also said to be a reason driving away the public towards private labs. Some key officials in the COVID Task Force deplored that those who take the rapid tests at private labs are at a risk of getting “unsure” results at 60:40 ratio. As such those who test negative are taking the results for granted, and not going to the RT-PCR tests for confirmed results. This is contributing to the casualty rate or last-minute admissions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/testing-inadequate-in-chittoor-despite-high-positivity-rate/article34582905.ece
18 May 2021||DIVISEEMA (KRISHNA),ANDHRA PRADESH||Healthcare services yet to reach Diviseema islands||Last week, Nachagunta, one of the five islands in Diviseema in the district, reported the islands’ first COVID-related death. The victim’s family had to perform the last rites on the mainland after the inhabitants prohibited them from bringing the body to the island. The five islands, Nachugunta, Eelachetladibba, Edurumondi, Brahamayyagarimoola and Yesupuram, nestled between River Krishna and Bay of Bengal, has a population of around 4,500-5,000. But except for a public health centre(PHC) on Edurumondi, there are no hospitals on any of the islands. In emergency cases, people have to travel 15 km by water to reach the nearest Area Hospital in Avanigadda, which also is the nearest COVID hospital. 25 COVID cases “By Sunday, at least 25 persons have tested positive for COVID and dozens of people are identified with its symptoms in the islands. The island of Eelachetladibba is the worst affected with 11 cases,” sources associated with charity works told The Hindu . Hurdles galore Fisherfolk families that inhabit the islands have to cross the river, by boat at night and by punt in the day time, to reach the mainland. While there are two punts, only one is in operation at present for the other has been anchored in need of repair. Given the geographical disadvantages, reaching the hospital in time remains a challenge for these people. Even if one does overcome the hurdles and reaches the mainland in time, there is no saying if one would get admission. The nearest COVID Care Centre (CCC-Avanigadda), with 50 beds, is almost full in the wake of rising number of cases in the Diviseema region that comprises three mandals of Koduru, Nagayalanka and Avanigadda. On the condition of anonymity, a medical officer told The Hindu : “A CCC has to be set up immediately and all means of medical aid should be provided to them to prevent more deaths. The lone PHC on Edurumondi and a school building here can be converted into a CCC before the situation turns grim.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/healthcare-services-yet-to-reach-diviseema-islands/article34582898.ece
18 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||MP enacting drama to malign govt.: Midhun Reddy||Accusing Narsapuram MP K. Raghu Ramkrishna Raju of enacting a drama to malign the State government, YSRCP Rajampet MP Peddyreddi Midhun Reddy has said that a detailed investigation would reveal the conspiracy behind the entire episode. “The conspirators and instigators of the MP will be exposed soon,” Mr. Midhun Reddy, along with party MPs Lavu Sri Krishnadevarayalu and V. Balashowry, told the media at the YSRCP Central Party Office here on Monday. Refuting the allegations of custodial violence made by the Narsapuram MP, Mr. Midhun Reddy pointed out that the medical board constituted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court found no new injuries on the body of Mr. Ramkrishna Raju. Dig at Naidu He alleged that Mr. Ramakrishna Raju, at the instance of TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu, ‘enacted the drama of being assaulted when he was in the CID custody after his bail plea was rejected. “Mr. Naidu has been using the MP’s family to settle political score. Nowhere it is written that an MP cannot be arrested. We will take up the issue with the Lok Sabha Speaker,” said Mr. Midhun Reddy. “The MP is putting up a show to mislead the case and avoid going to jail. It was not right on part of him to insisting on getting treated only at Ramesh Hospital. It is no secret that the hospital belongs to a close associate of Mr. Naidu,” said Mr. Midhun Reddy. ‘False allegations’ MP V. Balashowry said Mr. Raju, despite being a people’s representative, never reached out to the people of his constituency during the COVID pandemic and had been living in Delhi for 14 months. “The MP used pro-TDP media channels to accuse the government on various fronts. He had used abusive language against the YSRCP leaders and made fun of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. He had levelled false allegations against the government on many occasions ,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mp-enacting-drama-to-malign-govt-midhun-reddy/article34583381.ece

The approximate value of each apartment is estimated to be around Rs. 50 lakh. It was on January 11 last year that the Coral Cove apartment complex was demolished using controlled implosion.

The incident came to light when the administrators of the Malabar Devaswom Board approached the police seeking action against the website, which reportedly displayed the names of many prominent temples to attract the faithful. “The incident has been taken up very seriously by the cyber cell as similar complaints have already been confirmed by prominent temples in other parts of the State,” said A.N. Neelakandan, Commissioner and Secretary of the Malabar Devaswom Board. Administrators of the Cochin Devaswom Board have already confirmed that the names of nine prominent temples under their control had been included in the portal to collect payment for pooja. “Firstly, we want to check whether the amount received online for pooja was actually used for the purpose or not. It will be possible only after tracking some of the victims of the alleged fraud. Also, the website was found facilitating such religious services in many temples across the country,” officers attached to the Kozhikode Cyberdome said.

Also known as Mucormycosis, the Black Fungus was reportedly spreading due to the misuse of steroids. The State needs to be cautious about the medicine kit it was giving to COVID-19 patients, the HC said. A Bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a batch of PIL petitions on coronavirus related matters, sought to know specifically from Advocate General B.S. Prasad if the kit had any steroids. The court directed the government to consider the teachers who died of coronavirus while attending to duties during the recently held elections as ‘COVID Warriors’. All benefits given to ‘COVID Warriors’ should be extended to them. The direction was given after a lawyer, Poojitha, said 15 of the 500 teachers deployed for election duties died of the infection. Responding to another submission by the lawyer, the bench said the government needed to address on a priority basis the issue of children being orphaned with their parents succumbing to COVID-19. It directed the Women and Child Welfare Department to file an affidavit on such instances and how it was going to rehabilitate them. The lawyer said some persons were resorting to illegal online adoption of such children. The bench said this could also lead to child-trafficking as well and the authorities need to take measures urgently to check the problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/do-covid-19-drug-kits-have-steroids-asks-hc/article34582854.ece

18 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Talks on Kerala Cabinet reach finality||The profile of the next Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala took a more definitive form on Monday after a fortnight of hectic behind-the-scenes berth-sharing talks. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan hinted the discussions had reached a finality. When pressed whether new faces would populate the Council of Ministers, Mr. Vijayan said: “Wait till tomorrow.” Diverse team Earlier, LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan had said the next government would have 21 Ministers. The LDF has drawn from a diverse cross-section of society to form the next Cabinet, he said. The LDF parliamentary party will meet on Tuesday and elect Mr. Vijayan as its leader. The Chief Minister-designate would decide the composition of the new government. In all probability, the CPI(M) would retain 12 Cabinet posts and the Speaker post. The party’s State secretariat would finalise the nominees. The party had withdrawn an array of veteran leaders from the electoral field to allow a new generation of activists to compete in the Assembly polls and gain legislative experience. The CPI(M) is likely to follow a similar template for selecting Ministers to ensure more party persons gained administrative experience and rose to leadership positions. However, it might retain veterans like Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. The Communist Party of India will keep four Cabinet posts and the Deputy Speaker’s office. Its State council is meeting here on Tuesday to finalise the party’s nominees. The Kerala Congress (M), the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) may get one Cabinet post each. The party is likely to nominate Roshy Augustine to the Cabinet and N. Jayaraj as the LDF Chief Whip. The CPI(M) had urged the Indian National League (INL), the Congress (S), the Kerala Congress (B) and the Democratic Kerala Congress (DKC) to hold a Cabinet rank for two-and-a-half years and concede the remaining term to another single-member ally. The calculus triggered speculation that DC(K) MLA Antony Raju, who hails from the Latin Catholic Community, a critical demographic in Kerala, and INL legislator Ahammad Devarkovil would serve the first term and step down in favour of KC(B) legislator K. B. Ganesh Kumar and Congress (S) leader Kadanappally Ramachandran. The LJD with a single member might have to settle for a board or corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/talks-on-kerala-cabinet-reach-finality/article34582864.ece

18 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Triple lockdown in 4 Kerala districts||The police scrambled to impose stay-at-home orders in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram districts on Monday midnight. The regions were under triple lockdown orders to curb the startling rise in COVID-19 cases. Officers fanned out across localities, flagged down vehicles and sought the reason for travel. They turned back scores of persons they deemed had ventured out without a valid reason or were far away from their houses. They allowed persons with online passes and emergency workers to travel. Some rush In Thiruvananthapuram, the police barricaded 22 exit and entry points into the district. In most wards, they allowed only one route for entry and exit. The capital witnessed some rush in the morning. However, vehicles and pedestrians dwindled to a trickle by noon. The shutdown was almost total by 3 p.m. Roads wore a deserted look. Retail businesses and commercial institutions, except banks, medical stores and fuel outlets, remained shut. Public transport buses, autorickshaws and taxi cabs remained off the road. Only a few plied ferrying passengers to and fro from hospitals, vaccination centres, airports, and railway stations. Only home delivery Hotels opened only to cater to home delivery services. The administration had banned indoor dining and takeaways. They could function on all days from 7 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. The police patrolled harbours, fish landing centres and beaches. Police vans, kitted-out with public address systems, urged people to remain indoors. The department flew remote-controlled drones to monitor far-flung localities. Law enforcers discouraged inter-district travel, except weddings, hospital appointments and the death of next of kin. Municipal and ward-level committees helped police fence off COVID-19 hotspots. Elected local body functionaries, neighbourhood watch and civil defence volunteers helped the police impose lockdown orders at the grassroots level. Community kitchens catered to cut-off localities. However, they prevented persons from hotspots from venturing out of their homes or neighbourhoods. Borders closed More than 10,000 officers were involved in pandemic duty. The police have assigned a beat officer for every 10 houses in hotspots. Flying squads and motorbike patrols will back them. The police have also closed inter-State borders. The government has allowed only freight movement. The government would review the lockdown on May 23. It is likely to ease the restrictions only if the disease transmission rate slowed down to an acceptable level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/triple-lockdown-in-4-kerala-districts/article34582866.ece

Sudhakar Reddy on Monday said sedition charges levelled by the Andhra Pradesh CID police against Narsapuram MP K. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju were untenable and flimsy. The police did not respect the democratic rights of the YSRCP MP to express his opinions on the policies of the YSRCP government, Mr. Sudhakar Reddy told the media here. The TDP leader asserted that the MP was wrongly implicated in the case. “Mr. Raju was charged with instigating caste feelings in order to destabilise the government. If it was the case, similar cases should have also been filed against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his Cabinet colleagues who had played caste politics in the issues pertaining to capital city Amaravati, and the previous TDP government,” he said. Decrying the alleged custodial violence faced by Mr. Raju, Mr. Sudhakar Reddy said, “This is aimed at terrorising the witnesses in the bail cancellation petition filed by the Narsapuram MP against Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy in the court.” Following a Supreme Court directive on Monday, the MP — lodged in the district jail in Guntur — was taken to Secunderabad in neighbouring Telangana for medical tests at the Army Hospital. The MP had earlier alleged that the sedition case against him was a “vindictive action” by his own party’s government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sedition-charges-against-narsapuram-mp-flimsy-tdp/article34582856.ece
18 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Covishield costs Rs. 300 per dose and Covaxin Rs. 400, govt. tells HC||The State government on Monday informed the High Court through a memo that under the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Policy notified by the Centre, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India are mandated to supply 50% of their production to the Centre at the rate of Rs. 150 per dose and half of the balance is to be supplied to States and the other half to private players. Although no price has been fixed for supply to the States, the Centre indicated in its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that in ‘informal consultations’ with the manufacturers, it has been decided that both the manufacturers should supply vaccines to every State at a uniform rate. Consequently, while Covishield is available to the States at Rs. 300 per dose, Covaxin costs Rs. 400 per dose. C. Sumon, special government pleader in the office of the Advocate General, mentioned in the memo that it was against that backdrop Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to permit other manufacturers to produce vaccines to meet the burgeoning demand. Appearing for the petitioners, advocates V. Ashok Ram and G.R. Sudhakar presented their arguments on the difficulties faced by the State in procuring adequate stocks of oxygen and Remdesivir injections and the need for urgent remedial action. Mr. Sumon said the allocation to the State was increased to only 590 MT from 480 MT as on May 8, despite the letter written to the Centre for an allotment of 800 MT of oxygen. The Chief Minister sought an increase in the allocation of oxygen to 910 MT considering the heavy caseload.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covishield-costs-rs-300-per-dose-and-covaxin-rs-400-govt-tells-hc/article34583387.ece

18 May 2021||VIJYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||SRM varsity launches first startup cohort||The Technology Business Incubator (TBI) of SRM University-AP has launched its first venture cohort with 36 selected start-up business ventures. Head of Co-innovation and Outreach at IIIT-Hyderabad and former chief innovation officer of the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC) Prof. Ramesh Loganathan provided insights into the scope and future of entrepreneurship in the country and across the globe. “The entrepreneurial journey should start with identifying the problems in the ecosystem. The face recognition software that started with the idea of capturing student attendance in colleges is a great example. Budding entrepreneurs should identify similar problems, take up a thorough market research and then prepare the business plan. The price of the product/idea should matter the last,” he said. The university vice-chancellor V.S. Rao said from the beginning the university had been focussing on grooming students as entrepreneurs who could be the leaders of tomorrow. He said the university had signed an MoU with the University of California, Berkeley, to design the curriculum and promote entrepreneurship.

Continuing the same timings, it is learnt that the curfew will be enforced from 12 p.m. to next day 6 a.m. and the window period, which will be observed under Cr Pc 144 Section, is from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. Since mid April, the district has been seeing a huge surge in cases, including an increase in the official death rate. On April 9, the total cases were around 64,139 and active cases were 2,082. By May 16 (Sunday), the total cases have gone up to 1,12,847, which indicate that about 48,000 cases were reported during this period and the active cases as on Sunday stood at 20,952. Similarly, on April 9, the death count stood at 554 and by Sunday it has risen to 771. The district recorded 217 deaths, in the same period. On the brighter side, during the same period about 29,000 people, who were affected with the virus, also recovered. “It was a good decision to extend the curfew, as the cases are piling up at the hospital doorsteps. We are just about seeing a slight dip in cases and it will be ideal to extend the curfew for a few more days to break the chain of spread,” said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. Another senior doctor from the King George Hospital (KGH) said that a strong curfew or lockdown for a few more days can bring down the curve and the positivity rate. “Right now we are testing around 7,500 to 8,000 people on a daily basis and we are are recording around 2,000 to 2,200 positive cases on an average, which indicate that the positivity rate is around 25%. In the last week of April it was around 15.2 %,” said a senior official from the District Medical and Health Department. Strict enforcement In such a scenario, a stronger enforcement of curfew is the need of the hour, as it may curtail the spread, said Hema Prakash from GITAM Institute of Medical Science and Research. If the spread is curtailed, the load on the hospitals will come down, and the health machinery will function better, said a senior doctor from KGH.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/medical-fraternity-welcomes-extension-of-partial-curfew/article34583398.ece

Vinay Chand has directed the officials to ensure that cashless treatment is provided at empanelled hospitals under the Aarogyasri scheme, as per the guidelines. The Collector held a review meet on the allocation of beds under Aarogyasri at private hospitals in the district on Monday. The allocation of beds under Aarogyasri should be done under category A and B empanelled hospitals without fail, he said. The nodal officers for the respective hospitals and the hospital managements should keep the DRDA Project Director informed on the availability of beds from time to time. The ICU beds, ventilator beds and oxygen beds allocated under Aarogyasri should be shown separately, the Collector said. Mr. Vinay Chand said that it was unfortunate that some patients were being given treatment under ‘self finance’. He directed that allocation of beds under Aarogyasri should be done as per G.O. 210. He asked District Medical and Health Officer P. Suryanarayana and Aarogyasri Coordinator Rajesh as to why notices were not issued to the private hospitals not following the norms. He said though there were a number of hospitals in the district, it was unfortunate that several requests for beds were pending in 104 service. He directed the RDO Penchala Kishore to get the private hospitals inspected by the revenue officials. The private hospitals were not permitted to treat COVID-19 patients without prior permission, he said. Audit on ventilators He directed the District Medical and Health Officer to inspect five hospitals in the morning and five in the evening every day and submit a report.

18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Vaccine second dose deferment catches many citizens unawares||Anxiety over the second vaccine dose continues for quite a few people who had arrived at the Government COVID Vaccination Centres (GCVCs) on Monday hoping to get the jab, but had to return home disappointed. An announcement on the vaccination drive being postponed was made late on Sunday night, catching them unawares. A few families that had reached Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital on Monday for the jab enquired with the staff there if the vaccine would be given, but did not get a proper response. They were forced to return home without taking the vaccine. “Such incidents were reported in other GCVCs too. The staff there explained the reasons for the postponement. A few argued and questioned how many times must they visit the vaccination centres,” sources in the department said. Apart from the GCVCs, the vaccination came to halt at a few corporate hospitals, too, which had been given Covaxin stocks. Till Monday evening, there was no official communication about the date from which the second dose drive will be resumed. The Health department did not conduct the second dose vaccination drive on Saturday and Sunday, and therefore, people had pinned their hopes on getting the shot on Monday. However, on Sunday night, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao announced that the COVID-19 second dose vaccination drive for people above 45 years of age has been postponed. “In view of inadequate stock of Covaxin and non-receipt of fresh stocks from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the second dose drive for persons above 45 years of age is postponed. Details regarding resumption of the vaccination drive will be made available subsequently,” he said in a statement. Incomplete info Those who went through the announcement had a question in mind — would Covishield be offered at the GCVCs on Monday? In fact, till early morning, Health department staff were also not certain if Covishield jabs would be administered. Asked if the dose of Covishield would be offered on Monday to people who have completed the 12-week interval since the first jab, senior officials from the Health department had, on Sunday night, said: “No vaccination programme in the State. No eligible beneficiaries for Covishield”.  The staff at GCVCs explained reasons for postponement. A few argued and questioned how many times must they visit the vaccination centres.

18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||More Mucormycosis patients get admitted to ENT Hospital||The number of patients with Mucormycosis or Black Fungus to have been admitted to the Government ENT Hospital, Koti, has increased to 20. The hospital was recently turned into the nodal centre for admission and treatment of such cases. Of the 20, two were operated on. Investigations and medical procedures in the run-up to the surgery are being offered to the remaining 18 patients. Superintendent of the hospital, T. Shankar said they have allotted two out of the five operation theatres (OTs) to such cases. “If need be, all five OTs will be used for operation of Black Fungus patients,” he added. Officials are anticipating more cases in the coming days. Availability of anti-fungal drugs at the government hospital is another reason that demand for the services there may increase. Helpline number Dr Shankar said people can dial 040-24740245 for admission-related queries. Currently, the helpline service is available from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m, and patients may be asked for CT scan and other reports. The hospital’s superintendent said that soon they will ensure that people can reach the number for a response round the clock. He added that only COVID-negative patients with the fungal infection are admitted there. If the Mucormycosis patients are COVID-positive, they are sent to Gandhi Hospital. Know the symptoms ENT specialists and opthalmologists have stressed the importance of awareness on Black Fungus symptoms so that the patients do not neglect the infection till they end up in a critical stage. Many patients were seen to have delayed consulting a specialist doctor since they assumed that the symptoms were post-COVID complications. A senior ophthalmologist-oculoplasty specialist at L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, Tarjani Vivek Dave said that the symptoms include any kind of facial pain, pain over the sinuses (cheekbones), stuffy nose, blood-stained or black nasal discharge, drooping of the upper eyelid, unusual bulging of the eyes, restricted movement of the eyeball, sudden redness and extreme swelling over the eyeball, sudden decrease in vision and black lesions on the palate or dental pain. “If the patient experiences any such symptoms, he or she should immediately consult a specialised eye surgeon, preferably an oculoplasty specialist. Alternatively, an ENT surgeon can also be consulted. Patients can also avail tele-consultation facility if they are in isolation or admitted to a hospital,” Dr Tarjani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-mucormycosis-patients-get-admitted-to-ent-hospital/article34583134.ece
18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Take call on capping hospital, test charges in 48 hours: HC||Directing the State government to spell out its strategy to tackle the situation in the event of a third wave of COVID-19, Telangana High Court on Monday said the government cannot afford to take chances on the matter. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas on coronavirus-connected issues, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy observed that scientific and medical experts indicated children could be more susceptible to the virus during the possible third wave. Hence, the government needs to be geared up to meet the situation, the bench said. The bench directed the government to issue orders within 48 hours on fixing charges for different diagnostic tests and hospitalisation for COVID-19 patients. If not all for all tests, the government can cap the charge for crucial blood tests and CT scan of chest which are crucial to assess the condition of the patients, the CJ noted. “Examine the issue of capping prices of tests and beds with all seriousness and take all measures to issue a GO in the matter,” the CJ told the government. Lawyer Arjun Kumar told the bench that a three-member task force committee of IAS officers used to examine complaints relating to excessive charges and bills, but the committee was not functional any more. The CJ ordered reconstitution of the panel and publicise its contact number so that people can lodge complaints. Referring to submissions relating to prices of drugs, the bench issued notices to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority and directed it to file an affidavit on the prices of essential medicines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-call-on-capping-hospital-test-charges-in-48-hours-hc/article34583136.ece
18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Micronutrient bites’ reduce anemia in children: study||Project Grow Smart, a study conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has shown that adding a multiple micronutrient powder to the first bites of the meal in anganwadi centres has resulted in a striking reduction in anemia among children aged between 3-6 years old. The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, US, at 22 anganwadis of Nalgonda district. The centres were randomised into a group that got micronutrients (which include iron, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin A and vitamin B2) or a placebo group (only vitamin B6). Anganwadi staff were trained to mix the micronutrients/placebo powder into a small portion of the cooked noon meal and serve it as the first few bites. The duration of the study was eight months and the intervention was provided on every school day (six days per week) during that period. After eight months, it was noticed that anemia reduced from 46% to 10.1% among children who received the added micronutrient bites, as compared to a 47% to 35.5% reduction among children without the added micronutrients (placebo group), with corresponding improvements in iron status. The study also found that adding micronutrients led to gains in children’s language of about six points (equivalent to IQ points), in social-emotional development of about 4.5 points, and in inhibitory control of about three points. “These are significant gains. These gains in children’s health and neurobehavioral development mean that the children are better prepared to learn and to take advantage of opportunities in primary school, and beyond, advancing human capital development,” said Sylvia F Rao, scientist and lead investigator from ICMR-NIN. “This can be a cost-effective way to improve the health and neurobehavioral development of more than 2.5 crore preschool age children (3-6 years) that anganwadi centres serve throughout the country” she said. Anemia and iron deficiency are widespread (40.5%) among preschool children in India, largely due to nutrition insecurity and low iron and other micronutrient diets. The strategy adopted in the study can be stepped up to effectively combat anemia among young children taking advantage of the infrastructure of the ICDS-Anganwadi Centres, she added. The study funded by Micronutrient Initiative, Canada, and Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition, USA, was published in the recent issue of the globally renowned Journal of Nutrition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/micronutrient-bites-reduce-anemia-in-children-study/article34583138.ece

Mahender Reddy to ensure that police personnel were sensitised to extend helping hand to any person approaching them for admission in government hospitals. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said local police personnel should render all necessary assistance to such persons in securing admissions in government hospitals. The direction was issued after lawyer Chikkudu Prabhakar drew attention of the court to the death of a pregnant woman who was denied admission in a government hospital in the State capital in the backdrop of COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-two-year-old Pavani from Medchal-Malkajgiri district was taken to different hospitals in city reportedly after she developed some complications. The pregnant woman was not COVID-positive but could not secure admission in any private or government hospital. After being taken first to a corporate hospital and then different government hospitals, she died in the ambulance. Taking into consideration instances of entire members of a family falling sick due to the virus, the bench said community kitchens were the need of the hour. The bench instructed the government to ensure authorities of all civic bodies across the State tied up with voluntary organisations to supply food to COVID-19 affected families free of cost or at nominal price. Immediate steps should be taken in this regard, the bench said. The bench made it clear to AG that authorities should not take up evacuation of villagers whose properties were acquired for Kaleshwaram project during lockdown. Lawyer Arjun complained that authorities were evacuating villagers, some of whom tested positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sensitise-police-in-helping-the-needy-get-hospital-admissions/article34583331.ece
18 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||People finding reasons to venture out on the streets||A borrowed Zomato or Swiggy T-shirt can be somebody’s ticket to roam around for fun during the lockdown. However, police in the State capital have sniffed out such cheap tricks and are clamping down with cases to teach the loiterers a lesson. Recently, one such 25-year-old who borrowed his friend’s Zomato delivery T-shirt to escape police checkpoints, was caught by the LB Nagar police of Rachakonda Commissionerate. The youth claimed that he was working for the app-based food delivery aggregator, but failed to show enough evidence or order booking. When police seized his bike and questioned him, the youngster narrated the whole story and he was booked under Section 188 ( Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC, and relevant sections of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. This was one of many such cases dealt by the police in the three urban police commissionerates — Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda — or elsewhere in the State, on a daily basis. Everyday, the law enforcers are coming across such cases, where people are venturing out during lockdown hours for no reason. Excuses range from fake medical prescriptions to fake illness as well. Some say they came out to buy medicines without even a prescription, or a forwarded one on WhatsApp, while others maintain that they were going/coming back from the hospitals after meeting their relatives who tested positive for the deadly virus. In fact, some people maintained that they were sick and on the way to the hospital to consult a doctor. “As we don’t know how to prove their claims, they are simply let off. What if he was really sick and required immediate medical assistance. We will be at fault,” said an officer. The top cops are frustrated with how many people are coming up with lies and tricks to go out for just for the heck of it, while policemen remain on the ground in the summer heat to implement the lockdown. On Sunday evening, a young couple was caught by the Jubilee Hills police for coming out during lockdown hours. When questioned, the couple told police that they decided to go on a jolly ride as they were bored sitting at home. A case was registered and they were left off as the woman was supposed to feed the newborn. Everyday the Hyderabad city police alone is booking about 5,000 to 5,200 cases, while their counterparts in Cyberabad and Rachakonda register at least 1,000 each for lockdown violation. “Since April 6, we have booked more than 1.12 lakh cases of not wearing masks in public places, not maintaining physical distance, and gatherings at public places,” City Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar told The Hindu.  He said that this time people have realised the impact of the virus and are voluntarily cooperating. “However, black sheep in the society are taken for a task,” Mr. Kumar said. Police chiefs of Cyberabad and Rachakonda, V.C. Sajjanar and Mahesh Bhagwat, respectively, said that they have registered about 7,500 and 9,633 cases since May 12. “We are asked to implement lockdown effectively. Parameter for effective enforcement is that we must book more cases and seize more vehicles,” said a police inspector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/people-finding-reasons-to-venture-out-on-the-streets/article34583336.ece

Steps should be taken to set up cold storages at these sub centres for storing drugs. Steps should be taken to accord priority to government hospitals providing required oxygen to poor and there should be no scope for shortage of oxygen. Officials informed the Chief Minister that the government had issued orders relating to charges that should be levied by private hospitals for providing beds to COVID-19 patients almost of year ago. Similar guidelines were being implemented in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other States. The Chief Minister directed the officials to designate the 200-bed hospital in Anantagiri in Vikarabad district as COVID-19 hospital while other hospitals that were being run by the TSRTC, Singareni, CISF, CRPF and Railways should be utilized for treating coronavirus patients. He expressed happiness over the measures that had been initiated in the government hospitals for COVID-19 treatment as well as the ongoing fever survey and supply of medicines. The proactive steps initiated by the government had ensured that the number of admissions had come down and the rate of discharges from the hospitals that increased significantly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sub-centres-to-be-set-up-across-state/article34583341.ece
18 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Make stand clear on free treatment: Uttam||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy said Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao was not responding to the appeals to include COVID-19 treatment in Arogyasri while several other States were already providing free treatment to all the COVID patients. Addressing the representatives of rural local bodies in a meeting being held by Panchayat Raj Sanghatan on virtual mode, he said TRS government’s attitude on the pandemic was inhuman. Despite lack of beds, injections and medicines shortage the government has not taken any concrete steps to mitigate the problems of people. The TPCC chief said during Congress regime pharma industry was developed in Hyderabad. Today, several medicines are made in Hyderabad and supplied all over the world but people of the State are not getting them. He pointed out that Covaxin is produced in Hyderabad by Bharat Biotech and Remdisivir by Hetero Drugs in Hyderabad, but both of them are not available to the people of the state.  Mr. Reddy said Congress has decided to take up relief works for the COVID patients on the occasion of 30th death anniversary of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. He called upon the party leaders and workers to be available to the people and said that relief works like taking the people to test centres, vaccine centres, providing medicines, food and masks should be taken up. He said that two ambulances have been arranged at Gandhi Hospital and they would be available from Tuesday.

18 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP MPs asked to ensure adequate medicines||Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy has challenged the BJP Parliament members from the State to fight with their Central leadership on the short supply of vaccines and Remdesvir injections rather than making tall claims. At a press conference here, he said that Remdesvir injections were not available even in the black market if people want to spend money. It is unfortunate that the injections are manufactured in Hyderabad but the city doesn’t get its share, he said alleging that the Centre was providing sufficient numbers only to a few states. Mr. Reddy threatened that he would be forced to stage a dharna in front of the manufacturing unit in Telangana if sufficient numbers were not given to the State on priority basis. He asked as to why the State government was not protesting with the Centre when hundreds of people were dying due to the shortage of medicines. The Congress MLA ridiculed the BJP leaders claim that the State government was not providing sufficient data and said it can get the data from its own sources if it wants to. Mr. Reddy also questioned the silence of the State Task Force on COVID when private hospitals were openly fleecing patients and billing them lakhs of rupees. There are so many reports of victims of excess billing by private hospitals, but the Task Force is just silent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-mps-asked-to-ensure-adequate-medicines/article34583332.ece

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Set up oxygen generation plants with 324 MT capacity: CM||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the Health Department officials to take steps to set up oxygen generating plants with a capacity of 324 metric tonne in 48 hospitals in the government sector across the State to avoid scope for shortage of oxygen in future. Steps should be initiated to set up a plant with a capacity of 100 MT liquid oxygen in the GHMC limits. The Chief Minister wanted the officials concerned to ensure that six units of 16 MT capacity, 15 units of 8 MT capacity and 27 units of 4 MT capacity are set up in Hyderabad as well as district and area hospitals. He requested the firms engaged in oxygen generation to ensure supply of 11 oxygen tankers each with a capacity of 20 MT in the next 10 days. This is aimed at ensuring that there was no shortage of oxygen in the State in the coming days. The Chief Minister gave the directions during a high-level meeting convened to discuss the status of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the State with officials of Health and related departments on Monday. Mr. Rao stressed the need for the patients, especially lower middle class and poor, to opt for State-owned hospitals for COVID-19 treatment as the government is providing free treatment along with medicines, food and other facilities. In all, 6,926 beds - 2,253 oxygen beds, 533 ICU, 4,140 general beds – are available in the government hospitals as on Monday, officials explained the Chief Minister. Responding to this, the Chief Minister wanted people to opt for government hospitals in view of the availability of beds, oxygen, Remdesivir and other drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients rather than the private hospitals where they could be forced to shell out money. Mr. Rao directed the Health officials to ensure equipment and medicines in Gandhi Hospital and ENT Hospital in Koti, the two hospitals designated to treat Black Fungus. The officials should take steps to ensure that equipment like micro debriders and HD endoscopic cameras are procured at the earliest, he said. In addition, officials should be in constant touch with the Central government to ensure that quota of vaccines allocated to the State is received on timely basis. Officials informed the Chief Minister that the State had so far received 57.30 lakh doses of vaccine and currently stocks of 1.86 lakh doses of Covaxin - 58,230 - and Covishield - 1.28 lakh - are available in the State. The Chief Minister reiterated that the government is prepared to spend any amount of money for setting up necessary medical infrastructure and it was decided to set up new medical colleges at Sangareddy, Jagtial, Kothagudem, Wanaparthy, Mancherial and Mahbubabad districts. Steps should be taken to start nursing colleges along with these medical colleges, he said. Officials were directed to work out modalities for setting nursing colleges affiliated to the existing medical colleges in areas where they were not present while they should also examine the proposals received for setting up new nursing colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/set-up-oxygen-generation-plants-with-324-mt-capacity-cm/article34583340.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kin of COVID-19 victims deprived of one final goodbye||On Monday afternoon, Arunima Bhattacharjee (28) performed the last rites of her father Abhoy (65) who succumbed to COVID-19 last night. She regrets not being able to see him one last time to bid goodbye. Breaking down, Ms. Bhattacharjee, a lawyer by profession and resident of South Delhi, said that she wanted her father to know that she and her mother tried their best to save him but she didn’t get a chance despite waiting outside Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and making innumerable calls to the help desk. “I just wanted to tell him that I didn’t abandon him and you may be leaving us behind but me and Maa will try to be okay just the way you would have wanted. I wanted him to know we tried,” she said sobbing. Recalling her experience, Ms. Bhattacharjee said that her father, who was also under treatment for neurological problems, was admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital on May 7. “I specifically told the doctors and nurses there during admission that he has neurological problems and he’ll need attention but I didn’t get any update on his health for three days. I kept asking the doctor that I wanted to visit him and three days later, they agreed to let me go inside wearing a PPE kit,” she said. What she saw had her in tears. “My father was in diapers and a tshirt which were soiled. He was confused and didn’t know what was happening. I decided to shift him because I knew he would die there,” she claimed. After arranging a bed, she shifted him to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital on May 14 and that was the last she saw of him. “I waited outside the hospital on May 15 and asked the reception and called on five help desk numbers, but they kept me waiting. I got no word. Eventually, my friend cried on the phone and that’s when they shared details of his bed number,” she claimed, adding she also took to social media for help on her father’s update. Neharikka Vij from AAP MLA Raghav Chadha’s team then contacted the daughter via Twitter and helped her with the health update on her father. “Thanks to her we got the update that he was okay,” Ms. Bhattacharjee said. Request for video call On May 16, claiming that she herself was unwell as she had just recovered from COVID-19 about 10 days ago, Ms. Bhattacharjee did not visit the hospital and continued to call requesting the hospital for “one video call” but to no avail. On Sunday night, around 10 p.m., she said she received a call from the hospital saying that her father had been put on ventilator. “I was on my way and I asked the hospital staffer to show me my father via video and tell him that he was going to be okay, but that did not happen,” she said. By the time she reached the hospital, she was informed he had passed away. Ms. Vij said that she got Ms. Bhattacharjee’s call around 11 p.m. on Sunday asking her to help with information on her father’s heath and if there was any way she could meet her father. “I told her to calm down and carry a PPE kit and that I’ll try if something can be done. When I called the doctor, he told her father had already passed away. I just didn’t know how to tell her but within the next few minutes, she reached the hospital,” the volunteer said. Amit Phansalkar (45) from Pune, an IT professional, recalled how he saw his father for the last time when he was admitted in a hospital for COVID-19 in March. “Going into the COVID lift of the hospital… that was the last I saw of him,” he said. Mr. Phansalkar claimed it was nearly impossible to get updates about his father’s health. “Most of the times, I would just tell the doctor that he can update me when he had the time because I understood they were swarmed with work but I feel there should be a way to be able to contact COVID patients,” he said. Kartikeya Bhatotia, 24, resident of Pitampura, said that his father is admitted at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and he tested COVID negative a week ago but they haven’t been able to see him or get any update about him. “We don’t know who is his doctor is. My father wasn’t fully conscious for the last two weeks and we were dependent on a healthcare worker for information about my father,” he said. Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital refused to comment on the matter. A doctor working with a private hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, “Doctors and healthcare workers are in a terrible condition themselves. They are dealing with more than they can handle. They can’t be expected to update families when they are trying to save lives”.  Doctors and healthcare workers are dealing with more than they can handle.

18 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC reserves order on Central Vista plea||The Delhi High Court on Monday reserved its verdict on a petition seeking to halt the construction activities related to the Central Vista Project in view of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the Capital. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh reserved its verdict after hearing both sides for over three hours. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, opposed the plea saying that the plea was a “facade” and a “disguise” in the form of a public interest litigation (PIL) to stall the project which they always wanted to stop. The Solicitor General said the public interest question raised by the petitioner in the case was “very selective”. He said the petitioners do not seem to care about the workmen of other construction activities going on the city. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, argued that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government cannot see it, then it was a “sorry reflection” of their concerns for the lives of the citizens. Mr. Luthra referred to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather “central fortress of death”, comparing it to “Auschwitz”, a German concentration camp during World War-II. Solicitor General Mehta was displeased with the project being referred to as Auschwitz, saying one can criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court. Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bona fide and the company was taking care of its workforce. The company's counsel argued that the petitioners cannot decide what was the safe timeline for completing the project as it had to finish it by November so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath. The company also said that half of Rajpath has been dug up and if the work is stalled then the pits would be filled during the monsoon, which could lead to collapse of adjacent areas and also creation of a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-reserves-order-on-central-vista-plea/article34583305.ece

18 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘Fix a formula to determine price of oxygen concentrators’||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre if it can fix a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators which are being imported at huge numbers due to their demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rakha Palli said it was not asking the government to fix an exact price for the oxygen concentrators but to fix a principle on which they will be charged as people were being charged exorbitantly. The High Court also said that there has to a ceiling on the price of the product which could be sold in the domestic market by the importers. “There has to be some limit to it. Tomorrow, some Chinese manufacturer will say he will sell it at a five-time rate, it cannot be allowed,” the court said. “As a government, it is your responsibility that people are actually able to afford the product and not have to pay through their nose. They can’t be taken for a ride. Shortage of a product cannot be taken advantage of,” the High Court observed. Central government counsel said the landed price is ultimately determined by the exporter. It was not possible for the government to fix the prices as there are different concentrators in the market with different prices, sizes and names, it said. The Centre’s counsel, however, sought some time to obtain instructions and come back to the court with some answers by May 19. During the hearing, the court permitted various private hospitals, which had sought immediate relief of oxygen supply to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, to withdraw their pleas as the supplies have now been stabilised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fix-a-formula-to-determine-price-of-oxygen-concentrators/article34583306.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rs. 1 lakh cash reward for wrestler’s whereabouts||The Delhi police on Monday announced a reward of Rs. 1 lakh on Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and of Rs. 50,000 on co-accused Ajay. They are wanted in a murder of a wrestler in north-west Delhi. The proposal to announce cash reward was approved by the police headquarters on Monday, a senior police officer said. “We are hopeful to get leads about Sushil after announcing the cash reward as he is a public figure and hiding for long at any place will be tough for him,” said the officer. Previously, a Delhi court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Sushil Kumar in the murder case of a 23-year-old wrestler at Chhatrasal Stadium. The police had also issued a look-out notice against Sushil Kumar in the matter last week. “Several police teams have been on the look-out for Sushil Kumar in Uttarakhand, U.P., Delhi and Haryana. After being named in the case, he remained at an ashram in Haridwar for a few days and later changed his location. He was last seen in Sonipat in Haryana,” added the officer. The officer added that Sushil is continuously changing his location and at several instances, police teams were a few minutes late to catch him. “We have arrested three of his accomplices and they have got details of Sushil’s hideouts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rs-1-lakh-cash-reward-for-wrestlers-whereabouts/article34583313.ece

18 May 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Threatened by Punjab CM’s adviser: Cong. MLA||Punjab Congress MLA Pargat Singh on Monday alleged that Sandeep Sandhu, political adviser to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, has threatened him of a police case for raising questions surrounding State government’s action over the sacrilege and police firing incidents of 2015. Allegation dismissed Dismissing the allegation, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said there was no truth into it and Mr. Sandhu has made it clear that he never made any threatening call to Mr. Pargat Singh. Mr. Singh at a press conference here, said Mr. Sandhu had called him up last week and threatened him. “Mr. Sandu stated that certain papers have been gathered against me and that I should now be ready to the face consequence,” said Mr. Singh. Mr. Jakhar in a statement, describing the party MLA and veteran sports star Pargat Singh as the role model of the youth, said that the party respects his sentiments. “The Congress party never indulged in vendetta politics. It was the principle of the party to not use the constitutional institutions for personal interests or to settle scores and it was unthinkable to do so against its own MLA. In fact there was no truth in these rumours as Captain Sandeep Sandhu himself had made it clear that he never made any threatening phone call to Pargat Singh,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/threatened-by-punjab-cms-adviser-cong-mla/article34583317.ece

The reply furnished by the hospitals was not satisfactory following which the two have been denotified. Both hospitals have been directed to not admit new COVID-19 patients. But they can continue to treat the patients already admitted till the time they are discharged,” said Rewari Deputy Commissioner Yashendra Singh. He said that beds were added to the existing hospitals so that the patients do not suffer due to closure of the two facilities. “It is a first-of-its kind action against any hospital in the State for flouting government guidelines on Covid charges,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/two-hospitals-denotified-for-overcharging/article34583321.ece
18 May 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal government decides to set up a Legislative Council||The West Bengal Government will set up a Legislative Council, or a Vidhan Parishad. A decision on setting up the council was taken up at a State Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday. The Trinamool Congress in its manifesto has promised formation of Legislative Council and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had also said that the Vidhan Parishad will be set up once the Trinamool Congress government returns to power. Ms. Banerjee had indicated that certain members who will not face election can be nominated through the Legislative Council. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Finance Minister Amit Mitra are not members of the State Assembly. They can be easily nominated to the Legislative Council once the body is set up and will not have to face elections. For setting up the council, a Bill has to be introduced in the State Assembly and then a nod from the State’s Governor is required. West Bengal Legislative Council, the Upper House of the bicameral legislature in West Bengal existed till 1969, till a resolution was passed in the State Assembly for its dissolution. Not all States in the country have Legislative Councils.  Private players The State government also took the important decision for involving private players as a part of public-private partnership to contain COVID-19 situation in the State. The State on Monday recorded 19,003 new cases and 147 deaths due to the infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/west-bengal-government-decides-to-set-up-a-legislative-council/article34583319.ece

18 May 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Gusty winds bring destruction to Raigad||The strong winds which lashed the Maharashtra coast due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae left five houses completely damaged and partially destroyed 1,886 houses. The gusty winds, touching speeds of 60 to 70 kmph, also knocked down trees and electricity poles in several places which are being cleared on a war footing. Cyclone Nisarga in June last year had witnessed wind speeds of 150 kmph and lasted for just about four hours but had severely destroyed the power infrastructure. “Electricity poles have been damaged in Alibag and Shrivardhan. Road blockades are being cleared by field teams immediately,” Raigad Collector Nidhi Choudhary said. The district has 100 Covid care hospitals of which 55 are in rural Raigad.There were reports of damage to trees, vehicles and roofs of houses in Navi Mumbai also. The intensity of the wind caused a crack in the glass pane at the jumbo Covid facility at the Cidco Exhibition Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gusty-winds-bring-destruction-to-raigad/article34583067.ece
18 May 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra’s recovery rate rises above 90%||Maharashtra’s recoveries continued to outpace its cases with 48,211 patients being discharged on Monday as compared with 26,616 new COVID-19 cases. The spike is the lowest that the State has recorded in more than a month as its active case tally dipped below 4.50 lakh to reach 4,45,495.

18 May 2021||Gaza City,||Israeli strikes hit Gaza tunnels as diplomats work for ceasefire||The Israeli military unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes on the Gaza Strip early on Monday, saying it destroyed 15 km of militant tunnels and the homes of nine Hamas commanders, as international diplomats worked to end the week of fighting that has killed hundreds of people. The latest attacks killed a top Gaza leader of the Islamic Jihad militant group whom the Israeli military blamed for some of the thousands of rocket attacks launched at Israel in recent days. Residents of Gaza awakened by the overnight barrage described it as the heaviest since the war began. The strikes came a day after the deadliest attack in the current round of hostilities between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers, which killed 42 people and flattened three buildings in Gaza. Gaza’s Mayor, Yahya Sarraj, told Al-Jazeera TV that the strikes had caused extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure. “If the aggression continues we expect conditions to become worse,” he said. The UN has warned that the territory’s sole power station is at risk of running out of fuel, and Mr. Sarraj said Gaza was also low on spare parts. Gaza already experiences daily power outages for between eight and 12 hours, and tap water is undrinkable. Mohammed Thabet, a spokesman for the electricity distribution company, said it has fuel to supply Gaza with electricity for two or three days. Hamas also continued its rocket attacks, launching them from residential areas in Gaza and aimed at civilian population centres in Israel. The war broke out last Monday, when the Hamas militant group fired long-range rockets at Jerusalem after weeks of clashes in the holy city between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police. The protests were focused on the heavy-handed policing of a flashpoint sacred site during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. Call for strike More protests were expected across the region on Tuesday in response to a call by Palestinian citizens of Israel for a general strike. The protest has the support of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party. Since the fighting began, the Israeli military has launched hundreds of airstrikes. Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired more than 3,200 rockets into Israel. The Israeli military, meanwhile, said it struck 35 “terror targets” on Monday as well as the tunnels, which it says are part of an elaborate system it refers to as the “Metro,” used by fighters to take cover from airstrikes. At least 200 Palestinians have been killed in the strikes, including 59 children and 35 women, with 1,300 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Eight people in Israel have been killed in rocket attacks launched from Gaza.. Despite international efforts at a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s attacks were continuing at “full-force” and would “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” on the Hamas militant group, he said. Hamas’ top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who is based abroad, said the group has been contacted by the UN, Russia, Egypt and Qatar as part of cease-fire efforts but “will not accept a solution that is not up to the sacrifices of the Palestinian people.” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said his government is working to “urgently” end the violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israeli-strikes-hit-gaza-tunnels-as-diplomats-work-for-ceasefire/article34582800.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Is India’s Palestine policy evolving?||At the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, India, a non-permanent member, reaffirmed its support for Palestine, but stopped short of making any direct reference to the status of Jerusalem or the future Israel-Palestine borders. Wrapping up his over-4-minute-long speech at the Security Council, T.S. Tirumurti, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said: “In conclusion, India reiterates its strong support for the just Palestinian cause and its unwavering commitment to the two-state solution.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday tweeted the national flags of 25 countries, from the United States to Albania, that he said were “resolutely standing with Israel and supporting our right to self defence”. Indian flag was not among them. Ambassador Tirumurti’s statement made two things clear. One, he said the “violence began in East Jerusalem a week back”, referring to the clashes in the Al-Aqsa compound and East Jerusalem’s neighbourhood. This means, India doesn’t see Hamas’s rocket firing on May 10, which followed Israeli forces storming Al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, as the trigger of the conflict. Second, India has expressed “our deep concern over the violence in Jerusalem, especially on Haram esh-Sharif/Temple Mount during the holy month of Ramzan and about the possible eviction process in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhood in East Jerusalem.” Dozens of Arab families in the occupied East Jerusalem face eviction by the Israelis, which was one of the triggers of Arab protests in the last week of Ramzan. India has also urged both sides to “refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhood.” Here, it is Israel which is trying to unilaterally change the status quo by moving to evict the Palestinian families, and deploying troops to the Al-Aqsa compound. India called for “the historic status quo at the holy places of Jerusalem, including Haram esh-Sharif/Temple Mount must be respected”. So, without mentioning any country, India has, in effect, called for the eviction process to be stopped and status quo ante to be restored at the Al Aqsa compound. Evolving position While refusing to toe the Israeli line on the conflict, India’s comments also point to its evolving position on the larger Israel-Palestine issue. “It’s a very carefully drafted statement. For example, it’s called for the status quo relating to East Jerusalem. But the crucial point that’s missing is that East Jerusalem should be the capital [of a future Palestinian state]. Earlier, this used to be the mantra from India regarding the two-state solution. This portion is now taken out. Therefore, we are simply giving lip service to the two-state solution without mentioning that East Jerusalem is the core part of that two-state solution,” said Talmiz Ahmad, a former diplomat who was India’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. Until 2017, India’s position was that it supported “the Palestinian cause and called for a negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel”. Then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stated this position in November 2013. So did then President Pranab Mukherjee, in October 2015. India dropped the references to East Jerusalem and the borders in 2017 when Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas visited Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said back then, “[W]e hope to see the realisation of a sovereign, independent, united and viable Palestine, coexisting peacefully with Israel. I have reaffirmed our position on this to President Abbas during our conversation today.” In 2018, when Mr. Modi visited Ramallah, he reaffirmed the same position, with no direct reference to the borders or Jerusalem. Ambassador Tirumurti stated this line while calling for a “just” solution, without giving specifics on what that solution should be. P.R. Kumaraswamy, professor of international studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, said it is “the sensible way of saying what is acceptable to both parties”. “It [the statement] is vague enough while at the same time firmly putting the two-state solution on the table. That’s what the point is — whether there is a reference to Jerusalem, whether it is [the] 1967 [border], these are all minor issues. The real issue is this: a two-state solution, coexisting side by side. What are the contours of the boundaries will be discussed, settled and recognised by the parties,” he said. Two narratives Prof. Kumaraswamy, however, added that there are a couple of important nuances in India’s statement. “First, the references to Haram esh-Sharif come twice. And it says, Haram esh-Sharif/Temple Mount. This is a very subtle way of saying that this is not a Palestinian narrative. The Palestinian narrative is that it is Haram esh-Sherif—that means exclusive Islamic control and ownership. By saying Temple Mount together with Sharam esh-Sherif, it says... the real issue is it is Jewish as well as Islamic. Second, you openly condemn the rockets, but no references to Israeli reaction.” Ambassador Ahmad also noted the different approaches India took to the rocket firing and Israeli strikes. “There is a specific condemnation on the rocket fire from Gaza, but a similar condemnation is not specifically directed at the Israeli side. And then, there is this loose talk on casualties, but fails to mention the disproportionate use of force by Israel. I think there is a lot of symbolism here.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-indias-palestine-policy-evolving/article34582793.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||China steps up vaccinations to 14 million in a day||China’s health authority said the country had administered more than 400 million doses of vaccines as of Sunday amid a renewed push to guard against the resurgence of COVID-19 cases after the reporting of several local clusters in recent days. A record 14 million doses were administered on a single day on Sunday, the National Health Commission said. This follows a stepped up vaccination campaign that saw the last 100 million doses administered in just nine days, down from 17 days for doses to rise from 200 million to 300 million and 26 days from 100 million to 200 million. China’s vaccination campaign was slow to take off, attributed by experts to a combination of hesitancy and a broader lack of urgency because of the low number of COVID-19 cases in China, which has managed to suppress outbreaks since last summer after months-long lockdown and continued restrictions on international travel that remain in place. Officials sacked Five cases were reported on Monday, including three in northeastern Liaoning and two in Anhui province, which reported 14 cases earlier. The Anhui cases prompted a rush for vaccines in the province, with images on Chinese social media showing long queues braving heavy rains. Five officials from the two provinces were sacked after the emergence of cases, believed to be tied to a port city, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday. Estimates for the efficacy rates of China’s vaccines have ranged between 60% and 80% in phase three trials conducted in several countries, but the vaccines have been found to prevent severe cases of COVID-19. The newspaper reported Chinese authorities had approved a sixth vaccine for emergency use last week as it continues a stepped up campaign with plans to inoculate half the population by the middle of the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-steps-up-vaccinations-to-14-million-in-a-day/article34582797.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Iran to develop Farzad B gas field domestically, dumps India||Iran on Monday gave the Farzad B gas field to Petropars, a domestic gas producer. This is a setback for India’s energy ties with Iran as ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) had discovered the gas field in 2000 and has been part of the ongoing cooperation on that front. According to Iran's news agency Shana, the deal was signed in an event on Monday which was presided over by Iran's Minister of Petroleum Bijan Zanganeh. The deal was signed between Mohammed Meshkinfam, CEO of Pars Oil and Gas Company, on behalf of the National Iranian Oil Company, and Hamid Reza Masoudi, CEO of Petropars Group. The Ministry of External Affairs has not yet commented on the development but OVL had discovered the Farzad B gas field in the Farsi region, which is located between the Iranian and Saudi territories. Monday’s deal in Iran comes despite India’s long-standing cooperation regarding the gas field and is indicative of the impact of the U.S. sanctions on India-Iran energy cooperation, which had been drastically reduced during the Donald Trump administration in the U.S. Last year, Mr. Zanganeh had indicated that foreign talks on the Farzad B block had become difficult because of the sanctions. Monday’s deal will pave the way for daily production of 28 million cu m of gas over five years, reported Shana .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-to-develop-farzad-b-gas-field-domestically-dumps-india/article34582794.ece
18 May 2021||Kabul,||Afghans who helped the U.S. now fear being left behind||He served as an interpreter alongside U.S. soldiers on hundreds of patrols and dozens of firefights in eastern Afghanistan, earning a glowing letter of recommendation from an American platoon commander and a medal of commendation. Still, Ayazudin Hilal was turned down when he applied for one of the scarce special visas that would allow him to relocate to the U.S. with his family. Now, as American and NATO forces prepare to leave the country, he and thousands of others who aided the war effort fear they will be left stranded, facing the prospect of Taliban reprisals. “We are not safe,” the 41-year-old father of six said of Afghan civilians who worked for the U.S. or NATO. “The Taliban is calling us and telling us, ’Your stepbrother is leaving the country soon, and we will kill all of you guys.’” The fate of interpreters after the troop withdrawal is one of the looming uncertainties surrounding the pullout, including a possible resurgence of terrorist threats and a reversal of fragile gains for women if chaos, whether from competing Kabul-based warlords or the Taliban, follows the end of America’s military engagement. Interpreters and other civilians who worked for the U.S. or NATO can get what is known as a special immigrant visa under a programme created in 2009 . Both programmes have been dogged by complaints about a lengthy and complicated application process for security screening that grew more cumbersome with pandemic safety measures. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that the U.S. is committed to helping interpreters and other civilians who aided the war effort, often at great personal risk. The Biden administration is reviewing the visas programmes, examining the delays and the ability of applicants to challenge a rejection. At least 300 interpreters have been killed in Afghanistan since 2016, and the Taliban have made it clear they will continue to be targeted, said Matt Zeller, a co-founder of No One Left Behind, an organisation that advocates on behalf of the interpreters. He also served in Afghanistan as a U.S. Army officer. “The Taliban considers them to be literally enemies of Islam,” said Mr. Zeller, now a fellow at the Truman National Security Project. “There’s no mercy for them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghans-who-helped-the-us-now-fear-being-left-behind/article34582796.ece

He said he welcomed efforts by the UN — where the U.S. has so far blocked a proposed Security Council statement on the fighting — and other nations working for a ceasefire. “Any diplomatic initiative that advances that prospect is something that we’ll support... But ultimately it is up to the parties to make clear that they want to pursue a ceasefire,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-signals-us-will-not-push-for-a-ceasefire/article34582798.ece

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Counting the COVID toll in India||Last year, in these columns, I wrote about the many challenges in estimating deaths due to COVID-19 in India (https://bit.ly/2Rs4hAZ). While the challenges remain, the need for estimating COVID-19 deaths globally and in India to understand the magnitude of the pandemic is still there. Since direct counting of COVID-deaths is problematic, the approach most commonly used is the “excess” death approach which attributes all deaths beyond what is considered “normal” for that area and time to COVID-19. It includes deaths directly caused by COVID-19 as well as deaths indirectly caused due to the impact on access to care for other diseases during the pandemic and the lockdown. Global estimates released While official or unofficial estimates are available for some countries, two estimates have been released globally. Based on the World Mortality Dataset — the largest international dataset of all-cause mortality encompassing 89 countries — researchers estimated excess mortality and reported that it exceeded the number of reported COVID-19 deaths in these countries by over 1.6 times. It also said that this ratio is likely to be conservative as undercounting is likely to be much higher in countries which are not part of this dataset (https://bit.ly/3eQ3Bye). The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a global leader in this area, recently released its estimates that put the global toll of COVID-19 deaths by May 3, 2021 at 6.93 million, a figure that is more than two times higher than the reported number of deaths of 3.24 million. India accounted for about 10% of them at 6,54,395 (only second to the United States with an estimated 0.9 million) which is about three times higher than the reported official figure (https://bit.ly/3omaKtg). The lower number of reported deaths does not imply undercounting, deliberate or otherwise. Even if there had been no underreporting of COVID deaths in a country, this ratio is likely to be above one as excess deaths include not only those that are directly caused by COVID-19 and likely to be reported but also those where deaths occurred due to other diseases, either due to a lack of care or as a consequence of COVID-19. It is very difficult to tease out these proportions. We might have a better sense if we look at cause-specific deaths. But that kind of data is still more difficult to get. WHO classification The World Health Organization classifies countries into three categories based on their data availability for COVID-19 excess death estimation. First are those countries that have good data available and excess death estimation is possible (most countries in the above mortality dataset). Second is the group of countries whose data, though not good, is acceptable for use through some process of harmonisation or adjustment for incompleteness leaving the third category of countries where the data on deaths are not available or usable, forcing the adoption of an indirect approach of using data from other countries or a multivariate approach using covariates to arrive at these estimates. India and China, which together constitute a third of the world population, are currently in category three, and unless we manage to provide some source of usable data, India will have to be content with an estimate generated by an external agency using an indirect approach. Data for India So, what do we know about the COVID-19 mortality in India? Data from Kerala, which is among the States with a very good vital registration system, showed that there has been a decline in deaths in 2020 as compared to previous years (https://bit.ly/3eTBaj3). While it will need a closer look, under-registration of all deaths due to the pandemic is a possibility. Data released by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, shows 22% excess deaths during 2020 in Mumbai region (https://bit.ly/3hwwHEx). An analysis of data from a panel of 2,32,000 households maintained by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) found that deaths from all causes between May and August 2020 numbered almost twice as many as compared with the same period in past years (https://bit.ly/3wepv4m). These are crude estimates based on the number of extra deaths reported as compared to previous years. Estimation of excess deaths needs a more sophisticated statistical approach which first defines a baseline, before estimating excess. The simplest approach for defining a baseline would be estimation of mean and standard error based on data for the last five years to provide a plausible range for a baseline. We could then see whether the registered deaths are beyond that range to estimate “excess” deaths. There are other statistical approaches which use different data distribution assumptions to define a baseline. This analysis should be done by age and sex on a weekly or monthly basis and correlated to the peaks of the epidemic. My team analysed data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) of district Faridabad in Haryana, which has been reporting 100% registration of deaths in the past few years. We found that 7% higher deaths have been reported in 2020 as compared to 2016-19, with a 17% increase in deaths above 60 years. By applying well-accepted statistical techniques, we found that the period of excess deaths correlated with the pandemic peaks in the districts. Our range of estimates for excess deaths by different approaches resulted in a ratio of reported to excess death estimate to be between 1.8 to 4. This is not very different from that reported by the IHME, though its ratio included part of the second wave. This estimate should be read in the context that 80% of the population for Faridabad is urban and the serological survey in October 2020 showed a 31% seropositivity. It is not appropriate to extrapolate these estimates to India as even within India, there are enormous differences in the severity and timing of the epidemic and its health system capacity. Thus, combining data at higher levels is likely to lead to errors in estimation. A district-wise estimation is our best bet to arrive at a national estimate. An assessment of the quality of CRS data should enable us to identify districts with an acceptable quality of registration and generate estimates for them. For districts which lack an acceptable quality of registration, we could use alternative approaches. We are seeking access to the CRS dataset from the authorities and are hopeful of being able to generate national estimates in the next few months. A continuing process Our experience with an estimation of deaths in past influenza pandemics shows that different agencies come up with different estimates which leads to confusion among policy makers and the public. These are both due to data limitations and differences in statistical approaches. The long-term way out for countries is to address the data limitations while academics work on refining their approaches. There will be more estimates of COVID deaths in the near future and the numbers will keep changing till some sort of a consensus emerges. However, putting up a number which is contested and debated is still good as it propels people to improve that estimate. The second wave has been deadlier, and undercounting is more likely to have occurred as the pandemic has spread to rural areas, and when access to testing has been adversely affected and many deaths are occurring outside hospitals. Refining our approaches using the first wave in 2020 would enable a much better estimation of the deaths in subsequent waves.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Prioritising the right to life||The majority of India’s working population is today reeling from the impact of multiple crises: a health emergency more ferocious than any in independent India; massive job losses and dramatic declines in incomes from work; and significantly increased mass hunger and worsening nutrition. Many failures The Supreme Court on May 13 directed the Centre and the State governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide free rations without insisting on ID proof to all migrant workers and to run kitchens providing free meals twice a day. The verdict was significant as this was the first time since the national lockdown last March that the apex court acknowledged a hunger crisis in the country that needed urgent state action. But it fell short of being path-breaking for three reasons: it did not extend the facility to the country as a whole; it did not extend the facility to cover cash payments by the state besides meals and ration; and it made the facility a state largesse rather than a right. Had it recognised a universal right to livelihood as the basis for its verdict, deriving from the right to life, all three lacunae would have been overcome. The most brazen violation of the right to life by the state at present is its vaccine policy. Being vaccinated against COVID-19 is essential for defending one’s right to life; and since the state must respect everyone’s right to life, it must make the vaccine equally available to all irrespective of the recipient’s capacity to pay. This can be accomplished only if vaccination is free. In many other countries, including the most privatised medical systems like the U.S., vaccines are being distributed free to all the people. India is making people (aged 18-45 years) pay to be administered these vaccines in private clinics — an obscene and counterproductive strategy to deal with a pandemic. This is the outcome of many grave failures of the Indian government: it did not ensure adequate production through compulsory licensing of more producers; it did not order enough vaccines; it reneged on its responsibility to provide these vaccines to State governments; it introduced differential pricing, forcing State governments to compete with each other and with private clinics to buy vaccines; and it allowed price gouging by Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India. The lack of consideration for lives is matched by callousness about the loss of livelihood that has come about during the second wave. At least 90% of workers are informal, with no legal or social protection, denied adequate compensation over the past year of lockdowns, restrictions and economic distress. But there is hardly any public outcry about the plight of the nearly one billion people whose lives depend on informal activities, and policymakers, especially at the national level, have completely abandoned them. The consequences of inaction are going to be dire and long-lasting, not just for people experiencing untold suffering, but for the country and the future economic trajectory. A recent study called ‘Hunger Watch’ by a large collective of social groups found that even two months after the lockdown was lifted last year, two-third families reported eating less than they did before the lockdown, and a reduction in healthy food. For a quarter of the families surveyed, incomes had fallen by half. It also found that hunger was higher in urban India compared to rural. The recent knee-jerk lockdowns will stifle the attempts for revival. A significant fiscal package Even as the country confronts its greatest humanitarian crisis in half a century, India is one of the few countries in the world that has not come up with a significant fiscal package to counter the health and economic effects of the pandemic. It has remained fiscally conservative, and actual Central government spending over April 2020 to February 2021 shows a rise in non-interest expenditure only by 2.1% of GDP. This explains why India’s economy has been performing so poorly compared to other countries that were more battered by the first wave of the pandemic, since most of them had significantly larger fiscal packages that were also directed towards providing income support to people. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks of government spending on the backlog of infrastructure projects as the means for a recovery. If instead she relied on cash transfers to the millions of the labouring poor, it would have shielded them from slipping deeper into hunger and joblessness and also spurred growth, because all of this would be spent for simple, domestically produced goods. Therefore, the ‘multiplier’ effects of this public expenditure would have been much higher than if spent on infrastructure projects. Free rations and meals, as mandated by the Supreme Court, though beneficial, have very little expansionary effect on the economy, since the bulk of the commodities required come from decumulation of existing stocks of foodgrains. Thus, both the need to provide relief and the imperative to revive the economy demand that a monthly cash transfer, of about Rs. 7,000 per family (the rough equivalent of minimum wages), be made to people, over and above the provision of free meals and rations. What the state needs to do urgently is to take a range of measures that prioritise the right to life, which also remains the surest way of initiating assured (and equitable) economic recovery today. Among them are enabling expanded production and central procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, and distribution to States for free immunisation to all; universal access to free foodgrains of 5 kg per month to all those who require it for the next six months; cash transfers of Rs. 7,000 per household for at least three months to those without regular formal employment; increased resources to the Integrated Child Development Services to enable revival and expansion of their programmes; making the MGNREGS purely demand-driven, with no ceilings on the number of days or the number of beneficiaries per household; and covering urban India with a parallel scheme that would also cater to the educated unemployed. Where, it would be asked, are the resources? In an economy with substantial unemployment, unutilised capacity and unused foodgrain stocks (about 80 million tonnes at present), resource mobilisation does not require curtailing anyone else’s consumption. Even enlarging the fiscal deficit would cause no harm, except that it would gratuitously widen wealth inequalities and frighten globally mobile finance capital. To prevent both, a simple measure would be to introduce wealth taxation (though larger profit taxation will also suffice). These measures together would not cost more than an additional 3.5% of GDP, of which about 1% would flow back as extra tax revenue to Central and State governments, requiring 2.5% of GDP as fresh additional tax revenue. A 1.5% wealth tax levied on only the top 1% of households will be adequate to raise this amount. These figures are only illustrative. But when U.S. President Joe Biden and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen are considering more radical measures, India should not shy away from measures that give substance and meaning to the term ‘right to life’ and the pledges of equality and fraternity in the Constitution.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The Biden push-button to West Asia’s diplomatic resets||Major West Asian nations have recently embarked on new diplomatic engagements with erstwhile rivals that could in time overturn existing regional alignments and possibly end ongoing conflicts that have wreaked havoc in several states. The most dramatic interactions have been between senior Saudi and Iranian officials. After their meeting on April 9, the first since diplomatic ties were broken in January 2016, there have been other interactions, with technical committees set up to look at specific topics. Again, since early this year, following the removal of the diplomatic and economic blockade on Qatar that was imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, Doha has made efforts to mend ties with both Saudi Arabia and Egypt, in tandem with similar initiatives of its doctrinal and political ally, Turkey. On May 5, Turkey and Egypt had their first diplomatic meeting in Cairo after they had broken diplomatic ties in 2013, when Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was overthrown in a military coup. The two countries, on opposite sides on almost all regional issues, are now exploring how to address their differences. The Biden challenge The driving force behind these unprecedented engagements is the advent of the Biden administration at the helm of politics in the United States. Within his first 100 days in office, Mr. Biden has signalled a fresh U.S. approach to West Asian affairs. He has taken a tough line on Saudi Arabia, indicating a closer scrutiny of its human rights record and strong opposition to the war in Yemen. Egypt too has concerns on the human rights issue, while seeking regional support for its differences with Ethiopia. It now seems the U.S. could re-enter the nuclear agreement, but Iran has concerns about the limitations to be imposed on its regional role. Turkey could also experience fresh winds from Washington. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has built close ties with Russia, while threatening U.S. allies in Syria, the Kurds, with military force. Mr. Biden is expected to be less accommodative; his recent recognition of the Armenian “genocide” is already a fresh rebuke. Besides concerns in West Asian capitals about a new U.S. approach to each of them, the broader message from Washington is that the U.S. is now likely to be less engaged with the region’s quarrels. Mr. Biden seems to be reiterating earlier messages from his predecessors Barack Obama and Donald Trump that regional states should be responsible for regional security. These signals of new U.S. policies have occurred even as the novel coronavirus pandemic is devastating West Asia. Besides the widespread infections and deaths, the viral epidemic has severely damaged regional economies, while oil prices remain in the doldrums, creating uncertainties for the producer states. Finally, one major factor that is encouraging these unprecedented interactions among rivals is the recognition that the ongoing regional conflicts, in Syria, Yemen and Libya, despite the massive death and destruction, have yielded no military outcome and now demand fresh diplomatic approaches. Recent engagements Following the first meetings in Baghdad, both Iran and Saudi Arabia have made efforts to improve the atmosphere. In a recent interview, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke of seeking a “good and special relationship” with Iran. The Iranian spokesman responded by referring to a “new phase of cooperation and tolerance”. The priority for the kingdom is to end the Yemen conflict: the lethal attacks from the precision missiles of the Houthis, said to have been provided by Iran, are a threat to national infrastructure and morale. The recent Houthi attack on oil-rich Marib is also a Saudi concern, while Iran would like the  blockaded Hodeidah port which is partially open, to be used to rush humanitarian aid to the beleaguered Houthis. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has supported the Saudi offer of a ceasefire in Yemen. Both countries also share concerns relating to the political impasse in Lebanon and the security of the waters of the Gulf and the Red Sea where a “shadow war” on oil and merchant vessels could escalate into a larger conflict. So far, both have paid a heavy financial price for their rivalry: Iran’s role in Syria costs its exchequer a few billion dollars every month, while Saudi Arabia has spent several hundred billion dollars in buying weaponry to sustain its partnership with the U.S. Turkey is also exhibiting diplomatic dexterity. Despite differences with Egypt over Libya, the East Mediterranean waters and Turkey’s affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey now sees Egypt as a valuable partner to promote peace in Libya and pursue their interests jointly in the East Mediterranean by challenging Greece, Israel and Cyprus. Turkey has also made overtures to Saudi Arabia. Besides accepting the Saudi court verdict on the Khashoggi murder case (https://bit.ly/3w5QwGS), Turkey has indicated it could work with the Saudis against the Houthis and facilitate the post-war political process through the Islamist Al-Islah party. Turkey has also offered the kingdom its advanced drones to be used against Houthi missiles. Qatar’s outreach to Egypt has been well received, since it appears to have moderated its ties with the Brotherhood, toned down anti-Egypt broadcasts on Al Jazeera television, and is a major potential investor in Egypt’s flagging economy. To promote regional peace, Qatar’s Foreign Minister has called for a structured dialogue of the Gulf countries with Iran, affirming its view that Iran is a major presence in the regional security scenario. Regional security These are very early days and all sides concerned have a long way to go in resolving their differences. Egypt remains uneasy about Turkey’s ties with the Brotherhood and its regional ambitions. Saudi Arabia has similar concerns about Turkey’s doctrinal affiliations and its relations with Iran. There are difficulties in reshaping Saudi-Iran relations as well. Iran may ease the pressure on the kingdom in Yemen and gradually yield ground in Iraq: the latter has already conveyed its desire to be free from all external influences. However, Syria will test their diplomatic skills as they explore how to accommodate their competing strategic interests in that devastated country. Still, this is truly a historic period for West Asian diplomacy: the major states are displaying an unprecedented self-confidence in pursuing initiatives without the heavy hand of western powers that have dominated regional affairs for at least a couple of centuries, and, in pursuit of their own interests, have nurtured deep animosities between many of them. This has left a pervasive sense of insecurity across West Asia and made the countries dependent on western alliances to ensure their interests. A role for India? Today, states in West Asia appear poised to negotiate their strategic interests without outside intrusion. But, given that regional contentions are inter-connected, third-party facilitators will be needed to promote mutual confidence and prepare the ground for a comprehensive regional security arrangement which will bring together regional and external states with a stake in West Asia security. This arrangement will have provisions for participating states to uphold regional peace and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in energy, economic and logistical connectivity areas. Given its close ties with all the regional states, India is well-placed to build an association of like-minded states — Japan, Russia, South Korea — to shape and pursue such an initiative for West Asian peace.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Walk the talk on TRIPS waiver||Member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are under an obligation to ensure that their domestic intellectual property rights (IPR) laws conform to the requirements of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. When the pandemic hit the globe, India and South Africa piloted the proposal to waive key provisions of the TRIPS agreement on COVID-19 vaccines, drugs, therapeutics, and related technologies. The core idea is that IPRs such as patents should not become barriers in scaling up production of medical products essential to combat COVID-19. The TRIPS waiver proposal, now backed by the U.S., is essential because it would give immunity to member countries from a legal challenge at the WTO if their domestic IPR laws suspend or do not enforce IP protection on COVID-19 medical products. Foot-dragging on compulsory licences It is uncertain when the TRIPS waiver would be adopted, or what conditions it would be subjected to. Meanwhile, nothing stops India from using the existing flexibilities under the Patents Act of 1970, such as compulsory licences, which are consistent with the TRIPS agreement, to increase the supply of COVID-19 medical products. While issuing compulsory licences for COVID-19 vaccines in the absence of technology transfer is easier said than done, they can be used to augment the supply of drugs and other therapeutics. For instance, Natco, an Indian pharmaceutical company, has requested a compulsory licence under Section 92 of the Patents Act for Baricitinib, a COVID-19 drug. Incyte Holdings Corporation owns the patent for Baricitinib with a licence to Eli Lilly, an American drug company. Likewise, there are demands that compulsory licences be issued for drugs such as Remdesivir to augment supply. Natco’s application demonstrates that the option of issuing compulsory licences is available to the government. However, despite the nudging by the judiciary and others, the government inexplicably hasn’t made use of compulsory licences in the pandemic. This is ironic because India has historically played a leading role in mainstreaming TRIPS flexibilities like the compulsory licence at the WTO. To make matters worse, the Central government, in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court a few days ago, suggests that issuance of compulsory licences will not be effective. Specifically, the affidavit states that the main constraint in boosting the production of drugs like Remdesivir is the unavailability of raw materials and essential inputs. If that is the real bottleneck, and not IPR-related legal hurdles, why is India pushing for a TRIPS waiver at the WTO? After all, the TRIPS waiver is about overcoming legal impediments, not about addressing supply-side bottlenecks. The affidavit further states, “it is presumptuous to assume that the patent holder will not agree to more voluntary licences”. Thus, the government believes that voluntary licences, not compulsory licences, are the way forward to address shortage of COVID-19 medical products. Interestingly, those who oppose the TRIPS waiver at the WTO advance the same argument. The first step in advocating for the removal of IPR-related impediments at the WTO is to make use of the existing lawful means, even if insufficient, to lift the obstacles that come in the way of manufacturing patented products domestically. Therefore, the government’s stand before the Supreme Court is not only contradictory with India’s position at the WTO but also severely undermines it. This would make the TRIPS waiver negotiations arduous. To make its TRIPS waiver stand convincing, the government needs to make aggressive use of Sections 92 and 100 of the Patents Act to license all patents necessary to make COVID-19 medical products, without waiting for a private party to apply for a licence. An assertive posture on compulsory licences would also have the advantage of forcing several pharmaceutical companies to offer licences voluntarily. Licensing Covaxin India’s development of Covaxin is a spectacular scientific achievement. Given the involvement of taxpayers’ money in the development of Covaxin, the government has a stake in its IPR. Thus, the government should not only transfer Covaxin’s technology to domestic pharmaceutical companies, to boost national supplies, but also offer it to foreign corporations. By unlocking its vaccine technical know-how to the world, India would demonstrate its resolve to walk the talk on the TRIPS waiver. Licensing Covaxin widely would enable India to live up to its reputation of being the ‘pharmacy of the world’ and also put pressure on developed countries to transfer their vaccine technology to developing countries. India must take a consistent stand on IPRs on COVID-19 medical products internationally and domestically.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||No learning from the Spanish flu||In the beginning of COVID-19 last year, thousands of people around the world shared an image on social media depicting the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic, commonly known as the Spanish flu. The image had the headline, ‘Humanity should never allow a repeat of the same mistake made in 1918, in the time of COVID-19’. The image read, “The most severe pandemic in history was the Spanish Flu of 1918. It lasted for 2 years, in 3 waves, with 500 million people infected and 50 million deaths. Most of the fatalities happened in the 2nd wave. The people felt so bad about the quarantine and social distancing measures that when they were first lifted, the people rejoiced in the streets with abandon. In the coming weeks, the 2nd wave occurred, with tens of millions dead.” This post contained a mix of accurate and inaccurate information. The estimates are accurate and the second wave was indeed the most deadly. However, according to James Harris, a historian at Ohio State University, part of the reason why the flu spread like wildfire causing a second wave was because officials were unwilling to impose restrictions during wartime despite the existence of a new mutated strain. Lessons from the past This shows that we haven’t been able to learn from history to prevent millions of infections and deaths worldwide. One would believe that knowledge makes one wiser. But in reality, knowledge doesn’t change behaviour. Knowing about the Spanish flu is very different from having to live through a similar pandemic. Knowing about masks being protective doesn’t make people wear them. Knowing about social distancing doesn’t make people practise it. In most countries, people got tired of lockdowns, wearing masks, staying at home and not socialising last year. Human beings are social animals after all. Social ostracisation has been shown to cause pain in the brain similar to putting up with physical pain. So, as the number of cases began to fall by the end of the first COVID-19 wave, governments and people around the world started to let their guard down. Amongst many businesses that were allowed to resume, for example, restaurants which were suspected to be one of the major centres for the spread of COVID-19 were given permission to open. Signs outside their establishments read ‘No entry without mask’, but once inside, visitors could remove their masks even while not eating. They talked, laughed, sneezed and coughed in indoor non-ventilated spaces. These visitors would have known about the dangers of this behaviour, some of them may have read about the Spanish flu. But awareness and action often lie at opposing ends. Lifting restrictions Each one of us has to contribute to break the chain of COVID-19 infections. However, the ultimate responsibility of managing the pandemic cannot lie with the masses in today’s modern societies; it is the job of governments. But governments of most countries failed to learn from the Spanish flu because they failed to understand and predict human behaviour. In India, the government allowed election rallies and religious gatherings. It hesitated in imposing a lockdown despite the emergence of new strains of the virus. Leaders were often seen addressing crowds and conducting meetings without masks. Every politician wants to win over people and give them what they want (in this case, freedom from lockdowns). But declaring victory prematurely gave rise to policies that caused the second wave. India had the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of other countries which opened up too soon after the first wave. But it didn’t. This has led to the huge spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Perhaps it was overconfidence in the government’s ability to manage the pandemic or an underestimation of the ability of COVID-19 to cause infections and deaths in the second wave or both that led to the surge in infections. While vaccines weren’t available during the Spanish flu, we have the benefit of curbing COVID-19 by vaccinating people now.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Unwarranted arrest||The arrest of K. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju, an MP from Andhra Pradesh, on the grave charge of sedition, is yet another instance of the misuse of the provision relating to exciting “disaffection” against the government. The police in different States have been invoking sedition, an offence defined in Section 124A IPC, against critics of the establishment and prominent dissenters. It is not surprising that Mr. Raju, a vocal detractor of A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, is sought to be prosecuted. However, his arrest is unwarranted, considering that he is being accused of only speech-based offences relating to his diatribe against his party leader and CM. It has predictably, and not without justification, invited charges of political vendetta. Even if one were to accept at face value the prosecution’s claim that his speeches stoked hatred against communities — he had referred to alleged rampant conversion activities in the State — and attracted prosecution under Section 153-A or Section 505, was his arrest necessary? These offences attract a prison term of only three years and, under the Arnesh Kumar ruling (2014) of the Supreme Court, there is no need to arrest a person for an offence that invites a prison term of seven years and less. Further, even sedition, which allows a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, also prescribes an alternative jail term of three years. Mr. Raju has alleged ill-treatment while in CID custody. The Supreme Court has directed that he be examined at the Army hospital in Secunderabad in neighbouring Telangana. His bail petition is likely to be taken up later this week. It is unedifying to note that the CID has also named in the FIR, two television channels to which he gave interviews. While the legal process will take its course, it is once again time for a reflection on the need and relevance of the offence of sedition, a colonial-era provision used to imprison people for political writings in support of Indian independence, to remain on the statute book. That State governments and various police departments are known for the casual resort to prosecution under this section is a poor reflection of the understanding of the law among civil servants everywhere. It is now fairly well known that the section is attracted only if there is an imminent threat to public order or there is actual incitement to violence — ingredients that are invariably absent in most cases. In addition, it remains vaguely and too broadly defined (the term ‘disaffection’ is said to include ‘disloyalty’ and ‘feelings of enmity’), warranting a total reconsideration. Recently, the Supreme Court decided to revisit the constitutionality of this section. While a judicial verdict will be welcome, it would be even more protective of free speech if the Centre abolished the provision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/unwarranted-arrest/article34582776.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Avoiding breakdown||After a gap of over seven months, the GST Council will now meet on May 28, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced last Saturday. That the Council, expected to meet every quarter, has taken possibly the longest pause in its functioning does not set a good precedent. Given the acrimony that transpired in its last few meetings over how the States’ GST compensation dues for the pandemic-induced lockdown-dented 2020-21 were to be met, the long break makes Centre-State equations even more awkward. States later reluctantly agreed to the Centre’s proposal to raise Rs. 1.1 lakh crore of GST recompense dues through special market borrowings, after the Finance Ministry backed off from insisting that States raise these loans directly. In the intervening period, the economy almost surged back to normalcy before being hobbled again by the second wave of infections. And unlike the first wave, there is a greater onus on the States now to figure out everything from what mobility restrictions to put in place, to vaccination sequencing, and the bigger headache of sourcing enough vaccines from within or outside India. A Council meeting before or after the Union Budget could have helped soothe States’ frayed nerves. Having ignored the call by several States for a Council meet all these months, citing the Assembly polls, the Centre will now also have to contend with a slight change in equations. The elan of re-elected State governments apart, a large State such as Tamil Nadu can no longer be expected to toe the Centre’s line. There is much big ticket pending work on the Council’s plate, but from the States’ perspective, it would be necessary to get clarity on the modalities for receiving the Rs. 63,000 crore GST compensation still due to them, along with this year’s dues, in a timely manner. Cash flow visibility would help them gear up better, be it for vaccines or subsequent COVID-19 waves. Even more pressing is the demand to drop GST on material to battle the pandemic, including the 12% tax on oxygen concentrators, 5% on vaccines, and on relief supplies from abroad. Ms. Sitharaman responded with a tweet storm to a missive on the issue from the West Bengal CM to the PM. This suggests an irascible approach on an issue that more States are raising. Tax experts believe solutions are possible to reduce the GST burden. The Centre had dropped the GST on sanitary napkins after strongly defending the tax, with one stated worry being cheap imports. In the case of vaccines and critical supplies, the more the imports, the merrier it is now. That the GST revenue will be shared with the States may be factually correct, but surely, neither the States nor the Centre are eyeing COVID-19 expenses as a fat source of revenue. An accommodative approach from the Centre could ensure India’s fiscal federalism framework does not suffer an irretrievable breakdown at this calamitous juncture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/avoiding-breakdown/article34582777.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Cochin reform rules||The Diwan of Cochin has published the draft rules for the State Legislative Council and the people of the State do not appear to be much delighted over them. After the recent riots at Trichur the Diwan has fallen so heavily in prestige and public estimation that popular judgment on anything of his doing must naturally begin with prejudice. While therefore the public of the State would tend to be hypercritical, the Diwan it will be felt, had a splendid opportunity in the drafting of the rules, not merely for recovering lost position but even for inspiring fresh confidence. Mr. Vijiaraghavachariar has apparently not troubled himself about these points of view and has presented Cochinites with a set of rules which complete the Morleyan hesitancy of the proclamation regarding the Legislative Council. For the most part, the rules read like echoes of what we are familiar with in these parts, but there is often an attempt at originality and ample room is left for reasonable dissatisfaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cochin-reform-rules/article34582784.ece
18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||3.5 lakh refugees in Coochbehar||Coochbehar, May 17: About 3.5 lakh evacuees from Bangla Desh are officially reported to have crossed into the Coochbehar district of West Bengal till Saturday. Of them about 1.5 lakhs have been accommodated in 85 Government camps. The rest are either putting up with relatives and friends or living in the open air. Meanwhile, a PTI correspondent on a tour from Jalpaiguri to Haldibari found yesterday streams of evacuees anxiously waiting on the roadside and in open spaces to be taken to places of safety. Several hundreds were still trekking to the Indian territory through Haldibari, Deaganj, and South Berubari borders. The Union Minister for Industrial Development, Mr. Moinul Haq Choudhry, said in Lucknow yesterday that either the Pakistan Government or the countries which were responsible for arming it should bear the bill for the rehabilitation of the East Bengal refugees in India. The Indian Government, he added, apart from asking for compensation for their rehabilitation would also ask the Pakistan Government to take them back. Mr. Choudhry said about 30 per cent of the refugees from East Bengal were Muslims while ten per cent belonged to other religions and the rest were Hindus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/35-lakh-refugees-in-coochbehar/article34582785.ece
18 May 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Demand takes big hit on second wave’||As the second wave of COVID-19 overwhelmed India and the world, the real economy indicators moderated through April-May 2021, senior officials of the Reserve Bank of India wrote in the RBI’s monthly bulletin. “The biggest toll of the second wave is in terms of a demand shock — loss of mobility, discretionary spending and employment, besides inventory accumulation” while the aggregate supply was less impacted, they wrote. “The resurgence of COVID-19 has dented but not debilitated economic activity in the first half of Q1... Although extremely tentative at this stage, the central tendency of available diagnosis is that the loss of momentum is not as severe as at this time a year ago,” they added. In an article on ‘State of the Economy’, the officials including Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra observed that agriculture remained robust at this critical time and industrial production surged after a two-month contraction on the tailwinds of a large favourable base effect. The impact of the new infections appeared to be U-shaped, they posited. ‘Weathering the storm’ “Each shoulder of the U represents sectors that are weathering the storm — agriculture at one end and IT on the other. On the slopes of the U are organised and automated manufacturing on one side and on the other, services that can be delivered remotely and do not require producers and consumers to move. These activities continue to function under pandemic protocols,” they wrote. In the well of the U were the most vulnerable — blue collar groups that had to risk exposure for a living and for the rest of society to survive; doctors and healthcare workers; law and order; municipal personnel; individuals eking out daily livelihoods; small businesses, organised and unorganised — and they warranted priority in policy interventions, the officials observed. “It is in this direction that the Reserve Bank, re-armed and re-loaded, has stepped out... The road ahead is fraught with danger, but India’s destiny lies not in the second wave, but in life beyond,” they added. NBFCs hit hard In another article on the performance of NBFCs during the pandemic, the bank’s officials wrote that as the pandemic disrupted economic activity significantly, Non-Banking Financial Companies were hit hard. During Q2 and Q3 of FY21, the consolidated balance sheet of NBFCs grew at a slower pace. “However, NBFCs were able to continue credit intermediation, albeit at a lower rate, reflecting the resilience of the sector. Among sectors NBFCs lend to, industrial sector, particularly micro and small and large industries, were the hardest hit by the pandemic as they posted decline in credit growth,” the article’s authors added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/demand-takes-big-hit-on-second-wave/article34582760.ece
18 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Sichuan resumes cargo flights, brings relief to pharma firms||Indian pharmaceutical industry’s fears of disruption in raw material supplies from China seem to have subsided with Sichuan Airlines resuming cargo services to India. “Goods are coming from China, even other airlines are also operating,” said Ashok Kumar Madan, executive director, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association. “We are not foreseeing any issues pertaining to shortage [of raw materials].” Had the suspension of services continued for a longer time, it would have been a cause for concern. Sichuan Airlines resumed flights on May 9, he said. Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil) director general Ravi Udaya Bhaskar, who had sought the intervention of the Indian embassy in Beijing when the Chinese air carrier decided to suspend cargo services to India for a fortnight, said since resumption, the members had not flagged any issue. There have been no complaints on raw material availability. Some firms had even operated chartered flights to ensure continuity, he said. The Department of Pharmaceuticals had earlier informed Pharmexcil and others that the airlines would restart services from Chengdu to Bengaluru on May 9 and to Chennai on May 12. It brought relief to the industry since it sourced 60-70% of drug intermediates, key starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients from China. While availability is not an issue, rise in the prices of raw material is a cause for concern, said Mr. Madan. He said since February, API prices as well cost of transportation had shot up. The ripple effect continued to be felt, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sichuan-resumes-cargo-flights-brings-relief-to-pharma-firms/article34582764.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||WPI inflation hits high of 10.5%||Inflation as measured by the Wholesale Price Index quickened to a record high of 10.5% in April, from 7.4% in March and 4.8% recorded in February, thanks to a base effect from last April which recorded a negative inflation of 1.57%, and a surge in fuel, food and manufactured goods’ prices. Wholesale inflation in fuel and power more than doubled to 20.94% in April 2021 from 10.25% in March 2021, while manufactured goods recorded inflation of 9%, prompting industry to urge the government to rationalise fuel prices and try to rein in high commodity prices. Food prices also hardened to record 7.6% inflation in April from 3.6% in February and 5.3% in March. Retail inflation for April had moderated to a three-month low of 4.29% from over 5.5% in March, helped by cooling food prices, but economists had expected the WPI to harden during the month. The high inflation in fuel and power is significantly raising input costs of Indian industry, said PHDCCI president Sanjay Aggarwal. “We urge the government to consider petroleum products in the ambit of GST to rationalise the prices and to contain rising inflation,” he said. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said the headline WPI inflation surge was sharper than expected and could rise further to 13%-13.5% in May before winding down. However, core WPI inflation may continue to rise over the next three months to a peak of about 10.5% from 8.4% in April. “The likely trajectory of WPI inflation supports our view that there is no space for rate cuts to support the faltering growth momentum, even as we expect the monetary stance to remain accommodative,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wpi-inflation-hits-high-of-105/article34582766.ece

He added that AI would deal with the suit legally when it receives a court notice, noting that the Department of Revenue was overseeing the Cairn case. Lawsuit in U.S. Cairn has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against AI to enforce the $1.2-billion arbitration award it won against the Indian government in a long-standing tax dispute. After inviting preliminary bids for 100% stake sale in AI, the government has moved to the financial-bid stage. The Tata Group is among the ‘multiple’ entities that had submitted preliminary bids for the debt-ridden carrier’s privatisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-sees-no-impact-on-ai-sale-from-cairn-suit/article34582757.ece
18 May 2021||MUMBAI,||SEBI invites comments on gold exchange||The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has floated a consultation paper on the proposed framework for Gold Exchange in India. The proposal was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her FY22 Budget speech. SEBI, entrusted with the task of regulating the proposed exchange, including for vaulting, assaying and gold quality and delivery standards, said the existing stock exchanges may deal in ‘electronic gold receipt’ (EGR) through a separate segment. The markets regulator has also suggested a new exchange exclusively for EGR that would have advantages such as better liquidity and single-price reference. As far as transactions are concerned, SEBI working groups have suggested that an entire transaction be divided into three tranches. It has been proposed that the vault manager should have a net worth of Rs. 50 crore and will be required to furnish security deposits.

18 May 2021||ROME,||Nadal wins record-extending 10th title||After warming up for the French Open in style by beating World No. 1 Novak Djokovic 7-5, 1-6, 6-3 in the Italian Open final on Sunday, Rafael Nadal said he is heading to Roland Garros with confidence and a clear mind in search of a 21st Grand Slam title. Nadal, 34, who claimed a record-extending 10th ATP Masters 1000 title in Rome, felt his game had improved through the week and would rest for a couple of days back home before heading to Paris for his title defence. “I think I can work in a couple of things that I can do a little bit better or I can keep confirming that I am on the way,” he told reporters on Sunday, after his 57th showdown with Djokovic ended in 2 hours, 49 minutes. The two have won 15 of the last 17 Rome titles between them but Nadal leads their head-to-head in finals in the Italian capital 4-2. Victory also Nadal equal Djokovic’s tally of 36 ATP Masters 1000 trophies. “I think I have been improving this week, but I need to keep going with that improvement, because when you improve and you’re able to do it every day for longer time, then you feel more confident and more safe. “So I just need to keep going. I know what I need to work (on) for the next couple of weeks, and I (am) going to do it.” “I really wanted this 10th here in Rome. It was one of the first important titles that I won in my career,” Nadal said. “After achieving 10 in Roland Garros, 10 in Monte-Carlo, 10 in Barcelona, I really wanted this one.  “I went through a lot of things during the week. Some positive, some great moments, some lucky moments, suffering moments. At the end I think I played a very solid week of tennis, it’s the right moment to win an important title.” Djokovic also said his level of play last week has filled him with confidence about his chances at the French Open, where he lost to Nadal in last year’s final. “I was happy to play him because of the fine-tuning for Roland Garros...that doesn’t get bigger of a challenge on clay than playing Rafa in finals,” said Djokovic. “Of course I’m disappointed not to win it, but at the same time I’m very pleased with the level of tennis that I managed to find in the later stages of this tournament. “Going into Paris brings me good sensation. I actually now started to feel like I actually want to feel on clay. So I think if I manage to play the way I played last two days here, I think I have a good chance to go all the way in Paris.” Djokovic will next play a tournament at home in Belgrade in the week before the French Open kicks off on May 30 and will hope to arrive in Paris with a few more matches under his belt.

18 May 2021||Madrid,||Suarez puts Atletico closer to LaLiga title||Diego Simeone hailed Luis Suarez as “extraordinary” on Sunday after the Uruguayan scored the goal that could win Atletico Madrid La Liga, his late winner snatching a dramatic 2-1 win over Osasuna. Atletico trailed Osasuna with nine minutes to go at the Wanda Metropolitano and faced a defeat that would not just have postponed its bid to be champion but allowed Real Madrid, which was beating Athletic Bilbao, to go top with one game left. Stunning turnaround Instead, Atletico scored in the 82nd and 88th minutes to pull off a stunning turnaround. Renan Lodi smashed in an equaliser before Suarez proved the hero, firing in from eight yards to spark mass celebrations. “He’s extraordinary,” said Diego Simeone. “He came here wanting to prove people wrong, wanting to show that he was a forward still at the top of his game. Who better than him to decide a match that seemed to be getting away from us?” Atletico’s players and substitutes piled onto Suarez in the corner and at full-time, some of their players dropped to their knees, not with ecstasy, but relief, the title now just one win away. “These are moments of happiness,” said Suarez. Meanwhile in Berlin, Borussia Dortmund and Wolfsburg clinched Champions League qualification on Sunday, while Hamburger SV’s hopes of rejoining the Bundesliga were put on hold for another year. Dortmund won 3-1 at Mainz and Wolfsburg drew 2-2 at Leipzig to ensure both sides will finish among the top four to qualify for Europe’s top club competition.

18 May 2021||Melbourne,||Australian IPL players return home||Australia’s IPL players, including Pat Cummins and Steve Smith, arrived in Sydney on Monday after a stop-over at Maldives due to travel ban from COVID-ravaged India, almost two weeks after the T20 league was suspended due to the health crisis. Most of the 38 members of the Australian contingent, including players, officials and commentators who participated at the league, landed at the Sydney airport this morning after spending 10 days at Maldives. The lucrative league was indefinitely suspended on May 5 after four players and two coaches from four different teams tested positive inside the bio-bubble. Australian players, however, couldn’t head home immediately as the country had imposed a travel ban from India, which is battling a deadly second wave of the coronavirus. They will all be spending two weeks in a Sydney hotel for the mandatory quarantine. According to national broadcaster ABC, Smith, Cummins, batsman David Warner and Ricky Ponting, who coached Delhi Capitals, were among the people on the Air Seychelles flight. Chennai Super Kings batting coach Michael Hussey also headed home on Sunday via Doha after testing negative for COVID-19 on Friday.

But here we are still winning the biggest tournaments and Slams. “I don’t know what to tell you other than that.

18 May 2021||Melbourne,||CA tried to sweep it under the carpet, says Clarke||Former captain Michael Clarke won’t be surprised if it comes to light that more players were aware of the ball-tampering plot in 2018 as he accused Cricket Australia of sweeping the issue under the carpet. The scandal had led to a review of Australia’s win-at-all-cost team culture and led to one-year bans being slapped on then captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and a nine-month suspension on opener Cameron Bancroft, who had the sandpaper in his possession. The issue was put under the spotlight again when Bancroft last week revealed that Australian bowlers in the team at that time might have had some knowledge about the plot. “If you are playing sport at the highest level you know your tools that good it’s not funny. Can you imagine that ball being thrown back to the bowler and the bowler not knowing about it? Please,” Clarke told Sky Sports Radio on Monday. “I love how the articles in the paper are, ‘It is such a big surprise that Cameron Bancroft has made a ...’ Actually, if you read his quotes, it is not what he did say as what he didn’t say in regards to other people knowing about ‘sandpapergate’,” he said. Following Bancroft’s interview, Cricket Australia said it was open to a re-investigation into the incident and its integrity team has already approached the player for more information. “What’s the surprise? That more than three people knew? I don’t think anybody who has played the game of cricket, or knows a little bit about cricket, would know that in a team like that, at the highest level, when the ball is such an important part of the game,” Clarke said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ca-tried-to-sweep-it-under-the-carpet-says-clarke/article34582875.ece
18 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Das is India women’s team batting coach||Former India opener Shiv Sunder Das has been appointed the batting coach of the Indian women's team for the tour of England. Das, who played 23 Tests between 2000 and ’02, scored 1326 runs, including two hundreds and nine half-centuries. He finished with an average of 34.89. “It will be a good experience and I am looking forward to it,” said the 43-year-old former Odisha skipper. Das, who has honed his skills as a batting coach at the National Cricket Academy under Rahul Dravid's guidance, believes that the stint would help him while trying to solve the technical problems of the batters. “I have been part of the NCA for the last 4-5 years and have been batting coach for the past couple of years. I would like to thank Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly for giving me this opportunity,” said Das, who played most of his cricket under the BCCI president's captaincy. “I don’t think there is a lot of difference and at the end of the day, you impart your knowledge and work with the players. You contribute to their success and be ready to solve their cricketing issues when they need you. My responsibility is to make them well prepared and match-ready,” said Das, who was part of the Indian team that toured England under Ganguly in 2002 and scored 250 in a tour game. “That was my highest score in England on that tour,” he recalled. Das believes that his experience of having played league cricket in England will prove to be helpful when he guides the players. “It will help that I have played a lot of cricket in England, including international cricket and league cricket. I know the conditions and I will share my experiences with the players. “A few of them have toured England multiple times and have quite a bit of experience. Whatever time we have, we will see how many training sessions we get, and make sure we use them properly,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/das-is-india-womens-team-batting-coach/article34582878.ece

18 May 2021||Sydney,||Finch to lead, big names return||Australia welcomed back its star players and picked four spinners in an extended 23-man squad named on Monday for a white-ball tour of the West Indies in July. The team will be captained by Aaron Finch and will feature the return of Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, David Warner and Pat Cummins, who all missed the recent trip to New Zealand. The tour starts with the first of five T20Is in St. Lucia on July 9 and ends with the third of three ODIs in Barbados on July 24 as the teams prepare for the T20 World Cup in India later this year. Marnus Labuschagne however misses out, due to “logistical complexities” of joining the squad from the UK, which would necessitate him to undergo two weeks of quarantine.  The squad: Aaron Finch (Capt.), Ashton Agar, Jason Behrendorff, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Moises Henriques, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Riley Meredith, Josh Philippe, Jhye Richardson, Kane Richardson, Tanveer Sangha, D’Arcy Short, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Swepson, Andrew Tye, Matthew Wade, David Warner and Adam Zampa .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/finch-to-lead-big-names-return/article34582873.ece
18 May 2021||Geneva,||‘Going to be an extra hard battle’||Roger Federer said on Monday that he expects to return to the top tier of tennis even though the next generation of players will have gained ground during his lengthy injury lay-off. Federer begins his comeback-proper on Swiss home soil in Geneva on Tuesday, with the 39-year-old tennis legend starting a run of tournaments including the French Open, Halle, Wimbledon and then the Tokyo Olympics. Federer returned to the courts in March, having been out for more than a year following two knee surgeries, winning his first match in Qatar before losing his second. Doha was his first appearance since January 2020 and an Australian Open semifinal defeat to Novak Djokovic. “I’m just concerned about where my game is at. The guys on tour are all in a good rhythm. The level that everybody is producing is great. I want to achieve that as well again,” Federer said. “I’m excited about the comeback, that’s what my focus needs to be on and not about trying to be at the same level as Rafa and Novak right now,” Federer said. But the 20-time Grand Slam title winner added: “I believe I will be part of the top-tier.” He said the so-called “Next Generation” of players such as Stefanos Tsitsipas, Andrey Rublev, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev plus 2020 US Open winner Dominic Thiem would all prove a much tougher challenge now. “One thing is for sure, I would expect that the generation of Tsitsipas, Zverev, Rublev, Medvedev have all again gotten better naturally because they have more experience,” he said. “For me, that’s going to be an extra challenge, extra hard for me to find that level, but I guess I knew from the get-go it was never going to be simple, regardless of whether I was going to be out for three months or almost a year and a half.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/going-to-be-an-extra-hard-battle/article34582879.ece
18 May 2021||BENGALURU,||Our aim is to peak at the right time: Monika||The Indian women’s hockey players have become tech-savvy and now understand the purpose of the training sessions, experienced midfielder Monika said on Monday. All work Monika, who was part of the team that competed at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, said the sessions on Saturday mornings were the toughest. “It is always a red session. They are mostly high-intensity training sessions where we focus on match situations,” Monika said in a Hockey India (HI) release. “The focus in each session is either on speed or endurance. We have about two-three such sessions a week. Those are the days when our fitness levels are really tested. Better awareness “Our awareness about each session and how does it help is much better now than before. Earlier, we would just focus on what the coaches said.” Monika added that the coaching staff is planning week-on-week training in such a way that the team peaks at the right time. “The focus now is to keep improving on our strengths and work on the weak points. Our aim is to peak at the right time. “Every player’s workload is taken into consideration and improvement is mapped accordingly,” she said. “Our focus is to improve each day and be ready for the Games. The entire group is mentally prepared.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/our-aim-is-to-peak-at-the-right-time-monika/article34582922.ece
18 May 2021||Villamartin (Spain),||Two top-5 positions for Hero team||Hero MotoSports Team Rally missed out on podium but team riders Sebastian Buhler and Franco Caimi finished a strong fourth and fifth respectively at the Anadalucia Rally, here. Rodrigues and Caimi started the final stage with the best chances of achieving a podium for the team. Rodrigues made a strong start to the stage but settled on the side of caution owing to a couple of crashes and brought the bike home safely in the seventh position. This was enough for him to earn a fourth place in the overall standings, building upon his win in the Prologue and a strong performance throughout the rally. Difficult day “Today was difficult day for me as I had a couple of crashes and hurt my hand and knee a little bit. So, I decided to slow down and focus on getting the bike to the finish safely,” Rodrigues said. Caimi also made a strong final dash and managed to secure a fifth place in the last stage of the rally, his efforts rewarding him with a fifth place in the overall standings too. With this, he managed to achieve a Top-5 finish in his very first rally in Hero MotoSports colors. “I focused today on improving my feeling and confidence on the bike so I am happy to be at the end and with the way things have gone in my first rally with my new team,” Caimi said. Sebastian Buhler, who had received a 15 minutes penalty yesterday owing to an engine change effectively lost his chance of an overall podium finish. Yet, he put the new engine to good use and achieved good speed to finish the final stage in fourth place. He finished the rally on the eight position in the overall rankings. Great job “The bike worked really well and the team also made a great job so everything was perfectI feel that I am getting better day by day and even though the results could have been better, overall we had a very good rally. I want to express my special thanks to our team and fans across the world,” Buhler said. Next up for Hero MotoSports Team Rally will be the Rally Kazakhstan scheduled from June 7–13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/two-top-5-positions-for-hero-team/article34582929.ece

Vijayanand announced a financial assistance of Rs. 3 lakh to former India women’s player S.K. Sravanthi Naidu, who has been struggling to raise funds to get her COVID-19 affected parents — S.K. Suman and S.K. Govind Raj Naidu — treated in two different hospitals here. Responding to pleas from Sravanthi and also former BCCI South Zone women’s cricket convenor N. Vidya Yadav, the HCA Apex Council decided on Monday to hand over the cheque on Tuesday to the cricketer, who played one Test in 2005 and four ODIs with career-best figures of four for nine with her left-arm spin against Bangladesh in 2014. Former BCCI president N. Shivlal Yadav is also trying to mobilise funds for the cricketer besides an undisclosed personal contribution which he will be making soon. “I am in deep trouble as both my parents tested COVID-19 positive. “My mom is critical and dad is also in hospital,” the 34-year-old Sravanthi said in her letter to the HCA and also to the top brass of the BCCI. “I have paid Rs. 16 lakh as medical bills so far for my mother’s treatment and another Rs. 3 lakh for my father. I don’t have money to clear any more bills,” she said. “I am totally shattered by the financial crisis. Another Rs. 10 lakh is needed for tracheostomy. I will be indebted to the BCCI and the HCA. I need your kind attention for further action,” Sravanthi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hcas-financial-assistance-to-sravanthi/article34583324.ece
18 May 2021||LONDON,||Britain yet to decide on Pfizer’s offer||The British government is still deciding whether to accept an offer from Pfizer to fast-track Olympic and Paralympic athletes for coronavirus vaccines. Jabs are only being given to Britons aged 38 or older — though this will be extended to those over 35 from next week — with younger people only getting inoculated if they have an underlying health condition. “It’s sensitive because the philosophy has been based on age and that’s been proved to be the right thing," British Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said. “The biggest indicator is age is the biggest factor and of course Pfizer have offered for the Olympics and we’ve asked them about that.” Pfizer, which developed a vaccine with BioNTech, said earlier this month that it would donate doses to inoculate athletes and officials preparing for the Tokyo games with the rescheduled Olympics due to open on July 23. While the Olympics begin in less than 10 weeks, Britain has a policy of delaying the second dose by up to 12 weeks to free up vaccines for more people. Britain announced Sunday that more than 20 million people have now received both doses. The two shots of the Pfizer vaccines were intended to be given three to four weeks apart.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/britain-yet-to-decide-on-pfizers-offer/article34582920.ece
18 May 2021||DUBAI,||ICC rejects claims made by documentary||The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday dismissed claims made by news channel Al Jazeera that India’s Test matches against England and Australia were fixed, saying the passages of play identified as fixed were entirely predictable, and therefore “implausible as a fix”. The documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers released in 2018 had claimed that India’s game against England in Chennai in 2016 and the one against Australia in 2017 in Ranchi were fixed. The ICC also cleared five people — filmed by the channel — of any wrongdoing saying even as they behaved in a questionable manner, there was no credible evidence was available to charge them. During the programme, an alleged bookie Aneel Munnawar was seen making claims about his dubious connections and history of fixing matches including two Tests involving Virat Kohli’s Indian team. The ICC had launched an investigation into the claims.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Embodiment of dharma||Rama is praised as Dharmah in the Vishnu Sahasranama, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. Brahma praised Rama as the Supreme Dharma. Another name for Rama in the Sahasranama is Uttamah. The Sahasranama says, Dharmavid Uttamah. Dharmavid means one who knows dharma. Among all such persons, Rama is the best. Dasaratha, despite being Rama’s father, went to svarga. Svarga is not a permanent place of stay for anyone. When one’s punyas are exhausted, one has to be born again on the earth. Svarga is not synonymous with moksha. That being the case, why did Rama not grant moksha to Dasaratha? Why did He only give him the inferior position of being a resident of svarga? Dasaratha, strictly speaking, should have gone to naraka. It is because of Rama’s kindness that he went to svarga. Dasaratha did not deserve moksha. Dasaratha had made a promise to Kaikeyi, and in order to honour that promise, he banished Rama, the embodiment of dharma, to the forest. How can a promise to Kaikeyi be more important than the Lord Himself? People keep to the path of dharma in order to reach Him. When Dasaratha had the boon of having Rama beside him, he parted from Rama, to keep his word to Kaikeyi. Hence, he did not get moksha. Vibhishana, on the other hand, left his country and turned against his brother because what the latter was doing was against dharma. He sought Rama and surrendered to Him. And Rama accepted Vibhishana, and explained Saranagati dharma to followers. When a lake or river gets full, water flows out through an outlet so that flooding is avoided. The Lord is so full of good qualities that there is a need for some of them to overflow and benefit mankind. And how else can He accomplish this than by taking avataras?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/embodiment-of-dharma/article34582834.ece

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Elementary, my dear Prakash||In Bhaskar Chattopadhyay’s, Best Served Cold , Janadhan Maity and Prakash set out to the beautiful tea estate in Manikpur in the Dooars region of Bengal. The elderly, wealthy estate owner is threatened by four people who he might have grievously injured. The title, the 42-year-old author says is not inspired by either Star Trek or Kill Bill . “It is part of the well-known proverb, ‘Revenge is a dish best served cold’ whose origin is both ancient and debatable. I usually like to begin my books with an epigraph, or a famous quote, or a stanza from a famous poem, which doubles up as a premonition of what is about to come, as well as a clue to the final solution. This time around, I decided that the title must serve both purposes.” Passage of time The idea of retribution or nemesis has always fascinated the Bengaluru-based author. “I like to explore the passage of time in my work. How does time affect one’s emotions like love, anger, hatred, gratitude or vengeance? When I was a young boy, my father had once told me that the two most valuable things were life and time. That has stayed with me. I find the theme of your past catching up with you very rich for the purposes of storytelling.” Bhaskar’s maternal grandfather used to be a clerk in a tea estate in the Dooars. “My mother grew up on the estate. I spent several years in the midst of the tea gardens — both in the Dooars as well as in Assam, where I grew up. It is a familiar and picturesque setting.” Location is everything Most of Bhaskar’s research he says comes from first-hand experience. He had been to places where the earlier Maity books Penumbra, Here Falls The Shadow , and The Disappearance of Sally Sequeira , were set. “When you travel, you don’t just ‘see’ places, you learn about them. That is research. You may use it in your story or it may just add to your knowledge. Either way, you enrich yourself. The fact that there was a menace of leprosy in the tea gardens in the past is not something that many books will tell you. As a storyteller, it is important to know the place you are writing about. It adds several dimensions to your narrative.” Like every good detective, Maity has the writer Prakash as his Watson. “It is one of the most important elements of the story. A non-character narrator won’t be half as effective as telling the story through your Watson because in the former situation, the narrator is not supposed to have emotions or opinions.” Hero worship The Watson character Bhaskar comments also reminds the reader who the hero of the story is. “Would you have loved Feluda so much if Topshe did not hero-worship him? The truth is you always need a character who cannot solve a crime to prove the brilliance of the character who can.” Another important role the Watson character plays according to Bhaskar is that of a channel between the protagonist and the reader. “A detective story includes a lot of thinking. How do the readers get to know what your detective is thinking? The discussions between the detective and his assistant or friend or whatever you want to call your Watson is an integral part of the narrative as it takes the story forward.” Notes and a sketch Talking about his process, Bhaskar says he makes notes and has a sketch with the entire story coded into it. “This includes all characters, their motives, relationships with each other and timelines. This is only a small part of the process. The biggest and most important part is to find a good puzzle. The story is nothing without the puzzle. If I don’t construct a good puzzle, I would never, ever write a mystery story.” There are plans to bring Maity and Prakash on screen. “I am in discussions with some people. It will happen, because there is considerable interest. The question is when.” Best Served Cold is available on Kindle Unlimited and as a paperback online.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||On track with the stars||Oscar Award-winning director, Barry Jenkins, has adapted Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Underground Railroad , into a 10-part series. The novel, like the show, is set in an alternate timeline where the Underground Railroad instead of being a series of safe houses for escaped slaves, is an actual subterranean railway with stations and trains. The story follows Cora, a slave who escapes on the Underground Railroad from a Georgia plantation with a fellow slave, Caesar. Thuso Mbedu, who plays Cora, speaking over a video call, says the show did not feel voyeuristic. “It was not ‘putting the black body on display’ thing that we have seen in the past. It was actually taking the time to understand, do the research and tell the story of the black experience.” William Jackson Harper, who plays Royal, a freeman, agrees saying, “This project is about resistance, as opposed to endurance. It is about actively changing the circumstances, rather than wondering when the circumstances will change.” Describing Royal as someone who is ahead of his time, the 41-year-old Harper says, “He sees something wrong and decides to do something about it. That was what I latched on.” Reality bites Aaron Pierre who plays Caesar, says, “He was born in Virginia and promised Manumission, which did not come to fruition. He then finds himself in the South on the Randall plantation. While he was in Virginia, he had the opportunity to see glimpses of what true liberation was like and he continually pursues that in the hope of obtaining it one day.” The most challenging aspect of the role, Pierre says, was the knowledge it was based in reality. “This was the reality for many individuals, and that was unsettling. While the series renders horrific realities, it also celebrates the magnitude of strength that these people had, to overcome those circumstances.” Ugandan-born British actor, Sheila Atim, who plays a midwife Mabel, is veteran of stage and screen. She has done Shakespeare as well as acted in the musical Girl from the North Country based on Bob Dylan’s songs and the adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Pale Horse . Page to screen With The Underground Railroad , Sheila says she did not feel that way. “I felt very free and I think Barry was brilliant in making the cast feel like they had artistic licence over their characters.” Pierre says he could not give specific percentages of how much of his character is the writing, how much is the direction, and how much was his input. “When you work on a project, you try and bring the character to life. I am endlessly thankful for Barry's guidance, for his words of encouragement, and how generous he is with his knowledge. And of course, I am endlessly thankful for Coulson’s writing because in the writing there is a wealth of knowledge and guidance. The way I approach work is to just be as present as possible. I try not to have too many premeditated or preordained ways of doing a scene.” The book was the first point of contact for Joel Edgerton, who plays the slave catcher, Ridgeway.  The Underground Railroad streams on Amazon Prime Video.

18 May 2021||May 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Playing a new game||The closest PM Bava, a machinist from Kalady near Kochi, came to films was when he opened a video rental and distribution business, Saina Video Vision at Kodambakkam, Chennai. The year was 1985, when the city was the hub of the South Indian film industry. Malayalis of a generation got their dose of Malayalam cinema from video cassettes hired from video rentals, and Saina was prominent among companies that made, marketed and distributed these. The red and yellow logo — Saina — with the letter S figuring prominently — was a familiar one. Saina is one of the few video cassette companies that have survived the times. Cut to May 2021, Saina Audio Video Vision is all set to launch its OTT platform Saina Play, which will stream the 700-odd Malayalam films besides new content. Saina has the rights to all the content it will stream. Some of the films that will be in their platform are Malayalam’s biggest blockbusters such as Manichitrathaazhu , Punjabi House , Vadakkumnathan , Chandrolsavam and Kurukshetra . Going OTT “We have been working on the logistics of an OTT platform since 2018. It was the inevitable next step for us,” says Aashiq, Bava’s son. “We identified technical glitches which we wanted to set right; others who rushed into it have encountered problems. We wanted to be prepared when we launched,” Bava says. The OTT platform is the culmination of a journey that started in 1985 with a trip to Singapore, from where he brought back a video cassette recorder/player and four video cassettes of Tamil films. All that he had seen on the trip and the VCR set him thinking, “After I finished watching the four cassettes, there was nothing else to watch. At the time film cassettes were made in West Asia, Dubai specifically. These were brought back to India, distributed by companies here. That made me think ‘why not start a VCR-cassette rental business here?’” He started the rental business from a shop adjacent to his brother’s electrical shop in Vadapalani, and later branched out into distribution and manufacturing video cassettes as well. Over time he graduated from video cassettes to audio tapes, then CD (compact disc), VCD and DVD. The business is now based in Kochi. “In 1995, when we brought out the CDs of Manichitrathaazhu , the first Malayalam film in the format, we sold exactly 20 pieces. In 2006, we sold, in association with Moser Baer, 2.5 lakh CDs and one lakh DVDs of Vadakkumnathan . That is how the market changed. That said, at around Rs. 20,000, CD players were also expensive as were CDs. But the market has grown exponentially since then,” Bava says. Embracing technology Initially, he did not have copyright to films nor was anyone in the film industry particular about it. However, over time, he understood the advantage of acquiring it. Among the first films that he acquired the rights for in the early 1990s were Vidyarambham and Vyuham . “We ensured that we had the rights to everything we put in the market,” he says. Malayalam films were their core though they have some Tamil titles too. Although he does not want to mention figures of video and audio rights of a film he says, “They have grown 20 times in the 35-plus years that I have been in the business.” The secret of staying current, Bava says, “is being updated about trends across the world. Technology changes constantly and you have to be on top of your game. I was aware of the changes, television screens getting wider, high-definition, Blu ray...and accordingly adapted.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/playing-a-new-game/article34583052.ece

18 May 2021||New Delhi,||Only 3 days of vaccine stock left for 18-44 group: Sisodia||Citing a shortage of vaccines, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the stock for the 18-44 years category would only last three more days. He said the Delhi government may have to shut all the centres opened up for this category if the Centre does not provide fresh supply. Mr. Sisodia said that in a letter addressed to the Delhi government, the Centre has committed to distribute 3.83 lakh doses for the 45+ age group, however, the same provision has not been extended to 18-44 age group. “This is a grave issue that requires the immediate attention of the Central government. At the very least, they should match the doses for 45+ citizens and distribute 3.83 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group as well,” Mr. Sisodia said. Mr. Sisodia said he wrote to the Centre on Monday, requesting them to make vaccine doses available for citizens between 18-44 years, make allocation data of vaccines transparent and open to the public. Transparency sought He said: “Currently the Centre allocates 50% of vaccines and passes on the responsibility for the rest to State governments. But, there is no transparency in the process. Allocation data, showing how many vaccine doses have been provided to which State and for which age group, should be on public domain.” He said the Centre should be transparent in its vaccine allocation data like it has shown transparency in oxygen allocation. He also requested that the information on the number of doses that will be made available to the Capital in June and July be communicated to the State government so that it can plan its vaccination programme. AAP MLA Atishi said 90,832 vaccine doses had been administered on Sunday, of which 79,353 were administered their first dose. The second dose had been administered to 11,479 beneficiaries. “We will have five days stock of Covishield, but less than a day’s stock of Covaxin for 45 plus age group after today’s vaccination,” Ms. Atishi said. To cater to those people in the 45 and above age group who don’t have smartphones and can’t register online, Ms. Atishi said the government has added 97 schools where walk-in vaccinations for 45-plus, healthcare workers and frontline workers started on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/only-3-days-of-vaccine-stock-left-for-18-44-group-sisodia/article34583062.ece
18 May 2021||Srinagar,||Parties concerned over vaccine shortage in Kashmir||J&K witnessed the highest ever deaths — 73 — due to the pandemic on Monday, as the political parties decried the scarcity of vaccine doses in the Union Territory (UT), especially the Kashmir valley. An official said 3,344 fresh positive cases were also reported. The Jammu region witnessed 54 of the 73 deaths. “Nineteen deaths were reported in the Kashmir valley,” officials said. “For days together not a single soul was vaccinated in Srinagar. While 95% of the population above 45 years has been inoculated in Jammu, it’s shockingly only 30% for Srinagar,” PDP spokesperson Najmu Saqib said. The PDP asked the L-G administration to “scale up and speed up vaccination drives”. “The skewed percentage of inoculation between Jammu and Srinagar is concerning,” he said. Peoples Conference leader and former Minister Syed Basharat Bukhari also asked the administration to address the mounting concerns on the shortage. J&K Kashmir Civil Society Forum chairman Abdul Qayoom Wani said the shortage has created “a panic-like situation in Kashmir”. J&K Apni Party spokesperson Javid Hasan Beigh said the condition was getting grim with every single passing day. “In the absence of sufficient funds , the government should pool funds on a temporary basis,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/parties-decry-vaccine-shortage-in-kashmir/article34583316.ece
18 May 2021||New Delhi,||Middle class, poor, labourers, migrants got nothing from the Delhi govt.: BJP||The middle-class, poor, labourers and migrant workers of Delhi have got “nothing” from the government in the last six years except false promises and assurances, the BJP alleged on Monday. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said while the Centre, during the pandemic, had provided two months’ free ration for 80 crore poor across the country, the Delhi government had left over 72 lakh ration cardholders in the Capital on their own. “Kejriwal [Delhi CM] announced on May 4 that 72 lakh ration card holders in city will be given free ration for May and June but the fact is it is Central government’s policy under which it is being done. But the Delhi government has till date not acted on this which is why labourers, who have lost their jobs, are not getting even a single meal,” he said. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said not even a single new ration card has been issued in Delhi in the last six years. Though over 72 lakh citizens had ration cards, thousands still did not; when the Delhi government asked for applications in this regard, 54 lakh applications were found to be valid but had not been issued ration cards till date. “Most of them are migrant labourers or daily wagers. Despite the apex court’s order, no poor has been given two times’ meals now even after lockdowns. Why does the AAP government continue to lie on such an issue?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/middle-class-poor-labourers-migrants-got-nothing-from-the-delhi-govt-bjp/article34583060.ece
