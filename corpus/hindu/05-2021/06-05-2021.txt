06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maratha quota unconstitutional, violates right to equality, says SC||A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously declared a Maharashtra law which provides reservation benefits to the Maratha community, taking the quota limit in the State in excess of 50%, unconstitutional. The Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan found there was no “exceptional circumstances” or “extraordinary situation” in Maharashtra which required the Maharashtra government to break the 50% ceiling limit to bestow quota benefits on the Maratha community. “We have found that no extraordinary circumstances were made out in granting separate reservation for Maratha community by exceeding the 50% ceiling limit of reservation ... The Marathas are in the mainstream of the national life. It is not even disputed that Marathas are politically dominant caste,” Justice Bhushan, who authored the lead opinion on the point of the validity of the Maratha law, noted. Sets aside HC verdict The Supreme Court struck down the findings of the Justice M.G. Gaikwad Commission which led to the enactment of the Maratha quota law and set aside the Bombay High Court judgment which validated the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act of 2018. The High Court had, in June 2019, reduced the quantum of reservation for Marathas from the 16% recommended by the Gaikwad Commission to 12% in education and 13% in employment. The Supreme Court concluded that even the reduced percentages of reservation granted by the High Court were ultra vires . In fact, the Supreme Court held that a separate reservation for the Maratha community violates Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (due process of law). Most important, the top court declined to revisit its 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, which fixed the reservation limit at 50%. “The judgment of Indra Sawhney has stood the test of the time and has never been doubted by any judgment of this court,” Justice Bhushan wrote. “The ceiling of 50% with the ‘extraordinary circumstances’ exception, is the just balance — what is termed as the ‘Goldilocks solution’ — i.e. the solution containing the right balance that allows the State sufficient latitude to ensure meaningful affirmative action, to those who deserve it, and at the same time ensures that the essential content of equality,” Justice S. Ravindra Bhat on the Bench agreed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maratha-quota-unconstitutional-violates-right-to-equality-says-sc/article34494480.ece
06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Viral load high, third wave is inevitable: govt. adviser||A third wave of COVID-19 is inevitable, given the amount of virus in circulation, K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, said on Wednesday. “There is, however, no clear timeline on when this third phase will occur. We should be prepared for new waves and COVID-appropriate behaviour, and vaccine upgrades is the way forward,” he said at a press conference. Professor VijayRaghavan said there was a need to update the COVID-19 vaccines to deal with new strains and mutations. He pointed out that while the nature of the virus was to mutate, the basic precautions against it to break the transmission did not change. “We have to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated. The scientific community is working at mapping the possible changes that can occur in the virus to ensure that our preparedness and response remains robust,” he said. The warning comes along with an indication by the Health Ministry that Bengaluru Urban; Chennai; Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram in Kerala; Gurugram and Patna districts have been among those now registering an increasing trend of the virus for the past two weeks. “States including Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Bihar are showing an increasing trend in daily COVID-19 cases, and an increase in deaths has been noticed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, and Haryana,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/viral-load-high-third-wave-is-inevitable-govt-adviser/article34494486.ece
06 May 2021||Mumbai,||Thank you for recognising Mumbai pattern: CM to SC||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday thanked the Supreme Court for recognising the ‘Mumbai pattern’ in dealing with the pandemic. “Not only do the medical staff involved in relief work deserve an applause for this but also the citizens of Maharashtra to whom I am thankful for being part of this fight,” he said, in an address in the evening to the State through social media. The Chief Minister was responding to the Supreme Court’s suggestion to the Delhi administration to take note of actions of Mumbai’s civic body for effective Covid management. Mr. Thackeray said many districts are showing a declining trend and at some places the cases are reducing. “But this is not the end. Nor should you assume it as our victory against the virus,” he cautioned. Referring to the Centre’s warning of a third wave, Mr. Thackeray said his government has already begun preparations. “We are increasing the number of beds and also concentrating on making the State self-reliant in terms of medical oxygen supply,” he said, referring to ‘Mission Oxygen’ launched in the State. Under this, Maharashtra plans to increase its oxygen manufacturing capacity to 1800 MT per day and store capacity to around 3250 MT. Directions have been issued to district collectors to ensure oxygen plants are set up at the tehsil level in the next two months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/thank-you-for-recognising-mumbai-pattern-cm-to-sc/article34495227.ece
06 May 2021||Chengalpattu,||13 COVID-19 patients die in T.N. hospital||Thirteen COVID-19 patients died after oxygen supply was disrupted due to poor pressure in the oxygen tank at the Chengalpattu Government Hospital in Tamil Nadu late on Tuesday. Confirming the death of the 13 patients on Wednesday, J. Muthukumaran, Dean of the hospital, said oxygen was available in the tank from which it was supplied to more than 300 patients admitted to the COVID-19 ward, but it did not have sufficient pressure. He said the hospital had a total capacity of 23 kilolitres (kl), comprising two 10 kl and a 3 kl oxygen tanks. “Previously, when there were not too many COVID-19 patients, we did not face any oxygen shortage but now with a large number of COVID-19 patients getting admitted during the past fortnight [oxygen beds have been filled up], it has become tough. Today, 309 patients in the COVID-19 ward [of the total 580] were provided with oxygen support,” he said. “The COVID-19 ward is supplied with oxygen from the 10 kl tank. As several government and private hospitals are also in need of oxygen supply, our hospital has been receiving only around 4 kl to 5 kl to be filled in the three oxygen tanks, which would be enough to treat patients on regular days.” The incident triggered a strike by postgraduate physicians and assistant doctors, demanding the immediate filling of the oxygen tanks on Wednesday morning. Doctors stage protest Chengalpattu Collector A. John Louis, who went to the hospital on hearing about the tragedy, pacified the protesting doctors and assured them that all their demands would be met. He ordered an inquiry by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO). The hospital authorities handed over the bodies to the relatives. A postgraduate doctor who participated in the protest said the hospital had been facing oxygen shortage despite having 23 KL capacity tanks. Since COVID-19 patients had been getting admitted in large numbers the hospital had been facing oxygen shortage for more than a week, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/13-covid-19-patients-die-in-tn-hospital/article34494490.ece
06 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Major private hospitals in Chennai keep a watch on oxygen supply||Major private hospitals in Chennai are keeping a close watch on their oxygen supply. Faced with last-minute supplies, some of them are feeling the heat already, and are apprehensive about an oxygen shortage in the coming weeks. The steady rise in daily COVID-19 cases has led to an increase in infrastructural requirements in hospitals, with beds and oxygen supply being the most crucial. Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said, “So far, oxygen supply is holding. Day to day, we are getting information from our biomedical department that vendors are supplying at the last minute. We are expecting severe oxygen shortage in Chennai within the next 10 to 15 days. Unless we can bring down the active cases by way of a lockdown, it is going to be a supply versus demand problem.” Last-minute supply Though there was no oxygen shortage right now, hospitals are receiving supply at the last minute, he said, adding, “The situation is all set to worsen. We are anticipating a shortage of oxygen in the future. We are trying to rationalise our use of oxygen and procure oxygen concentrators for ward patients. The best concentrators can give eight to 10 litres of oxygen. Anybody with a higher requirement cannot be managed with concentrators.” An official at a hospital, on the condition of anonymity, said, “It is a nail-biting wait for the truck.” On average, the hospital has 150 to 170 patients on oxygen support. “Trucks to refill the liquid oxygen tanks do not come on time, putting pressure on us. Delay will send patients into desaturation. So, we are not taking too many patients requiring oxygen. We can take more if we have more supply,” he said.    “The government should ensure that oxygen supply is increased and Remdesivir is available for private hospitals. Non-availability of Remdesivir is a setback. We have to send the patients’ attenders with a prescription to government medical college hospitals to get Remdesivir,” the official said. Santy Sajan, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, in a written reply to The Hindu , said, “We are grateful to the State authorities and local associates for ensuring regular and timely supplies of oxygen for the smooth running of operations at all our hospitals. We are closely monitoring the requirement of oxygen and other essential supplies as we enhance our critical bed capacity for extending care to our patients.” P. Ramakrishnan, State president of the Indian Medical Association - Tamil Nadu, said that with the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, more admissions were expected. “There is a need for uninterrupted and prompt supply of oxygen for private hospitals. If the supply is increased, we will be trouble-free,” he said. Availability of beds, Remdesivir and vaccines were among the other issues facing hospitals. At one hospital, all COVID-19 beds — wards, intensive care and holding area in the emergency room — were full. “We have another 50 to 60 patients requiring intensive care and ventilator-supported beds waiting, and another 50 to 60 patients in the waiting list for ward beds,” a hospital authority said. “We are unable to accommodate many patients. Our doctors, nurses and other staff and equipment are stretched out to take care of these many beds. Most of the doctors are heading for a burnout,” he added. Dr. Gnanasekaran said Chennai would require at least 1,000 more ward beds and at least 200 more intensive care beds with all necessary equipment and manpower to handle the crisis for the next two months. “Our only hope is a lockdown for Chennai for at least 20 days, like in Maharashtra, to bring down the transmission,” he said. Vaccination had come to a standstill in some private hospitals. The government should ensure that vaccination is carried out in full swing, a senior doctor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/major-private-hospitals-in-chennai-keep-a-watch-on-oxygen-supply/article34494550.ece
06 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Disease transmission intense: CM||The State is going through an extremely dangerous situation involving COVID-19, wherein disease transmission continues to be intense and the rising patient load is threatening to breach the State’s health system capacity, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, he said as of now, the situation did not warrant any panic as the health system had enhanced its surge capacity in the best way possible to manage increasing hospital admissions. However, the situation would not remain the same and if the surge in new cases did not come down immediately soon, no facility created by the State would be enough to contain the burgeoning numbers, Mr. Vijayan said. Revealing details on the current occupancy status in the State’s hospital beds and ICUs, he said that nearly 61% of the ICU beds and 27.3% of ventilators in the government sector were currently occupied. Of the 7,085 ICU beds in private sector, 1,037 were currently occupied by COVID patients A total of 1,975 out of the 3,231 oxygen beds in medical colleges in the State were currently occupied, of which 1,429 were being used for COVID care. Oxygen position About 52% of the oxygen beds (3,001 beds) under the hospitals in the Directorate of Health Services and 66.12% oxygen beds (2,990 beds) in the private sector were also occupied as of now. The State’s oxygen position was comfortable at present. Mr. Vijayan appealed to people not to crowd hospitals seeking admission, just because they had been tested COVID positive. People with mild symptoms can very well afford to stay on home care. Private hospitals should also admit only those patients who require hospital care so that the hospital beds are reserved solely for serious patients. More COVID first line treatment centres would have to be opened up and the government would have to take over hostels and lodges for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/disease-transmission-intense-cm/article34494664.ece

06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC demands oxygen supply plan for Delhi||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Centre to burn the midnight oil and prepare a “comprehensive plan” for the supply of 700 metric tonnes of medical oxygen to Delhi daily. The plan, to be handed over in the form of a tabulated chart at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, should identify sources for supply and provisions for transport and logistical arrangements, including distribution points. A Special Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah, in a special sitting, said the lack of oxygen was causing “tremendous anxiety”. It orally urged Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, to comply with its April 30 order and ensure that Delhi received 700 MT of oxygen by May 5 midnight. According to the Centre, Delhi has received 351 MT till noon. The Bench, however, stayed a Delhi High Court order initiating contempt action against the Centre’s officers for the continued short supply of oxygen to Delhi, which is battling a devastating second wave of COVID-19. “Hauling officers up for contempt will not bring oxygen to Delhi,” Justice Chandrachud reasoned. “Contempt is when something is done absolutely wilfully,” Justice Shah said. “This is a national crisis, nobody can dispute that the Centre has not done anything... But still what is your plan for distribution and assessment of requirement of oxygen,” he asked Mr. Mehta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-demands-oxygen-supply-plan-for-delhi/article34494487.ece

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das used an unscheduled address to announce a Term Liquidity Facility of Rs. 50,000 crore with tenor of up to three years, at the repo rate, to ease access to credit for providers of emergency health services. Under the scheme, banks will provide fresh lending support to a wide range of entities, including vaccine manufacturers, importers/suppliers of vaccines and priority medical devices, hospitals/dispensaries, pathology labs, manufacturers and suppliers of oxygen and ventilators, and logistics firms. “These loans will continue to be classified under priority sector till repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier,” Mr. Das said, adding that banks were expected to create a COVID loan book under the scheme. As part of a “comprehensive targeted policy response”, the RBI also unveiled schemes to provide credit relief to individual and MSME borrowers impacted by the pandemic. “Restoring livelihoods has become an imperative,” Mr. Das said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rbi-steps-in-to-ease-covid-19-burden/article34494488.ece
06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Think of week-end lockdown, longer curfew: HC||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday asked the State government to explore imposition of stronger restrictive measures like extending hours of night curfew or weekend lockdown to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas on coronavirus-related issues, the HC said the government should take stock of the situation well before Saturday as extended night curfew would end by then and take a call on initiating further stringent measures to check spread of COVID-19. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the government to issue a fresh Government Order within 24 hours restricting persons attending marriages and funerals. Numbers of persons attending a marriage and a funeral should not exceed 50 and 20 respectively, the bench said. The bench expressed concern over the GO issued on November 16 last year permitting congregations of 200 persons as part of COVID-19 norms. District Collectors, Commissioners of Police and heads of municipal bodies were authorised to permit such gatherings. Permitting such large number now was not appropriate, it said. The bench instructed the Additional Solicitor General of India to ensure that the Central government supplied 600 metric tonnes of oxygen to Telangana. So far only 300 metric tonnes of oxygen was supplied to the State while the demand was going up with each passing day. The Central government should also supply sufficient stocks of drugs like Remdesivir. Against the requirement of 4,500 vials of the drug a day, only 25,000 vials were supplied to the State so far. Appreciating the State police for cracking down on hoarders of Remdesivir vials and oxygen cylinders, the bench directed DGP M. Mahender Reddy, who appeared for the hearing through virtual mode, to continue such work. The bench told the DGP to set up separate help centres at government and private hospitals by roping in voluntary organisations to assist people thronging hospitals for COVID-19 treatment. Mr. Reddy informed the HC that police were registering cases against function and banquet hall owners in case of violations relating to not maintaining social distance and participation of large number of guests. He explained that police refrained from booking cases in such instances against individuals as it was triggering some social tensions. Agreeing to this, the CJ instructed the police to be strict in enforcing all COVID-19-related norms and initiate action against violators. The bench told Advocate General B.S. Prasad to advise the government to consider seizure of vehicles of people not wearing face mask properly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/think-of-week-end-lockdown-longer-curfew-hc/article34495124.ece

In his grief, only one question weighed on his mind: what to tell his children. “I could not save Meenu. I couldn’t do anything. Rajiv Gandhi (Hospital) said they don’t have any beds and asked us to go to GTB (Hospital). She was fine in the morning,” Mr. Khare cried. The couple has two children: a 15-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl. “What will I tell them happened to their mother?” he said.   “Just this morning, my daughter was saying how she had not hugged her mother in a while. How will I take her (body) home?” Delhiites have been struggling to find beds, oxygen and medical supplies since the latest COVID surge hit the city early last month.  Raju Saha, 25, said he got his neighbour admitted to GTB Hospital after three other hospitals turned them away saying they had no beds for COVID patients.  Only 7.1% of the 21,805 beds set aside for COVID-19 patients in Delhi were vacant at 8 p.m. on Wednesday. There were also only 45 ICU beds available.  Ignoring the signs The number of active COVID cases in the city jumped 529.4% between March 1 and March 31, while daily cases rose by 939.4%. The number of beds for patients during the same period, however, increased by just 1.6%. The government started increasing beds on a war footing only in April.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/what-will-i-tell-my-kids-asks-distraught-husband-sitting-next-to-body-of-spouse/article34495104.ece

Soon after the function, she appealed to all parties to maintain peace and stop post-election violence. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who administered the oath of office, expressed the hope that the governance in the State “will be according to the Constitution and as per rule of law”. BJP State president Dilip Ghosh kept away in protest against the violence. “I will appeal to all political parties to maintain peace. Take proper care that there is no violence. West Bengal does not like violence, and I do not support it,” Ms. Banerjee said. For three months, the administration was working as per the instructions of the Election Commission of India and some inefficiency had crept in. The Trinamool Congress won 213 seats in the 294-member Assembly in the recent polls. The party’s vote share was at an all-time high of 47.9 %.

06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Workers’ income fell by 17%, says report||The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased informality in employment, leading to a decline in earnings for the majority of workers, and consequent increase in poverty in the country, according to ‘State of Working India 2021: One Year of Covid-19’, a report brought out annually by Azim Premji University’s Centre for Sustainable Employment, Bengaluru. This year’s report, which covers the period March 2020 to December 2020, dwells on the impact of one year of COVID-19 on employment, incomes, inequality and poverty. 100 million jobs Regarding employment, the report notes that 100 million jobs were lost nationwide during the April-May 2020 lockdown. Though most of these workers had found employment by June 2020, about 15 million remained out of work. As for income, “for an average household of four members, the monthly per capita income in Oct 2020 (Rs. 4,979) was still below its level in Jan 2020 (Rs. 5,989),” the report noted. The study found that post-lockdown, nearly half of salaried workers had moved into informal work, either as self-employed (30%), casual wage (10%) or informal salaried (9%). The fallback option varied by caste and religion. “General category workers and Hindus were more likely to move into self-employment while marginalised caste workers and Muslims moved into daily wage work,” noted the report. Education, health and professional services saw the highest exodus of workers into other sectors, with agriculture, construction and petty trade emerging as the top fallback options. Due to the employment and income losses, the labour share of the GDP fell by 5 percentage points, from 32.5% in the second quarter of 2019-20 to 27% in the second quarter of 2020-21. “Of the decline in income, 90% was due to reduction in earnings, while 10% was due to loss of employment. This means that even though most workers were able to go back to work, they had to settle for lower earnings,” observed the report. Monthly earnings of workers fell on an average by 17% during the pandemic, with self-employed and informal salaried workers facing the highest loss of earnings. While the poorest 20% of households lost their entire incomes in April-May 2020, “the richer households suffered losses of less than a quarter of their pre-pandemic incomes.” During the period from March to October 2020, an average household in the bottom 10% lost Rs. 15,700, or just over two months’ income. Significantly, the study has found a clear correlation between job losses and the COVID-19 case load, with States showing higher case load, such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Delhi, “contributing disproportionately to the job losses”.  Women and younger workers were more affected by the pandemic-related measures. During the lockdown and in the post-lockdown months, 61% of working men remained employed while 7% lost their job and did not return to work. But in the case of women, only 19% remained employed while 47% suffered a permanent job loss, “not returning to work even by the end of 2020”. With 230 million falling below the national minimum wage threshold of Rs. 375 per day during the pandemic, poverty rate has “increased by 15 percentage points in rural and nearly 20 percentage points in urban areas,” the report said. Households coped with the loss of income by decreasing their food intake, selling assets and borrowing informally from friends, relatives and money-lenders. The report notes that 20% of those surveyed said that their food intake had not improved even six months after the lockdown. These findings are a serious cause for concern in the absence of an inclusive social welfare architecture. Among other ameliorative policy measures, the report calls for extending free rations under the Public Distribution System till the end of 2021, expansion of MGNREGA entitlement to 150 days, and a “Covid hardship allowance” for the 2.5 million Anganwadi and ASHA workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/workers-income-fell-by-17-says-report/article34494392.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Longest elections did not help BJP||The eight-phase elections in West Bengal that went on for four-and-a-half weeks have been described as the longest State elections India has ever seen. The post-poll survey data suggest that this probably did not help the BJP in what is known as micro-management. In overall terms, as many as 24% or one in every four voters of West Bengal decided who they are going to vote for at the very last minute or a day or two before Voting Day, and among such voters, it was the Trinamool Congress and not the BJP that did exceedingly well. While the ruling party secured 54% of its vote, the BJP was way behind at 33% (Table 1). Any attempt by the BJP to turn things around at the last minute through targeted campaigning did not seem to have worked. It was not just among the late deciders, but even among the campaign-time deciders (those who decided their vote choice during the campaign or after the announcement of candidates) the Trinamool again enjoyed a sizeable advantage over the BJP. The ruling party secured 49% votes of such voters whereas the BJP was a good 12 percentage points behind at 37%. This finding is particularly significant when compared with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Back then, the BJP had stolen a march over the Trinamool precisely among this segment of campaign-time deciders, enjoying a two percentage point vote lead. The only category of voters among whom the BJP managed to put up somewhat of a fight this time were the before campaign deciders. Forty six per cent respondents had actually made up their mind early. Among them, 42% said they voted for the BJP as against 44% for the Trinamool. Significantly, the overall pattern of late and campaign-time deciders giving the Trinamool an advantage over the BJP does not change when we break down the voting preferences data of late and campaign-time deciders by Phases (Table 2).

06 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC urges Centre to drop GST on imports of oxygen concentrators||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to drop the GST charged on imports of oxygen concentrators for personal use, just as it has done for donated COVID-19 relief material imports. A High Court Bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh requested Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, who appeared for the Department of Revenue, to place its order before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and listed the matter for Thursday, by when the government is expected to revert with its decision. Hearing a writ petition filed by senior citizen Gurcharan Singh whose nephew had sent him an oxygen concentrator from overseas in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court said this was ‘a rare writ action’ where a ‘notification issued in the realm of a tax statute has been, inter alia, assailed under Article 21 of the Constitution’ that enshrines the Right to Life and personal liberty. The petitioner had challenged a May 1 notification that levied 12% GST on oxygen concentrators imported for personal use, compared to 28% earlier. “That tax is an exaction by the State is well known. That its levy and collection, ordinarily, does not encompass equity, is also, well known. But presently, we are living in difficult times and, therefore, perhaps, the petitioner has invoked Article 21 of the Constitution,” the Bench, which had requested the ASG to join proceedings on Tuesday, noted in its order. Exemption for States When ASG Sharma informed the Court that the government has granted IGST exemption on oxygen concentrators imported by entities authorised by the State Government till June 30, the Court asked it to consider extending the same exemption to individuals too. On April 30, in view of the rapidly rising COVID-19 cases and shortage of medical oxygen in the country, the government had notified changes to the foreign trade policy to allow the import of oxygen concentrators for personal use through e-commerce portals, post or courier till July 31, 2021. Customs clearance was to be granted without any import duties for such imports, but Integrated GST levies remain. As per industry experts, an oxygen concentrator with a 10-litre capacity costs around $1200 in the global market and those meaning to import them for personal use as a back-up option in case suitable medical facilities are not available for COVID-19 patients, would have to fork out nearly $150 more as GST to clear these imports from customs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-urges-centre-to-drop-gst-on-imports-of-oxygen-concentrators/article34494435.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Need to be patient over foreign aid distribution’||Germany is sending a massive oxygen plant on loan to Delhi on Thursday, capable of generating 4,00,000 litres of oxygen. The plant will service the DRDO-run Sardar Patel COVID-19 Hospital, and will help refill oxygen supplies for others. German Ambassador Walter J. Lindner says calls for transparency in where all the foreign aid is going may be premature.  Germany has sent 120 ventilators to India. What else is expected? Over Thursday and Friday, we will see a big oxygen plant come in on two A-400 transport airliners, which will then be set up here. They will be good for covering the oxygen needs for hundreds of people every day. So this is a big one. And it will remain here until it is needed. Our government is also working on improving the cold chains for the vaccinations, together with UNICEF. There is a massive private effort, with German companies working with Indian companies in different cities, and we have cooperation of the European Union, the civil protection mechanism that is bringing equipment on military planes. We have seen questions being asked in the U.S. and other countries about the need for more transparency from the government on the 300 tonnes of equipment and foreign aid that has flown in. Are you concerned about the fact that the aid is not visible on the ground yet? I can understand the impatience, because I see the images as well. I also tell this to German television audiences — that this is a heart-wrenching situation, you see that people are suffocating in front of hospitals. But you know, if you have international aid coming, there is always a kind of a time lag before you see results. You have to get clearances, then you have to sometimes unpackage and then repackage the equipment for use. This does take a few days. I would say the officials we are dealing with in the Red Cross and MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] know that every hour counts, every hour can save lives. How has the German Embassy itself been affected, and have you received adequate help and access to healthcare from the government? Well, we have about 150 people in the embassy at the moment and 30 people are dealing with COVID at present, including Indians and German nationals, of which two people are in hospitals. It was difficult to get hospital beds, because we are not specially privileged, and I think that is okay, because every life counts the same. In one case, we had to fly out a patient in an emergency flight, because there was a boy, he was just in such a bad condition. You worked as the crisis director in the German Foreign Ministry dealing with the Ebola crisis. How do you assess the government’s preparation for this kind of a second wave? Well, I’m no one to assess government’s crisis management. We are here as foreign observers, not auditors. In many countries, where the numbers go down, people tend to get easy on the measures. In a country like India too we saw that, and all of us did that, diplomats and the journalists, the Opposition and the government. I personally think the image I saw in mass events be they political, religious, sporting event, the sense was that in India things were getting better. The mutations may be one of the reasons nobody expected this kind of wave. Later, we can draw out the lessons learned, what could have done better, and others in the world and WHO could have done, but for the moment, we have to find a solution to this crisis, get people out of the emergency situation. How will India’s image be affected as a pharma and vaccine supplier? Recently, Chancellor Merkel suggested that the EU should not have depended completely on India for pharmaceuticals, given its inability at the present. This quote by Chancellor Merkel was totally taken out of the context. Whoever knows the Chancellor knows that it’s not her thinking, she knows well India’s strengths in this field. What she referred to was the need for the European Union, in fact for every country in the world, to be a bit less dependent on single supply chains. Where do you see the possibilities of India and Germany collaborating in the future, particularly when it comes to the vaccine initiative? Indians are very important part of the so called COVAX initiative for distributing vaccines worldwide, paid for by a global fund. For the moment this has slowed, because Indians need the vaccinations for themselves, which is totally understandable. But soon we hope to see Indian manufacturers step up production and there will be discussions at the biannual virtual meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Merkel at the end of this month, their last such meeting as she will soon step down. We also hope to see cooperation on cold chains and on research into the sequencing of the COVID virus.  If you have international aid coming, there is always a kind of a time lag before you see results. You have to get clearances... This does take a few days||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/need-to-be-patient-over-foreign-aid-distribution/article34494394.ece
06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jaishankar holds virtual meetings||The United Kingdom has a set of protocols that will be used to deal with the situation that has come up after two members of the Indian delegation, led by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to the G7 Foreign Ministers’ meeting tested positive for COVID-19, said an official of the British High Commission here. During a press interaction, British High Commissioner Alex Ellis said officials in London will determine the course of action to be followed to safeguard the health of those involved in the event. “It is the first summit after the pandemic began. We have a set of protocols. Our approach will be guided by the public health authorities of England and details will be emerging soon about that,” Mr. Ellis said, reminding that the U.K. had faced a tough COVID-19 scenario last year and that there was a lot to learn from that experience. The G7 summit will be hosted by the U.K. from June 11 to 13 where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to represent India, a guest country. Sources here maintained that the Indian delegation did not travel with COVID-19 infection and is now working with the U.K. authorities on the protocol to be followed. “Entire delegation is in quarantine. External Affairs Minister has made all meetings virtual. Later in the day, we will know what U.K. health authorities suggest. None are unwell, most have been vaccinated fully. They had all had tests before the take off,” said an informed source here who maintained that the tests were carried out on Sunday when they turned to be negative. The question on the health scare came up after Sky News reported that the two members had tested positive. Mr. Jaishankar has been in London for the past three days meeting his counterparts. The visit is significant as it is the first in-person meeting of the Ministers of G7 and the partner countries. On Monday, he met Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss COVID-19 related assistance from the U.S. On Tuesday, he met British Home Secretary Priti Patel. Following the meting, Ms. Patel said, “A pleasure to welcome Dr. S. Jaishankar to the U.K. Home Office today as we signed the landmark Migration and Mobility deal as part of our New Plan for Immigration, providing new opportunities for our young people to live and work here and in India as we recover from the pandemic.” Mr. Jaishankar in a social media post announced that he had conducted business in virtual mode as a precaution. “Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible COVID positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 meeting today as well,” he said on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-holds-virtual-meetings/article34494402.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Centre alone can identify SEBC: SC||The Centre alone is empowered to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) and include them in the Central List for claiming reservation benefits. “The President (that is the Central government) alone, to the exclusion of all other authorities, is empowered to identify SEBCs and include them in a list to be published under Article 342A (1), which shall be deemed to include SEBCs in relation to each State and Union Territory for the purposes of the Constitution,” Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, whose opinion was concurred by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta on the five-judge Bench, held. Justice Bhat said the States could only make suggestions to the President or the statutory commissions concerned for inclusion, exclusion or modification of castes and communities to be included in the List. The Central List is to be the “only list” for the SEBC. “Once published, under Article 342A (1), the list can only be amended through a law enacted by Parliament, by virtue of Article 342A (2),” Justice Bhat said. “In the task of identification of SEBCs, the President shall be guided by the Commission (National Commission for Backward Classes) set up under Article 338B; its advice shall also be sought by the State in regard to policies that might be framed by it,” the court said. “If the commission prepares a report concerning matters of identification, such a report has to be shared with the State government, which is bound to deal with it, in accordance with provisions of Article 338B. However, the final determination culminates in the exercise undertaken by the President (i.e. the Central Government, under Article 342A (1),” the court clarified. However, “the President’s prerogative as far as the identification and inclusion of SEBCs in the List would not affect the States’ power to make reservations in favour of particular communities or castes, the quantum of reservations, the nature of benefits and the kind of reservations, and all other matters falling within the ambit of Articles 15 and 16”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-alone-can-identify-sebc-sc/article34494409.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Development mattered most, not corruption||A common account given by journalists and scholars who travelled far and wide in West Bengal during the elections was about corruption and cut money. So what happened then that the ruling party still comfortably won the election? Was corruption not an issue? Or is it the case that it was an issue but not on the scale at which was being reported, and that other more bread and butter issues mattered far more? The post-poll data indicate that the case is the latter. When we asked voters in the survey what the single most important issue had been for them while voting, corruption figured way down in the list of issues at the seventh spot — only 2% of our 4,200+ respondents said it had been a consideration for them while deciding whom to vote for (Table 1). What mattered most instead to voters was the larger issue of development. One-third (33%) said development or the desire for more of it is what determined their vote. Data further indicate that those who voted on the basis of development and related issues such as government performance, water and electricity, roads and welfare schemes voted overwhelmingly for the Trinamool Congress. The BJP secured most of the votes of those for whom unemployment, poriborton (change) and corruption were issues. The problem for the BJP, however, was that there were not enough people basing their vote on these issues. We must stress here that it is not that corruption was not a concern for voters. It was. It is just that it was not a major one. Most voters opened up about the issue only when we asked them specifically about it. For instance, on being asked about how corrupt the Trinamool government was in their opinion, one-fourth (23%) described it as being very corrupt, one-third (33%) as somewhat corrupt and one-fourth (26%) as not at all corrupt with the rest being ambivalent (Table 2). Similarly, a little over half (51%) agreed with the statement that there was a lot of corruption in Trinamool as a party.

06 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘INSACOG shared inputs on variants’||The INSACOG consortium of scientists, spanning 10 labs across the country, and involved in sequencing genomes of coronavirus samples in different States, had been giving regular updates on the threat from new strains to the government, said a senior member of the group. “The INSACOG members have meetings every alternate day. Whatever the results of analysis that emerge from the threat posed by new strains is shared with the National Centres for Disease Control and being a Health Ministry [body] is naturally shared with government,” Rakesh Mishra, Adviser, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, told The Hindu . Dr. Mishra retired as the Institute’s Director in April and since has been a scientific advisor there. “This system has been in place for most of this year, since the INSACOG system has been put into place,” he said. INSACOG refers to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia. In an interview to the news portal The Wire on Tuesday, Dr. Mishra said that warnings of an increase in cases from the increasing prevalence of new variants were conveyed to the government channels that eventually could likely have made their way to the Prime Minister’s Office. At a press meeting on Wednesday, Health Ministry officials said that information on genome sequencing had been shared with States twice in February, 2021, four times in March 2021, and again four times in April. Stringent measures In a video conference with States, the Union Health Ministry said it was informed about the current status of Variants of Concern and new mutants and “stressed on increased and stringent public health interventions”. The current surge in cases could be correlated with the rise in the B.1.617 lineage of SARS CoV-2, popularly known as the “Indian variant” of the coronavirus, the officials added. Dr. Mishra, in response to the interviewer’s questions in his interview to The Wire , agreed that India’s political leadership should have been more communicative about the risks that events such as political rallies and religious gatherings posed, in the way of crowding, and transmission of newer infectious variants getting magnified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/insacog-shared-inputs-on-variants/article34494429.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘Surge may go down by end of May’||The current COVID-19 surge in India may begin to start tapering between the middle and end of May, virologist Gagandeep Kang said on Wednesday. At a virtual interaction with members of the Indian Women Press Corps, Dr. Kang said, “Best guess estimates from a number of models put this somewhere between the middle and end of the month. Some models have it [second wave] going out in early June. Based on what we are seeing now, middle to end of May would be a reasonable estimate.” The first Indian woman scientist to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society also dispelled doubts over the efficacy of the two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — currently available in India and said more options would be available soon. “The vaccines offer lot of protection against disease, severe disease; good protection against disease and some protection against infection. If you are protected against infection, you also don’t transmit to the next person. So the vaccines are working very well against severe disease and death,” said Dr. Kang, adding that they may not prevent infection but definitely decrease infection. Dr. Kang attributed the second surge to the virus spreading among two segments which escaped the COVID-19 wrath last year – the middle class and the rural population. Sharing data from Our World in Data, she said the size of the peak that is seen now is three-and-a-half to four times seen earlier. “The likelihood is that when we begin to see a decline, it will also be reasonably rapid as the virus would have had the opportunity to burn through the population,” she said. Dr. Kang said, “Despite a decline in testing, we are pretty close to the limit that we could potentially reach, somewhere around four to four-and-a half lakh cases per day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/surge-may-go-down-by-end-of-may/article34494432.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||5G: China expresses ‘concern, regret’||China on Wednesday expressed “concern and regret” at India’s move to not include Chinese telecommunication firms among the companies permitted this week to conduct trials for the use of 5G technology. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, speaking at a Global Dialogue Series event in London, reiterated India’s view on Wednesday that it is “not realistic” to have good relations in other domains when there was tension on the border. Mr. Jaishankar did not specifically mention the 5G issue, but said broadly on India’s view on the relationship: “I can’t have friction, coercion, intimidation, and bloodshed on the border, and then say let us have a good relationship in other domains. It is not realistic.” On Tuesday, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave permission to several Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to conduct 5G trials, and did not include Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. “The applicant TSPs include Bharti Airtel Ltd., Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., Vodafone Idea Ltd. and MTNL,” the announcement said, adding they had “tied up with original equipment manufacturers and technology providers which are Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and C-DOT” while Reliance Jio Infocomm will conduct trials using its own indigenous technology. Reacting to the move, the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement it “express[es] concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian Telecom Service Providers in India”. “Relevant Chinese companies have been operating in India for years, providing mass job opportunities and making contribution to India’s infrastructure construction in telecommunications,” spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said. He said moves to “exclude Chinese telecommunications companies from the trials” would “harm their legitimate rights and interests”. “The Chinese side hopes that India could do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation, and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory investment and business environment for market entities from all countries, including China, to operate and invest in India.” At Wednesday’s dialogue, Mr. Jaishankar said the relationship was “going through a very difficult phase, because in violation of agreements and understandings of many, many years, the Chinese have deployed a very large part of their military on, and close to, the Line of Actual Control, without explanation, and they continue to be there”. Mr. Jaishankar noted it had been one year since the LAC crisis began, on May 5, 2020 with reports of tensions then starting in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake. He said China’s “actions have disturbed peace and tranquillity”, including leading to bloodshed in Galwan last June, and India “has been very clear that peace and tranquillity on the border areas is essential for the development of our relations”. The disengagement process was completed in some areas but one year on is still ongoing in others, and both sides had not yet come to the de-escalation part. On Friday’s phone call with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the External Affairs Minister said both sides had discussed their mutual interest in cooperating on tackling COVID-19 at a time when Indian companies have placed many orders to source supplies from China amid the current crisis. ‘Very laudable’ He told Mr. Wang that “many of our companies are ordering stuff from China and we are encountering difficulties in logistics, so please take a look at it which is something which we would appreciate”. “After our conversation things did move,” he said. “Some of our airlines got quicker approvals, the logistics chain is flowing, and that is something which is very laudable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5g-china-expresses-concern-regret/article34494389.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||BJP failed to attract Congress, Left supporters||The success of the BJP in West Bengal during the 2019 Lok Sabha election was largely made possible due to a significant shift amongst traditional Left and Congress supporters towards it. The Lokniti-CSDS NES 2019 post-poll data indicated — around two-fifths of traditional Left voters and one-third of traditional Congress supporters voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha election, helping it achieve its unexpected victories. The BJP needed two things to win the 2021 election — either it had to make a bigger dent in the traditional base of the Left and the Congress, and/or mobilise a sizeable number of unattached voters. It seems to have failed on both these accounts. According to our post-poll data, the BJP managed to wean away only 33% of traditional Left voters and 25% of Congress supporters to its side. This is 6 to 7 percentage points less than what it had managed in 2019. Half the traditional Left Front and around two-fifths of traditional Congress voters stuck with their traditional choices and voted for the Left-Congress-ISF joint alliance instead of opting for the BJP. To be sure, not many (only 9%) in our survey this time described themselves as traditional Left-Congress voters. Many of Left-Congress loyalists, we suspect chose to describe themselves as unattached this time — as many as two-fifths of all respondents said they were not a supporter of any particular party. However, among this pool of voters too the BJP could not make any massive gains, securing only 45% of their support. The failure to capitalise on the ambivalent and uncertain vote seems to have done the damage for the BJP.

06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Committed to free media, says Election Commission||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday said it was unanimously against asking for restrictions on the media when it approached the Supreme Court last week against the oral observations made by the Madras High Court that it was responsible for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, which witnessed Assembly elections recently. “The Election Commission of India has taken note of recent narrative relating to its position in relation to media. The Commission has also come across certain press reports in the same regard. The Commission always has appropriate deliberations before any decisions are taken. In the context of involvement of media, the Commission wishes to clarify that it stands sincerely committed to its faith in free media,” an ECI statement said. The statement came after the Indian Express reported on Wednesday that there was a disagreement between Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra and Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar on whether to move the top court. ‘Unanimous decision’ The Commission said: “The Commission as a whole and each one of its members recognise the positive role played by media in the conduct of all elections in the past and present and in strengthening electoral democracy in the country. The Election Commission was unanimous that before Hon’ble Supreme Court there should not be any prayer for restriction on media reporting.” The Commission added that its approach with the media was one of an ally and that it remained unchanged. HC rebuke Hearing the case, the Supreme Court had said the media could not be stopped from reporting oral remarks of judges during a hearing. The Madras High Court had observed that officials of the Election Commission should be charged with murder due to the spread of COVID-19 during the Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/committed-to-free-media-says-election-commission/article34494400.ece

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Customers looking for oxygen concentrators online duped||A person, believed to be operating from Delhi, allegedly cheated dozens of people ordering oxygen concentrators through a popular e-commerce platform. The scam was exposed after a city-based businessman N. Kannan of Periyar Nagar lodged a complaint with the Chennai police that the suspect took Rs. 1 lakh via bank transfer and failed to deliver two oxygen concentrators that he had ordered for an old age home here. Acting on specific inputs, the Delhi Police froze the suspect’s bank account, though he had already withdrawn the entire money transferred by unsuspecting people who placed orders for oxygen concentrators or other life-saving gadgets.  The Mumbai Police are also looking for the suspect, who used the GST number of a reputed textiles firm in the invoices that he issued to fool people. Since the contact address he gave was in Maharashtra, the Chennai police alerted their counterparts in Mumbai. However, investigators from the Mumbai Crime Branch found that the mobile phones of the suspect, which were switched off, were never active in Maharashtra but were used in Noida and Delhi. In view of the pandemic and lockdown/travel restrictions in different States, it would be difficult for police to zero-in on such suspects. But the digital footprints would help in establishing his identity and lead to his arrest, a police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/customers-looking-for-oxygen-concentrators-online-duped/article34494433.ece

According to reports reaching here, 86 fishermen from Pamban and other hamlets had ventured into the sea on May 3 in 11 boats. The Sri Lankan Navy personnel, on surveillance, secured the fishermen and took them to a camp, where they were detained for 10 hours.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Maratha quota is unconstitutional: SC||In 1992, a nine-judge Bench of the court had drawn the “Lakshman rekha” for reservation in jobs and education at 50%, except in “extraordinary circumstances.” However, over the years, several States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have crossed the rubicon and passed laws, which allow reservation shooting over 60%. The judgment would have an impact on the reservation dynamics in these States which have crossed the 50% ceiling limit. The Indira Sawhney judgment had categorically said “50% shall be the rule, only in certain exceptional and extraordinary situations for bringing far-flung and remote areas population into mainstream said 50% rule can be relaxed.” Justice Bhushan, in the lead opinion on the Maratha law, said that appointments made under it following the Bombay High Court judgment endorsing the State law would hold, but they would get no further benefits. Students already admitted under the Maratha quota law would continue. Students admitted to postgraduate courses would not be affected since they were not given reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maratha-quota-unconstitutional-sc/article34494395.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||SC demands oxygen supply plan for Delhi||The Bench, however, stayed a Delhi High Court order initiating contempt action against the Centre’s officers for the short supply of oxygen to Delhi. “Hauling officers up for contempt will not bring oxygen to Delhi,” Justice Chandrachud reasoned. “Contempt is when something is done absolutely wilfully,” Justice Shah said. “This is a national crisis, nobody can dispute that the Centre has not done anything... But still what is your plan for distribution and assessment of requirement of oxygen,” he asked Mr. Mehta. The court asked the Centre and the Delhi government officials to get the help of the Maharashtra government and consult with the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation, especially its Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. The court asked the Centre to take a leaf from Maharashtra’s successful management of oxygen supply, creation of storage tanks, etc, when the active case load was up to 92,000 in Mumbai. Mr. Mehta agreed there was nothing wrong for the Centre to consult the municipal body. “Yes ... these shared experiences can be put to use in Delhi. The administrative experiences of Mumbai can be replicated in Delhi to the extent feasible ... If densely populated Mumbai could install storage tanks, it can certainly be done in Delhi,” Justice Chandrachud said. The court asked why the Centre and the Delhi government did not devise a mechanism to tell people “upfront and on a transparent basis that there will be so much allocation of oxygen today, so much distribution, this is the availability of tankers and this is when the oxygen train will arrive ... Please publicise. Let people know”. Justice Chandrachud said the “current situation of pandemic in Delhi was critical ... Tell us about the logistics so that we can help ... How much is being allocated and supplied in real time? Lack of oxygen is causing tremendous anxiety. People are unable to get cylinders...” “We have stopped industrial use of oxygen, philanthropists have come forward. There is 9,000 MT of liquid medical oxygen for use now ... Question is how to divide this among States?” Mr. Mehta submitted. Mr. Mehta said the Centre had formed an expert panel of V.K. Paul, Member of the NITI Aayog; Randeep Guleria, AIIMS Director; Director-General, ICMR, and Directorate General of Health Services for computing oxygen requirement on a pan-India basis. But the court found the “formula” suggested by the panel “unscientific”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-demands-oxygen-supply-plan-for-delhi/article34494397.ece

Though cylinders were used for providing oxygen to the patients, five COVID-19 patients had died by Tuesday evening. In the meanwhile, the district administration made arrangements for filling the oxygen tankers on Tuesday but the supply was not quite enough, leading to the death of 13 COVID-19 patients about 3 a.m. on Wednesday, doctors at the hospital said.

06 May 2021||Mumbai,||‘PM must ensure quota’||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show similar “courage” in ensuring reservation for the Maratha community as he had done in the case of Article 370. Mr. Thackeray said the Supreme Court verdict striking down reservation for the Marathas was “disappointing”. “Court has said that it is Centre’s right [in deciding reservation] and I am sure that neither PM nor President will disappoint the Maratha community. I will be writing to Prime Minister on Thursday for the same. We want him to show the courage shown while dealing with Article 370 this time too,” he added. Earlier, the Chief Minister said he could not welcome the verdict as the court had scrapped the law “unanimously passed by the sovereign State legislature”. “The court in its verdict has said that State has no right to give reservation and it stands only with Prime Minister and President. Since we have been guided by the apex court, we now request both with folded hands to take a decision and ensure reservation to the Maratha community,” he said. The Chief Minister said the Centre should be proactive in the case as it was regarding the Shah Bano case and Article 370. Earlier Mr. Thackeray said Rajya Sabha member Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje had been seeking appointment with Mr. Modi for one year on the issue, but to no avail. “We cannot welcome this verdict which has given power to Prime Minister, but I appeal to the people to not spoil the atmosphere in Maharashtra using this verdict,” he said. Mr. Sambhajiraje was made Rajya Sabha member by the BJP and represents the lineage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the warrior king. State Minister Ashok Chavan, who headed the State Cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, alleged that the previous Devendra Fadnavis government “misled the legislature” by bringing an Act despite having no authority to do so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-must-ensure-quota/article34494417.ece

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Realising the supreme one||Kooratazhvan explained profound concepts in a simple manner, and we find this in his Varadaraja Stavam, a composition in praise of Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram, said Valayapet Ramachariar in a discourse. We have to rely on the Vedas to understand the Supreme One. But not many understand what the Vedas say. Some misinterpret them. It is given only to a few blessed people to understand what the Vedas say. They must be recipients of the Lord’s grace even at the time of birth. The rest think that propitiating other devatas like Brahma will earn liberation for them. But other devatas too function with limitations. Exiting the earth and going to Brahma’s abode is just exchanging one prison for another. If on the earth we are bound by iron chains, in Brahma loka, we will be bound by golden chains. While telling us about the Paramatma, the Vedas say what He is not like. By a process of elimination, they seek to explain the Supreme One. But Hastigiri, the hill on which Lord Varadaraja of Kanchi resides, helps us recognise Paramatma easily. The moment we do a pradakshina of Hastigiri, we feel energised, and then when we worship Varadaraja, we realise that we are before the Paramatma. When Krishna went as a messenger of Pandavas, Duryodhana ordered that no one was to rise when He entered. But the moment Krishna entered, Duryodhana himself rose from his throne. Such is the tejas of the Lord that we worship Him the moment we see Him. Varadaraja shows us His Supremacy and His saulabhya. Thiruvarangathu Amudanar says in Ramanuja Nootrandadi that we have suffered on the earth in our several births, But the Lord has given us the blessing of following the path laid down by Ramanujacharya, who was dear to the strong shouldered Varadaraja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/realising-the-supreme-one/article34494418.ece

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New Assembly will have more MLAs facing criminal cases||The average worth of the assets of Members of the Legislative Assembly and the percentage of legislators with criminal cases went up in 2021 when compared to 2016, an analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms, released on Wednesday, showed. According to the analysis, while 34% of the elected MLAs were facing criminal cases in 2016, it increased to 60% in 2021. In absolute numbers, at least 134 MLAs elected in 2021 faced criminal cases, of whom 57 had criminal cases for offences of a serious nature. ADR’s analysis included only 224 of the 234 MLAs. Details of eight MLAs from the DMK and two from the Congress were not included in the analysis due to lack of availability of proper data, the organisation said. For similar reasons, the comparison to 2016 included only 223 of the 234 MLAs, it said. 85% crorepatis More than 85% of the elected MLAs are crorepatis, compared to 76% in 2016. Consequently, the analysis showed that the average worth of assets of MLAs increased by nearly 50% from Rs. 8.21 crore in 2016 to Rs. 12.27 crore in 2021. E. Subaya of AIADMK, who got elected from Ambasamudram constituency in Tirunelveli district, is the wealthiest candidate with a total worth of Rs. 246 crore. K.

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown leaves flyers in the lurch||Ahead of the lockdown that begins on Thursday, eights flights were cancelled, putting hundreds of passengers to hardship. According to officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) on Wednesday, eight flights — four departures and four arrivals — were cancelled to and from Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad and Kozhikode. While the airlines cited operational reasons, some officials said one of the reasons for the cancellations could be poor patronage. “When a flight has very few passengers, airlines cancel it because it may not be profitable for them to operate the flight, and ultimately passengers suffer. This was particularly high last year when the lockdown was in place. Now we are again beginning to see this happen,” an official said. In some cases, flights were getting rescheduled, upsetting passengers’ travel plan. Officials said it could be for the same reason of not having adequate bookings to operate a flight and hence it could get rescheduled. On Tuesday, for instance, for the flights to Mysuru and Salem, there were less than five passengers. These days, even to major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru or Hyderabad, sometimes, the number of passengers travelling is just about 30 to 40, the officials said. Good demand “But interestingly what we have noticed is, to destinations like Patna and Guwahati, there are still a lot of people taking flights,” the official said. Passengers have taken to social media, tagging airlines, to enquire about refund of fares.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-leaves-flyers-in-the-lurch/article34495074.ece

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IMD predicts hot days from May 10||Most parts of the State are being spared of soaring mercury levels even as peak summer days, the season locally referred to as Kathiri , has started. Favourable wind pattern and weather system over the Bay of Bengal has kept the day temperatures close to normal so far. On Wednesday, the weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 35 degree Celsius, which are close to average day temperature for the day. However, people in coastal regions would experience sultry weather due to the high humidity levels as in 70% at Nungambakkam. In its bulletin, the Meteorological Department has said the humidity level hovered between 50% and 90% over the coastal and adjoining districts. People may experience a “real feel” temperature that is likely to be more than the normal by four or five degree Celsius. Officials of the Meteorological Department said that a trough or wind discontinuity, a line across which there would be an abrupt change in wind direction, would spark up thunderstorms with light to moderate rains in few places over Western Ghats, interior and southern parts of Tamil Nadu till May 8. Thundershowers may be restricted to Western Ghats till the weekend. In 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. Wednesday, Suralacode in Kanniyakumari district and Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district received 7 cm of rains each. N. Puviarasan, Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, said a cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and the neighbourhood would influence pre-monsoon showers over parts of the State. Recalling the heat wave period during early April, he said wind direction was a major determining factor for rise or fall in day temperature. Anticyclone system An anticyclone, a weather phenomenon that has winds in clockwise direction slowly blowing around it, is prevailing over the Bay of Bengal. This had been pushing cool, moist east-southeasterly winds into the Tamil Nadu region and keeping maximum temperature close to average. However, there may be a rise in mercury level after May 10 as this system may disappear and the anticyclone over Arabian sea bringing in westerly winds would persist. As the hot westerlies are expected to blow across the inland, temperature was set to rise, officials said. The department forecasts that the maximum and minimum temperature will be around 36 degree Celsius and 28 degree Celsius in Chennai till Friday.  A cyclonic circulation over Comorin area and neighbourhood will influence pre-monsoon showers in State N.

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Disclose rationale behind allocation of vaccines, drugs and oxygen to the States’||The Madras High Court on Wednesday advised the Centre to disclose the basis on which it had been allocating COVID-19 vaccines, drugs, oxygen and the like to various States and Union Territories fighting the raging second wave of the pandemic. The court felt that the States might stop complaining of discrimination in allotment if the Centre explains to them the rationale behind the allocation. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the suggestion to Additional Solicitor General (ASG) R. Sankaranarayanan during the hearing of a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court to monitor the steps being taken by the State government as well as the Centre to curtail the spread of the virus and to flatten the COVID curve. During the course of the hearing, senior counsel P. Wilson, also a Rajya Sabha member representing Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, said all five southern States had agreed for the allotment of 500 tonnes of oxygen per day to Tamil Nadu. Nevertheless, the Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGS) at the Centre was not clearing the allocation by citing some court cases which had no relevance whatsoever to Tamil Nadu. Claiming that the State was running out of oxygen, he urged the court to direct the ASG to get instructions on the issue from the EGS by Thursday. Mr. Sankaranarayanan agreed to ascertain the status on allocation of oxygen to the State. He, however, informed the court that the Centre had already allotted 1,35,500 vials of Remedesivir to Tamil Nadu for the block period between April 21 and May 9. When Justice Ramamoorthy wanted to know the basis on which the Centre had allocated 1.35 lakh vials to Tamil Nadu, the ASG said it was based on the number of COVID-19 active cases in every State. “For instance, the number of positive cases is more in Maharashtra, so it is allotted more oxygen,” the law officer said, and the judge suggested that the rationale behind the allocation must be publicised. On his part, the Chief Justice wanted to know by when the Sterlite Copper smelting plant in Thoothukudi would start producing medical oxygen. He said the oxygen produced in the plant might benefit all of India. “The virus does not choose Tamil Nadu, give Andhra an escape and then choose Odisha and give Bengal an escape. The virus goes for anyone that it hits. It does not differentiate. We are one country. We must all be together. We must cooperate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/disclose-rationale-behind-allocation-of-vaccines-drugs-and-oxygen-to-states-says-high-court/article34494566.ece

06 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Migrant workers start leaving Chennai||With retail establishments, malls, and service industries to be shut due to the new lockdown restrictions in the State from May 6, many migrant workers employed in these sectors have started leaving the city. On Wednesday, over 100 people from Nepal, who were working in the city, booked three buses to reach their home town. Meanwhile, omni bus owners wanted the government to ensure there was a system in place for the workers to reach their home town to prevent them from falling prey to touts. The State government has announced fresh restrictions from 4 a.m. on May 6 to 4 a.m. on May 20, to contain the spread of COVID-19. Among them were directions that except for non air-conditioned provision and grocery stores, all other shops are not allowed to function. All spas and saloons in the State are shut and only take away service allowed in restaurants and hotels. Many working in these establishments have started leaving the city for their home town. “I have been working in a bakery in Chromepet for the past one year. But now the shop has been closed. The owner gave us a month’s salary. But since the shop is closed, we decided to leave. Our employer will find it hard to manage the rent, he will not be able to pay us in the coming months,” said Tegh, who along with 100 others, were waiting to board the bus they had booked. These 100 workers from different parts of the city are from Nepal and they had booked three buses. Each one had paid Rs. 5,000 as bus fare. “We will reach our villages in three to four days. Once things settle down, we may come back for work,” said Tegh Bahadur who used to work in a restaurant on R.K. Salai. Bus owners’ plea Mohammed A. Afzal, president, Omni Bus Owners’ Association, said the government should coordinate with companies, where these migrant workers are employed, and the association to ensure they were able to travel without any hassle. “Last time, a gang created a fake website of ours and cheated workers by collecting Rs. 5,000 as advance from them. When they landed at our office, they realised they had been conned. We had filed a complaint with the cyber crime wing of the city police and they found that the gang was operating from Noida. We finally got some sponsors and the workers were taken free of cost to their home town,” he said. Vijay Bhaskaran, who works for the welfare of migrant workers, said that even last year workers from Nepal booked buses and went home. “It is important to know if the government has the data so that some action can be planned. Last time, they did not know,” he said. Ravin Carr, who formed the Chennai Migrant Task Force, said situation was under control as many workers were still employed. “So, a majority of the workforce has not left and since the train services are operational, there is no confusion. But on Saturdays, migrant workers throng the railway stations as Sunday is a full lockdown,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/migrant-workers-start-leaving-chennai/article34494596.ece

It will construct rooms for the unit and carry out the electrical works. This follows the Centre’s announcement that DRDO’s oxygen units will be given to hospitals to tide over the pandemic. NHAI sources said they had already held discussions with officials in the State Health Department and asked that land be identified in these hospitals within a day. The Union Health Ministry identified the hospitals in consultation with the State government. “We are identifying contractors who can execute the work quickly and without delays. We will work with our own contractors, who have enough stocks of cement and steel, so that we will not have to call for tenders separately. The works are expected to commence simultaneously at all locations in a day or two,” said an official. It will cost around Rs. 15 lakh to set up one facility and the total cost is expected to be around Rs. 20 crore. “We have been given a deadline of 10 days to complete the construction,” another official said. The NHAI will be creating a room that will hold air treatment and gas separation control units, an air dryer unit, an oxygen generator, an air receiver, a control panel and a pressure regulation system. The weight of the entire unit will be 4,100 kg. In the design, care has been taken to ensure that separate earth lines are provided for each component.

Stalin, after his appointment as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu by Governor Banwarilal Purohit, called upon private hospitals to dedicate themselves to fully to protect people who are in constant fear about their lives. In a statement here, he requested private hospitals to allocate more than 50% of the beds for treating COVID-19 patients. Describing the situation as medical emergency, he said private hospitals should function according to the situation. Mr. Stalin said it would be useful to the public if private hospitals published online the details about the availability of beds and oxygen. “Also give concession in hospital charges. Show mercy on the poor and protect their lives,” he appealed. Mr. Stalin said it was a difficult time, but that could be overcome. “If we work together, we can save our lives and plan a happy future. Everyone’s life is precious, and it should not be thrown out just like that,” he said. Fresh restrictions to contain the spread would come into force from Thursday, he said. He had asked the Chief Secretary to set up a war room to coordinate and ensure the availability of beds, oxygen requirement and vaccines. He said the war room would monitor the oxygen stock and the areas where it would be required. “I have asked officials to ensure transparency on this issue. Medical professionals will function like warriors,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-urges-pvt-clinics-to-join-virus-fight/article34495084.ece

In a statement, he said with the case against the 69% reservation set to come up in the court after the summer vacation, the State should immediately undertake the caste-wise census in Tamil Nadu and submit the data to the top court. “Since the Supreme Court said that reservation can be based only on caste-wise population data eight years ago, the court will not accept any data other than that,” Mr. Anbumani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/undertake-caste-wise-census/article34495083.ece

06 May 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||No immediate change in bus services, says TNSTC||Following the fresh set of COVID-19 restrictions announced by the State government from Thursday, officials from the Coimbatore Division of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) said that there are no immediate plans to change the number of bus services operated in Coimbatore district. As of Tuesday, the TNSTC operates around 640 town buses and 300 mofussil buses in the district. Low occupancy With occupancy taking a hit since the imposition of the night curfew in April, there will be no major change in these numbers, officials said. While most of the total fleet of 1,012 TNSTC buses for the district is operational, the decision to increase or decrease the bus services will be taken depending on the situation, the officials added. On Monday, the State government announced a slew of new restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19, which included limiting the occupancy of the number of passengers in government and private buses to 50%. Following poor patronage for the buses amidst the aggressive second wave of the pandemic, the TNSTC’s per day revenue has been nearly 60% less in comparison to 2019 for Coimbatore district, according to the officials. Private buses likely to cease operations Over 300 private buses that are operated in Coimbatore district, including more than 100 town buses operated in the Coimbatore Corporation limits, will likely not ply on the roads after Thursday. Financial stress A private bus operator, who operates three buses each in Coimbatore city and Pollachi, said that private buses have already been under financial stress owing to poor occupancy during the past year. Operating the buses with only 50% of the passengers from Thursday would not be financially viable, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-immediate-change-in-bus-services-says-tnstc/article34495087.ece
06 May 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination centre at Govt Arts College shut||The COVID-19 vaccination centre run by the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) at the Government Arts College here was temporarily shut on Wednesday morning due to non-availability of vaccines. A board was placed outside the main gate which said that vaccines were not available on Wednesday. An official from CMCH said that the hospital administration was not sure when it could resume the drive. On Tuesday, a board was placed outside the centre informing people that the vaccine stock was over after administering vaccines for about an hour. The COVID-19 vaccination centre of CMCH was shifted to the college last week to avoid crowding of people at the hospital. The college was witnessing a huge rush of people as it was one of the few centres where vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, were available. The rush at government-run vaccination centres in Coimbatore district increased from April 30 when the Health Department stopped supplying vaccines to private hospitals due to acute shortage. Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation said the civic body could not administer either Covaxin or Covishield. This was due to shortage of vaccines for the last four days. At all the 32 Urban Primary Health Centres, the staff had to unfortunately turn away people because of the shortage, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-centre-at-govt-arts-college-shut/article34495097.ece

06 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||MNM, NTK spoil DMK’s chances in Coimbatore||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) seem to have played a role in AIADMK candidates winning in six of the 10 Assembly constituencies, as the votes the two parties’ candidates had got in the just-concluded Assembly election was more than victory margin. Of the remaining four, in Sulur, AIADMK’s V.P. Kandasamy polled 1.18 lakh, which was 31,932 votes more than Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi candidate Premier Selvam, who contested with the DMK’s rising sun symbol. The vote difference was more than the total of votes the MNM (12,658) and NTK (14,426) had polled. Similarly in Thondamuthur, AIADMK’s S.P. Velumani had polled 41,630 votes more than his DMK rival Karthikeya Sivasenapathy, which was much more than the total of votes polled by MNM and NTK – 19,648. In Coimbatore South, which saw a triangular contest because of MNM president Kamal Haasan’s candidature, Congress candidate Mayura Jayakumar was pushed to the third slot. And, in Valparai, AIADMK candidate T.K. Amulkandasami’s victory margin of 12,223 was more than the votes the MNM and NTK had polled. But the scenario in Mettupalayam, Kavundampalayam, Coimbatore North, Singanallur, Kinathukadavu and Pollachi is different. In Mettupalayam, AIADMK’s A.K. Selvaraj managed a lead of only 2,456 votes, which was fewer than the 10,954 votes that the NTK had polled. In Kavundampalayam too, AIADMK candidate P.R.G. Arunkumar’s victory margin of 9,776 votes is fewer than the MNM candidate’s 23,527 and NTK candidate’s 17,897. Similarly, in Coimbatore North, the AIADMK’s victory margin is fewer than the votes polled by MNM (26,503) and NTK (11,433). In Singanallur, which was more or less a triangular contest, the MNM candidate R. Mahendran had polled more than 50% of what the DMK candidate N. Karthik had polled – 70,390 votes or 34.84% of the votes polled. Mr. Mahendran had secured 36,855 votes or 18.24%. In Kinathukadavu, the DMK’s Kurichi Prabhakaran had polled 1,095 votes fewer than the AIADMK candidate. This was way fewer than the votes polled by the MNM and NTK candidates, who, together, had garnered 10.85% votes. And, in Pollachi, AIADMK’s V. Jayaraman 1,725 vote lead over DMK candidate was less than what the MNM and NTK candidates had polled. Commenting on the impact of MNM and NTK in Coimbatore, DMK Coimbatore east urban unit in-charge N. Karthik said the DMK could have easily won six seats but for the MNM and NTK as the anti-AIADMK votes had a three-way split. Particularly, in Singanallur, the AIADMK candidate K.R. Jayaram led from the first round to the last round. And, the AIADMK candidate polled the maximum votes in 28 of the 33 rounds. He polled more votes than Mr. Jayaram and Mr. Mahendran in only five rounds. Further, Mr. Karthik pointed out that Mr. Mahendran, who had contested the 2019 Parliamentary election in Coimbatore constituency, had polled 28,634 votes in the Singanallur Assembly segment and in two years, he had managed to increase his vote share to 36,855. These were the anti-AIADMK votes that went to the MNM, and, thereby, led to his (Mr. Karthik) defeat, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mnm-ntk-spoil-dmks-chances-in-coimbatore/article34494611.ece

Murugesan, 52, who sells tender coconut on Gandhiji Road in Erode, is likely to be affected by the new restrictions on closure of shops at noon from Thursday. He is among the many street vendors selling seasonal fruits and drinks along the roadside, who want the State government to extend business hours till 5 p.m., as Kathiri Veyil (‘dog days’) has started. With mercury levels soaring to 38 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, the demand for watermelon, sweet lime, muskmelon, palmyra fruit, buttermilk, sugarcane juice, tender coconut, cucumbers and kambam koozh (pearl millet porridge) is also on the rise. Temporary shops selling these items are seen in the city and on the outskirts. “Last year’s lockdown completely affected our business. We only started to recover slowly now. But, we fear the restrictions in business hours will further affect us,” said Murugesan. With the start of Kathiri Veyil , more people visit these shops to keep themselves cool and hydrated. “Our main business is from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.,” said P. Mariyamma, who sells sugarcane juice in Solar. She said that business had dropped by over 70% in the current season and the little earnings would ensure proper food for her family every day. “Due to the increase in temperature, customers started visiting the juice stalls and these restrictions will halt the business completely,” she said. Vendors say there is no over-crowding in the roadside shops and wanted the government to extend business hours for them as juices and other drinks are essential during summer. “Even if people stay indoors, they need refreshments to tackle the scorching heat”, said Pushpa, who sells watermelon on Karur Bypass Road.

06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||KCR to write to PM for adequate vaccine supply: CS||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will soon write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking enhancement of vaccine supply to Telangana as the current supply was not matching the requirements of the State. Informing this during a press conference here on Wednesday, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said the State government was corresponding with the Central government as well as vaccine manufacturing firms for the last few days for supply of adequate doses of vaccine to the State. The State had been asking for a liberalised policy for enhancing production of vaccines and other consumables, but there was no response so far. He lamented that while the requirement of the State was to the tune of 3.5 crore doses to vaccinate all the 1.7 crore people aged between 18 and 45 years, the Centre had allotted 3.9 lakh doses for May. “This is just about 1% of the requirement,” he said. The policy and procedures were being controlled by the Centre, which was making allotment of the quantum of vaccine to States. “Though we have the manufacturing facility here, the allotment has to be done by the Centre,” he added. Mr. Somesh Kumar also said that in spite of the shortage of vaccine, the government was able to vaccinate 42.24 lakh people so far, with two lakh being vaccinated every day on an average. The recent change in policy by the Centre over vaccination mandated that people over 45 years would be vaccinated first. Pre-booking of vaccination had been put in place as the supply got reduced. This would also ensure there was no overcrowding in vaccine centres thus reducing the scope for spread of the virus. The Chief Secretary however, exuded confidence that the situation would improve next month as vaccine production was set to increase and one more vaccine candidate was ready to enter the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kcr-to-write-to-pm-for-adequate-vaccine-supply-cs/article34494440.ece
06 May 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Road to freedom was a four-month long wait for them||Little Dhanalakshmi held out her tiny hand to show her missing left ring finger. Her finger got cut by a brick cutting wire, said her mother 22-year-old Sumathy. On April 23, outside the RDO’s office here, five families of Irula tribes, including 10 children, aged between 1 and 6, had been rescued from a brick kiln in Madathaanur in Pochampally taluk of Krishnagiri district that day. Earlier, an activist from the National Adivasi Solidarity Council (NASC), a grassroot organisation working with tribals, called The Hindu seeking help. The officials were huddled in a video conference with the Election Commission on the counting day arrangements, and the rescued were awaiting the arrival of the RDO for a release certificate. Late that night, they were formally released and sent home. But, something went unrecorded. Their road to freedom was a four-month long wait, in violation of the Bonded Labour System(Abolition) Act 1976, and its standard operating procedures. These families had unwittingly forfeited their freedoms for little advances either they took or their elders took five years ago in their villages in Chengam in Thiruvannamalai. Picked up by agents, they came to the brick kilns here five years ago. They were found by the field workers of the NASC during one of the field surveys in brick kiln areas looking for signs of bonded labour. On January 6, 2021, the Council petitioned the Revenue Divisional Officer, Krishnagiri G. Karpagavalli seeking immediate rescue of bonded labourers from Irula tribes in a brick kiln in Pochampalli. Only that they did not give out the exact location, fearing a tip-off. But the RDO insisted on the location. A month later, on February 12, the NASC petitioned the Collector and the same was forwarded to the RDO, again. No rescue was forthcoming. Finally, on March 12, the NASC approached the District Legal Services Authority(DLSA)seeking intervention through its judicial powers. Under the Bonded Labour Abolition Act, a rescue should be carried out within 24 hours of complaint, which can even be oral, says K.Krishnan, secretary, NASC. The RDO Karpagavalli enquired the families in the presence of the brick kiln manager, alleged the NASC advocate V. Ammu. “Children born and brought up there, but were never sent to school. Even the elders don’t have Aadhaar card. They were not allowed to go for a family bereavement, were not allowed to vote,” says Ms. Ammu. When contacted, RDO Karpagavalli asked, “How can we take action, without they divulging the location. I would have asked the local tahsildar to go verify.” However, activists contended the issue was less about trust but about standard operating procedure that advises caution to eliminate leak and protect evidence. “The information given to the tahsildar is given to the local VAO, who may be embedded and tip off the owners. We have experienced all this in many cases,’ says Ms. Ammu. Eventually, the rescue took place at the intervention of the magistrate of the Legal services authority after the NLSC threatened to move the High Court. FIRs have been filed against the brick kiln owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/road-to-freedom-was-a-four-month-long-wait-for-them/article34494615.ece
06 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea challenges proposed flyover project in Karur||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the State government and sought a response in a public interest litigation petition that challenged a proposed flyover project in Karur district. A Division Bench of Justices M.S. Ramesh and B. Pugalendhi sought response in the petition filed by Karur-Kovai Road Merchants Welfare Association represented by its president K.N. Vimalnath. The case was adjourned till June. In 2008, lands were acquired on Karur-Coimbatore Highway for expansion as a four-lane road. This reduced traffic congestion. But now, there was a proposal to construct a flyover to a length of 580 metres on theroad. The proposed flyover was meant for only light motor vehicles and two-wheelers. Instead of the flyover, the road could be widened. The total width of the road was 40 metres and the present carriageway was only 17 metres. The State government had announced a proposal to build a new ring road and there was also another proposal to shift the existing bus stand. If they were implemented, there would be no need for implementing the flyover project, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-challenges-proposed-flyover-project-in-karur/article34494560.ece
06 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||65-year-old man fitted with wireless pacemaker at city hospital||A wireless pacemaker was implanted on a 65-year-old patient at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre here on Wednesday. Though leadless pacemakers have advantages, it is not appropriate in all cases, the hospital has clarified. Unlike a traditional pacemaker, which is placed in a patient’s chest and needs wires (known as leads) to supply energy to heart muscles to beat, the new generation pacemaker is implanted directly into the heart and does not require leads. As it is leadless, there is no question of risk of lead damage (lead fracture), a major complication that is associated with traditional implants that results in malfunction of the pacemaker. The 65-year-old patient, P. Pandian, developed atrioventricular block, a medical condition in which electrical signals between upper and lower chambers of the heart are weakened or damaged. The procedure was carried out by R. Sivakumar, senior consultant, Interventional Cardiology. But it is not appropriate for all cases, he warns. For instance, when patients need dual chamber pacing, they may need only a traditional pacemaker. The main purpose of a pacemaker is to prevent the heart from beating slowly. It stimulates the heart muscle when the heart rate comes down or stops. Traditional pacemakers are implanted in the chest region under the skin and are connected to the heart with the help of leads. The leadless pacemaker is placed inside the heart and does not require any lead. It eliminates complications associated with leads, Dr. Sivakumar says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/65-year-old-man-fitted-with-wireless-pacemaker-at-madurai-hospital/article34494598.ece
06 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court seeks Centre, State response on lockdown restrictions||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the Centre and the State on a public interest litigation petition that challenged certain provisions of the lockdown restrictions imposed in Tamil Nadu in the wake of rapid increase in COVID-19 cases. A Division Bench of Justices M.S. Ramesh and B. Pugalendhi sought a response on the PIL petition filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan of Thoothukudi. Mr. Adityan said the restrictions imposed by the government would affect the common man. People were already suffering financially and facing hardships due to restrictions on travel. Hence, operation of private and public transport with 50% occupancy could be allowed. Additional temporary markets could be opened to avoid congestion. There must be emphasis on ensuring that COVID-19 protocols were strictly followed. Further, the lockdown on Sundays would create congestion on Saturdays and the restrictions were imposed without any scientific reason. They could lead to mental health problems among the public. If it was ensured that the COVID-19 mandatory protocols were strictly followed, there was no need for the lockdown, he added. The judges also sought a response from the Centre and the State in a separate PIL petition filed by the same petitioner seeking a direction for closure of all TASMAC shops in the State till the situation normalised. The petitioner said consumption of alcohol increased the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-centre-state-response-on-lockdown-restrictions/article34494602.ece

06 May 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry will have more MLAs facing criminal charges||The newly constituted 30-member Assembly is as wealthy as its predecessor, but probably with a slightly higher record of trouble with the law and definitely a lot less gender diverse in composition. The 15th Puducherry Legislative Assembly will have more members facing criminal charges than its predecessor with 43% of elected representatives self-declaring criminal cases as against 37% of legislators in the previous Assembly, an analysis of affidavits of the winning candidates by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed. The ADR study also indicated that in terms of wealth, the new Assembly is almost identical to the previous House with 25 of the legislators falling in the crorepati category. However, the new House is poorer in terms of gender parity with only one woman entering the Assembly as against four MLAs of the previous Assembly. G. Nehru (Independent-Orleanpet) is the richest with assets to the tune of Rs. 43 crore, followed by Chief Minister-designate N. Rangasamy (Rs. 38 crore) and BJP’s A. John Kumar (Rs. 26 crore). The ADR study found that 13 of the 30 winning candidates in the 2021 election have declared criminal cases against them — which is higher than the 11 representatives who had declared criminal cases after the 2016 election. The 2021 Assembly also has six members who have declared serious criminal charges against them, such as attempt to murder and electoral violations. In 2016, only four winning candidates had similar grave charges against them. The party-wise breakdown showed that four of the six BJP winners, three of the six DMK winners, three of the 10 AINRC winners and three of the six Independents had declared criminal cases in their affidavits while filing nomination for the April 6 election. As far as serious charges are concerned, three DMK candidates and one candidate each from the BJP, AINRC and Independents fell in this category. On the affluence front, the analysis showed that all six BJP candidates, both winners from Congress, nine of 10 candidates from the AINRC, three of six from DMK and five of six Independents had declared assets valued at over Rs. 1 crore. Overall, while 16 candidates had assets of over Rs. 5 crore, six had assets in the range of Rs. 2 crore to Rs. 5 crore, five in the Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 2 crore range and three in the less than Rs. 50 lakh category. Among major parties, the average assets per winning candidate for the 10 AINRC candidates stood at Rs. 11.21 crore, six BJP candidates at Rs. 11.26 crore, two Congress candidates at Rs. 7.74 crore and six DMK candidates at Rs. 7.15 crore. Only 17 possessed qualification of graduation and above, 11 were between 5th pass and 12th pass, one was a diploma holder and one was illiterate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-will-have-more-mlas-facing-criminal-charges/article34495281.ece

06 May 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||CPI(M) seeks more beds for COVID-19 patients||The CPI (M) has called for the conversion of schools and other available premises into mini-hospitals with beds to take care of the increasing number of COVID-19 patients. In a memorandum to the Lt. Governor, R. Rajangam, CPI(M) secretary, said though guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare specify that home isolation be recommended only for patients with mild symptoms, access to 24X7 medical care and adequate facilities at home, most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Puducherry were being recommended home isolation because of the pressure on hospital resources. “This is a public health crisis and the government needs to intervene immediately,” Mr. Rajangam said.  He urged the Lt. Governor to take necessary steps to make at least 2,000 beds, with medical observation, available for all patients and consider the possibility of converting available government buildings, including but not limited to schools, colleges, community halls and marriage halls, into COVID-19 care centres to overcome the shortage in beds with medical observation and necessary medical equipment, like medical oxygen, ventilators and IV stands. The Health Ministry also issued guidelines for the recruitment of additional medical personnel by extending the employment period of resident doctors, availing supervised voluntary services of medical PG students, final-year MBBS and nursing students, expediting the recruitment of necessary medical personnel and giving due preference in the appointment of permanent medical personnel in the State/Union Territory government services. However, the party said it had come to its notice that the Puducherry Health Department had about 1,000 vacancies for the posts of nurses, doctors and other health workers. “We demand that the Lt. Governor immediately take necessary action to fill the vacant posts and recruit necessary medical personnel to provide effective and quality healthcare to the people of Puducherry,” the memorandum stated. Harassment of patients The memorandum added that in spite of the government instructing private healthcare facilities to provide Remdesivir to patients without reservation, it had come to the party’s notice that a few private healthcare facilities were continuing to harass patients by asking them to procure the injection on their own. The CPI(M) wanted the Lt. Governor to immediately take steps to monitor and proactively prevent the harassment of patients during this critical period.  We demand that the Lt. Governor take steps to fill vacant posts and recruit medical personnel to provide effective and quality healthcare R.

First, rust was removed using thinners. Then coating was given using surgical spirit. They said 108 iron cannon balls were being given a coating of polyvinyl acetate mixed with benzene. The same procedure would be followed for preserving a few more iron cannon balls in the next few days. Conservation of such metal exhibits was being done once in five years. They would soon take up conservation of six cannons made of iron and bronze which are yet another added attraction at the museum. The museum has around 9,000 objects which includes ancient stone idols, metal icons, coins, manuscripts and antique wood carvings besides zoological, geological and botanical specimens. Started at Thirugokarnam in Pudukottai Town by the erstwhile Thondaiman rulers of the Pudukottai Samasthanam in 1910, the museum was handed over to the government after the merger of the ‘samasthanam’ with the union post independence. The preservation and conservation procedures of these items vary for metal icons, stone idols, wood carvings and manuscripts. Conservation of heritage building housing the museum was under way. Nearly 70% of the museum building conservation work had been carried out so far.

06 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Beds filling up fast in Kerala||It might be at least two weeks before the second wave of COVID-19 tearing through the State peaks. But desperation for hospital beds and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has already begun to be felt as both public and private sector hospitals are nearly filled. Reports from many private hospitals across the State said that many had been turning away patients since last week or referring them to hospitals in the nearby districts. Many patients who come demanding admission to private hospitals are being told to remain on home care and to be in touch with the doctors through tele-medicine links. “The number of patient transfers from home to hospitals have been on the rise and there are plenty of patients in the younger age group who are now coming in sick,” a doctor in a private hospital said. Resource shortage Acute shortage of human resources is the major problem that both government and private hospitals are facing. “Unless we have experienced staff to spare, we cannot expand ICU capacity,” he added.  Disease transmission Disease transmission in the second wave has been intense and even though the government has been preparing ahead to meet the exigency, enhancing the health system surge capacity, the number of active patients in the State (over 3.5 lakh) and the daily hospital admissions (between 3,500-4,500 patients) have been quite overwhelming. 28,115 in hospitals At present, there are 28,115 hospitalised patients in the State, of whom, 1,975 are critically ill in ICUs, with 756 of the patients put on ventilator support. Kerala had doubled the number of ventilators (3,776, both public and private) and ICU beds (9,735, both public and private). Oxygen demand As on May 3, the State had a stock of 270.2 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen, the daily demand for which had risen from about 74 to 108.35 metric tonnes in the past two weeks. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the Prime Minister requesting that the State be given an additional 1,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. “At this stage of COVID-19 crisis, we can bring down mortality if we focus on the 15% of COVID-19 patients who might become oxygen-dependent, but are salvageable without taking them into ICUs. For these patients, hospitals should be creating non-ICU oxygen beds,” says Rajeev Jayadevan, vice chairman, IMA research wing. In Ernakulam All beds allocated for COVID-19 treatment in government and private hospitals in Ernakulam, including ICU facilities, were full as on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Health Department. “It is full and there are no slots available,” said personnel working at the control room opened by the administration. “We are shifting emergency patients as and when there is a vacancy,” they said. Those who need urgent medical attention are now being shifted to stabilisation centres. Nearly 160 ICU beds were set aside at private hospitals for COVID patients.

06 May 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Oxygen production at Sterlite in a week’||A monitoring committee, appointed by the Supreme Court to oversee the production of oxygen at the Sterlite Copper smelter in Thoothukudi, inspected the plant on Wednesday. “The plant will be ready to produce oxygen in another seven days,” said Collector K. Senthil Raj, who inspected the premises and allied units along with members of the monitoring committee to ascertain if the plant was ready to produce oxygen that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. “I want to reiterate that oxygen alone will be produced from this complex, and no other operation will be allowed,” Dr. Senthil Raj said. He said necessary permissions from different government agencies, like the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, the Thoothukudi Corporation, fire and industrial safety officials, the electrical inspector and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had been expedited as directed by the Supreme Court, only for oxygen production. Sterlite Copper has submitted a list of personnel to be engaged in the operation of the oxygen plant. The personnel will be vetted by the technical experts of the committee before being granted permission to enter the plant. Partial supply “Power and water supply are being provided only to the extent needed to operate the oxygen plant on a standalone basis. Once all the permissions are given, the machinery will be checked and a power and safety audit conducted, after which oxygen production will commence,” the Collector said. On Tuesday, Sterlite Copper announced that the oxygen plant was ready to produce the life-saving gas as it had been checked thoroughly and overhauled by technicians. Subsequently, the monitoring committee, led by Dr. Senthil Raj, entered the premises and inspected the operational preparedness of the plant. Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar, Sub-Collector Simranjeet Singh, head of the department of chemistry at Kamaraj College D. Kanagavel, manager (Fire and Safety), Zirconium Complex, Department of Atomic Energy, Pazhaiyakaayal, V.C.P. Amarnath; and Deputy Chief Chemist, Tuticorin Thermal Power Station (TTPS), Bellarmine Anton accompanied the Collector during the inspection. The mandatory safety audit is being conducted by the Collector-led monitoring committee before the commencement of operations to issue appropriate instructions, if any, to ensure operational safety. Earlier, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change sent to the State government a list of experts from which the members of the committee were hand-picked. The Ministry’s list included J.K. Patterson Edward, renowned marine biologist and Director, Suganthi Devadasan Marine Research Institute, Thoothukudi; A.G.

06 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Not enough beds for COVID-19 patients||With COVID-19 cases rising by the day, beds in both private and government hospitals in Tiruchi have filled up rendering patients seeking admission in emergency situations helpless. Beds in Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, too, are entirely occupied. With over 500 patients testing positive in Tiruchi daily, hospitals in the city are overstretched and unable to handle the increasing number of cases. Though private hospitals have allocated 50% of their bed capacity for COVID-19 treatment, it is not enough under the prevailing circumstances. All 684 beds at the Tiruchi MGMGH in the COVID ward, 60 in the ICU and 311 with oxygen supply are occupied. ‘When a patient is discharged, or when something untoward happens to them... that’s when we have vacancies, otherwise, we are full,’ a senior doctor said. The staff are overworked and unable to handle the stress. ‘At least 10 staff nurses have tested positive, and with only 280 of us, including 45 on COVID duty, we are unable to manage. While the nature of our job is already stressful, the fear of contracting the virus adds to the rigour,’ a senior staff nurse said. Apollo Hospitals, SRM Medical College Hospitals, Sundaram Hospitals, GVN Hospitals and many other hospitals apparently do not have even a single ICU or oxygen-support bed. ‘We have travelled to at least four hospitals since morning with my father whose blood oxygen levels are dropping rapidly,’ a patient’s attender, said. Representatives of various hospitals said that they were short-staffed. M.A. Ashraf, former national vice president, Indian Medical Association said that there are some patients who are getting admitted in a panic. ‘Unless the patient’s oxygen levels are below 94, they do not need admission. The patient can isolate themselves at home or at the various COVID Care Centres set up by the government,’ he said. He said that some patients occupy beds which could be required by a patient with worse conditions. Collector S. Divyadharshini said that the district administration was looking forward to posting more nurses to address the situation. There are at least 150 applicants from private hospitals for the post of nurses in the mini-clinics. As for the Tiruchi GH, we are looking to augment strength of nurses and scale up the bed capacity,’ she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-enough-beds-for-covid-19-patients/article34494572.ece
06 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to improve water supply in Tiruchi||The Tiruchi Corporation has floated a re-tender for the rejuvenation of the drinking water supply scheme in the city. The scheme is aimed at replacing worn-out mains and pipelines of old water supply scheme being supplied from Kambarasampettai so as to improve the efficiency of water supply to residents. According to sources, Tiruchi got its first water supply scheme in 1910. It covered areas around Rockfort, Big Bazaar, Gandhi Market, Varaganeri and Palakkarai. As the population rose rapidly the capacity of the drinking water scheme was improved in 1980. Since the capacity was found inadequate to meet the requirement of the people, it was enhanced further with a new scheme in 1990. As per the present status of the population, the city needs about 125 MLD of water daily. The Tiruchi Corporation draws 55 MLD of water from Kambarasampettai head works. Though the first water supply scheme is still serving residents even after a century, it is severely strained due to frequent bursts of pipes at various places. The mains and supply lines have worn out. The corporation had roped in the Tamil Nadu Water Investment Company recently to check the mains and supply lines laid in 1910 and 1980. It was found that many pipes laid around Rockfort and Gandhi Market have been totally worn out and there was a need for their replacement. It was with the aim of rejuvenating and revamping the existing drinking water lines, the corporation prepared a scheme at a cost of Rs. 53 crore under the Smart City Mission and floated a tender a few months ago. To tap funds, it had included only areas notified under the Area Based Development of Smart City proposal. But, according to sources, the abnormal rate quoted by the bidders for executing the project has forced the corporation to cancel the tender. A senior official said that the corporation had powers to process tenders if the project cost quoted by the bidders was not more than 5% of the estimated cost. But the bidders quoted an abnormally high cost for the drinking water revamping project. Hence, the tender had been cancelled and a fresh tender had been floated. The last date for submitting tender was June 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-improve-water-supply-in-tiruchi/article34494562.ece
06 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||An offer to address oxygen shortage||The All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) has offered to the Central Government the support of defence civilian employees in ordnance factories for manufacture of oxygen generation plants. In a letter to the Director General of Factories and Chairman of Ornance Factory Boards, its general secretary C.Srikumar said in a crisis situation causing deaths of hundreds of COVID-infected patients due to non-availability of oxygen, OFB can prove its capability in utilising in-house expertise for the purpose. In the wake of the Defence Minister directing OFB and Defence Public Sector Undertakings to immediately start manufacturing oxygen generation plants, OFC Kanpur has developed in-house a PSA (Pressure Swing Absorption) based oxygen generation plant. Similarly Machine Tool Prototype Factory, Ambernath, has successfully converted the existing PSA nitrogen unit into PSA oxygen unit. This unit takes air as input from atmosphere. Producing oxygen was not very difficult. Pressure Swing Absorption technology was easy for adoption by ordnance factory units, he said. The manufacture of oxygen generation plants can be made possible within a fortnight, based on design/specification support from MTPF, he said. Considering the oxygen requirement of the nation to save the life of the people, we request you to take appropriate steps so that as in the last year OFB can play a vital role for the country and its people to save the life of the citizens who are affected by the second wave of COVID-19 virus, he said. The emergency financial powers granted to the Armed Forces to meet India’s Covid-19 challenges has to be extended to OFB for setting up of COVID-19 facilities and COVID-19 related manufacturing facilities, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/an-offer-to-address-oxygen-shortage/article34494577.ece

06 May 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Triaging point set up near TVMCH||District Collector V. Vishnu has created a triaging point at Gandhimathi School near Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital to screen and segregate COVID-19 patients based on their health condition on arrival. “If patients arriving here are asymptomatic and stable, they will be given COVID-19 kit having vitamin tablets, zinc tablets and kabasura kudineer packets and sent for home quarantine. If they have mild symptoms, they will be taken in vehicles stationed here to the COVID Care Centres being manned by team of qualified doctors and nurses. If they are in need of oxygen, then they will be admitted to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital across the road for appropriate treatment,” said Mr. Vishnu after inaugurating the triaging point, which will also act as COVID Care Centre, where a team of doctors and nurses have been posted. The purpose behind opening this triaging point is to avoid crowding in Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and reduce the turnaround time for screening the patient within the shortest possible time and to take the right decision about the line of treatment to be given to a particular patient. The Collector said the district administration had already established COVID Care Centres at Sivananda Hospital, Pattamadai, Government Siddha Medical College in Palayamkottai and the Primary Health Centre at Koodankulam and the COVID Care Centre with 100 beds at Gandhimathi School would be the fourth one. “If need arises, we’re ready to create COVID Care Centres at SCAD Engineering College, Cheranmahadevi, FX Polytechnic College, Tharuvai and Beedi Workers’ Hospital at Mukkoodal,” Mr. Vishnu said. The Collector also informed that the online updation of details could be accessed by the personnel manning the 24 X 7 COVID Control Centre functioning in the Collectorate so that they would be in touch with the patient’s family. This would enable them to keep a tab on the health status of the patient at the TVMCH or at the COVID Care Centre. He said 800 of the 1,240 beds in the TVMCH and 450 beds in private hospitals had oxygen facility and steps have been taken to increase it further. Apart from this, oxygen facility would be available in the COVID Care Centre at Gandhimathi School, Koodankulam Government Hospital and the Primary Health Centres in Munanjipatti, Panagudi and Valliyoor. Mr. Vishnu also asserted that there was no scarcity of oxygen in TVMCH which had two dedicated tanks with the cumulative capacity of 19 KL. Since patients from nearby Thoothukudi, Tenkasi and Virudhunagar districts were also being brought to TVMCH, demand for oxygen was going up and hence steps have been taken to tide over this problem, the Collector added. On the new lockdown norms coming into force from Thursday (May 6), the Collector said there would be no laxity or leniency in enforcement of law. “In the Corporation limits, a team, comprising police, corporation and revenue personnel, will be deployed to monitor every five wards for violations. Hence, 11 teams will be on the move to monitor all 55 wards of Tirunelveli Corporation. Enforcement will be done without any compromise and hence people should cooperate or else, violators will have to face the music,” Mr. Vishnu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/triaging-point-set-up-near-tvmch/article34494607.ece

06 May 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Expedite canal desilting’||The Thamizhaga Cauvery Farmers Association has urged the State government to expedite desilting in the delta region where ‘kuruvai’ cultivation is to set to begin in about 40 days. In a statement, its general secretary P.R.Pandian said that the farmers were confident of a bumper harvest in view of good storage at the Stanley Reservoir in Mettur. The government should release water from Mettur dam on June 12, expedite desilting work and ensure smooth flow of water. Urging the government to initiate necessary steps for taking up ‘kuruvai’ cultivation on a war-footing measure, its general secretary said additional tractors should be made available through the Agriculture Engineering Department for taking up direct sowing and to ensure availability of seeds in adequate quantity. He said that though the government announced 100 per cent compensation for the crop loss suffered due to heavy rain in January and waived the crop loans to the tune of Rs. 12, 500 crore disbursed through cooperative institutions, the process of compensation disbursement and release of jewellery pledged to avail crop loans were suspended by the officials citing the election model code of conduct. Urging the government to revive the crop loss compensation disbursement and release of pledged jewellery, he urged the governments to clear the cloud over the pricing of fertilizers. Though the Centre declared that fertilizer price hike had been put on hold, till date there was no official communication on whether the fertilizers would be sold at the old rate or at a new price, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-canal-desilting/article34494570.ece
06 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Forest Dept. puts ‘Rivaldo’ in kraal||Wild elephant Rivaldo, habituated to living close to humans in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), was on Wednesday trapped inside a kraal, a possible first step towards permanent captivity. The elephant had become used to humans as residents regularly fed it a nutritious diet of fruits and sugarcane. It stopped venturing into the forest in search of food over the last few months, preferring instead to roam around the region surrounding Vazhaithottam village. Forest Department officials say the animal was also suffering from health problems, and they had built a kraal (an elephant shelter to restrict its movement, using which it can be trained through a system of rewards and punishments) at Vazhaithottam. The animal was lured with food and led into the kraal, which was promptly shut. In a statement, Deputy Director of MTR L.C.S. Srikanth said in a first of its kind, an attempt was made to capture and tame a wild elephant without tranquillising it. Injuries “Rivaldo has trouble breathing and we cannot tranquillise the animal, as it could potentially lead to complications,” said Mr. Srikanth, who added that the pachyderm will be kept inside the kraal and treated for injuries. A few weeks ago, the Madras High Court had passed an order that the elephant should be released into the wild after it was treated for injuries. “As per the directions of the honourable High Court, all attempts and actions will be taken to treat Rivaldo… after a period of observation and attempted treatment, a decision will be taken in consultation with a team of veterinarians [on whether the elephant can be released again into the wild],” Mr. Srikanth said. The Forest Department made efforts earlier to guide Rivaldo to the Theppakadu Elephant Camp, but the elephant escaped.0||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-puts-rivaldo-in-kraal/article34494619.ece
06 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||‘Reconsider decision to put elephant in captivity’||Renowned ecologist and conservation biologist Priya Davidar has called upon the Chief Wildlife Warden in the State to reconsider the decision to capture wild elephant, known as “Rivaldo”. The elephant was lured out of the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris, and put in a “kraal” set up at Vazhaithottam on Wednesday. In her letter to the Chief Wildlife Warden, Ms. Davidar, a retired professor of ecology from Pondicherry University and former member of the State Board for Wildlife, Tamil Nadu said “Rivaldo was captured at Vazhaithottam based on the premise that he is unwell.” Ms. Davidar lives near Vazhaithottam in the MTR buffer zone and is familiar with the behaviour of the elephant. Ms. Davidar said Rivaldo was healthy and that the breathing problems cited by the forest department, as one of the reasons for his capture, stem from an injury to his trunk in 2013. “He breathes noisily. However, he is able to feed on jungle vegetation and sustain himself, as witnessed by me last week,” said Ms. Davidar. The ecologist said that another reason for the elephant staying close to human habitations was because the management of a private school in the area had been feeding the elephant fruits and sugarcane since September 2020. “Therefore, with this constant feeding, Rivaldo has become extremely dependent on fruits and sugarcane, which might affect his health adversely since elephants’ normal diet is rough forage,” she said. Ms. Davidar believed that Rivaldo did not require veterinary care and that he could be de-habituated. She had also outlined steps that could be taken by the forest department for that. These steps were outlined in a newsletter of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, co-authored with fellow ecologists, Shermin de Silva and Jean-Philippe Puyravaud. The paper details a process that can be implemented to de-habituate Rivaldo and prevent him from entering human habitations. The elephant cannot be captured without even attempting rehabilitation, said one of the authors of the paper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reconsider-decision-to-put-elephant-in-captivity/article34494612.ece
06 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Almost half of Coonoor town dumps waste directly into the Coonoor River||Highlighting the scale of the pollution of the Coonoor River, a survey conducted by the Coonoor Municipality (CMC) has revealed that around 5,000 households and over 100 commercial establishments in the town dump their sewage into the river. The results of the survey, which were submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in January, reveals that 4,719 households and 113 commercial establishments were found to be pumping their sewage into the river. Official sources believe that there are around 12,000 houses within the town, of which only around 2,000 have installed septic tanks, while the remaining either dump their sewage directly into the river or into drains, which eventually makes its way into the river. The municipality had stated that they had issued notices to 109 of the commercial establishments to cease dumping the waste into the river. They had also planned to begin sealing the establishments that were found to be in violation of the rules. The pollution of the river has been one of the major concerns of conservationists in the Nilgiris, as it leads to the contamination of the Bhavani, a vital source of drinking water for residents living in surrounding districts and also for wildlife. Municipal Engineer (CMC), V. Balamurugan, when contacted by The Hindu, said that notices will be issued to houses which have space to install septic tanks and choke pits but have failed to do so, while it has also been proposed to intercept sewage flowing through drains and other systems and treat the sewage at decentralized treatment systems. P.J. Vasanthan, a trustee of ‘Clean Coonoor’ which has been spearheading the campaign to clean up the river said that overhauling the entire drainage system of the town would be a herculean challenge. “I think a viable option would be to implement a combined sewerage system, similar to those that have been used to manage the sewage and drainage problems in towns in Europe, which too have very old systems in place,” said Mr. Vasanthan. A combined sewer system in theory would collect both surface water and sewage, with the sewage being diverted to treatment plants. Municipality officials said experts had visited the town and conducted a survey of the households. They are in the process of calculating the amount of sewage generated so that an effective management plan can be drawn up and implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/almost-half-of-coonoor-town-dumps-waste-directly-into-the-coonoor-river/article34494617.ece

06 May 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Panic-stricken residents stock up on oxygen cylinders||People have started stocking up on oxygen cylinders, apprehending a shortage in case of emergencies, according to officials in Virudhunagar. “Visuals of long queues for oxygen cylinders in north India and the news of deaths of patients in hospitals due to oxygen shortage have created fear among people,” said a senior official. Citing information on social media about home delivery of oxygen cylinders, the health official said affluent and upper middle-class residents were buying cylinders at exorbitant rates. “While a cylinder just cost Rs. 3,000 in normal times, people are now buying it for as high as Rs. 30,000,” another official in the district said. During a review of oxygen supply in hospitals on Tuesday, the issue came up for discussion. Some oxygen suppliers complained about a shortage of cylinders for refilling and supplying to hospitals on time. A doctor said many COVID-19 patients coming to hospitals were demanding oxygen supply out of fear. “When we say that not every patient requires oxygen support and only those with a higher degree of lung involvement need it, people do not listen,” he said. While attempts to create awareness on the importance of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance have not been completely successful, news bulletins on the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in other parts of the country have made people aware of their importance. “Even asymptomatic patients want to be admitted to hospitals at least for a day before being shifted to the care centres,” the senior official said. A new challenge A doctor said some patients were complaining that they were being discriminated against by hospital authorities while administering Remdesivir. “One patient complained that the injection brought out from the refrigerator was not administered to him, but to his neighbour. Our doctors are finding it hard to convince patients in this regard,” he added. Meanwhile, Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan said though the demand for oxygen had increased, there had been no delay in its replenishment.

Non-availability of Remdesivir is a setback. We have to send the patients’ attenders with a prescription to government medical college hospitals to get Remdesivir,” the official said. Santy Sajan, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, in a written reply to The Hindu , said, “We are grateful to the State authorities and local associates for ensuring regular and timely supplies of oxygen for the smooth running of operations at all our hospitals. We are closely monitoring the requirement of oxygen and other essential supplies as we enhance our critical bed capacity for extending care to our patients.” P. Ramakrishnan, State president of the Indian Medical Association - Tamil Nadu, said that with the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, more admissions were expected. “There is a need for uninterrupted and prompt supply of oxygen for private hospitals. If the supply is increased, we will be trouble-free,” he said. Availability of beds, Remdesivir and vaccines were among the other issues facing hospitals. At one hospital, all COVID-19 beds — wards, intensive care and holding area in the emergency room — were full. “We have another 50 to 60 patients requiring intensive care and ventilator-supported beds waiting, and another 50 to 60 patients in the waiting list for ward beds,” a hospital authority said. “We are unable to accommodate many patients. Our doctors, nurses and other staff and equipment are stretched out to take care of these many beds. Most of the doctors are heading for a burnout.” Dr. Gnanasekaran said Chennai would require at least 1,000 more ward beds and at least 200 more intensive care beds with all necessary equipment and manpower to handle the crisis for the next two months. “Our only hope is a lockdown for Chennai for at least 20 days, like in Maharashtra, to bring down the transmission,” he said.  Vaccination had come to a standstill in some private hospitals. The government should ensure that vaccination is carried out in full swing, a senior doctor said.    Our doctors, nurses and other staff and equipment are stretched out||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/major-private-hospitals-in-chennai-keep-a-watch-on-oxygen-supply/article34494568.ece
06 May 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||There is no scarcity of oxygen in BIMS, says hospital director||Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences Director Vinay Dastikopp has denied reports that four persons died due to oxygen scarcity in the government medical college hospital here. “There is no scarcity of oxygen in the hospital. We have our own dedicated oxygen supply for the wards and beds. There has been no oxygen scarcity,” he told journalists. “Of the 1,040 beds in the hospital, we have set aside 300 for COVID treatment. The rest are for emergency healthcare departments such as obstetrics and gynaecology, orthopaedics, surgery and general medicine. We can expand the COVID ward if we get additional rooms or another building,” he said in reply to a question. He pointed out that government doctors had saved the lives of 21 patients by shifting them to BIMS from private hospitals that were running low on oxygen in the last three days. However, there have been complaints of scarcity of oxygen fitted beds and ventilators. On Wednesday, there were 10 requests for oxygen from hospitals and three from patients on the district COVID care helpline website, belagavicovid19.com A family from Nehru Nagar complained that it could not get a ventilator bed. “We have gone around the city looking for beds. We did not get it even at BIMS,” a woman said and added, “Three days after my husband developed symptoms, we are yet to admit our relative to any hospital.’’ Private hospitals have complained that the district administration was not supplying them with enough oxygen. Subhash Patil and Amit Bhate, who run private hospitals, said that the officers were allotting only one third of the required number of cylinders while asking hospitals to “adjust somehow”. “But the government is forcing us to set aside half of the beds for COVID. How can we function like this? If this continues, we will be forced to shut down hospitals,” they said. Deputy Commissioner K. Harish Kumar has deputed officers to monitor the three oxygen production plants in the district. They are supposed to visit the plants once daily, take stock and send regular reports. They can also receive public grievances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-is-no-scarcity-of-oxygen-in-bims-says-hospital-director/article34494646.ece
06 May 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Vegetable sellers hit hard by restrictions||The partial lockdown has hit hard vegetable growers who routinely sell their produce to markets in towns in neighbouring Maharashtra and Goa. Wholesale vegetable markets are closed or shifted and local sales are reduced. Transportation across the border is near zero. Due to restrictions in the three States, traders and growers are suffering huge losses, said Malik Bagwan, vegetable wholesaler. With the extension of day curfew, “we will suffer further,” he said. The State government has extended Janata Curfew till May 12. The State government extended the timings of APMC yards and wholesale and retail vegetable markets from 6 a.m. to noon . But traffic restrictions and barricades across the city have reduced footfall in vegetable markets. The prices of vegetables, fruits and flowers have fallen in the wholesale market, said Anant Dhage, a vegetable trader. Chilli is selling at Rs. 1,000 per quintal and marigold flowers are selling at Rs. 2,000 per quintal. This is a fall of more than half the price, he said. Fresh vegetables such as cucumber, cauliflower, capsicum, potato, tomato, beans, carrot and curry leaves that were in great demand in Goa have no buyers now, said Basavaraj Desai, a farmer leader. Chilli farmers in Khanapur have given a memorandum to MLA Anjali Nimbalkar, to urge the State government to start procurement in APMC yards. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader Choonappa Pujari blamed the partial lockdown for the crisis. Everyone knows that farmers suffered greatly in last year’s lockdown. That caused a negative effect on the economy, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vegetable-sellers-hit-hard-by-restrictions/article34494638.ece

06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bed allotment scam: Two doctors among four persons arrested||The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police, which is probing the bed allotment scam, carried out raids across all eight Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike war rooms on Wednesday and arrested four people, including two doctors. The arrests come a day after BJP legislators, led by Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya, live-streamed an exposé of alleged corruption in bed allocation by staff at the South zone war room. One of the arrested accused, Dr. Rehan, is in charge of the South zone war room, while the other, Dr. Suresh, is the Bommanahalli war room in-charge. “We have taken Dr. Rehan into custody and are trying to ascertain the possible involvement of others in the racket. The second accused, Dr. Suresh, has tested positive for COVID-19, and we are yet to question him,” said a senior police official. The duo allegedly instructed the third accused, a Bommanahalli war room staffer, Shashi Kumar, to block and unblock the beds using BU IDs. The police suspect that beds were being blocked in the name of asymptomatic patients in home isolation, only to be sold to others later. CCB officials are checking records of the other war rooms in R.R. Nagar, Mahadevapura, Yelahanka and Dasarahalli as part of the investigation. Private hospitals The CCB also suspects the involvement of many private hospitals. The day the BJP legislators exposed the scam, the Jayanagar police arrested a social worker, Nethravathi, and her nephew, Rohith Kumar, in a sting operation. They were allegedly selling blocked beds to desperate families for anywhere between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000, and are suspected to have contacts with war room staff and hospitals. The CCB has taken over the case as part of its probe into the bed allotment scam. Sub-Inspector Chandan Kale, Jayanagar, who had initially probed the case, said the duo would get information about vacant beds across the city and get them blocked until they were sold. “The accused would then inform their contacts on the field, who approached people looking for beds for their loved ones. Once money exchanged hands, the beds were unblocked briefly to facilitate the admission of patients who had paid them,” said Mr. Kale. Using this modus operandi, the accused sold a bed at Apollo Hospital in Jayanagar on May 1. According to police sources, the bed had been blocked in the name of Chandrasekhar, who was actually in home isolation. “Many touts, who are part of the racket, have switched off their phones and are on the run. Efforts are on to track them down,” a senior police officer said. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, speaking to the media, said there was nothing communal in the investigation. “Anyone found guilty will be punished,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bed-allotment-scam-two-doctors-among-four-persons-arrested/article34495055.ece
06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Extension of lockdown will depend on PM’s direction: CM||Karnataka, currently under partial lockdown, is awaiting further instructions from the Centre on strictures to be imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the State. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Wednesday, said that though curfew has been imposed, the State was awaiting further guidelines and instructions from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It is quite natural for the Centre to issue directions during this time. We will follow it,” he said. His response came after presspersons asked him if the State was looking at a stricter curfew in the coming days as numbers were not declining enough. Incidentally, Wednesday saw the total number of cases crossing the 50,000 mark. “Since the current curfew restrictions are in force till May 12, we are yet to decide on it. We will wait for the Centre’s directives,” speaking after the 119th birth anniversary celebration of former Chief Minister K.C. Reddy here on Wednesday. Meanwhile, sources aware of the developments, strongly indicated that the curfew could be extended beyond May 12, and that it would be for at least one week. “The numbers over the next three days would be a barometer before the government decides. We are not very sure if the government would be willing to ease restrictions if the numbers do not fall below 20,000. This is also unlikely to happen in the next three days,” sources said.  The sources also said that the government was weighing options before a decision to extend curfew is taken since the livelihood of a large population is also at stake. While the last lockdown received considerable help from the Centre to deal with livelihood issues, no such support is assured to States this time, sources said. “There is a lot of pressure on the State government to save livelihoods,” an officer said. “In the last two to three days, there has not been much discussion over the extension as oxygen shortage and Chamarajanagar incidents took precedence. The Technical Advisory Committee is also watching the numbers. The government decision will be based on what the TAC will also suggest,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/extension-of-lockdown-will-depend-on-pms-direction-cm/article34494786.ece
06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State logs biggest single-day jump with 50,112 cases, 346 deaths||Karnataka on Wednesday logged the biggest single-day increase of 50,112 new cases of COVID-19, taking the total to 17,41,046. Bengaluru Urban has recorded 46.10% of the day’s caseload with 23,106 cases. The daily test positivity rate (TPR) that had been hovering around 29% for the last two days shot up to 32.28% on Wednesday. The State’s average TPR for seven days prior to May 3 stood at 20.9%. For the first time ever since the pandemic hit Karnataka, the daily fatalities in the State crossed 300 and touched 346. Of these, 161 are from Bengaluru Urban alone. With this the toll rose to 16,884 and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) touched 0.69%. This is apart from 20 deaths of patients due to non-COVID-19 reasons. As pointed out by experts, Wednesday’s caseload indicated that the infection is now spreading in the districts. Bengaluru Urban which used to contribute nearly 70% of the daily caseload has now less than 50% of the cases. Mysuru and Tumakuru have reported the highest number of new cases among the districts (other than Bengaluru) with 2,790 and 2,335 cases respectively. While only seven districts - Ramanagar, Raichur, Koppal, Haveri, Gadag, Chitradurga, and Bidar - have reported les than 500 cases on Wednesday, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkamangaluru, Dharwad, Hassan, Kalaburagi, Kolar, and Udupi recorded cases between 1,000 and 2,000. As many as 26,841 persons were discharged on Wednesday, taking the total recoveries to 12,36,854. The State now has 4,87,288 active patients. After Bengaluru, which now has 3,13,314 active cases, Mysuru and Tumkuru have the next highest with 16,591 and 15,418 active cases respectively. Four districts, Ballari, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan and Kalaburagi, follow with more than 10,000 cases. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said the surge in the districts was expected with people moving out of Bengaluru even during the curfew. “They carry the virus from here to their hometown infecting others there,” he said. “The cases that we are reporting now are an extension of the pre-lockdown tranmissison. The impact of lockdown can be asssessed only after 10-12 days,” he doctor added. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, also attributed the surge to movement of people from Bengaluru to their hometowns both during long weekends of April as well as just before the partial lockdown began. “We now have to meticulously plan management strategies to control the surge in disticts with respect to beds and oxygen requirement,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-logs-biggest-single-day-jump-with-50112-cases-346-deaths/article34494661.ece
06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru book lovers mourn the passing away of ‘Premier’ Shanbhag||Tributes started pouring in from book lovers of Bengaluru as news of the passing away of T.S. Shanbhag, the owner of the erstwhile legendary Premier Bookshop in the city, reached them on Wednesday. Balakrishna V., his financial advisor, told The Hindu that Shanbhag turned 84 on May 2. “He was suffering from an infection and then got COVID-19. He was hospitalised for a few days and passed away on Tuesday night,” he said. He is survived by his wife and daughter. Started in 1971, Premier Book Shop was the ultimate destination for bibliophiles for over three decades, particularly before e-commerce pervaded the world of books. Mr. Shanbhag was the go-to man to source a rare academic book or the latest release of a favourite author. The iconic store closed down in 2009, the reason being an exponential increase in rent on and around M.G. Road. Historian Ramachandra Guha in a tweet said that he owes “much of my education (such as it is) to books bought at his Premier Bookshop. My wife and I both grew up reading books bought from Mr Shanbhag and Premier, and so did our children.” He recalled Shanbhag’s warmth and kindliness that did not preclude a mischievous sense of humour. Krishna Gowda of Bookworm, who, in 2016, hosted a programme with Mr. Shanbhag to reminisce about an “important piece of Bengaluru’s literary history” after it was closed in 2009, recalled him as the first to start discounts on new books when no one had heard of the concept. “I had known him for over 11 years, and we learnt about the concept of offering discounts from him. He was the first to start 20% discount on all books in 1978. I also bought many books from him when his shop closed. He was aware of customers’ tastes and would keep track of them. He had a personal relationship with them,” he said. Post-retirement too, Mr. Shanbhag, originally from Kundapur, would enjoy walking, reading books and would regularly visit bookshops in the Central Business District. His long list of admirers included Mr. Guha, playwright Girish Karnad, politician George Fernandes, and actor Kamal Haasan. At the Bookworm event, when asked about Premier’s collection of nearly 5 lakh books, Mr. Shanbhag had said in his typically wry style, “I gave them all away at 60% discount. Change is a part of life. I was already 70 when I closed shop, so why feel emotional?” He had also pointed out that with the popularity of online retailers increasing, the offline shop needed younger minds to run it.  Writer Vivek Shanbhag recalled the endearing “mess” of Premier Book Shop with piles of books stacked up. “That book shop looked like a mess to us, but he knew exactly what was where. There was no Google or anything, but he would be able to suggest other books by the same author. He himself was a reader. It was a place where you made friends and was usually a stop before Koshy’s.” Historian Janaki Nair recalled how he saw many, like herself, grow from being readers to writers and was secretly proud of it. “He didn’t make any fuss about it. He was, of course, generous in his discounts. I miss his bookshop,” she added.  He was man of very few words but he knew his books well. He knew what each person visiting his shop was interested in. As his shop grew, sometimes there were two to three rows of books and he alone knew what was in the third row.  Janaki Nair,    Historian    When I was a student, he would allow me to borrow books because I couldn't afford them. He spoke so little. Only through his actions would you know that he liked you. He knew what each customer was looking for.

06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fear looms in Sub-Registrars’ offices||Amid the raging pandemic and imposition of restrictions, registration of documents in Sub-Registrars’ offices in the State has fallen to about 30% of the normal. However, what has riled a section of department officials is the insistence of the government to continue the services, which falls under non-essential category, for revenue generation. Revenue Department sources said that over 30 data entry operators have tested positive for COVID-19, and news of more cases keep coming. “With many people still flocking to Sub-Registrar offices, the chance of transmission is very high,” sources said. From the average 9,000 documents being registered daily before the pandemic hit the State, it is now down to about 2,500 documents. Offices are functioning on normal timing, between 10 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. Public interface The registrations mostly pertain to properties, sources in the government said. To reduce public interface, the department has made the certificate copy services online, while introducing both online and offline facilities to procure encumbrance certificate. “The number of documents being registered during the curfew period has reduced. However, you can still see a good number of people, throwing social distancing norm to the wind. For one property registration, there are at least five persons. Besides the buyer and seller, you need witnesses and a deed writer,” an official said. A senior Sub-Registrar in Bengaluru acknowledged the scare in the department. “Several Sub-Registrars in the city have turned positive, along with a number of data-entry operators. A couple of data-entry operators have died. In many offices, not even 20% of registrations are happening. I don’t know why the government has kept our offices open,” he added. Inspector General of Registrations and Commissioner of Stamps K.P. Mohanraj was not available for comments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fear-looms-in-sub-registrars-offices/article34494789.ece
06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 1 crore doses of vaccine administered in Karnataka||The State administered 1,01,04,750 doses of COVID-19 vaccine till 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday. This includes 5,326 in the age group of 18-44 years, 6,84,874 healthcare workers and 4,38,934 frontline workers who have taken the first dose of vaccination. As many as 4,38,685 healthcare workers and 1,66,935 frontline workers have taken the second dose as well. On Wednesday, 1,54,935 beneficiaries took the jab till 8.30 p.m. Karnataka currently has a stock of 4 lakh doses. The State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) that met on Wednesday has recommended that vaccination for the 18-44 age group beneficaries should be taken up only with prior registration on Co-WIN portal. “This is essential to avoid overcrowding at he vaccination centres,” a member said.   Meanwhile, Kalaburagi, which is seeing a high rate of COVID-19 cases, is lagging behind in the vaccination drive. The data from the Department of Health and Family Welfare for three days (since Sunday) shows that the district’s vaccination achievement has been less than 5% as compared to the target. A daily target of vaccinating 20,500 people was set for the district. On Sunday, 992 (5%) people were vaccinated. On Monday, 731 (4%) people were vaccinated. On Tuesday, only 298 (1%) people were vaccinated against the target of 20,500 people. Kalaburagi Rural saw the highest vaccination with just 101 (6%) against the target of 1,700 and Jewargi saw none. The authorities in the Department of Health and Family Welfare attributed the poor performance to the erratic and inadequate supply of vaccination doses. They also said that they for the time being had, upon directions from higher-ups, stopped supplying vaccine to private healthcare facilities and are diverting all doses to public healthcare institutions when they received them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-1-crore-doses-of-vaccine-administered-in-karnataka/article34494653.ece

A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the directions while hearing PIL petitions related to COVID-19 issues. Earlier many advocates representing the petitioners pointed out that it is impossible to get a bed through Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike’s central bed management system while pointing out that some COVID-19 patients had chosen to find beds in neighbouring districts after failing to get beds in hospitals in the city. Vaccination On vaccine shortage, the bench directed the government to submit a report on status of vaccination while pointing out that administering the second dose of vaccine is vital as the first dose of vaccine would be of no use if people are unable to get the second dose within the prescribed time schedule. “It will be a national waste if the second dose cannot be given within the scheduled time,” the bench observed while directing the government to clarify on the confusion over availability of vaccine and administration of the second dose of vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-seeks-status-report/article34495050.ece

Contract to be reviewed BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said a technical committee led by V. Ponnuraj, nodal officer for State War Room, had submitted an interim report reviewing the software being used to allot beds. “The committee has advised a reform in the login process, among other things. The final report is yet to be submitted. We will fix these gaps,” he said, and added that the agency given the contract to run the war room will be reviewed. Senior Minister Arvind Limbavali, appointed in-charge of war rooms by the Chief Minister on Tuesday, held a review meeting of all war rooms. “Pertaining to bed-blocking, we have realised the gap in the system may be at the nodal officer level, who are not keeping the war room up to date. This will be streamlined,” he said. Meanwhile, Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya tweeted that he had sought help from Nandan Nilekani, chairman, Infosys to revamp the BBMP bed allocation system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/war-room-management-software-under-scanner/article34495057.ece
06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||MLA funds to ramp up rural medical infrastructure||As the State scrambles to ramp up medical infrastructure with COVID-19 cases showing no sign of abating, in a first, the government has allowed purchase of medical equipment for government health facilities, especially in rural areas, under the legislators’ fund given annually. The State’s Planning Department has, based on the needs of the health facilities in 146 taluks across Karnataka, drawn a list of medical equipments that are required. This ramp up of medical infrastructure is estimated to cost about Rs. 65.62 crore. In the second wave, there has been a steep rise in cases in rural areas. “A list of medical infrastructure needs was prepared based on the needs of the taluk centres. The district administration can propose and purchase the equipment by taking the legislator’s permission,” Planning Department sources said.

06 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Seize records of oxygen supply in Chamarajanagar, Mysuru: HC||In a major setback to the State government, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the Chief Secretary to immediately seize all the relevant records in the offices of the Deputy Commissioners of Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts, and the Chamarajanagar district hospital on oxygen supply and correspondences amongst the authorities in the two districts for the relevant period. The court issued this direction after taking serious exception to the decision of the State government to set up a commission of inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, and appointing a retired judge to probe incident of 24 COVID-19 patients in Chamarajanagar without taking prior approval from the court.  Also, the court directed the Chief Secretary to keep all the documents in his custody and make available the seized documents to a committee, set up by Karnataka State Legal Services Authority under the chairmanship of A.N. Venugopala Gowda, a retired judge of the High Court, for monitoring COVID-19 situation, for its assessment. The government had appointed B.A. Patil, a retired judge of the High Court, as a one-man commission to conduct inquiry under the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952. A Special Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, issued the directions while hearing a batch of PIL petitions related to COVID-19. The Bench on Tuesday had taken suo motu cognisance of the death of COVD-19 patients in Chamarajanagar district based on the media reports, and had indicated to the State Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi that it was in favour of ordering a judicial probe by appointing a retired judge considering the seriousness of the issues related to death of COVID-19 patients allegedly due to lack of oxygen supply in Chamarajanagar, Kalaburagi, and other places. The A-G, after taking instructions from the government, on Tuesday told the court that the government per se had no objection in court ordering judicial probe. However, the government, in the Cabinet meeting convened on Tuesday evening decided to set up the Commission of Inquiry.  When the A-G on Wednesday told the Bench about appointment of the Commission, the Bench termed the government’s conduct as “pre-emptory” in nature as the decision was taken without without informing the court, which was seized of the matter. “Intention of the government is very clear from the manner in which the whole thing is being done by the government... It is a pre-emptory order...we are not on you appointing a particular judge.... But in all fairness you should have left it to the court to appoint a retired judge to conduct an inquiry...,” the Bench observed asking A-G to immediately inform Chief Secretary to seize the documents. The A-G later told the Bench that the Chief Secretary had entrusted the task of seizing the records to the IAS officer appointed to conduct preliminary inquiry into the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seize-records-of-oxygen-supply-in-chamarajanagar-mysuru-hc/article34494658.ece

Office-bearers of Hubballi Dharwad Mahanagar Zillla Congress Committee submitted a memorandum addressed to the Deputy Commissioner in Dharwad on Monday in this regard. Vice-president of District Congress Committee P.L. Haliyal and two others submitted the memorandum and sought action against the hospital director. It might be recalled that Seva Bharati, an organisation affiliated to RSS, set up a help desk for COVID-19 patients on KIMS Hospital premises and KIMS Director Ramalingappa Antaratani had taken part in its inauguration recently. In the memorandum addressed to the Deputy Commissioner and signed on behalf of the district Congress committee president Altaf Halwoor, it has been said that it is condemnable that an organisation affiliated to a political party is being allowed to set up a help desk on a government hospital premises. In the memorandum, the office-bearers have pointed out that the Dharwad district administration itself has released a list of COVID warriors and officials and asked the people to approach them for any help pertaining to COVID-19. Such being the case, how can the KIMS director allow an organisation affiliated to RSS and associated with the BJP to set up the help desk on the hospital premises, they asked. They have urged the Deputy Commissioner to immediately take action against the KIMS director and also take steps to shift the help desk out of the KIMS campus, failing which they would be forced to take the legal route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/objection-to-help-desk-coming-up-at-kims/article34494652.ece

Hence, the Minister said that Dakshina Kannada district administration should constitute over 78 teams of expert doctors to enquire about the health conditions of patients under home isolation and offer them guidance and proper treatment. The teams of doctors should visit the homes of patients under home isolation for providing treatment. Officials should be appointed to supervise the visit of teams, he said.

The Minister said that people should not come to the streets unnecessarily during the curfew relaxation period. If private hospitals collected fees more than the ones fixed by the government, patients should complain against such hospitals to the Health Department. Steps will be taken to make those hospitals return the excess fee collected. Remdesivir injection should not be given to all patients in general. The country’s medical institutes have said that it should be given only to those patients who had initial breathing problem. Hence it should be given only to such patients who needed it. Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, suggested that the services of students at eight medical colleges could be made use of to enquire about the health of patients under home isolation. The administration should make a video clipping of the steps to be taken by those who are under isolation and it should be circulated in social media. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that religious institutes opening Covid Care Centres should obtain the permission of the Health Department before opening such centres as they should provide basic facilities to patients at such centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/form-teams-of-doctors-to-treat-patients-in-home-isolation-kota/article34495210.ece
06 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Shift patients who cannot isolate themselves to COVID centres’||Home Minister and district in-charge Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday instructed the Udupi district administration to shift to COVID care centres such COVID-19 patients who are not able to isolate themselves in their houses. Such patients should be shifted immediately, the Minister said while speaking through video conference from Bengaluru. The Minister said that the infection is spreading fast as the infected persons are not isolating themselves in their houses. Hence, the disease is spreading to family members. Some patients may not be having enough facility to isolate themselves in their houses. Such patients should be taken care of in COVID care centres. The services of panchayat development officers should be made use of for the purpose. The Minister said that the hospitals should make use of oxygen cylinders carefully and should not waste oxygen. Mr. Bommai asked the administration to appoint AYUSH doctors for COVID care centres. Such students who have completed their B.Sc in Nursing should be appointed for duty immediately on contract basis, he said. The Minister said that the State should get 45 tonnes of oxygen daily from a company in Palakkad in Kerala. But now there is short supply. The matter has been brought to the notice of Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal. The State hopes that the issue will be addressed. The State will take steps for enough supply of Remdesivir injection for the treatment of patients in the district, he said and added that the administration should file daily report on the supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injection. The Minister instructed officials to set up 10 more ICU beds in the Udupi Government District Hospital. The beds for treating COVID-19 patients in TMA Pai and Kasturba Hospitals should also be increased, he said. The Minister said that the health condition of patients in home isolation in rural areas should be monitored. If required, they should be shifted to hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shift-patients-who-cannot-isolate-themselves-to-covid-centres/article34495198.ece
06 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Do not keep people waiting for long outside vaccination centres’||While asking the authorities concerned to give preference to those who come to vaccination centres for their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath on Wednesday said that information about availability of vaccine should be given to people early and they should not be made to wait for long outside vaccination centres. Expressing anguish over people waiting outside the AYUSH Block of the Government Wenlock Hospital since 8 a.m., Mr. Kamath said, “Do not make them wait till 1 p.m. and then say vaccine is not available. There should be a better system of managing people visiting the centre when vaccine supply is limited,” he said. Mr. Kamath said that apart from those aged 45 and above who have registered online for their second dose, preference should also be given to those in that age category who come directly to the health centres. If vaccine is available then it can be administered to those who have come to receive their first dose, he said. Later, in a meeting with doctors at the Wenlock Hospital, Mr. Kamath expressed the need for proper use of COVID-19 testing facility at the hospital to ensure reports are available within 24 hours. He also said that a help desk should be set up at the hospital to provide information to family members of COVID-19 patients admitted there. There should not be any shortage of staff in dedicated COVID-19 hospital. Bodies of patients who die should be immediately disposed of. If family members do not come forward to perform the last rites, arrangements should be made to perform them using the services of social activists, he said. Mr. Kamath was accompanied by Mayor Premanand Shetty and Chairman of Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation Nitin Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/do-not-keep-people-waiting-for-long-outside-vaccination-centres/article34495204.ece

With this, the hospital has buffer stock of liquid oxygen that will meet the requirement till the weekend. District Surgeon Madhusudhan Nayak said that the stock of liquid oxygen is being replenished at regular intervals in the hospital. As liquid oxygen stock goes down to 1,000 litres, fresh stock is obtained, he said. The hospital has 60 beds with oxygen reserved for COVID-19 patients and all these beds are filled. A decision has been taken to put to use some of the beds with oxygen, which are reserved for the non-COVID-19 section, for the benefit of new COVID-19 patients. The number of beds for non-COVID-19 patients is being reduced and they are being used for treating COVID-19 patients, hospital sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospital-receives-2000-litres-of-oxygen/article34495202.ece

06 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Retired doctors, nurses to be roped in to augment trained manpower||Retired doctors and nurses will be recruited for COVID-19 duties in a bid to augment trained manpower to handle the surge in the cases in rural areas and taluk centres. In a bid to reduce the time lag between testing and results additional laboratories will also be opened in Mysuru district. This was stated by the district in-charge Minister S.T.Somashekar here on Wednesday. Speaking to media persons after a district-level review meeting, he said the local authorities have been directed to identify retired doctors for deployment on COVID-19 duties and they will be paid Rs. 60,000 per month while retired nurses will be paid Rs. 25,000 per month. Experts have said that though the demand for beds and oxygen or medicines can be met by scaling up production, it will be difficult to augment the number of doctors and nurses at short notice to handle the increase in cases. Hence the decision to recruit retired doctors and nurses was seen as a solution to meet the exigency. Mr. Somashekar said the issue pertaining to manpower scarcity was also discussed in the review meeting and the government had already issued a notification to begin the recruitment process. The Minister said Covid care centres are being established at the taluk and rural levels so as to ensure quarantine of those testing positive besides taking care of their nutritional needs. The review meeting follows the increase in positive cases across the State following which the Ministers in charge of their respective districts were directed to take stock of the situation. Mr. Somashekar said local task force committee will be constituted with MLAs heading it in their respective constituencies and it will ensure that there was no dearth of oxygen or medicine in the respective area of jurisdiction. The Minister said there was a sense of panic in the public and a false belief that any testing positive has to be administered oxygen. The Minister noted the daily increase in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru and the delay in obtaining the RT-PCR results. Hence it has been decided to open additional testing centres so as to reduce the load on the existing ones. There were 77 laboratories in the district equipped to conduct RT-PCR tests but it takes 3 days to 5 days in certain cases for the results. So it has been decided to ramp up the number of laboratories to bridge the time lag. Mysuru used to record an average of 150 to 200 COVID-19 cases per day till some time ago but it has surged in recent days and the daily average hovers around 2,000 to 2,500 cases Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda, Narasimharaja MLA Tanvir Sait, Chamarja MLA L. Nagendra, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, Chamarajanagar MP V. Srinivas Prasad, and senior officials of the district administration were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/retired-doctors-nurses-to-be-roped-in-to-augment-trained-manpower/article34494775.ece
06 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Spotlight over lack of overseeing agency in State||The death of 24 people on May 2 and 3, allegedly owing to shortage of oxygen highlights a larger issue that pervades the State: the absence of an agency for overseeing equitable distribution of medical oxygen to different parts of Karnataka. One of the most backward districts in Karnataka, Chamarajanagar does not have either a medical oxygen manufacturing facility or refilling and distribution units. Its dependence on medical oxygen suppliers from outside the district, particularly neighbouring Mysuru, has gone up sharply at a time when the number of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen increased even in Mysuru. With no overseeing authority, the Chamarajanagar administration was literally left to fend for itself. When a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the hospitals, the demand for oxygen went up during the last 10 days, forcing the officials to plead with suppliers outside the district to ensure that its requirement of about 300 cylinders per day is met.  The disruption in timely supply of cylinders from Mysuru on May 2 and early hours of May 3, which allegedly led to the death of 24 persons, has now sparked off an ugly spat between the Deputy Commissioners of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar. Amid speculation in a section of the media that Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri had objected to the supply of oxygen to Chamarajanagar, the Mysuru district administration issued a statement claiming that it had sent 250 cylinders to Chamarajanagar on Sunday and early on Monday. But, Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar M.R. Ravi released a press statement disputing the claim and contended that the district hospital in Chamarajanagar did not receive proper response from Mysuru during the crisis. Ms. Sindhuri on Wednesday sought to clarify that she neither rationed nor controlled oxygen supplies to Chamarajanagar and said that oxygen supplies to a district are entirely between the supplier/refiller and the district. “For example, Mysuru’s oxygen supplies are from Ballari. If the supplier from Ballari supplies less, I cannot blame the Deputy Commissioner of Ballari,” she reasoned, arguing that it was the responsibility of the district to manage their own supplies. If any oxygen supplier does not meet the requirements of a district, an intervention should be made by the State-level officers, she said.  Meanwhile, Mysuru, which is meeting the requirements of Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, and Mandya, has a combined refilling capacity of 75 kilolitres (KL) per day from its five refilling plants. Though there is no manufacturing plant, the refilling units sources liquid medical oxygen from Ballari, Koppal, and Bengaluru. But, the refilling plants in Mysuru said they were unable to reach their capacity production due logistics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/spotlight-over-lack-of-overseeing-agency-in-state/article34494657.ece
06 May 2021||MYSuRU,KARNATAKA||BSY blind and deaf to pandemic: Vishwanath||A.H. Vishwanath, ruling party MLC who has been critical of the BJP government in State in recent times, lashed out at Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on his handling of the pandemic. Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, Mr. Vishwanath said the situation was turning from bad to worse and the government was yet to wake up. “People are dying all around and yet we have nobody to talk to, while the Chief Minister is both blind and deaf to the situation and lacks presence of mind,” he said. The MLC, who has turned a vociferous critic of Mr. Yediyurappa, said any Ministry handled by the Chief Minister becomes “defunct” and it is evident in the case of DPAR, Finance, Energy, and Bengaluru Development. Reiterating the demand for a total lockdown to break the chain, Mr. Vishwanath said partial lockdowns do not serve any purpose. The government has exempted construction sector and garment units because many Ministers and MLAs are running businesses, he alleged.  BJP leaders hit back Meanwhile, Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar and other BJP leaders hit back at Mr. Vishwanath for his outburst. The Minister said repeated outbursts against the Chief Minister does not behove Mr. Vishwanath’s seniority. Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, said the MLC had “lost his mind” and to air such statements because he was not made a Minister diminishes his dignity. Another leader warned of “disciplinary” action against Mr. Vishwanath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bsy-blind-and-deaf-to-pandemic-vishwanath/article34494793.ece
06 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Talks held on handling oxygen supplies||Officials of Mysuru district administration and elected representatives on Wednesday held a meeting with representatives of oxygen refilling units and private hospitals in the city and took stock of the situation. While the private hospitals were instructed to set aside 50 per cent of the beds for patients referred by the government, the oxygen refilling units were instructed to ramp up their production to meet the growing requirement of medical oxygen in the wake of the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen. The private hospitals were not only assured that the government will reimburse the expenses incurred on the treatment of the patients admitted under the government quota, but also cautioned against collecting bills in excess of the amount stipulated by the government for patients admitted under different categories. The representatives of oxygen refilling units, who were asked to increase their production, cited the hurdles they were facing in terms of sourcing liquid medical oxygen (LMO), transportation and other logistics before seeking government assistance.  ‘Scam’ Earlier in the day, Mysuru District Congress Committee President Vijaykumar alleged a bed-blocking scam in private hospitals in Mysuru. He told reporters that that the Congress, which had started a health helpline last week, was not able to secure admission of even a single patient in the government quota beds in private hospitals since the last four days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/talks-held-on-handling-oxygen-supplies/article34494776.ece

Of the 204 staff manning the war room, Mr. Surya read out 17 names, all members of a minority community. He questioned their recruitment and their role, following which all 17 were fired. MLAs Ravi Subramanya and Satish Reddy had also made communally loaded statements. Senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa on Wednesday expressed suspicion that minority organisations may be behind bed-blocking in the city. Many citizens took to social media to criticise Mr. Surya for communalising the issue. Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said BJP leaders were unfairly trying to pin the blame on a community for the bed-blocking scam. “The communal virus in your brain is more dangerous than coronavirus, better get tested,” he tweeted. Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy also came down heavily on the legislators. “A legislator asks whether this is a madrasa. When people are dying, these legislators are going to the war room and doing politics. Religion doesn’t work, honesty works,” he said. Several activists have demanded a criminal case be booked against Mr. Surya and the legislators. “In reading only the names of the 17 employees from a minority community and making communal remarks, they have promoted enmity and hatred. Police have to book a suo motu case under Sections 153A and 505(2) of the IPC. What proof does he have to blame them?” said advocate and activist Vinay Sreenivasa. Public health activist Dr. H.V. Vasu was equally scathing in his criticism. “It is clearly a diversionary tactic, a pattern we have seen both across the country and in Karnataka last year too, when the crisis went out of hand and people’s anger was directed at BJP governments in the State and Centre,” he said. BJP MLA Uday Garudachar, who was in the war room with Mr. Surya on Tuesday, sought to distance himself from the communal overtones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mp-legislators-draw-flak-for-communal-twist/article34495059.ece

She accused the Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner of making allegations by releasing press statements against her in the context of oxygen supplies to Chamarajanagar even when the matter is under inquiry as per the orders of the State government. “…Chamarajanagar Deputy, without waiting for the enquiry to be completed, continues to make false allegations against Deputy Commissioner Mysuru in the media”, she said. She said the oxygen supplies to a district are left to be decided entirely between the supplier/re-filler and the district administration. The Deputy Commissioner of another district has no role or authority in the matter. “For example, Mysuru’s oxygen supplies are from Ballari. If the supplier from Ballari supplies less, I cannot blame Deputy Commissioner, Ballari”, she reasoned before arguing that it was the responsibility of the district to manage their own supplies. If any oxygen supplier does not meet the requirements of a district, an intervention should be made by the State-level officers, she said. “The DC Chamarajanagar should have coordinated with these state-level officers and got his supplies. He failed to do that and is now blaming DC Mysuru”, she said in the statement. “As a matter of fact, Mysuru district, upon emergency request from Chamarajanagar, took out 40 oxygen cylinders out of its own district hospital on the night of 2nd May 2021 and sent to Chamarajanagar”, she claimed. Ms. Sindhuri’s statement is in response to Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar M.R. Ravi’s statement on Tuesday that Mysuru district administration did not respond properly to the medical emergency and the midnight crisis in the Chamarajanagar district hospital as Chamarajanagar, a backward district, was completely dependent on neighbouring Mysuru for supply of oxygen. Mr. Ravi had also disputed the claims of Ms. Sindhuri that 250 oxygen cylinders had been delivered to Chamarajanagar. The claim of Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru is “far from truth”, he had said. The Mysuru Deputy Commissioner’s clarification on Wednesday was also followed by a statement issued by the Deputy Drugs Controller, Mysuru Region, Mysuru, with the details of the oxygen supplied to Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences from refillers in Mysuru. The statement said a total of 251 cylinders had been dispatched between 10.20 a.m. of May 2 and 3.15 a.m. of May 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/war-of-words-between-dcs-over-deaths-continues/article34494773.ece

06 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Debunking theories linking menstruation, vaccination||Even during normal times, menstruation is a favourite topic around which misinformation storm troopers on social media weave hare-brained myths. The pandemic seems to have provided them with a more fertile ground going by the awful theories being peddled linking menstruation and vaccination on social media. Getting vaccinated during menstruation can lead to excessive bleeding and unusually acute pain, says one such story. The campaign seems to have gained some traction going by the anxious calls received at the helpline being run by the Women and Child Development Department. Poster campaign Taking the matter seriously, the department has embarked on a poster campaign debunking these myths. The posters among other things seek to reinforce that vaccination during menstruation is as safe as any time, neither will it reduce immunity or lead to excessive bleeding. “We have also asked our 33,500 anganwadi workers to clarify the matter to the ones swayed by such misinformation campaign through calls since anganwadis remain closed now. However, they have been asked to do it judiciously as we don’t want to inadvertently help increase the reach of misinformation, which is now largely confined to social media,” T.A. Anupama, Director, Women and Child Development Department. Swapna Bhasker, Consultant in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ernakulam General Hospital, said that linking vaccination and menstruation was completely devoid of any scientific or medical basis. She said that the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India has issued a circular debunking the myths. “Such claims (side effects of vaccination during menstruation) are completely unscientific. There is no physiological, endocrine, or immunological basis affecting vaccination cycle. Women can take the vaccine on any day of the menstrual cycle including the days of the periods. There is no scientific basis for delaying or avoiding vaccination for this reason,” the release said. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for immunisation in Ernakulam district where test positivity rate has exceeded 30%, said the Union Health Ministry itself has debunked the myth. “In fact, even those allergic to certain drugs should go for vaccination as it can only boost one’s immunisation. The bottom line is whether you risk vaccination owing to some unscientific myths or risk getting infected with this dreaded virus and die gasping for breath,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/debunking-theories-linking-menstruation-vaccination/article34495176.ece
06 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||17 LSGs ‘very poor’ in waste management||The Local Self-Government Department has given a ‘very poor’ rating to the solid waste management and sanitation scenario in 14 panchayats and three municipalities in Ernakulam. The worst-performing panchayats include Kumbalam, Karukutty, Ayyampuzha, Paingottur, Koovapadi, Mazhuvannoor, Aayavana, Mudakuzha, Pallarimangalam, Kuzhuppalli, Keerampara, Payipra, Chellanam and Malayattoor-Neeleswaram. Koothattukulam, Thripunithura and Maradu figured among the erring municipalities. The rating was given after a comprehensive evaluation carried out by the department in April. Some of the serious gaps found included absence of Harithakarma Sena members for regular waste collection, and lack of proper collection mechanism and facilities for treatment of biodegradable waste. The civic bodies were also found lagging in the implementation of material collection facilities. The best performing panchayats include Chottanikkara, Varapetti, Thirumaradi, Vadakkekara, Mukkannoor, Amballur, Kunnukara, Thiruvaniyoor, Puthrika and Ramamangalam. Kothamangalam, Eloor and North Paravur received the highest rating among the 13 municipalities in the district, according to the assessment report. Door-to -door Twenty-four grama panchayats have not yet started door-to-door collection of non-biodegradable waste. Twenty-six panchayats were yet to start door-to-door collection of such waste from commercial establishments. Only 20 grama panchayats had ensured door-to-door collection of non-biodegradable waste from households. The assessment revealed that only nine grama panchayats and six municipalities were complying with the circular issued by the Department on the norms for waste collection. Only 5.6% of the grama panchayats and five municipalities in the district had material collection facilities as per the provisions under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Thirty-two grama panchayats lacked the space for setting up the facility while the corresponding number of municipalities was eight. Twenty-five grama panchayats had failed to install the material collection facility under their jurisdiction. The assessment also revealed the widening gaps in initiating decentralised systems of waste management. Only five panchayats had Thumboormuzhi-model aerobic bins for treatment of biodegradable waste. But the number of units in these panchayats was considerably low (total eight units only). Eight municipalities had set up 38 such systems.

06 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Questions raised over fate of 10% economic quota in Kerala||The Supreme Court order in Maratha reservation case has cast a doubt over the fate of 10% economic reservation introduced by the State government in jobs and educational institutions. The apex court, while quashing the Maharashtra law to provide reservation for Marathas, held that there should be a cap of 50% on reservation as laid down in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. Outgoing Law Minister A.K. Balan apprehended that the verdict may leave an impact on the 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as the total reservation in the State had exceed the 50% cap. Currently, 50% caste-based reservation is provided to the Other backward Communities and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes together in the State. Additionally, a 10% reservation is provided to EWS from the open merit, without affecting the caste-based reservation, thus taking the total reservation to 60%. Pioneer The 10% EWS may not be be possible any more in the light of the apex court order, Mr. Balan told The Hindu.  Incidentally, Kerala was the pioneer to introduce economic reservation and provided 10% reservation for candidates from the EWS in Devaswom boards in the State. As many as 25 persons were appointed under the scheme. The apex court order will not affect those who have already been appointed. However, it may adversely affect the future appointments, he said. At the same time, the Nair Service Society maintained that the court verdict will not affect the economic reservation introduced via a Constitutional amendment. The amendment was never discussed by the apex court in the Maratha case. Moreover, the court had even refused to stay the amendment and the case challenging its validity was pending, said G. Sukumaran Nair, NSS general secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/questions-raised-over-fate-of-10-economic-quota-in-kerala/article34494743.ece
06 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kalamassery defeat intensifies factionalism in League||The internal discord in the district unit of the Indian Union Muslim League has intensified with the defeat of the party candidate V.E. Abdul Gafoor in the Kalamassery constituency in the elections. A section of the party leaders had earlier openly revolted against the candidature of Mr. Gafoor, son of former Minister, Ibrahim Kunju, who was arrested in the Palarivattom flyover case. The defeat of Mr. Gafoor in the constituency, the only seat in the Central and Southern Kerala where the party contested, has added credence to the arguments of the faction in the party, which was opposed to Mr. Kunju. Though the party, which contested in 27 seats, went down fighting in most of the seats it lost, the defeat at Kalamassery was a humiliating one as it lost by a significant margin, said Abdul Majeed, district president of the League. The UDF machinery worked with all its might in the constituency and ensured that all its votes were polled. However, its doubtful whether the candidate has succeeded in winning the hearts of neutral voters, he said. Neutral votes Going by the results, it has to be assumed that the neutral votes went in favour of the LDF candidate as Mr. Gafoor failed to impress the voters in his personal capacity. The candidate could manage only a lead of one vote in his own booth. There has also been a shift in the BJP votes in the constituency in favour of the LDF, which had also influenced the poll outcome, he said. When asked about the protest meeting held in the constituency against the candidature of Mr. Gafoor, Mr. Majeed said the party functionaries, who publicly opposed the nomination, had withdrawn their protest and worked for the candidate after the League supremo, Panakkad Sayed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, intervened in the issue. The district committee of the party and its local units in Kalamassery will carry out a review of the poll results to get to the root of the poll debacle, he said. At the same time, Mr. Gafoor maintained that the internal squabbles in the party didn’t leave much impact on the poll outcome. It was essentially the shifting of BJP votes in favour of the LDF candidate, P. Rajeev, that culminated in the defeat. Moreover, there was opposition from upper caste segments of society to the party’s stand on economic reservation, he said. On the poor performance in his own booth, Mr. Gafoor said his vote was in a polling booth, which was long considered a stronghold of the LDF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/defeat-intensifies-factionalism-in-iuml/article34494724.ece

K. Babu of the Congress defeated the Left Democratic Front candidate M. Swaraj by 992 votes. The party said that there had been instances in which entry to all women in Sabarimala and Mr. Swaraj’s speech in that connection was used communally in the electioneering. Such a graffiti was reported with cVigil, a mobile app launched by the Election Commission of India for fast-track complaint reception and redress system. Several such material evidences are said to have been collected by the party. Posters in the name of Sabarimala Karma Samithi had appeared across the constituency on the eve of the election exhorting the Hindu faithful to defeat Mr. Swaraj. Later, the Samithi officially disowned it and Mr. Swaraj alleged it to be the handiwork of Mr. Babu. What gives confidence to the party is the favourable legal precedents when alleged electoral malpractices were questioned in the past. Former MP, P.C. Thomas, was disqualified from contesting elections for three years from May 19, 2010, for corrupt practices during the election. He was disqualified under Sub-section (1) of Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The charge against him was that he used his religious background to woo voters. More recently, the Kerala High Court in 2018 had disqualified the Indian Union Muslim League MLA, K.M. Shaji, on a plea claiming that he used religion to win the Assembly polls in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-mulls-legal-action-over-poll-outcome/article34495167.ece

Secretaries of the grama panchayats that earned ‘very poor’ rating in the assessment by the Local Self-Government Department should evaluate the gaps in scientific waste management plans. The action plan has to be submitted before the Director of Panchayat, Ernakulam. The Deputy Director of Panchayat should hold a review meeting every week to assess the progress of implementation. Local bodies that are yet to deploy Harithakarma Sena members for the collection of non-biodegradable waste should convene a meeting to appoint the green volunteers. It was found that some local bodies, which included Koothattukulam, Aayavana, Karukutty, Vengola, Paingottur, Keerampara, and Puthenvelikkara, were yet to form the Harithakarma Sena for door-to-door collection of non-biodegradable waste. Panchayat committees should be convened immediately. An action-taken report has to be filed by May 12, according to an official communication. Secretaries of grama panchayats should take the lead in holding weekly review meetings to assess the progress of solid waste management and sanitation projects. Officials concerned must submit a compliance report before the District Deputy Director of Panchayat. Local bodies have to ensure that material collection facilities are not carrying waste beyond their capacity.

Mr. Baby had an enduring and enriching relationship with Mar Chrysostom which led to the former bringing out a volume, Christ, Marx and Sree Narayana Guru; A Colloquy by Mar Chrysostom Senior Metropolitan and MA Baby . The book, containing long conversations between the duo, was initially published in Malayalam. The conversations weren’t forced and veered around the issues of faith, atheism, the Charvaka philosophy and touched on figures such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Sree Narayana Guru, even Pope Francis. It also had short pieces written by Pinarayi Vijayan, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, and several others on their impression of the senior Church functionary. “A part of the conversations had been telecast on Kairali TV following which we held long conversations which resulted in that book. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote an introduction to it when it was published in English,” says Mr. Baby. Mar Chrysostom took an active interest in the People’s Planning Programme of the LDF government in the late 1990s. “He once called me, expressing his desire to donate his eyes after death. I went over and saw that he had completed all formalities to donate his eyes after death. This was inspirational for the government to launch its Darshanam programme. An organ donated by you is harvested after your death, but it also shows that the organs stay alive for some more time after you’re dead. It has philosophical dimensions,” says Mr. Baby. “He was sharp and witty and there was this incident of him coming home for lunch. At an event later, he said when he was fiddling with the sharp bones of fried pearl spot ( karimeen pollichathu ), I, a minister then, just kept staring at him while my wife carefully removed the fish bones, as his mother would have done, to help him out. So, she deserves to be the minister, not Baby sir, he announced with a smile, as he looked at me from the corner of his eye,” recalls Mr. Baby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/he-worked-for-the-weak-and-the-persecuted-baby/article34494669.ece

Joy Kalapura, State president of the Bharat Gas Distributors’ Association, said that gas dealers across the country had appealed to the Union Health Ministry for priority vaccination of the workers in the sector. Similar efforts were being made in the State too. He said that there were 684 gas distribution agencies in the State served by 6,840 LPG cylinder delivery boys, who visited 2.70 lakh homes across the State on a daily basis. 50 houses a day Each delivery worker visited around 50 homes per day. The lives of these workers and their families were put at risk because they came in close contact with people at their delivery points on a daily basis. Sometimes, the situation was such that the delivery boys were told of the presence of an infected person in a house only after he delivered the cylinder. M. Radhakrishnan, patron of the All Kerala Federation of Petroleum Dealers, said that around 12,000 workers were engaged in petrol pumps across the State. These include those associated with the filling stations, drivers and cleaners and those who service the customers. Those directly delivering fuel to the customers came in contact with around 3,000 customers daily. This implied that their plight should be considered as an area that needed priority attention. Fuel pumps There were 2,000 pumps belonging to the three public sector oil companies in the State. Besides, there were outlets operated by private oil distribution companies. On an average, eight persons worked in a fuel outlet. After health workers and police personnel, these workers were on the front line, working to ensure that there was no break in the supplies. Indian Oil Corporation sources said that the State level coordinator for the oil industry had requested the State government for priority vaccination of the workers in the sector and that the government had agreed to the request. The modalities were being worked out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lpg-fuel-dealers-appeal-for-priority-vaccination/article34495174.ece

At present all data including available resources, oxygen consumption, number of cylinders and details of plants are being updated while private hospitals who have been sourcing oxygen from outside the district have been asked to get in touch with the COVID-19 control room. “We have given directions to an agency in Kollam to employ more staff to fill cylinders and we have ensured supply to ambulances so that there will not be any issues while shifting patients. Cylinders will be replaced for all emergency cases,and we think we will be able to manage,” said Dr.R.Sandhya, Deputy DMO The test positivity rate (TPR) of the district, which had remained lowest in the State for a while, has also started rising now. “TPR is climbing up and today the number of cases almost touched 3,000. A total of 3,537 beds have been identified by the Department and at present 91% ventilators and 72% ICU beds are occupied,” she said. Currently Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd.

Private hospitals Meanwhile, District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao asked private hospitals to set aside 50% of beds for COVID-19 treatment. At an online meeting with representatives of private hospitals, he said any denial of treatment would invite legal action. Mr. Rao said hospital infrastructure needed to be strengthened in the wake of the rise in number of new patients each day. Details on the availability of ventilators and beds should be updated on the COVID Jagratha portal four times a day. Patients come to Kozhikode from Malappuram, Wayanad and Kannur districts as well. More ventilators should be provided to ensure expert treatment. All hospitals should open help desks. If any hospital is not able to provide treatment, the patient should be referred to other places. Protocol violation The police on Wednesday registered 1,105 more cases as part of the stringent enforcement activities against COVID-19 protocol violations in Kozhikode district.

06 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Oximeter turns dear as supply plummets||There seems to be an absolute shortage of pulse oximeter, the tiny equipment used to determine oxygen level in the blood, in Kerala, also leading to a steep rise in its price across districts. Falling of oxygen levels in blood is a major reason for death of COVID-19 patients. Those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and suspected patients too have been advised to use the meter to avoid a critical condition. Rajesh Pillai, State functionary, All Kerala Scientific and Surgical Dealers’ Association, said wholesale dealers had exhausted their existing stock, and fresh ones were yet to arrive. “We purchase pulse oximeters mainly from New Delhi and Mumbai. By April second week, there was a surge in COVID-19 cases in those places, resulting in a high demand for meters there for personal use. So, the arrival of the machines from there stopped gradually,” he added. Mr. Pillai said dealers had been trying for advance booking of the product to meet the demand but were yet to get any confirmation from manufacturers.  The trend has also led to the shooting up of prices. T.P. Faisal, a social activist associated with the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, said from between Rs. 600 and Rs. 700, the meters now cost between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 4,000. “We don’t know if some suppliers are indulging in black marketeering,” he said. With the State government instructing ward-level rapid response teams to keep at least 10 pulse oximeters ready with them, local bodies too are a desperate lot. Import of machines Mohammed Koya, a medical representative from Perumanna in Kozhikode, said efforts were on to import the equipment from China. Medical store owners say they normally do not stock them up, as the meters are normally not high in demand. Some of them had to sell off the stock before April at a low price. Mr. Pillai said dealers were purchasing the meters in a price range between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 1,800. The retail price will thus go up considering transportation charges and others.

In a unique move, the police are on the ‘lookout’ for couples who religiously follow the safety guidelines during their weddings and make their happiest moments the safest experience for all invitees. “We have so far distributed around 40 appreciation certificates to the newly married within the Kozhikode Rural police district. The couples were all very excited, as we could plan it as surprise gifts for them acknowledging their cooperation during the pandemic times,” District Police Chief A. Sreenivas told The Hindu on Wednesday.  He said he would personally call on such couples on possible occasions or otherwise delegate his colleagues to hand over the certificates. Following the creative move of the khaki-clad, many families in the Kozhikode rural area have been strictly complying with the safety guidelines and following the principle of minimalism. The number of visitors to weddings or similar family events has seen a considerable drop. Well-received Since the initiative was launched as part of an intensive awareness programme, it was well received by the public. Also, it paved the way for many families to share some cordial moments with police officials. “For better planning, we make a list of all weddings in our area in advance from the COVID Jagratha portal or through Special Branch reports. Later, our team comprising sectoral magistrates and police officials visit the spots to confirm that the families are properly complying with rules and following physical distancing norms,” said Dr. Sreenivas. He added that similar creative interventions would be made in the days to come. ‘Kuttikkaval’ (Child Watch) was another innovative idea launched by the Kozhikode Rural police recently to make children aware of the pandemic and their humble roles to fight off the crisis in their own families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-honour-couples-complying-with-protocol/article34494682.ece

Mohamed Riyas win a huge mandate in the Beypore Assembly constituency. Mr. Riyas who contested on the CPI(M) ticket secured leads in the Kozhikode Corporation, including the erstwhile Cheruvannur-Nallalam grama panchayat, Ramanattukara and Feroke municipalities, and Kadalundi grama panchayat. Incidentally, the United Democratic Front (UDF) is in power in both the municipalities. CPI(M) sources said the micro-managed campaign keenly monitored both by the district and State committees of the party gave Mr. Riyas a bigger victory margin than his precursor and popular leader V.K.C. Mammed Koya in the 2016 Assembly polls. Mr. Koya, a former Mayor and industrialist, who had also represented the segment in 2001-2006, had secured a margin of 14,363 votes against his nearest rival M.P. Adam Mulsi of the Congress. Bigger margin However, in this poll, Mr. Riyas doubled the margin, polling 28,747 more votes than Congress nominee P.M. Niyas in the segment. He received 49.73% of the popular vote, 82,165 EVM and 1,660 postal votes out of the 1,65,210 total votes. Sources said the party machinery focussed on electioneering in Beypore more than other segments in the district following rumours of strong undercurrents against Mr. Riyas, who had entered the fray after a hiatus following the electoral debacle in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. He was also unsuccessful in the civic polls in 2005. In Beypore, Hindus and Muslims equally share the demographic profile. It is considered to be an unbreachable red fortress even when the Congress-League-BJP alliance failed to pull off a victory in the 1991 Assembly polls. In the December 2020 local body polls, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) had got 71,150 votes; UDF, 56,063 and the BJP, 26,428. However, Mr. Niyas alleged that the BJP had transferred votes to get Mr. Riyas elected from the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/micro-managed-campaign-helped-riyas-win-big-in-beypore/article34494674.ece

The accomplished Mohiniyattam dancer had come down with COVID-19 and was hospitalised for a few days. And this happened at a time when she was working on an international project titled ‘Ahalya’ on the theme of ‘solitude’ imposed by the pandemic. Devika is one of the four Indian dancers commissioned by the Canada-based Sampradaya to make productions on the theme. Rama Vaidyanathan (Bharatanatyam), Aditi Mangaldas (Kathak) and Bijayini Satpathy (Odissi) are the others. Devika showed all the classical symptoms of COVID-19 while she was on working on the music of her production. Besides writing the script, in collaboration with Valmiki, she would tell you, smiling, she has also composed the music. “I was suffering from breathlessness, but the deadline to finish my film was fast approaching. So I sang the track in that condition and mailed it to my musicians,” says Devika. “It was indeed a severe form of COVID-19 that struck me.” After leaving the private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, she had to isolate herself in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol. That experience came in handy when she enacted the role of Ahalya during the shoot of her production. Tough times “I chose the tale of Ahalya for my film because I thought we all could relate, during these tough times, to her isolation and loneliness as she waited for Rama to end her curse,” says Devika. “I interpreted her character from my own perspective rather than those of other poets like Ezhuthachan. After reading different versions of The Ramayana , I went back to the original work by Valmiki.” The production, which she has choreographed and performed, is in the Mohiniyattam style, of course.

06 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||LJD stakes claim for Cabinet berth||In a bid to get out of its political wilderness, the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) has staked a claim in the Cabinet in the second Pinarayi Vijayan Ministry. The development comes in the wake of the decision of the CPI(M) State secretariat not to offer ministership to its junior partners with single legislator. The Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which contested three sitting seats of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), was able to emerge victorious only in the Koothuparamba constituency. LJD State president M.V. Shreyams Kumar and Kozhikode district president Manayath Chandran lost the Kalpetta and Vadakara seats respectively. Demand taken up Senior party functionaries met CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan and sought a berth for its lone legislator K.P. Mohanan. The CPI(M) leadership appeared to be non-committal on their demand as other partners KC(B), Congress(S), Janadhipathiya Kerala Congress and several Independents also had to be satisfied, sources said. Sources said the LJD State secretariat will meet on Friday to take stock of the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ljd-stakes-claim-for-cabinet-berth/article34494744.ece
06 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Associations help speed up vaccination of elderly||The intervention of various residents’ associations in the city to speed up the vaccination of senior citizens has come to fruition with the Health Department’s latest plan to reach out to the needy with the support of ward councillors, Junior Public Health Nurses (JPHN) and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA). Now, efforts are on to collect the ward-level details of all elderly citizens, whose final dose is due as a result of the vaccine shortage and other unexpected technical issues. The comprehensive ward-level priority list will be prepared carrying the names of persons who have completed 42 days after their first dose. Arrangements are also in place to give equal consideration for all wards. For many, the delay in getting the second dose had emerged as a headache after they failed to schedule it online due to various technical issues. Though many of them had been in touch with various private and government hospitals for support, the shortage of vaccine and the previously set distribution norms were playing spoilsport. “Currently, at least 10 senior citizens from each ward get their final shot with our intervention. The list is being prepared in such a way as to attend emergency requests with high priority,” said a residents’ association leader from Karaparamba ward, who took up the issue with the higher authorities. In the absence of ASHA workers, the ward councillors themselves would be preparing the data and exchanging it with the Health Department staff concerned, he said. Some senior citizens, who received their final shot on Monday and Tuesday, said they were very much apprehensive of the inordinate delay in the vaccination process and the possible complications as a result of the delayed booster dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/associations-help-speed-up-vaccination-of-elderly/article34494683.ece

06 May 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||A chronicle of political and social history of the country||Those who have happened to meet or hear Philipose Mar Chrysostom even once will instantly recognise some of his hallmarks; a mix of mundane with the weighty discipline of theology, instinctive humour, and the sardonic use of language. He would talk of God for hours as though he is talking about a person in the neighbourhood, tease his listeners, crack a joke about himself and his God, all the while spreading light and warmth all around. Indeed, laughter had a great deal to do with the prelate’s connections that transcended much beyond his religion and cut across all walks of life. According to Blessy, the award-winning film-maker who made the biographical documentary of the Metropolitan - 100 years of Chrysostom , the philosophical insights that the Valiya Thirumeni (as he was fondly called) conveyed through his speeches have left a legacy that will eventually outlast his humour. Having travelled extensively with the Metropolitan across the country for years on end, Blessy regards mirth as an ancillary behaviour of the prelate that helped him impart his wisdom. Great communicator While his innate humour and effective communication skills may have helped the Metropolitan instantly strike a chord with the audience, a great deal of preparation also went into each of his speeches. “I have seen him reading books in the early morning hours in preparation of the speeches to be delivered. But the message that the Metropolitan tried to convey through simple, humorous stories were often lost as people began celebrating the funny side of his character,” he says. Born in 1918, the year when the First World War drew to a close, the Metropolitan’s life is an epic chronicle of the political and social history of India in the last century. “The project was completed in a span of over five years as unfolding the many facets of this great man's life was a daunting task,” Blessy says. Wide circle of friends Beyond the innate humour and philosophical vision, part of his popularity no doubt stemmed from a little too wide friendship circle that the Metropolitan had possessed. There was little wonder then that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one among his friends, on Thursday took to the social media to state that he felt “saddened by the demise of His Grace The Most Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan”. “He will be remembered for his rich theological knowledge and many efforts to remove human suffering. Condolences to the members of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church,” tweeted the Prime Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-chronicle-of-political-and-social-history-of-the-country/article34494670.ece

An 'oxygen war room' has been opened at the district Collectorate to coordinate procurement and distribution of medical oxygen. The war room is designed as a 24-hour facility for monitoring oxygen availability across the district and ensuring prompt supply to hospitals, District Collector Navjot Khosa said. The auditorium of the Government Women's College, Vazhuthacaud, has been designated as the district-level collection centre for oxygen shipments.

06 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CSI retreat in Munnar last month comes under a cloud||A retreat organised by the South Kerala diocese of the Church of South India (CSI) at the Christ Church in Munnar last month has come under a cloud after a number of priests who participated in the four-day event tested positive for COVID-19. There are conflicting reports on the exact number of people who had contracted the disease, with one faction of the CSI claiming that close to 100 priests have tested positive over the past weeks, while the official faction claims that only around 24 of those got the disease. However, it has been confirmed that two priests have succumbed to COVID-19 since. As of now, six priests are admitted in the Somervell CSI Medical College Hospital at Karakonam, four in the Government Medical College in Thiruvananthapuram and three in other private hospitals, according to the officials of the CSI, while quite a few have recovered. CSI moderator and South Kerala diocese bishop A. Dharmaraj Rasalam is among those who have tested positive. The retreat was held in Munnar from April 13 to 17. A group photograph of the pastors and church workers at the retreat shows many of them standing close together without masks. Jacob Mathew, secretary of the CSI Trust Association, says that similar meetings and elections scheduled during the same period in the Central Kerala and Cochin dioceses were cancelled after he had written a complaint to the Chief Secretary. "Many of the priests themselves were not keen on attending. There was no space for proper physical distancing in that hall," said Mr. Mathew. Allegations refuted However, the official faction of the CSI has sought to portray these as false allegations as part of the internal rifts. T.T. Praveen, CSI South Kerala diocese secretary, refuted the allegations and claimed that the event was announced and held much before the second wave hit. "We have been organising these annual retreats for our priests for the past 40 years and they all look forward to it. The retreat was held as per unanimous decision of the administrative committee. It held in the church hall with a capacity for 400 people and a makeshift venue outside with capacity for 150. The first batch of 172 priests was there for April 13 and 14 and came back, when the second batch of 160 went. Out of all those who went, only 24 people have tested positive till now. Quite a few priests who did not come for the retreat did test positive as a result of the natural spread being seen around us now. Both the priests who passed away had other serious co-morbidities," said Mr. Praveen. Government’s view Replying to a question on the retreat during his daily COVID-19 press briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government was aware of the incident and had taken a serious view of such events being held during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/csi-retreat-in-munnar-last-month-comes-under-a-cloud/article34495308.ece

Under the aegis of the local parish, the local community has formed a volunteer group — christened ‘COVID-19 Karma Sena’— to keep tabs on visitors to this coastal neighbourhood which is home to a bustling fishing harbour. Armed with thermal scanners and hand sanitiser bottles, volunteers have stationed themselves at three entry points to the region to make sure that visitors are free from symptoms. ‘Karma Sena’ members describe their vigilance as an example of how a local community protects itself during the pandemic. “In these times, it is our duty to protect ourselves. This is a neighbourhood which has a busy fishing harbour. A lot of people come and go. We had formed the ‘Karma Sena’ last year following the outbreak with around 75 volunteers. When the second wave struck this year, we revived it by roping in more volunteers. Our safety is primarily our responsibility,” said S. Cyril, convener of the team. Teams rotated Teams of five are rotated every two or three hours at the three entry points which include the approach to the harbour area and Thenoorkonam. Their work starts at 5 a.m. and goes up to 9 p.m. The names and phone numbers of strangers are noted down for future reference. People are encouraged to wear masks and follow the COVID-19 protocol. Outside the local church too, the volunteers have been deployed to ensure that pandemic protocol requirements are fully met, said L. Sahayam, the parish secretary. “As per the protocol, not more than 50 people are allowed inside the church at a time. We have introduced a system based on tokens. Volunteers are stationed outside the church with sanitiser and thermal scanners,” Mr. Sahayam. “Same goes for the parish hall where weddings are held,” he added. Thiruvananthapuram district has witnessed a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases during the second wave. The district has reported a daily caseload of over 3,000 new cases in six of the past 10 days.

Liquid oxygen (LOX) is used as oxidiser in the propellant combination for the cryogenic engine of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The initial supply of 12 metric tonnes reached here on Wednesday, government sources said. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had agreed to supply 12 MT to the State on a weekly basis after Chief Secretary V.P. Joy wrote to ISRO chairman K. Sivan. M.C. Dathan, scientific advisor to the Chief Minister and a former director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), had taken the initiative to obtain ISRO's assistance in this regard. The IPRC is the testing centre for the space agency’s liquid propulsion systems. The cryogenic engine uses a propellant combination of liquid hydrogen (LH2) and LOX. Hydrogen liquefies at minus 253 degrees celsius (-253) and oxygen at minus 183 degrees celsius (-183). Cryogenic engines form the upper stages of the Mk-II and Mk-III variants of the GSLV.  After the COVID-19 outbreak last year, the VSSC had come up with three ventilator models. Trials are progressing on two of them, VSSC officials said. The models were christened PRANA (Programmable Respiratory Assistance for the Needy Aid); SVASTA (Space Ventilator Aided System for Trauma Assistance) and VaU or read as Vayu (Ventilation Assistance Unit).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-get-oxygen-from-isro-unit/article34494755.ece

06 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Corporation to deliver medical aid at doorstep||With many COVID-19 asymptomatic patients now in home quarantine than in hospitals or first-line treatment centres, the city Corporation is set to deploy medical teams to check on them at their homes and also make available telemedicine facilities. According to officials of the civic body, this is the first time that a local body in the State is putting up such a system to bring doctors to the doorstep. The city Corporation is using its team of doctors from the urban primary health centres under its control for the initiative, meant to address the concerns of asymptomatic patients and reduce the load on hospitals where beds are filling up fast. "Each medical team will comprise a doctor, a pharmacist, a nurse and a lab technician. A slightly larger team will also be stationed at the COVID-19 control room in the Corporation's main office for telemedicine support. If we get 10 calls at the control room, probably all of them would want a doctor to visit them directly. However, some of these cases can be handled by the telemedicine team. In cases where a direct visit is required, our medical team will visit their houses," says Binu Francis, Secretary of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. Practical hurdles However, the City Corporation's health wing is also foreseeing practical difficulties while implementing the initiative on the ground, especially with regard to the COVID-19 protocols for doctors and others who come into contact with a COVID positive patient. "As per the protocol, they have to wear Personal protective equipment (PPE) kits when meeting the patients. Once the meeting is done, they have to remove the kit, disinfect it and also disinfect the vehicle they travel in. This could limit the number of cases that can be taken up in a day. While in a hospital the doctors can attend to several patients in the space of four or five hours, here they need to change the PPE kit after meeting each patient," says an official. Expansion call With an aim to expand the medical team, the Corporation has also given a call for doctors, nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, physiotherapists and those who have completed health inspector diploma courses to join the initiative voluntarily.

Introduced sometimes ago with public participation, the project aims at providing oxygen for all in-patients. The project has high relevance, especially in the time of the surge in COVID-19 cases. Designed by the doctors at the hospital, the project has been implemented in 500 beds in six wards in the first stage. Each unit costs around Rs. 12,000. Doctors, voluntary organisations, patients and old-students have contributed to the project. The plan is to extend oxygen supply to all the 1,450 beds in the hospital. People who are ready to be part of the project can donate their share. New oxygen plant Meanwhile, work on an oxygen plant has been finished at hospital and is ready for inauguration. The plant would start functioning soon, the District Collector said. “Oxygen availability has been ensured in the district. All cylinders on industrial use will be procured for medical purpose.

Decentralised approach Failure of the coordinating nodal officers led to paucity of oxygen, Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said at a meeting of the people’s representatives and COVID-19 nodal officers convened by R&B Minister M. Sankaranarayana here on Wednesday. Favouring a decentralised approach in the working of the nodal officers, the MLA said it would help them tackle emergencies without waiting for the orders from the higher-ups. While there were two nodal officers to oversee and coordinate the supply of oxygen, the Superintendent in-charge of patients at the Cancer Hospital was made the scapegoat, the MLA said. “Why were no alternative arrangements made when the officials knew the capacity of the storage tank and were coordinating with the oxygen supplier? It is impossible for a single person to manage every aspect when a couple of hundred patients are being treated with severe scarcity of medical and paramedical staff,” Mr. Venkatarami Reddy observed. The MLA also suggested the taking over of the government hospitals at Kannekal and Uravakonda, along with the Kalyandurg RDT Hospital, for COVID-19 treatment, duly making arrangements for oxygen supply either through bulk cylinders or oxygen concentrators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/oxygen-lack-failure-of-nodal-officers/article34495154.ece
06 May 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lack of beds, staff shortage hit treatment in Anantapur||With the district running out of ICU and oxygen-supported beds, distressing scenes ensued at the Anantapur GGH as tens of patients, hooked up to oxygen cylinders that they bought on their own, continued to wait outside in ambulances for admission. Many of them have come from across the district as they were referred to the Anantapur Government General Hospital for an oxygen bed. One patient, whose oxygen saturation level had dipped to 88%, had come from Dharmavaram after finding no vacancy at the Gafoor Hospital there. Sometimes, those waiting here are left with no choice but to occupy the bed where a COVID patient had just died. Frantic calls were being made to people’s representatives to seek their help in getting a bed. Meanwhile, attendants of the patients at Super Speciality Hospital and the GGH have complained that doctors do not visit them and only nurses come to see the patients. There was one nurse for more than 50 patients, they said. Previously, kin of the patients used to attend to them, but now that none is allowed into the wards, they are left to fend for themselves. ‘Recruitments made’ While GGH Superintendent K. Venkateswara Rao said close to 1,000 medical and paramedical staff were recruited on a temporary basis and they had joined duties, they are not adequate for the number of patients. “Majority of the patients coming to the three government-run hospitals in Anantapur are in serious condition as the private hospitals are discharging them and referring them to the GGH as soon their health deteriorates. In some cases, they collapse even before reaching a hospital or after getting admitted here,” Dr. Venkateswara Rao added. All MLAs, attending a review meeting on COVID, complained that even in private hospitals they did not have an adequate number of doctors and that the patients were being looked after by the nurses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lack-of-beds-staff-hits-treatment-in-anantapur/article34495250.ece

06 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Increase oxygen allocation to Karnataka’||Observing that the State is facing a grave situation due to the COVID-19 surge, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the Central government to immediately increase the allocation of oxygen to the State to 1,200 MT per day from the present 865 MT per day. Prima faciethere is a justification for the quantity of oxygen demanded by the State government as the Central government has neither contended that the demand is on the higher side nor has disputed it, the court observed. The court noted that the Stategovernment had sought allocation of oxygen in the range of 1,471 MT to 1,791 MT per day during the period April 30 to May 5 based on the total active COVID-19 cases while indicating that the minimum requirement would be 1,162 MT. However, the Centre had allocated only 802 MT during last week of April and it was increased to 865 MT from May 1 after the court had asked the Centre to consider increasing in allocation. Fresh request Meanwhile, the court directed the State government to submit a fresh request to the Centre on oxygen requirement while directing the Central government to consider the State’s future request as well as the present request for increasing allocation to 1,792 MT. A Special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction after not being satisfied with the Central government’s offer of increasing the allocation to 965 MT. The Bench said that the Central government would increase the allocation of oxygen to Karnataka to 1,200 MT immediately till it considers the State’s request for 1,892 MT per day. The Bench also indicated to the Centre that it would consider issuing further direction based the decision to be taken on the State’s request for allocation of 1,792 MT. Oxygen sourcing The State government had told the court that seven major producers of oxygen in Karnataka produce approximately 812 MT daily and have a storage capacity of 5,780 MT. Of the 865 MT allotted by the Centre, 695 MT of oxygen is drawn from within State, 60 MT is procured from Telangana, 110 MT is allocated from Vishakapatnam and Orissa, for which logistic arrangements are being made. It was also pointed out to the Bench that the State government had lifted 671.75 MT on April 30, 650.97 MT on May 1, 691 MT on May and 722.71 MT on May 3. Lack of policy Meanwhile, noticing the lack of policy or guideline to manage and monitor supply of oxygen, the court directed the State government to come out with a policy for effective management. Earlier, the Central government said that allocation of oxygen also depends on the use, in addition to the number of active COVID-19 cases. Also, the Central government counsel told the Bench that 100 cylinders were received as foreign aid while pointing out that it had allocated 150 oxygen filling cylinders, received as part of the aid, to Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-asks-centre-to-increase-oxygen-allocation-to-state/article34494636.ece

06 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||State to increase rapid tests and optimise RT-PCR kits||With an unprecedented surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, Karnataka is now planning to increase rapid antigen tests (RAT) from the existing less than 10% to over 30%. This follows an advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to all States to increase rapid tests as laboratories across the country are facing challenges to meet the expected testing targets due to extraordinary case load and staff getting infected with COVID-19. Accordingly, the State’s COVID-19 ministerial task force headed by Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan that met on Tuesday gave an administrative nod to the Health Department to procure more RAT kits. State to place orders C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the task force, said the procurement committee of Karnataka State Drugs Logistics and Warehousing Society had decided to place orders for 30 lakh RAT kits. He said in the current situation there is a shortage of RAT kits and hence orders had to be placed immediately. “The State’s average test positivity rate (TPR) is hovering around 21%. Whenever the TPR is high, RAT is an important tool for immediate results. It will not only help in early detection but also in curbing transmission,” Dr. Manjunath said. Curbing transmission V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, who is also part of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said with symptomatic patients being prime drivers of the infection in Karnataka, rapid tests will help cut transmission at an early stage. RATs were recommended in India for COVID-19 testing in June 2020. However, the use of these tests is currently limited to containment zones and health care settings. RAT has a short turn-around time of 15-30 minutes and thus offers a huge advantage of quick detection of cases and opportunity to isolate and treat them early for curbing transmission, he said. “Although Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the gold standard test that has negligible chances of false negativity, an unprecedented upsurge of cases and deaths has made it imperative to optimize RT-PCR testing and simultaneously increase the access and availability of testing to people,” Dr. Ravi said. “If reports come early and if a person gets to know he/she has tested positive, tracking, tracing and isolation can be expedited. Rapid tests can be done at fever clinics where only those with symptoms report,” he said. Mild illness Explaining that nearly 80% of people have mild illness, Dr Ravi said: “People with mild illness assume they are asymptomatic. It all depends on how the patient’s history is recorded. Usually, patients with a strong immune system will be able to handle the virus and such patients will only have very mild symptoms, which they feel is not worth reporting and hence they are not recorded. A rapid test is useful in such patients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-to-increase-rapid-tests-and-optimise-rt-pcr-kits/article34494439.ece

According to the police, during the enforcement of the COVID restrictions, the police personnel of Gangavaram station spotted a car on its way towards Tirupati from Karnataka. Seeing the police, two inmates in the car reportedly showed signs of nervousness and tried to flee. A thorough check revealed that the duo was in possession of two bags, containing the cash. Preliminary investigation and a cross-check with Bengaluru counterparts revealed that the duo – identified as Subhankar Sheel (26) and Sanju Saha (27) of Nadia district in West Bengal– was wanted in several house break-in incidents in and around Bengaluru. On the night of May 2, the duo broke into a duplex house at MHR Layout in Bengaluru and decamped with Rs. 90 lakh. The house owner had also lodged a complaint with the area police station there. The police said that the accused then left Karnataka on May 3 on the pretext of leaving for their native place due to the lockdown. A case was registered and further investigation is on. The duo was remanded. Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar appreciated and announced rewards to the Gangavaram police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rs-90-lakh-stolen-cash-seized-two-youth-held/article34495243.ece
06 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sajjala lashes out at Naidu for ‘politicising’ COVID situation||Asserting that the government was efficiently tackling COVID-19, Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy told the media here on Wednesday that the supply of vaccines, oxygen and essential medicines such as Remdesiver was under the control of the Central Government, and that TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu was creating a ruckus over it. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the State had the capacity to vaccinate over six lakh people per day, and if doses were provided, the entire vaccination could be completed in 35 days. “However, the problem lies with the supply of doses, which is being monitored by the Central government. Although the State government is ready to purchase the vaccines directly from the companies, the control is still with the Centre,” he said, and questioned Mr. Naidu whether he knew under whose control the vaccines were being supplied. “Mr. Naidu, instead of blaming the government, should question the pharma companies for not supplying medicines,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said. He also accused Mr. Naidu of creating panic among the people. He further claimed that Andhra Pradesh was ahead of Tamil Nadu and Odisha in controlling the virus and stood first in the country in terms of testing, or allocating beds. Further, he stated the government was taking all measures to control the virus spread. The government also agreed to import oxygen from other States as the Centre was not supplying enough to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sajjala-lashes-out-at-naidu-for-politicising-covid-situation/article34495261.ece
06 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP has no right to speak about cooperatives: MLA||YSRCP MLA from Ponnur K. Rosaiah has brushed aside the allegations of the TDP on handing over Sangam Dairy to Amul. The TDP leaders had no moral right to speak about cooperatives as they were ruined only during the TDP term, Mr. Rosaiah told the media here on Wednesday. Mr. Rosaiah said, “It was the TDP leaders who had robbed the dairy farmers by debilitating the cooperative dairies. They are accusing the government of being vindictive when action is being taken against those who committed irregularities.” Dhulipalla case The ACB officials had conducted raids and arrested TDP leader and Sangam Dairy chairman Dhulipalla Narendra on charges of corruption and diversion of funds to the DVC Trust for personal use, the MLA said. Although Sangam Dairy had been established as a cooperative society, Mr. Narendra had become chairman of the trust and maintained it as his own firm. TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had destroyed the cooperative dairies and shutdown the Chittoor Dairy during her term only to safeguard the interests of his family-owned Heritage Group, the MLA alleged. The TDP leaders had lost the right to speak on farmers’ welfare too, as they failed to implement the loan waiver scheme when they were in power. As part of fulfilling his promise of increasing the incomes of the dairy farmers, the Chief Minister signed an MoU with Amul, which was already paying more than other dairies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-has-no-right-to-speak-about-cooperatives-mla/article34495260.ece

06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Two main SARS-CoV2 virus variants circulating’||Two main SARS-CoV-2 virus variants are prevalent across the country. While the so-called 'double mutant' or B.1.617, earlier mostly seen in Maharashtra, at 50% or more, Kerala and Karnataka in significant proportion, the "most infectious" among them - the UK variant, B.1.1.7, has been found 80% or more in Punjab and significant proportion in Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring states, according to scientists of the CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) on Wednesday. ‘Nothing new’ “There is nothing new in any of these variants and they are transmitting from person to person as the earlier ones like the dominant A2a strain seen last year but showing the same clinical symptoms, infection severity and certainly do not appear to be more lethal or causing more mortalities as is evident from viral genome sequencing of the samples. The major cause of such a huge and sharp spread is people’s behaviour and any variant is only the substrate," affirmed former director and now advisor Rakesh Mishra and his colleague Divya Tej S. In fact, Dr. Divya Tej has put out a twitter post with illustrations of the genome sequencing showing that the double mutant or B.1.617 is now fast replacing the earlier predominant virus strain of N440K observed extensively in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala from last year when swab samples were collected in July-August. "In controlled cell culture this variant makes more copies but it does not necessarily mean it can compete with other variants just the same way in real life pandemic where new variants keep coming up. Our genome studies say that N440K is now diminishing, it is of no concern and being replaced by B.1.617," he said. This ‘double mutant’ was noticed in October last year but started spreading in February-March this year with a reduction of N440K. “It coincides with the second wave seen in respective states as Maharashtra’s second wave was a one month and half earlier when compared to the four southern states. Variants play a role competing with each other, their game is completely dependent on human behaviour so it is possible to control if proper steps and precautions are taken, " explained Dr. Mishra. The scientist once again reiterated that instead of getting worked up about this or that variant, the main focus of people should be on "reducing the spread of coronavirus”. “The more it spreads, especially when people cluster for protests, meetings, religious or political fests, family functions, etc., the more variants are likely to come up, the more mess we create by increasing uncertainties and fear. Immediate need of the hour is to avoid crowds anywhere for any reason, use face mask, maintain personal hygiene, ensure good ventilation at homes or offices, plus take the vaccine shots - these will prevent the prevent the spread of the virus," explained the senior scientist. The most encouraging part in this gloomy scenario is that none of these variants has been found to escape the available vaccines effectiveness hence controllable. “We should consider ourselves lucky but you never know when a more lethal strain can come up, therefore, take precautionary measures now,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-main-cov2-variants-circulating/article34495153.ece
06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Demand for govt. facilities soars in TS||Until a few months ago, people used to steer clear of public health facilities in the State and with COVID-19 treatment restricted to government hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic, they had demanded that corporate hospitals also be allowed to offer the services. However, the second wave seems to have changed that trend. The shortage of ICU beds has led to a high demand for COVID admissions at Gandhi Hospital, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences, District Hospital in King Koti and Chest Hospital among others. Recommendations by influential persons have also increased multi-fold. “Perhaps, this is the first time that we are receiving enquiries from top officials about bed availability at government hospitals for people they know,” said an official from the State Health department. Staff working with various State Ministers also regularly call up government hospitals to ask about bed availability. During non-COVID times and in the first wave of the pandemic, the first preference of people was corporate hospitals, even if it was beyond their means. It was predominantly the poor who chose services at government hospitals. However, currently, as ICU beds in corporate hospitals remain full, even the affluent are turning their gaze to government hospitals. Oxygen, drugs Professor and nodal officer at Government General and Chest Hospital, M. Narender said availability of Remdesivir and oxygen is another reason that people are choosing government hospitals. Mid-level private hospitals and some corporate hospitals, on the other hand, are struggling to arrange for the anti-viral drug. Some nursing homes have asked patients’ attendants to procure the medicine on their own while many small-scale hospitals are refusing admission if the patient is aged with co-morbidities, or critical. “People always have a condescending view of treatment here. However, compared to private hospitals, it is us who have attended more critical cases during non-COVID times,” said a government hospital doctor. ICU beds in the major government hospitals are mostly full and were completely occupied on Wednesday evening too, according to the details on ‘health.telangana.gov.in’. Doctors said they are constantly evaluating the condition of patients to see if they can make space for more critical patients. “A separate team of doctors and nurses takes up floor analysis. They check oxygen saturation levels, vitals, and inform the triage about it. This helps to know who has to be shifted from oxygen bed to ventilator support, and who can be taken off oxygen support. Other methods are also being followed to admit more patients,” said T. Prabhakar Reddy, COVID nodal officer at Gandhi Hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/corporate-hospitals-full-demand-for-government-facilities-soars/article34495132.ece

The centres and individual caregivers are identified and verified to make it safe for children whose parents are undergoing COVID-19 treatment, Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said. “It was observed that with the rising number of cases, there is a trend of young parents and nuclear families being affected. In most cases, either one of the parents or both are hospitalised or in-home quarantine,” he said. With no immediate relatives around, it is distressing to see the children sharing the same facility or being left alone at home unattended, he said. “At short notice, we could mobilise the resources and get few facilities operational. There is a dedicated helpline where details are taken, and our SHE teams do a background check and safely drop the child/children of COVID-affected parents at this facility,” the top cop explained. “As we see many people using or in need of this service, we will scale up the facilities and provide assistance,” he said. Child Care Centers and individual caregivers can register on ‘covid.scsc.in’. For queries, advice and admission, one can call on helpline number 080-45811215 between 9a.m. and 6p.m.  The centres and caregivers are identified and verified to make it safe for children whose parents are undergoing treatment.

06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Why is testing low, asks Telangana HC||Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to evolve a strategy to restrain people from the neighbouring State of Andhra Pradesh entering Telangana as a new strain of virus called L-440 was reportedly spreading. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said the government should take all precautions with respect to people getting affected by the new virus strain in the State. Hearing a batch of PIL petitions on COVID-connected subjects, the bench sought to know from Advocate General B.S. Prasad if all the zoos in the State were closed, citing media reports about lions getting affected by the coronavirus in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad. Observing that COVID-19 tests in the State had dwindled, the bench instructed the government to conduct one lakh tests daily. It said the testing figures in the State were abysmally low. The bench sought to know from Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao why the State was unable to step up the number of tests. Dr. Srinivasa Rao, appearing for the hearing through video conference, said that people were not coming to the 1,110 testing centres set up across the State. Earlier, even asymptomatic persons used to come and get tested but that was not happening now, he added. Not agreeing with his contentions, the CJ said, in fact, people were thronging the testing centres having learnt about the piling up of bodies at crematoriums and burial grounds. Many people were being sent back since sufficient number of testing kits were not available, the CJ said. She instructed the government to ensure one lakh tests were conducted every day. Mobile testing vans should be pressed into service in all the 186 micro containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-is-testing-low-asks-telangana-hc/article34494438.ece
06 May 2021||K. UmashankerCHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||A man’s best friend during the pandemic time||A dog with four puppies in tow was trying to cross on the outskirts of Puttur when it was crushed to death by a speeding lorry. However, the puppies had a miraculous escape, but in no time presented a tear-jerking spectacle, gamboling over their mother’s carcass. Two college boys, who were returning home, picked up a pair each. Reaching home, the duo could not convince their families to adopt the days’ old puppies as they were still not able to walk steadily and that their mothers argued that feeding them was not an easy task. There was a reason when one of the mothers shouted: “At least they need two litres of milk per day. Who would buy it now at this hour of COVID pandemic?” Disappointed, the boys abandoned the puppies on the premises of Aretamma temple on the outskirts of Puttur. After surviving their first night without their mother, the puppies slowly crawled to reach the adjoining Aretamma Colony, when a group of children spotted them. The cute puppies became their favourites instantly. Again, four of the boys, aged below 7, picked up a puppy each and went home. No surprise, the households again rejected grooming the canines. Once again hitting bylanes, the pups were in danger of growling and menacing seniors. In the meantime, reportedly pricked by their conscience, the schoolchildren returned to the puppies and secured them inside the compound of a house. The children could gather all that they could — pocket money, their share of milk, biscuits and food — and kept feeding the puppies, naming them COVID-1, 2, 3 and 4. Whenever they sneaked into the houses in the neighbourhood, the puppies could succeed in getting some eatables from one and all. Slowly, the neighborhood, including children and homemakers, were in the forefront to feed them in turns, and shooing away the street dogs from harming them. After a month, the puppies have now become the cynosure of many households. Missing mother’s milk and care, yet the four could overcome their initial days of emaciation and hunger. Now, they have close to half a dozen regular patron households, apart from their saviour-kids. With holidays to schools and the lockdown owing to COVID second wave, the children try to draw maximum joy playing with the puppies. “The boisterous presence of these COVID 1, 2, 3 and 4 series are a big relief to us at this pandemic time. Though irritating sometimes, these cute pups are serving the children of this colony with much enjoyment,” says Divya, a homemaker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-mans-best-friends-during-the-time-of-pandemic/article34494501.ece
06 May 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||UNDP mission to restore nine wetlands in A.P. begins||The forest authorities have launched the works pertaining to the restoration of 5,000 hectares of mangrove cover in the Krishna and Godavari estuaries and 200 hectares of salt marshes as part of the five-year project of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The programme titled ‘Enhancing climate resilience of India’s coastal communities’ is being funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Of the 24 landscapes identified in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Maharastra for restoration at a cost of Rs. 298 crore, nine are in the State. As part of the programme, the coastal communities would be provided with climate-adaptive livelihood options for the restoration of the targeted landscapes by mid-2025. ‘Fish bone method’ “Funds for the first phase of works have been received and the GCF project has already begun in the State. Of the 5,000 hectares of targeted mangrove cover, around 4,250 hectares are in the Krishna and Godavari estuaries in the surrounding areas to the Coringa and Krishna Wildlife sanctuaries. The mangrove restoration will be done by adopting the fish bone method,” Wildlife Management (Eluru Division) Divisional Forest Officer C. Selvan told The Hindu.  First  phase  grant The project has begun with the first phase grant of more than Rs. 1 crore including Rs. 40 lakh allotted for the Eluru division, Rs. 40 lakh for Rajamahendravaram division and Rs. 30 for Kakinada area, he said. The restoration of around 200 hectares of Bantumilli marshy land in Krishna district and Nowpada swamp in Srikakulam district are the major targets of the project. Legal battle In the case of Nowpada swamp, the fishermen have won the legal battle against setting up a thermal power plant. Some of them died in the police firing at Kakarapalli in early 2011. The landscapes are Telineelapuram bird migratory habitation (Srikakulam), Coringa Wildlife sanctuary (East Godavari), Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary and Bantumilli wetlands (Krishna), Pulicat Lake and Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary (Nellore).  The wild crab-fattening method, direct involvement of coastal communities in the mangrove restoration, cultivation of mussel are among the areas designed to provide the climate-adaptive livelihood options to the coastal communities for conservation and restoration of the targeted wetlands, said Mr. Selvan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/undp-mission-to-restore-nine-wetlands-in-ap-begins/article34494499.ece

Godavari||A majority of the designated COVID-19 hospitals in East Godavari district are running short of Intensive Critical Care beds and beds with oxygen facility to ensure the critical care treatment to those battling for life . The report on the availability of the beds released by Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy on Wednesday shows that there is no availability of ICU beds in the 29 hospitals, including District Government Hospital (DGH) in Rajamahendravaram. There is not even a single bed with oxygen facility in the 28 hospitals, including DGH. In KIMS-Amalapuram, the major hospital covering the Konaseema region, and GSL hospital, that covers Rajamahendravaram region, all the ICU beds have been occupied. In Kakinada Government General Hospital, barely two ICU beds are vacant, and 38 beds with oxygen facility are available to be spared for the new admission of those battling for life. In a field inspection of the functioning of the hospitals, Mr. Reddy admitted that there was a huge requirement of critical care infrastructure such as ICU beds and oxygen-facility beds across the district. Those seeking admission to the renowned hospitals such as DGH-Rajamahendravaram have to wait until someone is discharged or declared dead in the hospital. Exploitation A senior official on a condition of anonymity said that the designated COVID-19 private hospitals were exploiting the patients seeking critical treatment in Kakinada and Rajamahendravaram, where they are discharging the patients during the ‘golden hour’ citing lack of critical care equipment.

According to sources, four patients were admitted in the hospital a couple days ago. Even as the COVID result was awaited, they died while undergoing treatment. Fearing spread of the virus, the family members did not turn up to claim the bodies. They also reportedly did not visit the hospital to inquire about the health condition of the patients. “We called the family members of the victims over phone and asked them to take the bodies by following the due procedure, but nobody came,” a hospital staff said. The staff shifted the bodies to the mortuary and waited for the family members, but they did not turn up. The victims were from Chintalapadu, Kondapalli, Veerulapadu areas in Krishna district. Initially, family members of two patients said that they will take the bodies if the COVID test result is negative. But, they stopped responding over phone later, the employees said. The staff then alerted the Revenue, Municipal, Medical and Health and Police departments personnel and got clearance for cremating the bodies. “We performed final rites for the bodies by taking COVID precautions. None of the family members attended the funeral,” a sanitation employee said. “COVID has snapped human relations completely. Not only the Nandigama incident, family members are not coming forward to claim the bodies of suspected COVID patients and those who died with the virus in many hospitals. In some incidents, kin of the deceased are not taking jewellery and other valuables from bodies fearing infection,” said a doctor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sanitation-staff-perform-last-rites-as-kin-abandon-bodies/article34495329.ece
06 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||UAE indefinite entry ban a huge setback for NRIs||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) decision to indefinitely extend its ban on the entry for travellers from India has come as a bolt from the blue for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) working in the seven emirates. The ban, in the wake of the surge in COVID-19 cases, is for passengers on all flights on national and foreign carriers, as well as for transit passengers coming from India. The decision came when the earlier ban was to end on May 14. Only transit flights to the UAE and bound for India have been allowed to land. Exemption has been given to cargo flight operations between the countries. The UAE has extended the suspension of entry for travellers who were in India in the 14-day period prior to arrival in the UAE. Travellers coming from India through other countries have been asked to provide proof of not less than 14 days’ stay in those countries in order to be allowed to enter the UAE. Foreign carriers operating to India have scaled down inbound flights. In addition to the seven emirates in the UAE, airline sources said a ban on entry of Indians is in force in Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The only countries that allow Indians are Bahrain and Qatar. Foreign airline sources said they would operate inbound flight as per the ‘air bubble’ pact for the time being, but outbound flights will not ferry passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/uae-indefinite-entry-ban-a-big-setback-for-nris/article34494436.ece
06 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala CM writes to PM for medical oxygen||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has made an urgent appeal to the Centre to resupply Kerala’s fast diminishing supplemental medical oxygen stocks. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, Mr. Vijayan said Kerala was cresting the second wave of COVID-19. The surge in cases was massive. The requirement for liquid medical oxygen was on the ascend. The State requires to stock up the life-saving compound urgently. Stock plunging Its current stock is plunging fast due to heavy daily demand. The State required 1,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. He requested the Union Ministry of External Affairs to issue the oxygen from the imported stock. Mr. Vijayan sought 500 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen immediately. The Centre could deliver the rest from the nearest steel plant, he said. He also requested the allotment of 50 lakh Covishield and 25 lakh Covaxin doses for Kerala. Care capacity Mr. Vijayan’s SOS to the Centre comes amidst a scramble to build COVID-19 care capacity in Kerala, given the upward spiral in new infections. The daily death rate was also slowly mounting. At least one government medical college hospital was operating in almost total capacity. Ventilators and oxygen beds were increasingly at a premium. By one account, private hospitals had reported 85% bed occupancy. Mr. Vijayan had said on Tuesday that the pandemic situation was grim. The pestilence was yet to peak.

The income from the temple hundi, which was Rs. 105 crore in March, fell to Rs. 62.62 crore in April recording an average of a little over Rs. 2 crore a day. But with the slash in the darshan tickets further, it dropped to a few lakhs a day since the beginning of May. As per information, the hundi has recorded Rs. 46 lakh, Rs. 78 lakh, Rs. 55 lakh and Rs. 39 lakh on the first four days of this month. Officials fear that the 18-hour curfew imposed by the State government from Wednesday is likely to affect the hundi income further. They also believe that the restrictions would also have an impact on the turnout of crowds, which hit its nadir on Tuesday with 4,723 pilgrims visiting the temple when 15,000 online darshan tickets were being made available every day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tirumala-hundi-income-hits-an-all-time-low/article34494447.ece

Though hailing from varied family backgrounds, socio-economic strata, caste and religion, all of them reached the morgue as dead bodies, with their kin not in a position to perform the last rites. In a moving gesture, the government arranged to perform last rites to the 21 persons who died of COVID-19. The bodies were offered garlands and the rituals performed according to their social customs. MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, who conducted the final rites by donning a PPE suit, carried the bodies in a procession. He expressed regret over the manner in which even blood relatives were watching the rituals from a distance. “When an entire family dies, the bodies lie unclaimed. This is not an economic issue, but a humanitarian issue. We have to get rid of the scare and give a decent farewell to the deceased, of course, by taking precautionary measures”, he added. Maha Prasthanam, a Rotary Club-supported organisation, took care of performing final rites to Hindu bodies, while Muslim JAC shouldered the responsibility of burying the bodies of their community members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-victims-get-formal-adieu-as-kin-stay-away/article34495252.ece
06 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Begin work in Jagananna Colonies on June 1: CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has instructed the officials to begin construction work in the ‘YSR Jagananna Colonies’ on June 1, and build a model house in every layout. In a review meeting on ‘Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu’ programme on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said construction of houses and creation of infrastructure in the colonies required 7.50 lakh tonnes of steel. Prices of steel “Due to slump in demand for steel because of the COVID-19 crisis, prices are likely to come down. Utilising the opportunity, the officials should negotiate the price to keep the expenditure at a minimum level, while not compromising on quality,” the Chief Minister said. If any beneficiary volunteered to get the house constructed on his or her own, the material needed should be supplied to them, he said. Power and water pipelines should be laid underground, he added. The Chief Minister asserted that the construction of houses would give a boost to the economy during the pandemic time by generating employment for the workers and stoking demand mainly for steel and cement. ‘Seek Central aid’ In view of the huge fund requirement, the Central government’s assistance should be sought, he ordered. The officials told the Chief Minister that 15,60,227 houses were sanctioned under the first phase of the PMAY-YSR Urban Housing (beneficiary-led construction) scheme. Out of these, 71,502 houses were in court cases. Decks were cleared for the construction of 14,88,725 houses. The construction of houses in the YSR Jagananna Colonies would be completed by June 2022. TIDCO project Under the TIDCO project, 81,040 houses were nearing completion (more than 90%) and 71,448 houses achieved 75% progress. Ministers B. Satyanarayana (Municipal Administration) and Ch.

Jagan Mohan Reddy’s assertion that the COVID-19 vaccination for people between 18 and 45 years was expected to start only in September, the former Chief Minister and the Telugu Desam Party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu stressed on the need to start vaccination for people above 18 years of age. “It is incorrect on the part of the government to say that vaccination for the people in the age group of 18 to 45 years cannot be taken up till October and November,” he said addressing a press conference on Wednesday. Mr. Naidu said there was no other way to combat COVID except vaccination. The elderly people who got vaccinated were safe. Even children were unsafe and vulnerable if not vaccinated. It was time the Centre and the State pooled all their resources together to save people. As per reports, even those below 18 years would be badly affected during a future third wave, he said adding, “Vaccination to all those above 18 years of age should be given immediate priority.” The State government ordered just 13 lakh doses, while all other States were procuring larger quantities. Tamil Nadu had ordered for 1.5 crore doses while Karnataka and Kerala were procuring 1 crore doses. Maharashtra had decided to go for universal vaccination for all its citizens, he pointed out. Referring to the partial curfew, Mr. Naidu called for total lockdown for a limited period in all States and the country in order to break the COVID chain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccine-for-all-above-18-only-solution-naidu/article34495254.ece

06 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBSE syllabus to be implemented in govt. schools||To raise the standards of education and to help students keep pace with the changing education scenario at the global level, the government has decided to implement the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus in government schools. Of the total 61,208 schools in the State, 44,639 (73 %) are Government schools with a strength of 43 lakh students. After the YSR Congress Party formed the government in 2019, the State-run schools recorded an additional 6,13,000 enrolments. Of them, nearly 4 lakh students had migrated from private schools to the government schools, while the remaining 2 lakh were new admissions. The government now has taken upon itself the task of providing high educational standards to these young learners and equip them with the knowledge to crack national and international-level competitive exams. To give them the kind of exposure they need to gain that edge, it has decided to introduce the CBSE syllabus. The CBSE is a national level board of education in the country for public and private schools, controlled and managed by the Union Government. There are approximately 21,271 schools in the country and 220 schools in 28 foreign countries affiliated to it. All Kendriya Vidyalayas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, private schools, and most of the schools approved by central government of India are affiliated to it. The CBSE envisions a robust, vibrant and holistic school education that will engender excellence in every sphere of human endeavour. As part of an agreement, the government schools in the State will be affiliated to the CBSE in a phased manner. The idea is to enable the 10th class students write the CBSE exams in English medium by the academic year 2024-25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbse-syllabus-to-be-implemented-in-government-schools/article34495333.ece

06 May 2021||VIKARABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three deaths send village in Telangana into a tizzy||The bustling village of Erravalli, 10 km from the district headquarters town of Vikarabad, is facing the worst challenge of its existence in the second COVID wave that is playing havoc across the nation. Three deaths due to COVID-19 of Patlolla Subhakar Reddy, Sadiulapuram Samantha and Anajiah in a span of two weeks has left the locals dazed and fear-stricken. While the first two died undergoing treatment in hospitals, the last one passed away in the village. Fearing the worst, the residents pleaded with the district administration to hold health camps to test people for COVID-19. When recently a health camp was indeed conducted, 30 out of the 85 people tested positive for COVID-19 sending shockwaves. On Wednesday tests conducted for 21 primary and secondary contacts of the corona patients and seven of them tested positive. Erravally has a population of 1,200 people and locals depend on agriculture as their main source of livelihood. Afraid of contracting the virus some villagers left their houses and moved to their agricultural lands. They have made the cattle sheds in the farm land as their temporary shelter. S. Mallamma, village sarpanch was also infected with coronavirus and is in home isolation. “People are fearing the worse even if they are having normal fever in the present situation. There is a need to increase number of tests immediately,” said Hanumanthu, husband of Mallamma. “There are about five families that are staying away from the village and in their fields in cattle sheds. These families are not infected with coronavirus but are afraid of contracting the same. This is a complete precautionary measure by them voluntarily. They are coming back to home in the evening and leaving houses early in the morning. There are only 28 COVID-positive cases and we are monitoring their health condition on day-to-day basis,” K. Aruna Kumari, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) of Erravalli told The Hindu . “In the case of Subhakar Reddy, he had high glucose levels and hyper tension and was on medication for several years. He was in hospital for three days and died later. Samantha was a single woman and had fever for four days and approached the officials very late. She was in government hospital at Vikarabad for one day and later died. As of now there are only 28 cases,” said panchayat secretary K Madhukar adding that tests for some more will be conducted by evening. “Surely we are not getting right figures as far as COVID cases or deaths are concerned in Vikarabad district. They have stopped even releasing health bulletin. We have to collect details from mandal level from one or other source and have to file reports. Officials are admitting that they are being supplied with limited test kits and their hands were tied,” said a Telugu language reporter on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-deaths-send-village-in-telangana-into-a-tizzy/article34494452.ece
06 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hospitals grapple with staff shortage as infections mount||The rapid surge in coronavirus infections has kept the district administration on tenterhooks. On one side, the single-day tally of infections has been touching the 2,000-mark since the last four days and on the other, there is a severe shortage of beds in hospitals. And now, the administration is grappling with shortage of manpower —both nurses and doctors. During the first wave of the pandemic last year, the district had recorded the highest single-day tally of a little over 1,200. But in the last 10 days, the average has been more than 1,700 cases per day. More importantly, this is the official count that is confirmned from the RT-PCR test results. Sources say that the real numbers are much higher as many people are undergoing tests through rapid antigen kits or HR-CT scan, which go unrecorded. Availability of beds As of now, the district administration is facing a serious shortage of beds. A conservative estimate by the health officials suggests that the district needs at least 3,000 more beds equipped with oxygen supply facility, apart from the already occupied 4,000 beds. Apart from this, the concern over oxygen supply is growing. The authorities say that the staff available at the government hospitals are not adequate to the cater to the needs of the patients, given the rapid spread of the infections. “The load is so high that the existing staff are not able to serve the purpose. There is an urgent requirement for staff nurses, paramedics, lab technicians and doctors,” says District COVID Special Officer and Andhra Medical College principal Dr. P.V. Sudhakar. Combining all government-run hospitals including the KGH and the VIMS, there are around 1,500 nurses and 1,000 doctors. As per an estimate by the Health Department, there is a need for 1,500 staff including at least 600 doctors. The nursing staff at the VIMS say that the mandatory quarantine period for the doctors and nurses are not being followed properly, due to shortage of staff. It is also learnt that the administration is in the process of recruiting at least 600 nurses and 300 doctors, but there are few takers. “We are trying hard to recruit doctors and nurses. But, a few are coming forward. We can’t blame them, as the fear of getting infected is quite palpable. We need to appreciate those who are doing their job tirelessly,” says a senior officer from the district administration. RINL 1,000-bed hospital The staff shortage has become a critical issue. Based on a directive from the Union Steel Ministry, the RINL-VSP is setting up a 1,000-bed hospital in its township on a war-footing. Sources say that State government needs to provide the manpower, which in present condition, looks difficult. “The RINL’s idea can augment well as we can lay a pipeline from the VSP that would supply oxygen to the hospital. We are in discussion with the RINL management and looking into the staffing issue,” says Collector V. Vinay Chand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hospitals-grapple-with-staff-shortage-as-infections-mount/article34495346.ece

The shops will remain remain open from 6 a.m. to noon daily during the two-week curfew. Huge crowds thronged the rythu bazaar at Seethammadhara. The buyers jostled with each another, leaving the social distancing norms to the wind. However, people were seen wearing masks. The consumers jostled to grab the vegetables and other provisions, fearing that the shops would run out of stocks. “There is no need for panic buying as the rythu bazaars and shops will remain open from 6 a.m. to noon daily. The idea is to facilitate purchases in a relaxed manner in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols. The people must understand that violation of protocols would make them susceptible to the infection, causing rapid spread of virus,” said an official. The police personnel were seen asking the people on the streets to go home as the curfew was in force from the noon. But, it took time for the crowd to disperse. A majority of the shops on the main roads downed their shutters by the noon. However, some shops in the internal roads functioned beyond noon.  Distressed sale Fruit sellers at Poorna Market sold mangoes at a reduced price of Rs. 200 for two dozens to exhaust their stock before the curfew hours.

06 May 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vizianagaram in urgent need of a govt. medical college||The absence of a government medical college is being acutely felt in Vizianagaram district, where many COVID-19 patients are desperate for medical care. Successive governments have not taken any steps towards setting up a medical college in the district. COVID patients, who are now bearing the brunt of decades of government apathy, are forced to travel to Visakhapatnam for treatment. The existing Government General Hospital is able to accommodate only 300 COVID-19 patients when over 10,000 persons who tested positive for COVID-19 are waiting for treatment in the district. Senior BJP leader Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju said that the party has been demanding establishment of a medical college for the last two decades. “Improvement of medical infrastructure should be the top priority for the State government. A sum of Rs. 500 crore would be sufficient for its establishment. The Jagan Mohan Reddy government should speed up the process as the Centre has also relaxed norms for establishment of new medical colleges in backward regions,” he said. Lok Satta Party State executive president Bhisetti Babji said that the State government had assured to establish a medical college but failed to identify a suitable location for it in the last one year. “At least 1,000 beds would have been available for COVID patients had the medical college been established in 2020 itself. Mere statements and sanction of funds on paper would not benefit the district in any way. The State government should show its commitment by taking steps on a war footing to construct the new college,” he said. Former Parvatipuram MP D.V.G. Sankara Rao, a doctor by profession, said that improvement of medical infrastructure would ensure access to good medical care at par with what is offered by hospitals in Visakhapatnam. “Apart from providing treatment to patients, senior doctors and professors can concentrate on research. They can exchange views and take up case studies in situations like COVID-19,” said Dr. Sankara Rao. Currently, Vizianagaram has only one private medical college — Maharaja Institute of Medical Science — at Nellimarla. Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana and other public representatives inspected various sites adjacent to the Government General Hospital, police grounds and Leprosy Hospital. Site yet to be finalised However, the site for the proposed government medical college has not been finalised yet due to various reasons. The Officials are expected to focus on site the selection after the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic subsides in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizianagaram-in-urgent-need-of-a-govt-medical-college/article34495292.ece

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Call for KPCC chief’s exit over poll loss||The knives seem to be out for Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran. The embattled leader is facing calls for resignation in the wake of the party's defeat in the Assembly polls. The Congress is reportedly caught up in a power struggle post-defeat. The political suddenly seems to be personal in the party. Illustratively, Hibi Eden, MP, has said the party did not need a "sleeping president". Mr. Ramachandran has been trolled widely in pro-Congress social media groups. The blame game arguably threatens to pit three dominant figures against one another namely Mr. Ramachandran, Mr. Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy. A senior leader said the political affairs committee (PAC) meeting scheduled for May 7 was unlikely to be a tame affair. Prominent Congress leaders and coalition partners have demanded a "recast" of leadership ahead of the PAC. Their public statements appeared to signal the volatility of the situation. Some have suggested that Mr. Ramachandran take his cue from Assam Congress president Ripun Bora who resigned, taking responsibility for the party's poor showing in his State. RSP leader Shibu Baby John and IUML veteran P.K. Abdul Rabb have signalled that the current disposition would not help the Congress meet future challenges. Nevertheless, Mr. Ramachandran reportedly has substantial reserves of support in the Congress. A party insider claimed the president had informed the AICC that he would abide by the national leadership's decision. The AICC had appointed him. Mr. Ramachandran reportedly did not want to put the party in a spot by resigning without warning. DCC president in Alappuzha M. Liju had pursued such a course. Moreover, West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, grappling with a similar poll debacle, was also awaiting the AICC's decision. Several leaders, including K. Muraleedharan, MP, had spoken out against scapegoating any one leader for the defeat. He suggested a practical way forward. Mr. Ramachandran's supporters said he had always kept Mr. Chandy and Mr. Chennithala in the loop. A 10-member committee, including the president, had spearheaded the election campaign. “It is a collective failure of the party. And not that of an individual leader or particular faction,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/call-for-pcc-chiefs-exit-over-poll-loss/article34494448.ece

06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘No lockdown in Telangana for now’||The Telangana State government has indicated that there is no chance of imposing total or partial lockdown in the State at present in the wake of the increasing number of COVID cases. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said that the imposition of lockdown in some States yielded no significant results. The situation was totally under control and recent trends indicated that the COVID curve was flattening. “We have to think about the livelihoods of people and other issues. The situation is totally under control and the State Cabinet will take a call on lockdown if the need arises,” he said. The night curfew imposed in the State would continue for some more days and the government would take a call on extending it only after the deadline for the night curfew (May 8 at 5 a.m.) ends. Asked about the High Court’s suggestion on imposition of weekend lockdown, he said that the government would definitely examine the recommendation “but imposing lockdown will be of no big use”. The Chief Secretary said situation in the State was much better compared to other States as the government had initiated proactive steps to check the spread of the virus. Declining trend Indicators both direct and proxy like the positivity rate showed that the virus was showing a declining trend and the situation was likely to return to normalcy in the next one week to 10 days. Steps like significant increase in bed strength in hospitals, oxygen supplies and supply of consumables, including medicine, had been taken so that the State handled the situation effectively. There was enough oxygen available with the government to cater to the existing and emerging needs as the government had taken steps to take oxygen from other States through specialised rakes and airlifted tankers to procure oxygen from other States. The oxygen requirement was currently estimated at 600 metric tonnes (MT) going by the occupancy rate in hospitals. The State had capacity of manufacturing 125 MT and the Centre had allotted 430 MT. The State was able to source 45 MT of oxygen from neighbouring States like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In addition to constituting teams of health and other associated departments, steps had been initiated for door-to-door survey to identify people with symptoms. Home treatment kits were being provided to people with mild symptoms while sufficient bed strength was available with the hospitals to treat moderate to serious cases. In all, 17 kits of RtPCR required for testing patients were made available in hospitals while tender process for procuring another 14 had been completed. “Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao gave express instructions that the departments concerned can place orders for the required material be it essentials or equipment without looking about financial aspects,” he asserted. Call centres were being set up at the district level to constantly receive requests from people and give advice while outpatient centres have been set up in all government medical establishments providing people with home treatment kits. It was for the people not to panic, the Chief Secretary said, expressing concern over scope for panic among people through circulation of social media messages. Asked about the doubts over the figures pertaining to COVID cases and deaths released by the department, he said the government was giving out the figures duly following the protocols laid down by the ICMR. “The numbers we declare are the real figures,” he said. Mr. Somesh Kumar said that the number of beds had been increased from 18,000 in September last to 52,000 at present while patients from different parts of the country were arriving in the city for COVID treatment as the city, reputed as medical treatment capital, was living up to the expectations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-lockdown-in-telangana-for-now/article34495161.ece
06 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Misleading names, addresses of PHCs put many in a fix||The Panjagutta Primary Health Centre (PHC) is in Begumpet. The Aliyabad PHC is in Goulipura near Sudha Talkies. The Charminar PHC is in Shahalibanda. Similarly, the Film Nagar urban primary health centre is in Shaikpet but the vaccination is being done at Gowtham Nagar Function Hall in the city. Citizens are left scratching their heads as they hunt for vaccination slots and then reach the vaccination centres designated to inoculate those aged 45 years and above. “These PHCs are not searchable online. How will senior citizens find the centres which are in small bylanes and that too without any landmarks,” asks Harsha V., who took his parents to the Shahalibanda PHC for vaccination. Different addresses “I started searching for ‘Film Nagar UPHC’, but couldn’t find anything on Google Maps. The Telangana government website mentions its address as ‘8-2-290/3, BGR Nagar, Near Shaikpet, Nala, Film Nagar, near Ramanaidu Studio’. The address on Co-WIN portal says ‘8-1-329-A-1PLOT NO 17, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500033’. But the UPHC address is 8-1-329/A/1/17 in Koh-E-Sar Colony,” says Avinesh Singh, another citizen who had taken his parents for vaccination.  But his travails didn’t end with finally locating the PHC. “Though it was called ‘Film Nagar UPHC’, the vaccination was being done at Gowtham Nagar community hall. Again, finding that place was difficult. After finally reaching there, I saw no display board, no notice or anything outside the building. I added the the community hall on Google Maps and it is now searchable,” says Mr. Singh The government list of PHCs in Hyderabad is of limited use. “The trouble is that the PHCs on that list aren’t on the Co-WIN app. I took my mother to the Jubilee Hills Road No. 5 PHC for her second shot after trying at a few other places. She got it with a walk-in registration,” said Sridala Swamy, a poet. Pleasant experience Even though citizens find the PHCs and Area Hospitals difficult to hunt down, once they reach there, the experience has been pleasant for many. If you have registered on the app and the PHC has the vaccine stock, the jab is a quick, painless affair as these centres are not crowded unlike the private hospitals where people are jostling for a shot. “We wait for 10 persons and then open a vial and give it to all of them. People who took their first dose in private hospitals are now coming here for their second dose. That’s why you can see all these cars,” says an ASHA worker at the Dar-ul-Shifa PHC.  Though it was called ‘Film Nagar UPHC’, the vaccination was being done at Gowtham Nagar community hall.

06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Focus back on safeguards in LPG supply||Protocols on safe supply of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders in the context of COVID-19, especially one advising the delivery staff to leave the refills at the doorstep of customers, are back in favour as the number of people getting infected with the virus spirals. Though never withdrawn officially, the significance of implementing the set of guidelines issued last year is greater now with cooking gas consumption by households also on the rise in recent weeks, sources in oil industry said. “We have instructed our delivery boys that unless absolutely needed they should not venture into kitchen,” says TS LPG Distributor’s Association General Secretary K. Jagan Mohan Reddy. For households with only elderly people or women who find it difficult to handle the cylinders, the delivery staff have been asked to take a call based on merit of the case. Many customers, however, prefer taking delivery of cylinders at the doorstep instead of allowing such staff into the kitchen. Irrespective of where they are asked to leave the refill, the staff have to perform the mandatory pre-delivery checks, including the all-important leak detection test, he says. While pre-delivery checks are not new, the Department of Civil Supplies had added certain standard protocols to be adhered to at the time of delivery in the wake of the pandemic last year. Sanitising the cylinder that is supplied as well as the empty refill the household returns, wearing masks and gloves and avoiding crowded places were key instructions given to LPG delivery staff. Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh R. Sravan S. Rao says while fresh instructions have not been issued, the grim situation unfolding as the overall COVID cases rise may necessitate a communication to the LPG network going forward on adhering to the protocols. For now, the cylinders are being delivered home, he adds. Some gated communities already have imposed restrictions on cylinder deliveries. For the national oil companies, a review of the situation becomes imperative in view of loss of lives of employees, distributors as well as delivery staff in Telangana. Mr. Reddy said at least six distributors and 12 delivery staff had died of COVID complications in the second wave of pandemic. As the nature of their job makes them vulnerable and may result in their becoming super-spreaders too, LPG distributors as well as companies like IOC are keen on getting those forming part of the supply chain vaccinated. The earlier it is done the better is something he sought to emphasis as in the last 10 days, LPG bookings by households had increased by 10-15%, presumably on account of customer fears of another lockdown being imposed. The distributors, however, have been meeting the enhanced demand and ensuring that the wait time for households, to access a refill, is not more than 1.5 days. At the peak of the first wave last year, LPG consumption had also soared before moderating, he says, adding the demand is more from urban areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/focus-back-on-safeguards-in-lpg-supply/article34495158.ece

06 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||CM more interested in politics than people’s health, says Bhatti||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s ‘insensitivity’ in the pandemic reflected again when he removed the Health Minister for political reasons when people were going through the toughest time of their lives. Speaking to reporters here along with Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy, he said the CM had taken over the Health portfolio and did not even review it when there was a medical emergency in the State with rising cases and depleting support from the government. “It’s unfortunate that people are dying without oxygen supply and the CM is least bothered about it,” he alleged. He said the CM went back on his promise made in the Assembly of including COVID under Aarogyasri. Poor people were hit by lack of medical and financial resources to deal with the virus but the CM is still unmoved. He wanted to know what happened to the Task Force on corona and reminded that it would present its report even to the opposition leaders. “Has the committee ever met,” he asked, and demanded that the government reveal the outcome of the report and the measures taken by the government on the recommendations. Mr. Bhatti also took a dig at Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, saying he was misleading people with false information on the availability of medicines and treatment at hospitals. “Let us all go and visit the hospitals to get a first hand report,” he said, adding that responsible officials should speak truths only. The Congress leader also demanded that the CM realise how private hospitals were fleecing people. He said the Opposition was ready to cooperate with the government and the CM should call for a meeting of opposition parties for their views so that a constructive plan could be implemented in dealing with the pandemic. Will meet CM: Jagga Mr. Jagga Reddy said that they would seek an appointment with the Chief Minister and if he doesn’t respond, that would only expose his failure. He said every citizen of the State should go back safely to their homes fully recovered like the CM recovered and it was the CM’s responsibility to ensure that. Mr. Reddy said that the Chief Minister was more interested in land issues than the health issues of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cm-more-interested-in-politics-than-peoples-health-says-bhatti/article34495166.ece

In a statement here, he ridiculed the dharna by BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar against the violence in Bengal and advised him to protest at Pragathi Bhavan against the State government for its failure in reaching out to people hit by COVID. “It is nothing but ridiculous for the BJP to ignore the failures of the TRS government but react to some issue nowhere connected to Telangana,” he said. Is Mr. Sanjay Kumar aware that people are suffering without oxygen availability and life saving drugs like Remdesivir apart from lack of supply of vaccines to Telangana by the Central government? he asked. He further asked was it not the responsibility of Mr. Sanjay to meet the PM and request for medical aid to Telangana. The BJP is least bothered about people’s issues here and it was shameful that the president sits on a dharna for political violence in some other State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ponnam-ridicules-bjp-dharna-on-bengal-attack/article34495164.ece

The demand for oxygen cylinders has peaked so high that more than 990 oxygen cylinders were consumed by around 49 COVID care centres including 46 private hospitals and three government hospitals in the district in a single day on Tuesday, sources said. Of the total 1,400 COVID-19 tests conducted at the designated test centres in the district on Tuesday, around 500 tested positive for COVID-19. A tweet by the close associates of a 74-year-old woman undergoing high-flow oxygen therapy for shortness of breath at a notified COVID care ward in a private hospital in Khammam expressing concern over the depleting stocks of oxygen at the hospital late on Tuesday night went viral. An imminent precarious situation was averted following the timely intervention of the district authorities who ensured timely supply of fresh stocks of oxygen cylinders to the hospital and also to the remaining authorised COVID care centres in the district on Wednesday morning. Some private hospitals reportedly referred several COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support to the District Headquarters Hospital on Tuesday owing to limited stock of oxygen cylinders, sources said. Fresh stock The district received a fresh stock of around 24.5 metric tonnes of oxygen in two separate spells in the last 24 hours. The stock will cater to the medical oxygen requirements of the hospitals for the next two and a half days and fresh indent has been placed by the two town-based oxygen filling stations to procure adequate stock of oxygen, sources added. The district headquarters hospital in Khammam is able to meet the huge demand for oxygen from the recently inaugurated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plant and the existing 13,000 litres capacity Liquid Oxygen Tank (LOT). All the 320 beds at the COVID-19 ward at the district headquarters hospital are presently occupied by COVID-19 patients. When contacted, Drug Inspector, Khammam, G Surendra told The Hindu that a little over 24 metric tonnes of oxygen reached the district since Tuesday night. The daily stock position at the two oxygen filling stations and sale of oxygen to the hospitals as per the stipulated price is being monitored by Collector R V Karnan on a daily basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/oxygen-shortage-hits-khammam-hospitals-hard/article34495152.ece

The accused have been identified as Ravi Sharma (40), Mohammad Abdul (38), and Shambhu Shah (30), all residents of Alipur, they said.

Though the State government had made a payment of Rs. 10.37 crore to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the procurement of around 30 lakh doses of the Covishield vaccine on April 26, it was yet to receive any supply schedule from the company, Health Secretary Hussan Lal informed the Cabinet during a virtual meeting. Mr. Lal said the company had only indicated that the availability of the vaccine could be known after at least four weeks. Only some private hospitals in the State, which had placed direct orders for vaccines, have begun vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group. ‘No lockdown’ The Chief Minister again ruled out a complete lockdown in the State, noting that the restrictions currently in place in the State were more stringent than the lockdown conditions in many other States such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. He announced a series of relaxations and relief measures to alleviate the woes of various sections of people. Amid the oxygen crisis, the government announced thrust sector status for all oxygen product units, while appointing a nodal officer to coordinate with the Customs Department for quick clearance of foreign aid, a statement said.  Tiding over crisis The status, approved by the Cabinet, will apply to oxygen production units with a minimum capacity of 700 cylinders per day which is equivalent to 5 MT, oxygen cylinder manufacturers/fabricators, and oxygen concentrator manufacturing units. Oxygen refilling units will not be covered by the special status. The Chief Minister warned that the COVID-19 situation could worsen, directing everyone to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/explore-all-options-for-supply-of-vaccines-punjab-cm-to-health-dept/article34495120.ece
06 May 2021||GURUGRAM,||Gurugram cremation grounds see dip in COVID bodies||Almost a week into the lockdown in Gurugram, the number of bodies reaching the city’s cremation grounds has gone down daily. “There is a sense of relief over the past three days. More than two dozen bodies reached Atul Kataria cremation ground till afternoon everyday during the peak, but today [Wednesday] only 10-12 bodies have arrived so far. Similarly, the Sector 22 cremation ground is almost full by noon, but only five families came for cremation so far. The Caterpuri ground has 10 platforms reserved for COVID-19 bodies and we have so far got only four bodies on Wednesday against 9-10 on a routine. In Chauma too only two bodies have come so far,” said Pandit Devdutt Sharma, who performs last rites at these four cremation sites. Mr. Sharma recalled that the situation was so grim till a few days back that there was not enough space for cremation. “For the first time in my life, I got calls from the Ministers recommending last rites. There was virtually no space and cremation went on till late at night. But the situation has thankfully improved over the past three days,” he claimed. Ambulance charges He, however, added that the families reaching the cremation ground were fleeced by ambulance owners. “A family reaching Atul Kataria cremation ground today with the body of a woman paid Rs. 8,000 to the ambulance for a distance of just five km. I have heard people are paying Rs. 35,000-Rs. 40,000 for ambulances for covering 5-10 km.” Ritu Raj, who, along with dozen friends, has been helping families to perform the last rites of their loved ones, claimed that they got 10-15 calls daily seeking help for ambulances or cremation. “There have been instances where the family was even not willing to offer shoulder to the bier of their loved ones, fearing infection. We helped them. I had to lit the pyre too in a few cases. Sometimes, the families can’t find an ambulance, and on a few occasions, the poor families don’t have enough financial resources to carry out the last rites. We take all necessary precautions while conducting last rites,” said Mr. Raj. He claimed that his team carried out a maximum of 27 cremations in a single day so far. The group, called “Hamara Bhaichara”, has people from diverse political ideologies and professions. “We have different political ideologies and different professions. Our group has IT professionals, financial advisers and even unemployed youth,” said Mr. Raj, State spokesperson of Shiv Sena. Chief Medical Officer, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Ashish Singla, said that the number of cremations had gone down by 30-40% over the past three days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gurugram-burial-grounds-see-dip-in-covid-bodies/article34494514.ece

06 May 2021||Mumbai,||Maratha quota: MVA govt. failed to present strong case, says BJP||The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday flayed the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for failing to fight hard for the community’s interests in the Supreme Court to get the Maratha quota law implemented in Maharashtra. Leader of Opposition (LoP) Devendra Fadnavis rued the sheer lack of coordination between the State government and the lawyers who were making the case for upholding the quota law. “The Supreme Court’s judgment is especially disheartening given that our previous government had successfully made the Maratha quota law stick in the Bombay High Court despite the reservation being challenged, and had strongly put forward our case before the Supreme Court where it was challenged again by a petitioner,” said Mr. Fadnavis. ‘Delay in filing review plea’ Mr. Fadnavis said the State government delayed inordinately in filing a review petition while a lack of coordination with their advocates led to several adjournments. “Furthermore, the Justice N.G. Gaikwad Commission report was not translated on time… as a result, the Supreme Court Bench was curious why no one had spoken against the report and its suggestions, causing them to regard the report as a one-sided document, biased in favour of the Maratha community. In reality, there were scores of objections and petitions against the Gaikwad Commission’s suggestions. But all of this had been resolved satisfactorily by the Commission. The State’s advocates failed to bring these facts before the Supreme Court,” he said. BJP leader Ashish Shelar said the State government must set aside its ‘ego’ and work in conjunction with the BJP to ensure benefits for the Maratha community within a particular legal framework. He urged the government to grant benefits to the community without compromising the quotas of other backward castes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maratha-quota-mva-govt-failed-to-present-strong-case-says-bjp/article34494708.ece
06 May 2021||Mumbai,||Verdict will impact poorer sections of Maratha community: VBA chief||While stating that the Supreme Court’s scrapping of the Maratha quota law would severely impact the poorer sections of the community, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar said that they were to “blame” for having failed to carve out a political identity for themselves. Mr. Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, said that while no OBCs (Other Backward Class) or SCs (Scheduled Castes) had ever been against poorer sections of the Maratha community, it had always been rich Marathas against their poorer brethren. “While it is unfortunate that the Maratha quota law has been repealed by the Supreme Court, which also rejected the Gaikwad Commission’s report, the poorer sections of the Maratha community are to blame for getting things to such a pass. They have not tried to create an independent identity for themselves and have kowtowed to the 10% of the rich and influential members of their community whether be they from the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party or the Bharatiya Janata Party,” he said. Mr. Ambedkar said that the apex court’s judgment had gone against poorer sections of the community while the richer members were not affected at all. Unless an economic “dividing line” was created between the wealthier, influential sections and the backward people within the Maratha community, the latter could neither prove nor claim reservation benefits, Mr. Ambedkar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/verdict-will-impact-poorer-sections-of-maratha-community-vba-chief/article34494714.ece
06 May 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay HC grants bail to 3 ex-directors of PMC Bank||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday granted bail to Mukti Bavisi, Trupti Suhas Bane, and Rajneet Tara Singh — three former directors of Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank — in the alleged Rs. 4,355-crore fraud case. A single judge Bench of Justice P.D. Naik allowed the application of the three on a cash bond of Rs. 1 lakh. The Bench, however, rejected the bail plea of Dr. Vishwanath Sridhar Prabhu, valuer of the bank. The court imposed bail conditions such as appearing at the Economic Offences Wing’s office for investigation, surrendering passports and not tampering with evidence. They had approached the court after the sessions court rejected their bail applications in May 2020. Ms. Bane was a member of the recovery committee from 2010-2015 and member of the loan committee since 2015. Ms. Bavisi, is the independent non-executive director since 2011 and member of the loan committee.

Datta Mane, an advocate, has filed the petition seeking a direction from the court to register an FIR against those threatening Mr. Poonawalla and provide security to him and family. The plea, which has relied on news reports, stated, “Mr. Poonawalla was getting aggressive calls from powerful people including chief ministers, business tycoons demanding instant supplies of Covishield which is among the two vaccines being used in the mass inoculation drive in India.” The petition also mentioned a quote from an interview of Mr. Poonawalla: “Threats is an understatement. The phone calls are the worst thing. The level of expectation and aggression is really unprecedented. It’s overwhelming. Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can’t understand why anyone should get it before them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-in-hc-seeks-z-security-for-adar-poonawalla/article34494713.ece

06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi reports 20,960 new virus cases and 311 deaths||Delhi reported 311 COVID-19-related deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths to 18,063, according to a health bulletin released by the State government on Wednesday. Also, 20,960 new cases were reported, taking the total cases to 12,53,902. Also, a total of 79,491 tests were done in a day, the bulletin said. Of the total cases, 11,43,980 people have recovered and there are 91,859 active cases at present. Out of the total 21,805 beds for COVID-19 treatment here, only 7.1% of beds were vacant at 8 p.m. Also, only 45 ICU beds were vacant. The positivity rate fell to 26.37% from 29.56% on Tuesday. This means that about 26 out of 100 people taking COVID-19 test are now testing positive. The positivity rate, which is the percentage of people testing positive out of the total tests done, has fallen below 30% after almost two weeks. There was a sharp rise in positivity from 3.5% on April 1 to 36.2% on April 22. But since then, it has stayed below it. Lower positivity is a good sign, as per experts. The Delhi government spokesperson said that the positivity rate is currently “under control” after a “timely” lockdown was imposed by Delhi government. The positivity rate should ideally be below 5%. The Delhi government did not release the daily bulletin on Tuesday, and it was released around 9 a.m. on Wednesday. The government did not give any reason for not releasing the same on Tuesday. It has happened at least twice in the past. As per Tuesday’s bulletin, Delhi reported 338 more COVID-19-related deaths and 19,953 new cases in 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-reports-20960-new-virus-cases-and-311-deaths/article34494527.ece
06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||JNUTA emphasises need for on-campus COVID care facility||The JNU Teachers’ Association on Wednesday reiterated its demand for setting up COVID care facilities on campus by converting the existing guest houses into isolation centres for residents that would include providing oxygen support. The teachers said that IIT-Delhi had set up such a facility and was producing its own oxygen. The teachers said the students who test positive on the JNU campus are taken to an isolation centre in Sultanpuri which does not have proper facilities. “JNUTA has received pictures sent by students of dirty toilets, open garbage cans, unchanged sheets and bedding that show how unhygienic and unsafe the facilities are. Starting yesterday [Tuesday], JNUTA has been providing packets of fruits and dry food to our students housed there. If only such isolation facilities had been constructed in JNU, in guest houses or makeshift arrangements in the stadium, not just students but other residents would have been spared the trouble of living in such unhygienic places outside the campus,” the teachers said. Disinterested V-C The teachers also alleged that the Vice-Chancellor has shown no interest in this. JNUTA had conveyed to the administration about an offer by an overseas university that wished to donate 10 oxygen concentrators to JNU. The JNU administration had stated that with the small health centre available in the university and with only a few doctors and part-time specialists meant for medical advice to normal people, the university is not equipped to handle COVID-19 related cases. Therefore, a COVID-19 Response Team (CRT) was mobilised to work round the clock in establishing contact with the hospitals for beds, doctors for medical advice on telephone or online, and arranging food for those who are in no position to prepare food at their houses. At hostels, the administration said a few rooms with dedicated washrooms were provided as quasi-isolation corners, where the students with mild symptoms are shifted until their COVID-19 testing is done. The administration had added that this system had been working well because the occupancy in the hostels is much less than it was in normal times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jnuta-emphasises-need-for-on-campus-covid-care-facility/article34494518.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||CM reviews vaccination drive at Rajendra Nagar||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday visited the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Rajendra Nagar to review the vaccination drive, following which he said that the youth were coming out in large numbers to get vaccinated. Mr. Kejriwal reiterated that if the vaccine was provided to it in sufficient quantities, the Delhi government could achieve its target of vaccinating the entire population of Delhi in three months. The process of vaccination, the Chief Minister said, had started successfully, but more supply of vaccine was the fundamental requirement right now. He said that the Delhi government was working hand-in-hand with the Central government on the issue of oxygen supply. He said he was hopeful that the situation related to oxygen supply would improve soon. “In Delhi, the vaccination drive has begun in both the private sector and in the government sector. Yesterday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Health Minister Satyendar Jain visited several government vaccination centres to review the drive. Today I am here to review the vaccination drive in private centres,” he said. “The process of vaccination has started successfully but I think that more supply of vaccine is the fundamental requirement right now. We have received a very less quantity of vaccines. Now the kind of infrastructure we have developed based on that we can ramp up the vaccination drive within 24 hours,” he also said. Talking about the oxygen situation in Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal said the availability of oxygen was the most important aspect related to the treatment of COVID patients, but Delhi was facing a scarcity of it. The Delhi government was working with the Centre to address the issue and battling the scarcity of oxygen on its own turf for the past several days to ensure that oxygen support was made available to every patient as soon as their oxygen level dipped. “We completely understand that the Central government is responsible for ensuring oxygen to the entire country. But our only hope is that the Central government will provide Delhi with its own quota of required oxygen,” he said. “We are continuously monitoring the situation related to the demand for oxygen. Yesterday, we received 43 SOS calls regarding oxygen. I know that there were some unfortunate incidents, but right now, we are working round-the-clock to ensure that no fatality in Delhi happens due to lack of oxygen,” he also said. The Chief Minister said his government would continue the lockdown based on the situation of the COVID-19 cases here and that at the moment, people were in favour of the lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. The Delhi government, he also said, was also working on increasing the number of oxygen beds across the Capital and arranging more and more oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders to run these.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-reviews-vaccination-drive-at-rajendra-nagar/article34494523.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Steady dip in funerals of COVID patients in Delhi’s crematoriums||The number of funerals of COVID-19 patients across Delhi’s crematoriums and burial grounds has been dipping consistently, especially compared to the peak in late April, when over 700 last rites were performed for three consecutive days. According to data recorded by the three municipal corporations of Delhi, 6,609 people, who lost their lives to COVID-19, were laid to rest at 29 funeral venues spread across the 11 municipal zones in the city between April 25 and May 4. More than 27 funerals were performed every hour over the ten-day period. The Delhi government, however, registered 3,854 COVID deaths during the same interval with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which runs the city’s civic bodies, accusing it of “hiding the real number” of deaths “as usual”. It also attributed the reduction in the number of last rites in Delhi to people passing away at medical establishments in the National Capital Region (NCR) after being “forced” to seek admission in them, given the paucity of hospital beds in the city. Civic body records show that 666 funerals were performed on April 25, compared to 553 on May 4, registering a decline of around 17%. The number of last rites gradually increased – 653 were performed on April 26 and 696 on April 27 – before the beginning of the peak on April 28, when 702 were performed followed by the peak of 717 on April 29 and slight decrease to 711 on April 30. The number of funerals has consistently decreased since then: slipping to 697 on May 1, 620 on May 2, 594 on May 3 and to 553 till 6 p.m. on May 4, according to civic body records. The capacity dedicated to the last rites of COVID patients was increased by over 43% during this time – from 773 to 1,113 – and it continues to be ramped up. “Hospitals across the NCR are full of seriously ill COVID patients from Delhi who have not been able to find hospital beds in the city and willing to spend any amount to save the life of their loved ones. They are referred to the closest funeral facility in those cities where the last rites are performed,” said a senior Delhi BJP leader. “We have come across innumerable cases of requests of help from Delhi’s people in getting the death certificates of their kin issued from the State governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The party will compile these numbers and make them public soon,” the leader also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/steady-dip-in-funerals-of-covid-patients-in-delhis-crematoriums/article34494524.ece
06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi gets 555 MT oxygen against demand of 976 MT||AAP MLA Radhav Chadha on Wednesday said that the Capital had been supplied 555 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen on Tuesday – the highest amount of oxygen received in the past 10-12 days – but it still fell short of the demand of 976 MT. On Monday, the Capital had received 433 MT. He alleged that the supply had not been done via regular sources, but on ad-hoc basis after the Delhi High Court came down strongly on the Centre for not supplying the required amount of oxygen. “It was a result of “ jugad ” done by the Centre. It was not supplied to us via our identified sources, but trucks, which were supposed to go to another State were diverted to the national capital. We really hope that we receive the oxygen with full certainty, and the plants which are designated to supply to us must do so on a regular basis,” Mr. Chadha said. Releasing the oxygen bulletin on the Delhi government, Mr. Chadha said that 48 SOS calls for oxygen were received on Tuesday and the government responded to all by providing 36.40 MT of oxygen from emergency reserves. “The total number of oxygen-support beds in these 48 hospitals, which made SOS appeals was 4,036. This means, 4,036 lives were saved by the Kejriwal government yesterday,” Mr. Chadha said. The Delhi government also updated its Delhi Corona app to show along with the availability of beds, the availability of oxygen at various hospital and COVID care centers across Delhi. Explaining the logistics behind the supply of oxygen, Mr. Chadha said that the county has 1,631 cryogenic tankers carrying 8,500 MT of oxygen in the country and demanded that the Central government designate Delhi 187 cryogenic tankers for 976 MT of oxygen demanded by Delhi. “There is no shortage of cryogenic tankers in India. The Central government should control and distribute cryogenic tankers the way it is controlling and distributing oxygen,” he said. He added that States like Delhi, which are not industrial ones, do not own cryogenic tankers and that the Central government must designate such tankers for use in Delhi and declare them as national assets. “These 1,631 tankers have been illegally captured and monopolised by all the other States of the country. There has been no proper and equitable distribution of these tankers to States. We believe that these tankers are national assets, the Centre should supply and facilitate oxygen cryogenic tankers the way it is doing with oxygen,” Mr. Chadha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-gets-555-mt-oxygen-against-demand-of-976-mt/article34494520.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. not taking steps to create oxygen buffer, streamline distribution, says HC||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it appears that the Delhi government has not taken steps for creation of a buffer of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) and for streamlining its distribution in the national capital. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said it is for the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) to explore the various possibilities to create storage facilities for LMO and oxygen cylinders in the city. The court said that the GNCTD may take help of the Delhi Technological University to prepare a blueprint for storage and distribution of oxygen in Delhi. It said the obligation to create an oxygen buffer fell on both the Centre and GNCTD as per the Supreme Court’s April 30 order. The observations and directions by the Bench came after one of the lawyers present in the hearing said that large static cryogenic tanks for storing LMO are available and can be installed in the city to create a buffer of the life saving gas. The lawyer, Aditya Prasad, said that smaller tankers can pick up oxygen from the larger tanks and distribute it in the city and in this way Delhi need not fall upon other states or Centre for tankers to transport oxygen. He said the tanks can be installed with the help of the Army. The court also noted that oxygen supplier INOX manufactures such static cryogenic tanks and there may be others and it was for the Delhi government to explore all the possibilities for creating storage facilities for oxygen. The Bench asked the Delhi government to identify the necessary areas where such tanks can be installed and to also create infrastructure for the purpose of distribution of both LMO and oxygen cylinders in the city. Mr. Prasad told the court that his research has identified several vendors providing oxygen storage tanks, oxygen generation plants and Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) plants and said that the Delhi government should also carry out research like he did and procure the necessary equipment to create the infrastructure for generation, transportation and storage of oxygen in the city. The court asked Mr. Prasad to share his research with the Delhi government and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao. It directed the Delhi government to examine the quotations obtained by Mr. Prasad and to also look for other vendors, who could meet the requirements, and asked them to file a report on the aspect by Friday. The court was hearing several pleas regarding the issues related to COVID-19 that Delhi is grappling with presently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-govt-not-taking-steps-to-create-oxygen-buffer-streamline-distribution-says-hc/article34494515.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that despite Delhi getting ample share of oxygen quota, many hospitals and COVID care centers are running out of oxygen supply as the Delhi government has failed to ensure proper and efficient distribution of oxygen tankers and cylinders. “According to Delhi government data, over 50,000 people are in home isolation, though sources admit that this number is far higher. While rich patients can afford to pay inflated hospital bills, the poor and the marginalised have been left to the mercy of the people,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-appeals-to-cm-to-set-up-oxygen-bank/article34494516.ece

BJP Rohtas Nagar MLA Jitendra Mahajan alleged that the Delhi government had been taking action against such establishments, badly inconveniencing patients in home isolation. “It is regrettable that the Kejriwal government is forcibly closing small gas agencies and free oxygen sewa counters which were a source of oxygen supply for patients in home isolation and small nursing homes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-protests-against-seizure-of-oxygen-cylinders/article34494521.ece

06 May 2021||San Francisco,||Facebook board upholds Trump ban||Former U.S. President Donald Trump won’t return to Facebook — at least not yet. The social network’s quasi-independent Oversight Board voted to uphold his ban from the platform after his account was suspended four months ago for inciting violence that led to the deadly January 6 Capitol riot. While upholding the suspension, the board faulted Facebook in a statement for the way it made the decision. The board said the ongoing risk of serious violence justified Facebook’s suspension at the time, but said it “was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an ‘indefinite’ suspension”. The board said Facebook was seeking to avoid its responsibilities by applying “a vague, standardless penalty” and then referring the case to the board to resolve. “Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international smell test,” oversight board co-chari Michael McConnell said in a conference call with reporters. “We are not cops, reigning over the realm of social media.” Content standards The board agreed with Facebook that that two of Mr. Trump’s January 6 posts “severely violated” the content standards of both Facebook and Instagram. “We love you. You’re very special,” he said to the rioters in the first post. In the second, he called them “great patriots” and told them to “remember this day forever” in the second. Those violated Facebook’s rules against praising or supporting people engaged in violence, the board said. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a former Danish Prime Minister who sits on the board, said in the call that Facebook shirked its responsibility to enforce its own rules. “Facebook should either permanently disable Mr. Trump’s account or propose a suspension for a specific period of time,” she said. The board says Facebook has six months to reexamine the “arbitrary penalty” it imposed on January 7 and decide on another penalty that reflects the “gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.” It didn't say exactly how Facebook should do this, but offered a number of recommendations. One advised against drawing a firm distinction between political leaders and other influential users because anyone with a big audience can potentially cause serious risks of harm. Ms. Thorning-Schmidt said considerations of newsworthiness should “never” take priority over the risk of harm. The board also says Facebook should publicly explain the rules that it uses to sanction influential users, and emphasized the need for time-bound suspensions and clear rules on how they can be lifted. The board says the new penalty must be “clear, necessary and proportionate” and consistent with Facebook’s rules for severe violations. The board says if Facebook decides to restore Trump’s accounts, the company must be able to promptly address further violations. No response A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The board, which has 20 members and will eventually grow to 40, did not reveal how it voted. It said a minority of members emphasised that Facebook should require users who seek reinstatement after being suspended to “recognise their wrongdoing and commit to observing the rules in the future.” Mr. Trump has also been permanently banned from Twitter. After years of handling Mr. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram took the drastic step of silencing his accounts in January. In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing Mr. Trump to continue using the platform was too great.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/facebook-board-upholds-trump-ban/article34494385.ece
06 May 2021||Washington,||‘U.S. to send vaccines to other countries by July 4’||U.S. President Joe Biden said countries that receive U.S. vaccines will receive them by July 4 — India and Brazil are likely on this list. His comments were made during remarks he delivered on Tuesday afternoon, updating the public on his administration’s vaccination programme and achievements. The U.S., which entered into an agreement with Canada and Mexico in March to share 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, said last week that another 10 million doses would become available in the coming weeks, followed by a further 50 million by the end of June. India expects to receive the largest share of the 60 million doses, Reuters had reported last week. “We are helping India significantly. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. What he needs most is he needs the material and the parts to be able to have his machines that can make the vaccine, work. We are sending that, sending oxygen.” “We’re sending a lot of the precursors. So we are doing a lot for India,” Mr. Biden said in response to a question on what criteria were being used to decide which countries (India, Brazil were specifically cited in the question) got the vaccine. Six shipments “With regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine …we have sent that vaccine to Canada and to Mexico and to other countries we are talking to now,” Mr. Biden said, adding he had spoken to a head of state on Tuesday and was not prepared to announce which other countries would be getting the vaccine. “We are going to, by the fourth of July, have sent about 10% of what we have to other nations, including some of the ones you mentioned.” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said five of six shipments of assistance had already reached India and that “more flights are on the way,” with a total of over $100 million in assistance, including rapid tests, oxygen cylinders and concentrators and masks. “We’ve also sent 2.5 million N-95 masks and we have an additional 12.5 million N-95 masks available, should that request come from the Indian government,” Ms. Psaki said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-send-vaccines-to-other-countries-by-july-4/article34494386.ece
06 May 2021||Washington,||Biden undecided on COVID-related TRIPS waiver||U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he had not made a decision on whether the U.S. would support an Indian and South African initiative at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to facilitate the production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics around the world. “Well, we’re going to decide that as we go along, I haven’t made that decision yet,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday afternoon at the White House, after he delivered remarks on the U.S.’s vaccination campaign. His administration would move as quickly as possible to get as many doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines to export to the rest of the world, Mr. Biden said. The U.S. government has already ordered 100 million additional doses of these vaccines through July 31. A group of nine Democratic Senators and Bernie Sanders (an independent) had called on Mr. Biden last month to support a temporary IP waiver. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai had discussed the issue with the U.S. heads of vaccine makers Pfizer and AstraZeneca last week. On Tuesday, however, a group of 12 Republican lawmakers wrote a seven-page letter to Ms. Tai asking her not to support the IP waiver initiative, calling it “extraordinarily broad and unnecessary” to giving the maximum number of people possible access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and that it would undermine the “record-breaking rapid innovation” of vaccines. “The justification for the waiver rests on an incorrect assumption that IP rights are a significant bottleneck to the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.” The letter says COVID-19 treatment access can be expanded globally without weakening IP, and weakeniing IP would hamper American innovation and technology. “This danger is particularly acute considering that many of the crucial technological advances made by American businesses and institutions in the fight against COVID-19 were made on the backs of billions of dollars of investment by American companies as well as billions more in American taxpayer money,” the letter says. The letter cites logistical challenges like lack of cold storage and syringes as well as regulatory hurdles in developing countries as bottlenecks to access.

06 May 2021||TORONTO,||Canada authorises Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents||Canada’s health regulator has authorised Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 and older. Dr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada, on Wednesday confirmed the decision for the ages to 12 to 15 and said it will help children return to a normal life. The vaccine was previously authorised for anyone 16 or older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also expected to authorise Pfizer’s vaccine for young by next week, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year. The announcement comes barely a month after the company found that its vaccine, which is already authorised for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group. Pfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15 showing there were no cases of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/canada-authorises-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-for-adolescents/article34494378.ece
06 May 2021||SAN FRANCISCO,||Man held for stabbing 2 Asian-American women||Police arrested a man who they said is suspected of stabbing two Asian-American women without warning on Tuesday afternoon in San Francisco’s Mid-Market neighbourhood. Officers sent to the scene shortly before 5 p.m. found the wounded women, who were taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on the condition of the women, who were 65 and 85. Witnesses told KPIX-TV that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women and then walked away. A 54-year-old San Francisco man was arrested on suspicion of committing the attack several hours later, police told the station. Police didn’t immediately indicate whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime. Asian-Americans have been the targets of unprovoked attacks in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the nation in recent months. California prosecutors have filed assault and hate crime charges against a man accused of an attack last week in which he allegedly yelled racial slurs before knocking down Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. In separate San Francisco attacks in March, an 83-year-old Vietnamese man was knocked down and broke his neck in the fall, and a 77-year-old woman was similarly attacked. Police arrested a man on charges of assault and elder abuse in both cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/man-held-for-stabbing-2-asian-american-women/article34494377.ece

Assadollah Assadi, 49, was convicted in February by an Antwerp court for supplying explosives for the planned June 30, 2018 attack on the exiled Opposition group the National Council of Resistance in Iran (NCRI). “I confirmed today that Mr. Assadi does not wish to appeal,” his lawyer, Dimitri de Beco, told AFP , adding that his client contested the right of the Belgian justice system to judge him and put him behind bars. A spokesman for Belgium’s federal prosecutor’s office confirmed that “Mr. Assadi’s lawyer has failed to lodge an appeal” to the conviction. Three individuals sentenced to between 15 and 18 years in prison as accomplices are maintaining their appeals against their convictions, he said. Iran has strongly protested Mr. Assadi’s conviction. Days after the February verdict, Iran’s foreign ministry summoned Belgium’s ambassador in Tehran to convey its fury. On Wednesday, the Iranian embassy in Belgium issued a statement calling Assadi’s conviction “a stark contravention of customary international law and established diplomatic practices”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-diplomat-gets-20-year-sentence-for-bomb-plot/article34494382.ece

The country has been in turmoil since the military deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering a mass uprising of daily protests and a nationwide boycott from civil servants. So far, nearly 770 people have been killed in deadly crackdowns, according to a local monitoring group — though the junta has a far lower death toll which it blames on “rioters”. A group of ousted lawmakers who call themselves the “National Unity Government” (NUG) and are working underground to oppose the junta announced their own “people’s defence force” to “stop the use of violence against people”.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The limits to polarisation in Bengal||There is no denying that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has massively increased its vote and seat share in West Bengal compared to the 2016 Assembly election, and this has largely been on the back of a strong Hindu consolidation behind it (50%), as per the Lokniti-CSDS’s post-poll survey. But the party failed to retain the level of Hindu support (57%, or nearly three-fifths) it had secured in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, thus ending up faring way below its own expectations and its performance in the last general election. The Trinamool Congress was a direct beneficiary of this erosion of votes, with the party registering an increase in Hindu support from 32% in 2019 to 39% this time. This seven-percentage-point shift from the BJP to the Trinamool happened despite the former running a high-pitched Hindutva campaign that was aimed at exciting Hindus through Jai Shri Ram slogans, talk of illegal migration, allegations of ‘Muslim appeasement’ against the ruling party, and anti-Muslim dog whistles, such as raising the spectre of West Bengal becoming a ‘mini-Pakistan’ and calling Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ‘ begum’ and ‘ khala’ . The post-poll survey conducted by Lokniti-CSDS and data from our study after the 2019 Lok Sabha election together point to the story of limited Hindu consolidation. This has also to do with the way the Hindu mind in West Bengal seems to be working at the moment. In our 2019 survey, we asked respondents in West Bengal (and the rest of the country) a set of questions to gauge their views on secularism, the temple-mosque dispute and minority rights. Surprisingly, despite political polarisation, full-fledged communalisation had not occurred in the State, as it was found that many Hindus, including those who voted for the BJP, gave highly secular and pluralistic answers to most of these questions, and far more so than their counterparts in other regions of the country. For instance, on a question on the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, only one in every five Hindus in Bengal had said that demolition was justified, as opposed to two-fifths in the rest of the country. Similarly, a huge majority of Hindus in Bengal (81%) held that India is a country of all religions, and not just Hindus. The same figure among Hindus in the rest of the country was 74%. On the issue of protecting minority rights, 38% of Hindus in West Bengal agreed with the proposition that even if it is not liked by the majority community, the government must protect the interests of minorities. This sentiment, in fact, strengthened further to 58% this time, when we repeated this question in our survey. What these responses indicate is that even as average Bengali Hindus may have supported the BJP in large numbers in 2019, the reasons for doing so were different and not necessarily an endorsement of the BJP’s Hindutva agenda. This perhaps explains why the BJP’s support among Hindu voters declined this time instead of increasing. Heavily polarising rhetoric by the BJP in the recent election may well have alienated the liberal tolerant section of the Bengali Hindus from the BJP, particularly the traditional Left voters, who had shown interest in the party in 2019. It also seems to have had the effect of scaring Muslims who consolidated in even larger proportions (75%) behind the Trinamool Congress than they had in 2019. The Trinamool, thus, ended up benefiting both ways. The story, of course, has another side. There is some traction to the idea that the government accorded undue favours to minorities. While a majority of the Hindus in the rest of the country had no problem with it, in West Bengal, the support for the idea was lukewarm, with many being ambivalent on the issue. In fact, in the 2021 survey, most Hindus, even the ones who ended up voting for the Trinamool Congress, agreed with the proposition that the party had given undue favours to Muslims during its tenure, an issue that the BJP had raised. It is nonetheless interesting that many of them continued to vote for the Trinamool despite holding this view. None of this is to say that there was no polarisation on religious lines in this election. But the divide was mostly restricted to seats where the Muslim population was higher in proportion. It is also important to note that the Hindu share in the Trinamool’s votes was 57% this time and the Muslim share was 42%; in 2019, it had been 50% for each. In sum, the BJP, which prides itself on knowing the Hindu mind, may have failed spectacularly in deciphering the Bengali Hindu psyche. It has been unable to transform the majority community into a minority-hating monolith. Moreover, the majority community was also divided on the basis of caste, class, gender and other social identities, and the Hindutva campaign clearly fell short in catering to everyday concerns around development and livelihood. In the cultural rubric of Bengal’s politics, there was limited room for uni-dimensional religious polarisation, a fact that the BJP took very lightly.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||New dawn in Dravidian politics||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has emerged victorious in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, a win that falls short of earlier projections of a landslide but one that can be considered a resounding vindication of its high-voltage Dravidian-values campaign. What do the tumultuous events of the past few months, culminating in the election results, mean for the State and its politics? There are two broad issues to consider: first, what the DMK’s victory at the hustings means for governance in Tamil Nadu, a State that has prided itself for delivering at a high level on human development and mass welfare policies; and second, what the change of leadership wrought by this election tells us about recent tectonic shifts in Dravidian politics and its prognosis. Quality of leadership In handing a clear mandate for governance to the DMK, led by its President M.K. Stalin, the Tamil Nadu electorate has expressed its well-known preference for strong leadership. Leadership in this context extends beyond a single person, and rather connotes a leadership system. A leadership system includes not only external-facing attributes of the leader in question, such as their personal charisma and broad popularity in the eyes of supporters, but also social networks and power relationships within the party that bind the leader to the cadre, help maintain discipline, negotiate agreements between party bosses, plan resource allocation for policies, and propagate the values of the party or movement. In these attributes, Mr. Stalin comes out ahead of outgoing Chief Minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) Joint Coordinator, Edappadi K. Palaniswami. Mr. Stalin’s late father, five-time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and Dravidian movement stalwart M. Karunanidhi, ensured that the DMK had an orderly succession planning process leading to Mr. Stalin inheriting the mantle of the party leadership after Karunanidhi’s passing. Even more, Karunanidhi’s clarity of message ensured that the party heavyweights neatly aligned themselves behind the anointed successor, seeing off all challenges including from Mr. Stalin’s estranged older brother M.K. Alagiri. The coalescence of political power within the DMK around a central vector has important consequences for governance. First, the absence of intra-party conflict will lead to smoother agenda setting and resource allocation to meet policy needs. Second, it is likely to lend strength to the party’s ideological chassis. The AIADMK contrarily suffered the consequences of Jayalalithaa degrading multiple rungs of leadership beneath her, likely a strategy to consolidate her position as the perpetual head of the party. Consequently, it was not surprising to witness the factional infighting that characterised the early years of the outgoing government. Indeed, it is likely that despite surmounting these internal wobbles and providing several years of stable governance, Mr. Palaniswami faced a setback in the election owing to a lack of confidence of the electorate in his ability to hold his flock together over the longer term and resist pressure to enter into an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and its brand of Hindutva. Mass welfare or rent-seeking? Looking beyond leadership to the broad question of agenda setting that it implies, there is a deeper imperative for effective policy implementation in this State — the invisible hand of competitive populism. Ever since the dawn of “benevolent populism” under former Chief Minister and AIADMK supremo M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), an irresistible commitment to policy competition in the realm of mass welfare schemes has become deeply entrenched in the ethos of successive Tamil Nadu governments. Yet, there is little doubt that in this regard, strong leadership cuts two ways, and the history of governance in Tamil Nadu supplies the starkest illustration of this. In parallel to the redistribution of resources to lower castes and classes for the best part of half a century, the highest rungs of leadership built up an unassailable machine for illicit resource extraction for private gain. This institutionalised system of extortion and loot obscenely enriched the leadership and provided a reliable bonanza to party loyalists and external contractors lining up for kickbacks. While supporters of the DMK may thus rejoice at having put into power a leader they believe will deliver on party manifesto promises, there may be many in Tamil Nadu who wonder whether Mr. Stalin and his colleagues will break with this ignoble past and forge a new path toward accountable and transparent governance. Inflection point This brings us to the second broad question that bears consideration in the aftermath of the 2021 State Assembly election — whether the rare window of opportunity for fundamental change that opened up after the passing of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, to reimagine the long-term vision for Tamil Nadu, can be capitalised upon. The absence from the landscape of these two politically centralising leaders offered two new possibilities: first, of party organisations based on more democratic decision-making processes and focused on delivering good governance; and second, of Dravidianism transmuting into a new ethos to answer the challenge of homogenising ideologies such as Hindutva. In the case of the DMK, decisions on allocation of party posts, election tickets, alliance formulas and resource allocation have over the decades become narrowly focused on the family of Karunanidhi. While “Kalaignar” himself came from a more everyman ethos and was, as a major leader of his party, integrated deeply into the values of Dravidianist mobilisation, the rise to prominence of his progeny and broader family including the Maran clan, led to a centralisation of control of all party matters in the hands of a few individuals. Now that the party is back in power, will Mr. Stalin be able to restrain the “first family” of the DMK from self-defeating overreach? The AIADMK occupies the opposite end of the spectrum in this regard — it has historically been ruled by autocratic leaders such as MGR and Jayalalithaa, yet, under Mr. Palaniswami, it appeared to pivot to a relatively more diffused balance of power internally. Indeed, Mr. Palaniswami had no choice but to focus on delivering good governance as he lacked the political heft to hold on to the top job in the State by any other means. The vital question for Tamil Nadu now is whether his approach created sufficient competitive pressure to keep the DMK on the straight and narrow and not once again get enmeshed in allegations of land-grabbing or other actions associated with kleptocracy. Reinventing an ideology On the subject of political ideology, Dravidianism has already gone through a dramatic transformation over decades from the early days of “assertive populism” under Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, C.N. Annadurai and Karunanidhi — a phase during which anti-Brahminism, anti-Hindi and anti-North Indian politics were the locus of mass mobilisation. Today, it is far more accommodationist in its leaning and eschews caste antagonisms in favour of pressing claims of state autonomy toward realising the goal of Tamil exceptionalism within a variegated Indian cultural milieu. Many assumed that the growing footprint of Hindutva politics across the nation would be the greatest challenge to the hegemonic influence of Dravidianism. Indeed, the BJP has re-entered the State Assembly this time after being absent there for 20 years. Yet, if there is one lesson from the 2021 State Assembly election, it is that the imperviousness of Tamil Nadu to Hindutva speaks less to the aversion of its people to religious politics than it does to the fact that, for a majority of them, the sheer adaptability of the Dravidian ethos makes it a more comfortable, less alien vehicle to transport them to a promising future. In that sense, it would be reasonable to expect Dravidian ideology to continue its transformational journey over the coming five years under DMK rule to further shed whatever remains of its anti-religiosity edge and thereby win over even more caste Hindus to its fold. Simultaneously, if Mr. Stalin is astute enough to recognise what his mandate to govern truly encompasses — the people’s hope that he will keep the State on the path of broad-based economic growth, sustained industrial development, and a continued commitment to pro-poor policies — he will expeditiously ring-fence the economy from predatory rent-seeking behaviour by political elites. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/new-dawn-in-dravidian-politics/article34494367.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||A CT scan for COVID merits a word of caution||There are broadly three reasons why we perform tests in clinical medicine: diagnosis (what is the disease?), etiognosis (what caused a disease?), and prognosis (how will the disease evolve?). It is also important that the outcome of a test should guide treatment in some way, especially when it is being touted as being a monitoring test that provides unique information that cannot be obtained by easier means. Considering how widespread the use of computerised tomography (CT) scans of the thorax during the novel coronavirus pandemic has been, one would assume that the test would satisfy one, if not all the above criteria, for an accurate diagnostic test. Data from studies The Cochrane (previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration) pooled together all the available data from studies conducted over the last year (https://bit.ly/33ftvVt) to try and test the accuracy of CT scans in diagnosing COVID-19. It included 41 studies with a total of 16,133 participants. It was found that a CT scan accurately diagnosed COVID-19 in about 88% of individuals with a positive RT-PCR. Since an RT-PCR itself misses 30% of people who have COVID-19, a chest CT is likely to diagnose only 62% of all individuals having COVID-19, making it a relatively inaccurate test for diagnosis. In these difficult times in obtaining RT-PCRs due to overworked laboratory services, the use of a CT chest as a surrogate needs to come with a caveat: a normal CT chest does not exclude COVID-19, and, therefore, should not be a reason to come out of isolation, especially when the CT is done very early in the disease. Mislabelling the cause An accurate test for etiognosis would be one in which a result would make the cause almost certain. The same Cochrane review mentioned above found that when radiologists convincingly labelled a CT pattern as being consistent with COVID-19 disease, they mislabelled 20% of those who did not have the disease as having COVID-19, getting the etiognosis wrong in a significant proportion of individuals. Telling someone who does not have COVID-19 that they do have the disease has serious implications, leaving the real diagnosis undetected, and subjecting the individual to the psychosocial consequences of the knowledge that she/he has the disease. The third reason that is often cited as being a reason to do a CT is for prognostication: a CT that appears worse is likely to lead to worse outcomes than a CT that appears better. Two comments need to be made in this context: the severity of lung involvement as seen on a CT is reflective of the status of the lungs at that point of time, and we know that this is a dynamic process, i.e., a limited involvement at an early stage could progress with time to a severe involvement; and a CT scan revealing severely affected lungs while oxygen levels remain high and unchanged is an extremely improbable event, suggesting that a CT is unlikely to give a treating physician more information than a simple tool such as an oximeter. It needs to be mentioned that in research settings, certain patterns of lung involvement (and not the mere quantum as reported by a score) have been associated with worse outcomes (https://bit.ly/3xInyi5), but unfortunately, these have not been widely validated, and are not the reason why CT scans are presently being performed. The risks “What is the harm in getting a CT of the chest done?” is another argument one hears often. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 (https://bit.ly/3eSuIru) postulated that “0.4% of all cancers in the United States may be attributable to the radiation from CT studies”, and further speculated that the current estimate could be in the range of 1.5%-2%. This potential harm would have been clearly acceptable had this been a highly accurate and useful test. In addition to this risk to the individual undergoing the scan, there are risks to radiology technicians, staff and doctors that need to be accounted for. Moreover, considering the fact that CT scanners need to be kept in closed air-conditioned spaces, the risk of transmission of the virus at such centres cannot be ruled out. As a physician treating COVID-19 disease over the past year, I have ordered CT scans for less than 1% of the patients whom I have treated. I have ordered them to evaluate the possibility of other lung diseases when two RT-PCR swabs were negative in patients whose symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 disease, in patients in whom there was a possibility of blood clots in the lungs when hospitalised, and to look for secondary infections in individuals who have been in hospital for a long time and can sometimes have new infections after being admitted for COVID-19. Intensivists have on occasion used CT scans to optimise ventilator strategies for individuals with severe COVID-19 disease. Indications outside of these should be the exception, not the norm. Raise queries So, if a physician asks that a CT scan be done, ask her/him a few questions. If it is being done for diagnosis, why not do an RT-PCR instead (or two RT-PCRs), considering the higher accuracy of the test? If it is being done despite COVID-19 being proven, ask whether a minimal involvement on the scan guarantees an uneventful clinical course, or whether a more than minimal involvement (when the oxygen levels are high, and the patient seems to be getting better) is a sign of impending deterioration. Ask whether treatment strategies have been proven to work better when guided by chest CTs (rather than clinical findings such as oxygen levels). If the answer to none of these satisfies you, consider the potential risks involved in getting that CT done, and feel free to make an informed decision.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Subaltern Hindutva on the wane?||The phrase ‘subaltern Hindutva’ was bandied about quite a lot in academic and journalistic circles during the recently concluded West Bengal Assembly election. Many journalists and scholars covering stories from the field had a common account, that a large section of rural poor, backward classes, Dalits and Adivasis had firmly shifted towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the influence of the Hindutva ideology, and that the Trinamool Congress, which owed its rise to the backward classes in 2011, had become extremely unpopular among them. Some described the movement of these subaltern classes towards the BJP as cultural and political solidarity among Hindus and also a reflection of the dominance of ‘anti-Bhadralok’ (anti-upper caste/class) sentiments in rural areas that the Trinamool Congress had once benefited from. The post-poll survey data, however, suggest that both the subaltern and bhadralok shift that had taken place towards the BJP on a massive scale in the 2019 Lok Sabha election waned this time and the Trinamool Congress managed to retain much of its lost support among these sections. Data show that the decline in support for the BJP compared to the Lok Sabha election was the steepest among OBC communities (Yadavs, Kurmis, Kumhars, Lohars, Telis, etc., taken together), falling from over two-thirds (68%) to just half (49%) this time around. Like OBC voters, Adivasi voters, too, were far less enthused by the BJP, and their support fell drastically from 62% to 46%. Most of them made their way back to the Trinamool, which also explains why the ruling party regained lost ground in some of the State’s tribal areas and Scheduled Tribes-reserved seats. Erosion of Dalit support Among Dalit communities, too, on whom the BJP invested considerable time and energy this time, the party was simply unable to retain the huge level of support it had garnered two years ago, and much of this was due to the erosion of the Rajbanshi support. The BJP’s vote share among Rajbanshis declined from three-fourths in 2019 to three-fifths this time. This is counter-intuitive since the BJP did well in north Bengal, but the survey data suggest that it was more on account of support from groups other than Rajbanshis and other communities. The only segment of Dalits that the BJP was able to hold on to were the Namashudras (including Matua refugees), but among them, too, the party managed to make only meagre progress, and even that was limited to certain regions. In fact, for the BJP to have had any chance at defeating the Trinamool Congress, it needed to build on its 2019 base among Dalits as a whole. Far from it, it ended up losing some of them. Finally, as far as the upper castes (Brahmins, Kayasthas, Baidyas, etc.) are concerned, the story for the BJP was no different. Among them, too, the party registered some losses instead of making any gains, falling from 50% in 2019 to 46% this time. However, this modest loss of upper-caste support should not be misinterpreted as a loss of upper-class support for the BJP. Our data do not find them to be synonymous. The BJP actually led the Trinamool Congress by a good 13 and 14 percentage points among upper-class and middle-class Hindus, respectively. It faced some tough competition among the backward classes and the poorest Hindus — the party’s vote share among the poorest Hindus registered a massive 17-percentage-point decline compared to 2019.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Women rally behind Trinamool||Of the various factors that contributed to the Trinamool Congress’s victory in the Assembly election, the support of women voters for Mamata Banerjee is significant. And this is not new for this election — even in polls held during the last decade, women have always come out in support of Mamata Banerjee. Not only have women voters managed to bridge the turnout deficit vis-à-vis men, but their voting preferences have also been different. For the fourth straight election in the State (counting both Assembly and Lok Sabha elections), women voted for the Trinamool in higher proportions than men. According to the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey, the gender gap this time was to the tune of four percentage points, slightly lower than in the past, but still significantly large. While 46% of men voted for the Trinamool Congress, two points lower than the party’s average vote share, among women voters, support for the Trinamool Congress touched 50%. This higher-than-average voting for the Trinamool among women also meant that the ruling party got a far bigger advantage over its principal opponent, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), among women than men. For men, the Trinamool Congress was ahead of the BJP by six percentage points, and among women, the Trinamool’s lead over the BJP was twice as high at a massive 13 percentage points. Women voters seem to have been instrumental in driving up the Trinamool Congress’s seat numbers. A somewhat similar trend was witnessed in the 2016 Assembly election, when the Left Front-Congress alliance had trailed behind the Trinamool Congress by just two percentage points among men voters but by 12 percentage points among women. The question that arises is, what has attracted women voters towards Mamata Banerjee election after election? It seems that many welfare schemes specifically targeted at women, like Kanyashree, Rupashree or bicycles for girl students, that the Mamata Banerjee-government launched during its tenure, may well have enhanced her popularity among women voters. Further, the fact that Ms. Banerjee has given greater representation to women in her party and government could also be making her more popular amongst women. This election saw the Trinamool Congress giving tickets to as many as 50 women, five more than the 2016 election. A number of schemes Another possible explanation for the Trinamool doing exceedingly well among women voters this time could be the party’s election manifesto promise that it would provide a minimum monthly income to the woman head of every family — Rs. 500 for those from the general category and Rs. 1,000 for those from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and OBC families. The Trinamool’s vote share among Dalit women was five percentage points more than it was among Dalit men, seven points more among upper-caste women, and 13 points more among Adivasi women. Another category of women that particularly stood out in its support for the Trinamool this time was that of elderly women aged 45 years and above. Over half of them voted for the Trinamool and only some, about a third, opted for the BJP. Women from the poorest backgrounds also emerged as Trinamool’s strong supporters.

In a decision that will be quite unpalatable to mainstream parties, the Court has not only found no merit in the Maratha claim to backwardness but also said the community is adequately represented in public services. It is no surprise that the Maratha quota, given by Maharashtra through a 2018 law, did not survive judicial scrutiny by a Constitution Bench. The 16% quota in admissions to educational institutions and jobs in public services — later brought down to 12% in admissions and 13% in jobs through a 2019 amendment — took the total reservation in the State beyond the 50% ceiling imposed by earlier verdicts. The five-Judge Bench has held that the State has not shown any exceptional circumstance to justify exceeding the limit. The Bombay High Court had upheld the validity of the Maratha reservation in principle, but ruled that the law could not have fixed the percentage above what was recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission headed by M.G. Gaikwad. The Court has now set aside this ruling, rejecting the HC’s reasoning that the denial of backward class status to the Marathas had pushed them deeper into social and educational backwardness, and that this constituted a special circumstance in support of their claim to separate reservation. The second limb of the judgment, however, may cause political concern. The Court’s categorical refusal to reconsider the 50% limit set down by a verdict in Indra Sawhney (1992) may threaten the continuance of different kinds of reservation in States. The Court’s interpretation of the 102nd Constitution Amendment, by which a National Commission for Backward Classes was created, has proved right fears that the national body’s role and power may impact the rights of States. The Court has ruled that, henceforth, there will only be a single list of socially and educationally backward classes with respect to each State and Union Territory notified by the President of India, and that States can only make recommendations for inclusion or exclusion, with any subsequent change to be made only by Parliament. Several MPs had argued that the Amendment would denude the States of their power, but the Centre had assured them that it was not so. The Court has now ruled that Parliament’s intent was to create a scheme to identify SEBCs in the same manner as SCs and STs. The President alone, to the exclusion of all other authorities, is now empowered to identify SEBCs. A clamour for yet another constitutional amendment to undo the effect of this verdict may be in the offing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/against-excess/article34494361.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Sudden death||The Indian Premier League’s suspension effective from Tuesday was an inevitable full stop considering India’s continuing trauma with COVID-19 and the breach of the tournament’s much-vaunted bio-bubble. Until the emergence of the COVID-positive results of Kolkata Knight Riders’ Sandeep Warrier and Varun Chakravarthy; Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Wriddhiman Saha; Delhi Capitals’ Amit Mishra, Chennai Super Kings’ bowling coach L. Balaji and a member of the squad’s logistics staff, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was in denial-mode, firmly believing that its bio-bubble protocols cannot be breached. BCCI officials also insisted that the league is not a super-spreader like election rallies or other permitted activities where crowds were allowed to assemble. That both fans and the media were kept away from the venues was cited as an example of how strict the IPL management was with regard to social-distancing. Besides this, the constant testing of everyone in the bubble was seen as another fail-safe method to ensure that the league did not turn into a coronavirus hotspot. But before the final denouement, what jarred was the tone-deafness of having matches in Delhi while beyond the ground, the accompanying note was that of ambulances blaring their sirens while patients gasped for oxygen. Even if the league has its share of a massive television audience and offers a diversion to the viewers, having Delhi as a host was extremely insensitive. The IPL’s 14th edition is at the crossroads, a reality which it had avoided since its launch in 2008. The cash-rich league always found a way to sidestep obstacles. During three general elections, the championship either fully or partially leant on neutral venues. There was also the incident of low intensity blasts just outside Bengaluru’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on April 17, 2010, ahead of a match featuring Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians. It is an event that has faded from public memory but on that ominous day, two bombs went off, injuring a few and a third was found, which was immediately defused. The contest started an hour late and the IPL continued unhindered. But the latest crisis due to a pandemic is something that humankind has never faced since the Spanish Flu in 1918. Meanwhile, the board officials are hinting about resuming the league later this year in the United Arab Emirates, which also hosted the 13th leg. But for that the virus should wane and most countries have suspended flights from India, with the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison not even permitting a chartered flight with the IPL’s Aussie players. To find a window in a packed international cricket schedule will be arduous even if the last word on the IPL’s tenuous resumption is yet to be spoken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sudden-death/article34494362.ece
06 May 2021||Mumbai,||Small businesses, MSMEs to get relief||The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday announced measures to protect small and medium businesses and individual borrowers from the adverse impact of the intense second wave of COVID-19 buffeting the country. In an unscheduled address, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unveiled a Resolution Framework 2.0 for COVID-related stressed assets of individuals, small businesses and MSMEs and also expressed the central bank’s resolve to do everything at its command to ‘save human lives and restore livelihoods through all means possible’. Eligibility criteria Considering that the resurgence of the pandemic had made these categories of borrowers most vulnerable, the RBI said those with aggregate exposure of up to Rs. 25 crore, who had not availed restructuring under any of the earlier restructuring frameworks (including under last year’s resolution framework), and whose loans were classified as ‘standard’ as on March 31, 2021, were eligible for restructuring under the proposed framework. In respect of individual borrowers and small businesses who had already availed restructuring under Resolution Framework 1.0, lenders have been permitted to use this window to modify such plans to the extent of increasing the period of moratorium and/or extending the residual tenor up to a total of two years. In respect of small businesses and MSMEs restructured earlier, lending institutions have been permitted as a one-time measure, to review the working capital sanctioned limits, based on a reassessment of the working capital cycle and margins. Credit support To provide further support to small business units, micro and small industries, and other unorganised sector entities adversely affected during the current wave of the pandemic, the RBI decided to conduct special three-year long-term repo operations (SLTRO) of Rs. 10,000 crore at the repo rate for Small Finance Banks. The SFBs would be able to deploy these funds for fresh lending of up to Rs. 10 lakh per borrower. This facility would be available till October 31. In view of the fresh challenges brought on by the pandemic and to address the emergent liquidity position of smaller MFIs, SFBs are now being permitted to reckon fresh lending to smaller MFIs (with asset size of up to Rs. 500 crore) for onlending to individual borrowers as priority sector lending. This facility will be available up to March 31, 2022. State governments To enable the State governments to better manage their fiscal situation in terms of their cash flows and market borrowings, maximum number of days of overdraft (OD) in a quarter is being increased from 36 to 50 days and the number of consecutive days of OD from 14 to 21 days, the RBI said. Separately, Mr, Das asserted that though the impact of the second wave was ‘debilitating’, it was ‘not insurmountable’. “We do not expect any broad deviations in our projections,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/small-businesses-msmes-to-get-relief/article34494345.ece

06 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘Investment in warehousing slides 44%’||Institutional investment in Indian warehousing fell 44% to $868 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the long-term outlook remains attractive on rising demand from e-commerce players, according to U.S.-based property consultant Vestian. In its report ‘Institutional Investment in Warehousing: Renewing Prospects’, Vestian said the warehousing sector had garnered institutional investment of $6.2 billion in the last five years (2016-2020). “With the economic slowdown and COVID-19 crisis taking precedence, 2020 saw a substantial decline in warehousing investment, to the tune of 44%, over the previous year,” Vestian said in the report. Investments in the segment almost dried up, particularly during the first half of 2020, as investors turned cautious due to the pandemic, it added. The warehousing sector attracted $868 million during the 2020 calendar year compared with $125 million in 2016, the data showed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/investment-in-warehousing-slides-44/article34494354.ece
06 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Roche gets emergency-use authorisation for COVID drug||Roche India on Wednesday said it has received emergency-use authorisation (EUA) from the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation for antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) indicated for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The EUA will enable Roche to import the globally-manufactured product to India, where it has a partnership with Cipla to market and distribute the same. The approval was based on the data filed for the EUA in the U.S and the scientific opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the European Union. Roche said the antibody cocktail is to be administered for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and paediatric patients (12 years of age or older, weighing at least 40 kg) who are confirmed infected with SARS-CoV2 and at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. “Neutralising antibody cocktails like Casirivimab and Imdevimab can play a role in the fight against COVID-19,” said V. Simpson Emmanuel, Managing Director of Roche Pharma India. “This outpatient treatment will be complementary to the ongoing vaccination drive and support our fight against the pandemic in India,” he added. The drug will be available through leading hospitals and COVID treatment centres. Casirivimab and Imdevimab is approved at a combined dose of 1,200 mg (600 mg of each drug) administered by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous route. It has to be stored at a temperature ranging from 2 °C to 8 °C.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/roche-gets-emergency-use-authorisation-for-covid-drug/article34494360.ece
06 May 2021||COIMBATORE,||Textile exports fell 13% in FY21 on COVID-19 impact||Textile and apparel exports in 2020-2021 are almost 13% less (in dollar terms) than the previous year, provisional data available with the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council shows. The exports were worth $29 billion last year as against $34 billion in 2019-2020. Exports of ready-made garments declined 20.78% last financial year compared with the previous year, while exports of man-made textile items fell 21.20 %. Siddhartha Rajagopal, the executive director of the council, said exports of cotton textiles had declined 2.12%. This was mainly because of the COVID spread and its impact on exports last April and May. However, all textile and clothing segments, including carpet, jute, apparel, and MMF products, showed significant growth in March this year and this trend is said to have continued in April too, Mr. Rajagopal said. The final data, expected later this month, may be better even for overall textile exports in 2020-2021. Textile and clothing exports are expected to do well at least till June since countries such as the U.S. and U.K. are looking up and China has also started buying. “We expect this year to be better than last year,” he added.

The central government and LIC together own more than 94% equity of IDBI Bank. LIC, currently the promoter of IDBI Bank with management control, has a 49.2% stake. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the strategic sale of IDBI Bank, the government said in a statement on Wednesday. The extent of respective shareholding to be divested by the central government and LIC shall be decided at the time of structuring of transaction in consultation with the RBI, it said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget 2021-22 had announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) as part of a disinvestment drive to garner Rs. 1.75 lakh crore. The Centre expects the strategic buyer will infuse funds and new technology for development of the bank’s business potential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cabinet-clears-idbi-bank-strategic-disinvestment/article34494350.ece

The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 54 in April from 54.6 in March, the slowest rise in output in 3 months. In PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while that below 50 marks contraction. “PMI results for April showed a more resilient economic performance for the service sector than expected,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. She noted that firms foresee higher output volumes over the course of the year, but business sentiment was dampened by worries surrounding the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/services-activity-eased-to-three-month-low-in-april/article34494356.ece

06 May 2021||Manchester,||Manchester City strolls to its first CL final||Manchester City reached the Champions League final for the first time in the club’s history as Riyad Mahrez’s double saw off Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 on Tuesday to seal a 4-1 aggregate win. Mahrez’s goal also decided the first leg and the Algerian, who grew up in the Parisian suburbs, haunted his home town team again with two clinical finishes early in each half. The final in Istanbul on May 29 is the culmination of City’s rise since an Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008. Meanwhile, four years on from making Neymar and Kylian Mbappe the world’s two most expensive players, PSG’s wait for a first Champions League title goes on. Implosion Mbappe could only watch on from the stands due to a calf injury as, just like in last week’s first leg, his side imploded after an excellent first-half performance. The visitors were left to rue huge missed chances by Marquinhos and Angel Di Maria in between Mahrez’s strikes before Di Maria lashed out at Fernandinho to leave PSG down to 10 men for the final 20 minutes. City had to withstand a barrage from PSG before the break. The French champion thought it had had an early penalty to get back in the tie when Oleksandr Zinchenko was penalised for handball. However, Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers rightly reversed his initial decision on seeing a replay of the ball bouncing off the shoulder. Neymar only ever showed flashes of his brilliance with City’s impressive defence led by Ruben Dias able to focus on stopping the Brazilian without Mbappe to worry about.  The result: Semifinal, second leg: Manchester City 2 (Mahrez 11, 63) bt PSG 0. City wins 4-1 on aggregate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manchester-city-strolls-to-its-first-cl-final/article34494549.ece
06 May 2021||MUMBAI,||Finding a new window is the toughest challenge||While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is ensuring a safe return of all the participants in the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) edition due to COVID-19 inroads into the biosecure bubbles, the fans are wondering whether the suspension will lead to abandonment. Despite stakes riding high on the IPL, finding an opportune window is going to be the toughest challenge for the BCCI to ensure the remaining 31 games of the IPL are played later this year. Only options The only available options for the BCCI are to organise the IPL before or after the T20 World Cup in October-November. If the T20 World Cup and IPL both are scheduled in the United Arab Emirates, the BCCI can save on quarantine time in multiple countries. However, it is highly unlikely that other boards will make players available just before a global event at the cost of preparing as a group. It would leave the BCCI to explore the option of playing the IPL just after the T20 World Cup. At the moment, India is scheduled to host New Zealand for two Tests (as part of World Test Championship) and three T20Is in November-December before departing for South Africa for three Tests (WTC) and three T20Is. If the BCCI convinces New Zealand and South Africa boards of doing away with the T20I series, it can create a three-week window immediately after the IPL. However, with England and Australia players set to be involved in the Ashes Down Under, they will be unavailable in November-December. “In that case, the sole option available is to play a fresh tournament by allowing teams to rejig squads and letting teams play each other only once before the knockouts,” says an IPL insider. He points out that a round-robin format, followed by semifinals and the final, would mean exactly 31 matches — the ones that have had to be suspended — can be played and the broadcaster and sponsors’ commitments can be respected. Big question The big question then would be whether the franchises will agree to play without Australians and English players. In 2020, when a similar possibility was informally discussed during lockdown, half the teams had shot down the proposal. While it would help recover most of the BCCI revenue that’s at stake, it may end up being an operational nightmare with regard to rejigging squads without an auction only for a three-week window. “It is way too early to discuss such a possibility. Let’s first ensure everyone reaches home safely and then we can start taking a stock about all these things,” says a franchise executive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/finding-a-new-window-is-the-toughest-challenge/article34494468.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Eight Englishmen arrive in London||The Englishmen were the first ones out with eight of them landing in London, while the Australians awaited an escape to Maldives as IPL’s foreign recruits charted their way back home, assisted by the BCCI on Wednesday. Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran, Tom Curran, Sam Billings, Chris Woakes, Moeen Ali and Jason Roy landed in London to begin a 10-day quarantine before heading to their respective homes. England skipper Eoin Morgan, Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan are expected to board a flight to London within the next 48 hours. “I can confirm that eight of the 11 England players in India managed to get on a flight to Heathrow last night and have landed this morning,” an England and wales Cricket Board spokesperson said. “They will now quarantine in government approved hotels. The remaining three — Jordan, Malan, Morgan — should leave India within the next 48 hours,” he added. IPL also featured cricketers from Australia (14), South Africa (11) and New Zealand (10) West Indians (9), Afghanistan (3) and Bangladesh (2). The Australians were still waiting to know when they can fly out to Maldives, where they will stay for a few days before flying home. The detour has been forced by the Australian government’s travel ban on India till May 15 because of the explosion of COVID-19 cases here. The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has refused to consider an exemption and Cricket Australia has also ruled out seeking one from the government. “All Australians are assembling in Delhi and from there they will head to Maldives by a charter flight,” a franchise official said. CA’s interim chief Nick Hockley said the BCCI is helping in every possible way to ensure a smooth return for the 14 players, members of the coaching staff and commentators, who are in India right now. “What the BCCI is working to do is to move the entire cohort out of India where they will wait until it’s possible to return to Australia,” Hockley told reporters in Sydney. “The BCCI has been working on a range of options. That’s now narrowed down to the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The BCCI is committed not only to the first move but also to putting on a charter to bring them back to Australia,” he added. Kiwis to stay till May 10 Meanwhile, New Zealand cricketers, including captain Kane Williamson, are likely to remain in India at least till May 10 before flying to England for national duty, their players’ union chief said. The remaining players as well as the support staff in various IPL teams and commentators could return home by charter flights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/eight-englishmen-arrive-in-london/article34494464.ece

Spectators were encouraged to stay off the streets and not watch the race in person. Security officials held signs on the roads that read: ”Please refrain from watching the event from here.” The smattering of competitors from abroad were largely restricted to their hotel rooms while not competing or training. Coe said strict protocols measures against COVID-19 were followed. Coe said “today Sapporo demonstrated the highest level of capability to organise successful” marathon and race walk events. Those events are being held outside of Tokyo because of the city’s hot summers. Coe will be on hand on Sunday when Tokyo organisers hold another test event at the new $1.4 billion National Stadium in Tokyo. Organisers have held a series of test events in the last several days and have reported few problems. The largest problem is convincing the Japanese population that the Olympics, with 11,000 athletes and thousands of others, should take place in the middle of a pandemic. “You can understand the concern,” Coe told a news conference. He tried to reassure by saying that one-fifth of the athletes in the Olympics represent track and field — and that World Athletics can meet the challenge. “Everybody, the athletes particularly, will hope for spectators,” Coe said. “But I think they recognise that if that’s not possible then the Games will still take place and the competition will still be extremely good.” He said athletes had become used to competing at stadiums where there aren’t any crowds. “The challenges are big. I don’t believe any Olympic Games has been delivered under more difficult circumstances,” Coe said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/coes-nod-for-olympic-test-event/article34494546.ece

There are two national campers in the women’s section — Pushpa and Gulabsha Ali — and one in the men’s category — Nathan Abraham — from Telangana. “This is a welcome development as it will mean players can train without the fear of any financial burden in case they are hit by an injury or other serious issue. “The exact details are not yet known. “Since Sports Authority of India has suspended the camps till May-end, all those who will be in the camps thereafter will be covered under the new insurance policy.” FIBA Asia Cups The FIBA Technical Delegate added that the FIBA Asia Cup for women will be held in Indonesia in July and the men’s tournament in Bengaluru in September. “Given the importance of these two events for which preparatory camps will be held depending on the situation, the BFI’s move is a wonderful gesture. Since basketball is a contact sport and the players are bound to mingle with each other and thereby exposed to some risks, there is a need to have such an insurance cover,” Norman said. The TBA secretary also revealed that the Masters selections to be held this weekend to name the State teams for the Master Nationals this July, have also been postponed.

Mary Kom (51kg) will join Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), who is already at the facility. Simranjit Kaur (60kg) will train there too but after completing the COVID-19 post-recovery isolation. The boxers will be placed in three separate groups with two sparring partners each to ensure that the risk of infection is minimal. However, Pooja Rani (75kg), who has qualified for the Games too, will continue to train at Bellary’s Inspire Institute of Sports, which is her current base. Mary Kom will not have immediate company of her coach and former boxer Chhote Lal Yadav, who continues to be in isolation after testing positive last month. “I am leaving today, looking forward to it. Chhote will come in a while so it will be fine. I hope to get vaccinated also during my time there,” Mary Kom said. “The training was thrown haywire after the suspension of Delhi camp but, hopefully, it will now get back on track. I might even train with the men boxers who are there at ASI. I routinely train like that to be in good shape,” she said. The next big assignment for them is the Asian Championship, which had to be shifted from Delhi to Dubai because of the COVID-19 surge here. The tournament is scheduled to start on May 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mary-kom-to-train-in-pune/article34494540.ece
06 May 2021||MADRID,||Barty overcomes a fighting Kvitova to make the semifinals||World No.1 Ashleigh Barty, chasing her fourth singles title of the year, will take on Paula Badosa in the semifinals of the Madrid Open after getting past two-time winner Petra Kvitova 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 on Wednesday. Wild card Badosa became the first Spanish woman in the tournament’s 12-year history to make the last four with her 6-4, 7-5 win over eighth seed Belinda Bencic.

Nadal will next take on Alexei Popyrin after the Australian knocked out rising star Jannik Sinner 7-6 (5), 6-2. Second seed Daniil Medvedev, returning to the circuit afer testing positive for COVID-19 in mid-April, picked up his first win on clay for two years when he came back from a set down to beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.

06 May 2021||LONDON,||Romain Grosjean to return with one-off Mercedes test||Romain Grosjean, who suffered a terrifying crash in November 2020, will be back at the wheel of a Formula One car for a test with Mercedes at the end of June in France, the team said on Wednesday. “I am so excited to jump back in an F1 car! It will be a special opportunity for me and to drive a World Championship-winning Mercedes will be a unique experience,” said the 35-year-old Frenchman on the Mercedes website. Grosjean’s Haas car broke in two and burst into flames after it crashed into a barrier at 220km/h on the first lap at the Bahrain GP. He escaped the fireball with burns to his hands, a sprained left ankle and bruising. Immediately after the crash, Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal said he would not let the accident mark the end of Grosjean’s Formula One career. “The idea first came when it looked like Romain would be ending his active career in Formula One, and we didn’t want his accident to be his last moment in an F1 car,” Wolff said on Wednesday, adding that he had known Grosjean since the driver’s start in Formula 3. Drive Hamilton’s car Grosjean will drive a 2019 Mercedes, the W10 model in which Lewis Hamilton won the World championship, on June 27 in “demonstration laps” ahead of the French Grand Prix at the Paul Ricard Circuit and then on June 29 in private testing on the same track.  Grosjean has already said he is switching to Indycar in the United States, “A last ride in front of my home crowd at the gpfrancef1 in a f1 car, what could be better?” he tweeted on Wednesday. In ten seasons in Formula One, including the last five with the American team Haas, Grosjean has not won a Grand Prix. “I’m looking forward to seeing him in France and welcoming him to the team for the weekend, although he better watch out for my 2019 W10,” said seven-time champion Hamilton.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/romain-grosjean-to-return-with-one-off-mercedes-test/article34494478.ece
06 May 2021||New Delhi,||Cleaner used to do ‘pitch-siding’ in IPL game: BCCI ACU chief||The recently suspended IPL witnessed potential corruptors plugging an accredited cleaner at Delhi’s Feroz Shah Kotla ground for doing “pitch-siding” which helps ball-to-ball betting, BCCI Anti-Corruption Unit chief Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala has revealed. The new modus operandi was observed during one of the IPL games at New Delhi where a designated cleaner was using the time lag between actual match action and live TV coverage to help in ball-by ball betting, which is also known as court-siding or pitch siding. Pitch-siding is the practice of transmitting information from sporting events for the purpose of gambling, or directly placing bets. “One of my ACU officers caught a person and handed over the details to Delhi Police. While that particular offender managed to flee leaving behind his two mobile phones, ACU lodged a complaint with the Delhi Police,” Hussain, a former DG of Gujarat Police, said on Wednesday. “We are thankful to Delhi Police that in a separate incident they caught two other persons from the Kotla on ACU tip-off.” The Delhi Police arrested two people with fake accreditation cards during the IPL match between RR and SRH on May 2. “So on two separate days, these people managed to get access to Kotla. The one who fled came in the garb of a cleaner. However, we have all his details as he was employed for the tournament. His Aadhar Card details have been handed over to Delhi Police,” Hussain said. “I am confident that he will be nabbed in a day or two. He is a small fry working for a couple of hundred or some thousand bucks may be,” the ACU supremo said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cleaner-used-to-do-pitch-siding-in-ipl-game-bcci-acu-chief/article34494474.ece
06 May 2021||Chennai,||TNPL may be postponed||The Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), scheduled from June 4 to July 4, is all set to be postponed due to the alarming rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) secretary R.S. Ramasaamy said to The Hindu on Wednesday, “It will be very difficult to hold the tournament in this period considering the current situation. We may well have to postpone it till things improve.” In fact, the TNCA was to have conducted TNPL’s Player Draft on Tuesday, May 4, but chose not to hold it considering the scenario. Ramasaamy said, “We were slated to hold the Player Draft at M.A. Chidambaram Stadium’s Sriraman Hall on Tuesday,. But then, we would have had to accommodate around 60 people including the franchise owners and TNCA officials in a hall for a fairly long time and that involved a Covid risk to all.” Four venues had been chosen for this year’s TNPL. Ramasaamy revealed, “We also have a plan `B.’ Conduct the tournament in just two cities Salem and Coimbatore where the distance between the two grounds is only two hours by road. For the first 16 games all the teams will stay in one city and for the next 16, camp in another city.” However, all plans have been put in the backburner for now. The TNCA secretary said, “There has been a change in the State Government too. We will have to have talks with the new Government and get fresh permission.” The TNPL could not be held last season because of the Covid pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tnpl-may-be-postponed/article34494533.ece
06 May 2021||SOFIA,||Grappler Amit Dhankar eyes a Tokyo berth||Handed an opportunity to qualify for Tokyo, veteran wrestler Amit Dhankar will go all out when he takes the mat along with 11 other Indians at the World Olympic Qualifiers, starting on Thursday. The 32-year-old Dhankar is a three-time Commonwealth champion but he missed the big-ticket events because he struggled to go past Yogeshwar Dutt in 66kg category for most of his career. His last big performance was a silver in 74kg at the 2019 Asian Championship in Xian, China. Dhankar’s hopes to make the cut for the Tokyo Games were dashed when he lost the trials but since National champion Sandeep Singh Mann came a cropper at the Asian Qualifiers in Almaty, the national federation gave him a chance to compete in Sofia. Last chance Dhankar had finished second in the trials. It is the last chance for all the wrestlers in the world to qualify for the Games. Dhankar will be desperate to make the most of the chance but his journey will be hard as the 74kg is packed with 36 wrestlers, including Rio Olympics bronze medallist Soner Demirtas from Turkey, World champion Hetik Cabolov of Serbia and Slovakia’s European champion Tajmuraz Salkazanov.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/grappler-amit-dhankar-eyes-a-tokyo-berth/article34494717.ece

Quoting Australian police, the country’s media reported that four men were detained in connection with the alleged kidnapping following a raid. The incident took place on April 14 when he was bundled into a car and driven to a remote location, after which he was assaulted and threatened with a firearm. “I know it was only an hour that he was held but it would have been a horribly frightful hour to endure,” NSW Police superintendent Anthony Holton was quoted as saying by the local media. The police said the kidnapping was financially motivated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/macgill-kidnapped-and-then-released/article34494476.ece

Cummins, a key part of the Kolkata Knight Riders team, said previous edition held in UAE was incredibly “well-run” and the organisers pushed it “little step further” by organising it at home this year. “ I’m sure looking back they might have tweaked a few things.” Cummins, however, didn’t specify what exactly could have been done differently.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-few-things-could-have-been-tweaked-cummins/article34494473.ece

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Handhold a monstera through lockdown||“Over the last couple of weeks people have been speculating about an impending lockdown. And that has brought even more plant enthusiasts here,” says K Subramaniam, the owner of KS Garden in Panaiyur. “They want to stock up on a variety of flowers and foliage to cheer them up as they stay indoors.” In addition, this rising bevy of first time gardeners are also buying compost, coco peat and pots so they can nurture plants and see something positive take shape in a world that is unnervingly unpredictable right now. With this sudden influx of clients, Subramaniam says he had to round up his troops to manage the crowd on weekends. “Normally I have three to four sales assistants but on weekends I need at least 10 of them,” he says. With the fresh lockdown restrictions starting today, he is now allowed only 50% of his staff and the nursery is permitted to be open till noon. While he expects the shorter working hours to impact business, he adds that on the whole he has seen a rise in clients over the past year. Before COVID-19, he says he would get an average of seven clients a day. This rose to 20 visitors per day on weekdays, and 50 on each day of the weekend till last month. Many were young first time plant buyers, who replaced their mall visit with the relative safety of the wide, open spaces the nurseries offer. Before the second wave, he was also getting road trippers on driving vacations from other cities. “It is easy for my clients to maintain physical distancing in a large, open area such as my nursery. They have enough space to spread out and admire the variety on display,” Subramaniam says, adding that he gets his staff tested as an additional safety measure. The 10,000 square feet green space houses nearly one lakh variety of plants — including grass, home garden, vegetables, potted plants — that Subramaniam procures from Pune, Rajahmundry, Bengaluru, Cuddalore, Puducherry, and Thiruvananthapuram. He gets stock once a week and says that incoming stock for succulents, table top and hanging varieties has gone up by 50%-60% given the demand. “I think with clients not having to go to office they are using that time to nurture plants,” he smiles. “I am hoping that the interest doesn’t fade in the future,” he adds. For a less empty home A number of nurseries and horticultural farms mushroomed along the ECR over the last few years. But with many more people taking to gardening to counter the tense monotony of lockdowns, smaller ones have been launching despite the economic slowdown. While the pandemic shut several small enterprises and made a dent on the balance sheets of the big ones, it kept many plant nurseries not just open, but thriving. Visakhapatnam-based CMR Nursery Garden was bracing for the “Great Recession” all over again when its seasonal business saw a steep decline in March-May last year. However, that did not last long. “By June, our business roared back with a 40% increase in sales as compared to pre-COVID-19 times,” says Mavuri Venkata Ramana, founder and managing director of CMR Group. The nursery that has around 800 varieties of plants along 16 acres received on an average 200 daily footfalls till last month. Now with the State going under restrictions again, and shortened opening hours (6 am to noon), a lull lies ahead. However, judging by the rush of Instagram and Facebook advertisements for online plant nurseries, buyers are as enthusiastic about shopping online. Ahmedabad-based myBageecha saw their sales grow during the July to September period — a time when most people were working from home. Saumitra Kabra, co-founder of myBageecha, says has been receiving a lot of orders from tier-2 cities lately ; this was not the case earlier. Pune-based NurseryLive too saw their sales double in the last year, with their vegetable seeds pack especially in huge demand. “We’re seeing a definite spike in seeds that’s continuing to rise this year,” says Satender Kumar, co-founder of NurseryLive. The bulk of the sales came from the June-October period when business sprung back with 70,000 orders in a month. “Now it has stabilised to 50,000 orders in a month, which is still higher than the 35,000 we did pre-COVID,” adds Satender. With the supply-chain networks still affected in many parts of the country due to the pandemic, NurseryLive plans to join hands with more local partners in cities across India to bridge the gap between plant growers and buyers. With nurseries observing a surge in first-time gardeners — primarily young working professionals and families with young kids — they are helping clients with personalised guidance, online or over the phone. “We launched a work-from-home plant pack which has a mix of five species that are low maintenance and perfect for low-light conditions. These include syngonium variegated, areca palm and peace lily,” says Satender. No wonder, most new buyers ask for them, concurs Saumitra, who likes to refer to these varieties as indoor “beginner” plants as they require minimum effort and attention. He also adds sansevieria, Pothos, Aglaonema, and Hoyas to list of the “It” plants. For Deepa K, a resident of Egmore, her joy every morning is to look at the plants on her balcony, along with her grandchildren. She started out with easy to handle plants and on the behest of the grand kids is now mulling over procuring a few ornamental varieties. “The kids and I feel a sense of achievement every morning when we see flowers blooming or new leaves opening up. There is this joy because we have created this, it’s alive, growing, blooming and brightening up our space. It is a positive, productive, de-stressing hobby,” she says, adding that “sometimes even if we do not get to see people, seeing these flowers can make our surrounding feel less empty.”  name||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/handhold-a-monstera-through-lockdown/article34494990.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||When the going got tough, so did they||Mallik Thatipalli,content writer  The only driving forces that kept me strong were my mother, wife and sister. Every day as I felt weak and fatigued, I’d tell myself, I have to be strong for them and fight it out. I wasn’t in a frame of mind to read a new book, so I started re-reading  the Harry Potter series, followed by Ayn Rand and the Inheritance series. I also re-watchedTheLord Of The Ringsand The Hobbit . All this even though I knew that Sauron and Voldemort would be defeated, I just wanted to go back to those familiar scenes. The other most important thing my family did was to be on video most of the time; it was our way of being connected. Since my wife and I both tested positive, it was my mother who kept a watch on us. She would keep the video on in the kitchen while she worked, so that was like our window to the world outside.    Sai Ram,marketing professional  As I work with a hospital, I was busy even while I was admitted there after testing positive. I was constantly on the phone, replying to various queries on beds, vaccine and medication. When I was not able to talk, I was messaging. Being on a hospital bed and battling the virus made me understand the plight of the people seeking help and I couldn’t turn my back. This also helped me feel stronger and diverted my attention.    Sajan Pookkodan,communication professional  After testing positive, I assured myself that I will be fine. I reminded myself of having the privilege of a safety net in the form of supportive friends even though I was away from my family. Staying connected with my wife and daughter through video calls kept me happy. We also made a pact that as a family we would be honest with each other about our feelings and well being. My friends kept me engaged with jokes and chats, jumping in to help with whatever I needed. A strong support system is very important to keep you in the right frame of mind.    Vanaja C,journalist  I spent many days in three different ICUs. Right now, I am home and recovering, but with limited limb function. While in the hospital my friends advised me to practise Vipasana , they sent me chants, verses from theGita, and suggested meditative music. I tried them all and honestly, I found them depressing. Instead, I found my mojo in popular Telugu film songs; their upbeat music made me feel alive — I wanted to break into a dance even in my bed. I insisted on doing some basic exercise. Calming music and meditation didn’t work for me. Everybody is different, so one should be allowed to listen and watch whatever gives them joy.    Dharma Kanta Sharma,retired teacher  I am 81 years old and am not a big fan of music, but I do have a transistor by my bedside right now just to listen to the political discussions. News is depressing. But since I like reading, I finished Ashwin Sanghi’s Chanakya’s Chant . That book was gripping and made me forget my lethargy. I read Sanghi’s The Rozabal Line too. I also call my daughters and friends to check on their well-being and also use the opportunity slyly to ask them if I sound feeble.    Bakiya Sri,analyst  When my mother, brother and I tested positive we preferred home quarantine. We stayed in our respective rooms and decided to stay away from news bulletins. We also spoke to each other from our rooms instead of communicating through phone. I sailed through my isolation days with Vadivelu memes and jokes. Seven days after we were allowed to mingle with each other, we played a lot of board games. As a household that survived COVID-19, my request to others is, be kind to those who are sick. That really lifts up their spirits. I am actively talking to my friends who have the virus now. I want to keep them motivated and do whatever cheers them up.    Shilpa Nainani,emcee  Cal Newports’s book Deep Work was my companion at night when I couldn’t sleep. During the day when I was not coughing, I was on call with my parents and niece. My husband and I both tested positive, so I had company in isolation. I am also part of an NLP group FULL FORM that shared motivational speeches and conducted virtual community meetings. It gave me the push to get dressed, do my hair and wear my earrings, so I could feel like myself again. By the 12th day, I got onto social media to see how I could be of help to others.    Venugopal N,journalist  When I was hospitalised, I kept myself focussed and positive to recover for my wife. COVID-19 hit her severely and I was only focussing on her recovery. For a week, we couldn’t see each other even though we were in the same hospital. That was very frustrating. To distract myself, I read Bahula by A Appala Naidu, a 500-page socio-historical fiction based in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-the-going-got-tough-so-did-they/article34495002.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Parking lights on||CS Ananth has wound up his antique-cars restoration business. The pandemic with its zillion disruptions did not force this decision. He explains he is 77 and “with my past major health problems along with some present health issues, there was no option but to say goodbye”. With a 1949 MG TC leaving the workshop on May 1, 2021, Ananth’s career statistics stand frozen at “75 car restorations in 14 years”, an oeuvre that reserves for him a notable place among restorers from South India. Antique car restoration marked a second career for Ananth, which sneaked up on him as most second careers do. In the early 2000s, elements of an enviable post-retirement life were in dazzling array for him. Retirement from UCAL as a top executive, followed by a move to an expansive beachside home in Neelankarai. Memberships with clubs offering golf and tennis being capped off with a new hobby. So, there it was — Ananth decided he would be at the coal-face of restorations involving a handful of antique cars he had bought for his family’s delectation. “It began around 2007 when seeing my restored cars — Morris Eight Tourer, Austin Burnham and Essex — A Sivasailam (the late industrialist from the Amalgamations Group) wanted me to work on his 1947 Riley,” recalls Ananth, admitting to an initial hesitation as “engagements of this kind do not particularly contribute to post-retirement comforts”. Ananth continues: “Sivasailam would offer me three more of his cars — Dodge Kingsway, Morris Eight and Morris Minor — for restoration. Around the same time, Steve Borgia (from INDeco Leisure Hotels) and N Sankar (from The Sanmar Group) entrusted me with the restoration of their Plymouth and Triumph 7 respectively. I had formed Team CSA with the workshop and office being established in the spacious backyard of my home. I realised that the restorations should be done as a company and not a hobby. If it were a hobby, I would not have the commitment; nor would the workers.” When an avocation turns into a vocation, adverse factors that have not been accounted for can have a rare sting to them. Ananth has had his share of pet peeves from those early days, which he learnt to take in his stride. “Once a stack of hickory wood I imported for making wooden spokes was stuck at the Customs. The official assumed it was contraband, and would not accept my explanation. Irritated, I told him I take wood for food on doctor’s prescription. When he was offended at my snarkiness, I said when a genuine reason was being rejected, what else could I do?” The fledgling initiative had a scare in 2009, when Ananth “fell sick from complications of cancer”. Following treatment, he quickly eased back into the routine. Upskilling was a defining feature of his run as a professional restorer. “When I went to Germany on a holiday around eight years ago, I spent two days at Kienle Automobiltechnik, which specialises in Mercedes-Benz restorations, to learn about rust-proofing. They taught me everything, and when I came back and started looking for materials, none of the ones they suggested was available in India. Finally, Dupont had a minimum volume of rust-preventive coating paint of that order to sell, and I was one of the very few restorers at that time to be able to buy it,” says Ananth. Recognitions for Ananth include awards for cars restored by him at a couple of editions of the 21 Gun Salute Vintage Car Rally; a judging role once at the same event; an ongoing stint as adviser to GD Naidu Car Museum, Coimbatore; the role of adviser, registrations with Federation International des Vehicules Anciens (FIVA) in 2016; and a chief judge’s role at two international rallies, in Malaysia and Singapore.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s easier for a camel...||Roshan’s even toes sink into the sand, dodging scree as he plods along the expansive plains towards Mand, a small town in southern Balochistan bordering Iran. The camel passes sights that belong to a medieval play — small houses, their doorways covered in hessian sacks, pepper the hillside; lone trees stand scattered; and the only colour in the dun landscape is from intricately painted Bedford trucks on the highway and the children dressed in bright salwar kameezes racing to meet him. Roshan’s saddle panniers hang low with books that bring both cheer and a peek into the world outside to these children living in Pakistan’s most impoverished province, which has low literacy rates and has been battling insurgency for over 20 years. COVID-19 is the latest deterrent but that has not stopped the cud-chewing Roshan from making weekly visits to villages carrying English, Urdu and Balochi books for children aged three to 15, as part of the Camel Library Project. When the pandemic closed schools, Zubaida Jalal, a federal minister and Rahima Jalal, a school head-mistress, thought of using camels to distribute books in this desolate terrain with little Internet access. The sisters reached out to the Alif Laila Book Bus Society (ALBBS) and Female Education Trust, two NGOs working for female literacy. Judith’s Reading Room was the first donor and the project was launched in October 2020 across Mand, Gwadar and Tharpakar, Sindh. Murad Ali, Roshan’s herder, had him togged out in colourful buntings and brought him around to help. Basarat Kazim, president of ALBBS that donated the books for the project and an author of children’s books, speaks on the Society’s journey, and giving children a sense of the ‘normal’ in these difficult times. Excerpts from an email interview: How did ALBBS begin?  It was started in 1978 by Dr Juanita Baker, an American living in Pakistan at the time. Till then, there were no children’s libraries in the country, and this stationary double-decker bus won everyone’s hearts. It is symbolic of the children’s library movement in Pakistan. The outreach is through libraries and mobile libraries in schools, distribution of 100-book box libraries to celebrate IBBY’s [International Board on Books for Young People] work in Pakistan and bus, rickshaw, camel and bike libraries. How do you ensure that children from disadvantaged sections understand the books they are reading? Are there guides? The project caters to children from all sections of society with a mission to create understanding. Our funds are however concentrated on the financially disadvantaged. We have developed a reading assessment sheet and facilitators are available to support the children. Imagination and problem solving skills need to be enhanced. Only then will education in our part of the world be worthy of children. Where do you source books from?  We buy books from publishers in Pakistan, who also donate periodically. Hoopoe Books and Big Bad Boo have been magnanimous donors. Book drives in schools and children donating books they have read is a common feature. Given the sub-continental culture, do more girls drop out from the reading habit, especially in rural areas?  If they read less it’s only because they don’t have the opportunity. Within our projects we notice a great leaning of girls to read and excel. Tell us about your rickshaw and camel projects  Rickshaw libraries are very exciting. These colourful three-wheelers can reach children and schools in narrow alleys. Running them is cost effective too. Camels are such gracious, eco-friendly animals. Through the Camel Library Project, we wanted children to value them for the fantastic service they provide. The ALBBS remains responsible for designing the library and supplementary material that goes with it like puppets, games and Tech Bag. We also give each camel a name. Chirag and Raunaq are the other camels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-easier-for-a-camel/article34495011.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Help arrives on a bicycle||Divi K wanted to take some home-cooked food for her elderly aunt, who was unwell, on May 1 in Bengaluru. She stays in Halasuru which is about 20 kilometres from her aunt’s house in Yelahanka. Due to the lockdown in Karnataka, she was unable to drive there herself. She could not find a delivery service either. That is when she came across a helpline number for Relief Riders, a group of cyclists who are volunteering to deliver medicines and other essentials, including food, to vulnerable people in the city. Within minutes of dialling the number, a volunteer — Kunal Bohra, a second-year BCom student — reached her doorstep. The food was delivered within an hour. Relief Riders is headed by Bengaluru’s ‘bicycle mayor’ Sathya Sankaran, who is a part of BYCS, a Dutch social enterprise that heads a worldwide network of international cycle mayors. Along with the Bengaluru cycling community, he formed Relief Riders during the first wave of the pandemic. With the city in the midst of a two-week lockdown, the cyclists returned to volunteer again. Now, more cities have joined the programme. The programme kicked off in Chennai from May 3. Felix John, Chennai’s bicycle mayor, says, “We are aware the situation is much worse than last year. Hence, it’s probably riskier for us to move around. But the people in need of essentials and medicines have also grown which is why we decided to volunteer.” In Bengaluru, the team serves from 6 am to 10 am (on other times as well, in case of emergencies) every day. Once a person in need contacts a helpline number, the request is shared on a WhatsApp group. Then, whoever is available to help, takes it up. Volunteers have made about 90 deliveries so far. They also check on people with physical and mental disabilities. The Bengaluru team has tied up with the elders helpline (1090) as well. “There are about 190 volunteers in Bangalore and 29 in Hubli-Dharwad,” says Sathya. Five more cities — Mumbai, Chennai, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Belagavi — have joined the programme. The Hyderabad edition of Relief Riders, which started on May 1, has done about 10 deliveries so far. “I think the number of requests we get will increase as the helpline numbers are just beginning to reach more people,” says Santhana Selvan, Hyderabad’s bicycle mayor. In Gurugram, Vineet Chopra and his local cycling group, the Rock Riders, formed a couple of years ago with a bunch of people in his apartment complex, are volunteering under the Relief Riders banner. “We have been getting about 40 to 50 calls a day, most asking for oxygen cylinders or Remdesivir. Sometimes, whole families are COVID positive, and even the chemist won’t go to these houses,” he says. Payments are usually cashless. But, occasionally, volunteers help with cash transactions if an elderly person is unfamiliar with digital payments. Santhana Selvan says a volunteer in Hyderabad even paid for medicines as the person in need of it could not afford them. Most of these volunteers who are used to riding long distances operate within neighbourhoods. “We used to cycle long distances for our own health. We don’t get to ride long distances now. But we ride for the health and safety of others,” says Sathya.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Build your own||Social media in the COVID-19 world is a command centre. As 20-something-year olds across the country assemble — sharing screenshots, forming verification models and networking across States — relatives of patients find hospital beds, oxygen concentrators and hope. Through the day and night (sometimes in shifts), strangers work together, armed with phones, laptops and an Internet connection, to help people through the current crisis. If there is a word that characterises the past few weeks, it would be ‘relentless’, says 28-year-old Pooja Pradeep. Bengaluru-based Pooja (@pooja.pradeep) starts her day by posting a format for those who send in requests from across the country, while her team of eight gets ready to carry out the back-end work. The format that is shared reads: Patient name; Age; Oxygen Saturation; Other Health Status... “I am not trained for this,” says Pooja, who is an educator. “What I do for a living is far from getting blood, figuring out what ICU bed is required for a particular oxygen saturation level…especially with no resources or backing,” she continues. It all started when a friend asked her if she had any leads for an ICU bed for her mother. Her own parents being dental surgeons and hence vulnerable, aided the trigger. “It comes from a point of having the platform, power and privilege to do it.” From a process standpoint, mobilisation forms the core of this exercise: what she needed were COVID Squads. “The squad is made up of three different teams: one is the request sourcing team, the second is the data streamlining team and the third is the verification team.” Requests and their details are entered into a simple tracker (an Excel sheet). The data streamlining team scouts through relevant data via Twitter searches and other social media data bases that are updated frequently. This is then shot out to the verification team. “They pick up the phone, and call, call, call. Call until they get verified leads and once they get at least two verified leads, the request sourcing team is informed. I, then, close the loop.” Verify, verify, verify Every single person in the verification team of 21-year-old Gautam Monangi’s COVID Squad, makes at least 500 calls a day. They are turned away many times, but soldier on. Formed only a week ago, Gautam’s (@gautam_monangi) is a larger squad of 25 to 30 people working across teams. They have been “thoroughly inspired by Pooja” who helped them come up with their own processes. In fact, days into forming her own team, Pooja had put up templates for anyone who wants to form their own crews. “We formed one more squad a few days back, called the BBMP squad, comprising 10 members who can speak Kannada and directly reach out to the BBMP helpline,” says Gautam, a freelance filmmaker, who is coordinating from Kuwait. He adds, “I have never taken this kind of responsibility before in my life.” Most squads have volunteers from across the world, who can work on different time zones. Twenty seven-year-old Saroj Attal, a volunteer in Pooja’s squad, is recovering from COVID-19. She joined the squad on returning from the hospital, where she was admitted for five days. A data scientist with JP Morgan Chase based in Mumbai, Saroj has been streamlining data and building a platform for the squad between her many fatigue-induced naps. “This work keeps me focussed. You need something to keep yourself engaged and busy. And it helps me have a purpose at the end of the day even if I am up for only a few hours in the day,” she says. The highs and lows The hardest part of the job is when someone gets back saying they wish to close the request, because the patient did not make it. “Even when they get the resources, it might not work in the best way. That hits hard,” says Gautam, adding, “Most of us are also dealing with our personal losses during this time and some in the group involve themselves in this work to make up for that,” says Gautam. And so, keeping a check on the mental health of the team members then becomes important. “Some team members are not seasoned volunteers and they wouldn’t know how to balance or draw a line,” says Pooja. Occasional breaks and Zoom get-togethers are definitely a relief. Gautam’s team also has a psychology therapist on board who helps them recognise and record the importance of their work, on a daily basis. As more groups mushroom across the country, a mass movement is taking form. “[A few days back], we were able to help an old couple with vision-impairments reach a hospital and we keep getting updates on their recovery,” says Gautam adding, “At the end of the day, if there is at least one person we could help, it makes all the difference.”  #COVIDSquads to look out for: Covid War Room by Sriharsha Karamchati (@sriharshakaramchati) COVIDSquad by Kartthika Siv (@karthikasiv) COVIDSquad by Swathi CM (@swatz_swatkat)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/build-your-own/article34494981.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The man for all times||Justin Theroux really is Hollywood’s man for every occasion. Need a Marvel blockbuster? Call Justin to write the screenplay. A lead star for an experimental supernatural series? Call Justin. Someone to direct a romantic drama? Call Justin. Yet Justin calls his career quite “bizarre”. Now, he attempts to bring to life the story of The Mosquito Coast , a 1981 best-selling novel by American author Paul Theroux, who is none other than Justin’s uncle. Connecting over video call from the US, Justin talks to us about taking on a layered character, his interpretation of the novel’s themes, and more. Edited excerpts: Did your uncle being the writer of the book from which the series is adapted make the process easier, or was there pressure on you? It didn’t add any pressure because he is just extremely happy that I am doing this show, and very proud that there is a family connection to it. As an actor, I get to just pick up the phone and call him whenever I want without feeling awkward, or having the enormous intimidation that comes when you want to impress the writer of something you are working on. I absolutely loved playing Allie; he is so complex. Whenever you are doing a series, if you have a boring character that you have to play for, possibly years, there is nothing worse. But Allie has a fascinating mind. Did you feel intimidated playing a character made popular by Harrison Ford?  He is so good in that movie! I have never read a review, so I couldn’t say whether it is underrated or overrated. But I know it didn’t do well financially, and that is a shame. I really just focussed on the material that I was given, which was different from the material that he [Ford] was given. But I do think we have probably arrived at some of the same conclusions, like he is a very forward-leaning character. So I didn’t feel intimidated at all, but I definitely felt a reverence to what he had done. In the show (and the novel), Allie puts his family above everything else. Does your off-screen persona share the same opinion?  I actually don’t. I mean, there are many family members that I love. But family is also the friends you are forced to have, as the expression goes, you know? Allie is a particular kind of character; it is not enough for him to just be the patriarch of the family. He really wants to instill his beliefs into them, and for his ideology to carry on. He is essentially a zealot for himself. So no, I wouldn’t share that belief system with Allie.  After going through a pandemic, how do you think audiences will relate to the show’s characters? If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that we can do more with less. You don’t need all the stuff! The flipside of that is, we all relied so much on technology; we are using it right now to communicate. So I don’t know, there could be some crazy consumer boom that happens once everyone gets vaccinated, and we start going back to life as normal. But I definitely think everyone got put into a time-out, and did some reflecting on what is important in life. I know I did. And as painful as it was, it was also an inspiring time. You have starred in acclaimed shows and written blockbusters. How do you diversify your mind to work in such different genres?  I have had a very bizarre career. Sometimes I’m writing comedy scripts, sometimes it’s action, otherwise I’m acting in them. I am a big believer in using your gut and choosing things that may not be the most financially rewarding, but are fulfilling. My idea of hell is playing the same character over and over again, so I usually try and diversify. Once I have finished something, I don’t really want to return to it. That just makes my life more interesting, whether it is writing or acting. The Mosquito Coast is currently streaming on Apple TV+   21st Century adaptation Having already been made into a 1986 film that starred Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, the Apple TV+ series promises a new take on the dangerous journey of a radical idealist and brilliant inventor, Allie Fox (played by Justin), who uproots his family to Mexico when they suddenly find themselves on the run from the US government. But what happens when the family’s adventure transitions from paradise into dystopia, as their father’s mind unravels? The Mosquito Coast also stars Melissa George, Logan Polish and Gabriel Bateman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-man-for-all-times/article34494962.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||When Indian thatha flicked his finger||The year was 1996. Cricketers Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva had just won the World Cup for Sri Lanka. Atal Bihari Vajpayee ruled Indian politics briefly, and a certain Ramar Pillai was in the news for producing ‘herbal fuel’. Closer home, a Tamil film titled Indian ( Hindustani in Hindi) hit screens. Starring Kamal Haasan as a freedom fighter, this Shankar-directorial became an on-screen statement against corruption, replete with elaborate stunt sequences and colourful songs by AR Rahman. Senapathy aka Indian thatha became a sensation. And his method of seeking justice — by twirling his fingers to lock the pressure points of wrongdoers — became a bigger hit. A few months after the film’s release, even children in Tamil Nadu were flicking their fingers imitating what Indian thatha did. They were displaying varmakkalai , an ancient Tamil martial artform predominantly used for self-defence. R Rajendran, or ‘Aasaan’ Rajendran, was most happy about these developments. The Madurai-based martial arts exponent guided Kamal Haasan and the stunt team on the techniques behind varmakkalai , which was an integral part of action sequences. “Back then, very few people knew about this artform. A week after Indian released, an elderly gentleman, who came to meet me, broke down. He was in awe of the way we had showcased it in the film,” recalls 70-year-old Rajendran, over a phone call. Rajendran, founder of Manja Varmakkalai Martial Art Academy, Chennai, recalls the day when he got a letter from AM Rathnam’s Sri Surya Movies, the production house that bankrolled Indian. “Director Shankar would like to meet you regarding a film,” the letter stated. He subsequently learnt that one of Shankar’s assistant directors had chanced upon a book on varmakkalai he had written, at a book stall in Tiruchi. “I realised it was a big opportunity for me to showcase the artform,” recalls Rajendran, “I immediately packed my bags and went to Madras.” At Shankar’s office, Rajendran did a demo by performing the martial art on one of the director’s assistants. He also presented a couple of books that he had written on the subject. “The premise of the film was interesting. Since the protagonist was an old man who had to fight, we conceptualised it in a way that he did not have to punch harder. We zeroed in on varmakkalai , or pressure point fighting, as a solution.” Rajendran had a few meetings with Shankar’s team and writer Sujatha at the pre-production stage. “In the shooting spot, Kamal was inquisitive about the artform and followed my inputs with diligence,” adds Rajendran. Back to the roots Though films like Indian and Suriya’s 7aum Arivu have  touched upon these indigenous martial artforms, much more can be done, feels Rajendran. “There are several techniques in varmakkalai that can be used in films,” he adds, “It is the pride of Tamils and founded by sage Agasthiyar in the South- podhigai mountains (Kutralam). He also founded other artforms such as nokku varmam (strike a person by looking at him) and meitheenda kalai (strike/heal a person in any part of the world). Why use guns and aruval when we have such aspects in our culture?” Twenty-five years have passed and Indian 2 is currently in the works. However, the 1996 film gave some impetus to Rajendran and varmakkalai . With centres in Chennai, Madurai and Kovilpattti, among others, Rajendran has been imparting his knowledge of the art to students. “It is the mother of all martial arts,” he declares, “It needs to be imparted to the next generation.”  At the shooting spot,Kamal was inquisitive about the artform of varmakkalai and followed my inputs with diligence R Rajendran||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-indian-thatha-flicked-his-finger/article34494972.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The big Olympics dream||The year 2011 was one of the worst in paddler Sharath Kamal’s career. His world rankings plummeted to 94, the lowest ever in his career. He started losing Indian national tournaments, a rarity for a veteran player like him. “It was the lowest of lows,” he recalls, “But I believe that you can appreciate the high only if you see the low.” Exactly a decade later, Sharath will represent the country at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, scheduled to kickstart on July 23. He firmly believes that this year he will realise his dream of bagging the prestigious medal. “I’m as close as can be this time,” says the Chennai-resident. This will be Sharath’s fourth trip to the Olympics, considered the holy grail for all sportspersons. “It [the Olympics] is what the whole world is talking about. The stress levels go higher here as there are a lot of expectations from you. This time, it is a lot different because interaction with other sportspersons is going to be minimal [due to COVID-19 protocols].”  Lockdown and later  Despite the pandemic squashing his longing to go out and play, Sharath is thankful he at least has a table at home. “Sathiyan (Gnanasekaran) also has a table at home, but has no one to play against. I was lucky to have my younger brother (Rajath Kamal) and father (Srinivasa Rao) around to help me during practice sessions.” With no specific goal in sight, all Sharath could do was keep working on his game. “Mentally, it was hard....because I was practising without knowing exactly for what. All I could tell was to work in a generic manner on my skills.” That was the time when he also got back to yoga, which he used to practise when he was in school and during his training days. “Flexibility is not my forte as I am used to playing a power game. Yoga helped me work on that,” he says. “It helped me become more aware of my body. Since the last year, I know exactly where I feel stiff and how to work on it. Also, just waking up in the morning and having that time and space for yourself was great.” At 38, Sharath isn’t growing any younger but he is still as active as the new players. His family has been wanting him to call it quits for a while now. He recently posted a picture with his mother, captioning it: “Ever since 2007, till date, my mom has been asking me when I’ll stop playing and spend more time with family.” Draw his attention to that, and Sharath breaks into a big smile, “I’ll just win another medal for them, and then they cannot say much. The families of sportspersons sacrifice a lot to help us focus on the sport.” His sights are set on an Olympic medal but he also has a vision for the future: taking the game he dearly loves to the masses. “It is a sport that most people would have tried at some point of time; there are tables at schools, colleges and offices. Most holiday resorts have TT tables too. But those numbers have not translated into people taking it up professionally. I think it’s about having role models and superstars in the sport. Hopefully, if we get an Olympic medal, things will change.”     Watch the   Olympics on      Sony Sports||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-big-olympics-dream/article34494992.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Master collaborators||Bjorn Surrao turned into a household name after his ‘Master the Blaster’ track in Vijay-starrer Master topped music charts. Now, the singer-composer has joined hands with Arivu — who is also basking in the limelight after ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ — to produce a track named ‘Yenna Sonna’ that has ‘Yel-love’ written all over it. Produced by Think Music, ‘Yenna Sonna’ is very well the ‘Shikhar Dhawan thigh-five’ equivalent for a Chennai Super Kings fan: the track’s music video features Bjorn and CSK superfan Saravanan Hari, and is basically a ‘What did you say?’ to fans of other IPL teams who questioned CSK’s below-par performance in IPL 2020. “I am a massive CSK fan, and so I liked the idea of collaborating with another artiste and writing music for CSK; it is a song for the fans,” says Bjorn, over phone. He adds: “Arivu and I, we sat down in my studio and it took us about two days to jam this track. We watched CSK highlights for inspiration.” The present IPL season stands postponed following an outbreak of COVID-19 cases among players and staff members of various teams. Before the postponement, CSK stood as one of the table toppers in the eight-team league. Bjorn says, “As CSK fans, there is always expectation [that the team performs well]. ‘Yenna Sonna’ is not even an aggressive question to fans of other teams. It’s more of... ‘What...? I didn’t even hear what you said!’ It’s CSK fans saying, ‘We are going to have a good time, celebrate our cricket and not care about what you say’.” Featuring quirky visuals, the music video has been viewed nearly 5 lakh times since being uploaded to YouTube. Bjorn adds that the track’s bohemian vibes are courtesy the use of Latino music instruments. “The track is inspired by South American, African, Jamaican and South Indian sounds. It was an interesting process working with Arivu and making use of these unique sounds in the track.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/master-collaborators/article34494964.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Straight out of Madagascar||In 2019, Bharath Sankar was on a tour to Madagascar, off East Africa, when he became acquainted with a family of musicians. They performed to Tamil songs and Bharath returned the favour by performing to their songs, markedly signalling a collaboration. He somehow wanted to loop them in but had difficulties contacting them, for it would take a while for his message to reach. Bharath says he created a library of soundtracks imagining himself sitting in Africa and sent across a track to Tsanta Randri, the only person who spoke English in the family. The brief given to Tsanta was ‘forgetting the past’ and ‘living in the moment’, and he was asked to write the lyrics, which eventually became ‘Iaino — To Live’, one of the songs in Mandela , directed by another débutante, Madonne Ashwin. Tsanta’s father Mamiliva Randriamihajasoa, also a musician, wrote the lyrics in Malagasy and the Tamil translation was written by singer-composer Pradeep Kumar, who is also part of the band Oorka, in which Bharath Sankar is the lead vocalist. Although the songs for Mandela were composed in 2018, Bharath began researching about African music and was looking at their catalogue of labels composed by popular tribal artists. Since the film also had an African connection, courtesy Nelson Mandela, Bharath felt it needed a rooted music that had the “local flavour but shouldn’t sound too produced and polished”. As part of the research, Bharath says the soundtrack for films such as The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind and Guava Island helped them to a large extent. ‘Ela Mandela’ was the starting point that signalled he was on the right track. For this, Bharath brought in another African singer, Musa Mashiane, for chorus. Musa had remote knowledge of the existence of Tamil cinema or what the film was about. Yet, he gave his own interpretation to the song. “Even I had no idea what he was going to bring to the table. He deleted all the bits I had marked for him and sung only for the beginning. Later, when I asked him what it meant, he said he was singing in praise of [Nelson] Mandela,” says Bharath over phone, “It was a good amalgamation of a Tamil song with an African flavour.” The sounds ofMandela He met the director through a mutual friend and says he was given a bound script and a narration. Bharath could not access the script musically, but says he began to play the harmonium when there was a power shut down and the music flowed. Both Bharath and Ashwin had certain references they agreed upon — but there was no calculated effort.  Mandela has six songs, three of which is written by Arivu who has sung ‘Yela Yelo’. Bharath admits that his influences lay in the compositions he grew up listening and the artists he adored. Watch closely and you will notice him playing a hat-tip to them — from Ilaiyaaraja, Deva to villupattu exponent Subbu Arumugam and Gangai Amaren.   “I have been inspired a lot by Deva. When I was in the North for a concert, we stayed at the artistes’ camp that had people from all over the world. Invariably, we would be the only tent that wakes up to a loud ‘Vitha Vithama Soap Seepu Kannadi’ song [from Deva],” he says with a laugh. Starting out as an independent musician, Bharath had composed for three songs in last year’s Dharala Prabhu , though Mandela marks his debut film album. About the growing space for indie collaborations, Bharath says, “It has not yet become a trend, but filmmakers are no longer looking at the X and Y combinations. Because, they are also an audience and if they discover an artiste and become their fan, they try reaching out. Things are changing especially with young filmmakers coming in.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/straight-out-of-madagascar/article34494968.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Tech geeks to the jab rescue||This time last year, India was queuing outside supermarkets and banks. Now the queues have also moved to the digital space, as the vaccination drive for all adults has opened up across the country. It has not been easy; the wait has been riddled with anxiety owing to vaccine shortages. But the past year has been a lesson in the power of online community, with people taking to social media for help, SOS calls and enquiries about registrations on CoWIN and Aarogya Setu apps. Websites such as GetJab.in, FindSlot.in and Under45.in have helped people get appointments at verified vaccine centres. These platforms were possible in the first place because CoWIN’s API (application programming interface) has now been opened to the public. This means developers are free to access the framework of the app and integrate it into their own platform, like how Google Maps is used in food delivery apps. GetJab.in was co-created by four Mumbai-based software developers: Azhar Hussain, Shyam Sunder, Anurag Kishore and Akshay Nautiyal, to smoothen the process. Azhar, who is also a product manager at Microsoft, says, “We are continually updating it (like an SMS feature to come), as we get more feedback.” The founders of FindSlot.in are Bengaluru-based Shubhendu Sharma and Jeroz Nishanth. According to Shubhendu, FindSlot.in “by May 2, saw more than 10,000 successful COVID-19 vaccine slot searches completed from 259 cities in India in the last 48 hours,” and he says the numbers keep rising.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The city’s foot soldiers||Hospitals are ground zero in the war against COVID-19. Like any other war, this one needs troops aplenty — not only doctors, nurses and others with medical prowess, but also patient and kind souls to guide and coordinate with the teeming masses that flock to them in fear. For instance, “At Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital where we volunteer, we once noticed that student doctors were filling out ICMR forms for patients. Their training could be used in more important tasks, so we took up this one,” says Jai Krishnan MS, project coordinator of one of Chennai’s largest COVID-19 volunteer groups. Formerly with a publishing house, Jai Krishnan has now dedicated all his time to this work. The group, that identifies itself just as Greater Chennai Corporation volunteers, was put together by Loyola College associate professor Gladston Xavier. It comprises hundreds of volunteers of different ages and professions coming together to man helplines, check in on the isolated, arrange for basic needs. “We are putting up a voluntary task force in Delhi. But so far, most of our volunteers have been in Chennai. Across other cities, whenever there is a need, we either give them our volunteers or train theirs,” says the professor. “There is a team of 10 people working full-time at GH hospital, providing patient support, helping with admission, and counselling. About 200 more are helping virtually, by following up with patients who are in home isolation. We have another 65 people in our telecounselling centre, and a host of others — these are mainly philanthropists and people who work in larger companies, who have come together — arranging for food, clothing and essentials,” he adds. Prominent among them all are the students — the ones manning ground zero with Jai. Most of them are undergraduate or post-graduate students of Social Work or Psychology, and are part of this particular team for good reason. Explains Jai: “People are scared. Many are anxious, or in fight mode. Our first priority is patience, and then the ability to listen and understand things from their perspective. Social Work and Psychology students think from a counselling point of view.” There is also scope to help out from home, as Gladston points out. A former Dean of Arts and Head, Department of Social Work at Loyola College, Gladston had co-founded the institution’s Department of Community Outreach. The initiative first began in March 2020, adds Gladston. Now that numbers are on the rise again, the team is back on a war footing. Any willing, helpful hands are welcome.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||When the going got tough, so did they||Mallik Thatipalli,content writer  The only driving forces that kept me strong were my mother, wife and sister. Every day as I felt weak and fatigued, I’d tell myself, I have to be strong for them and fight it out. I wasn’t in a frame of mind to read a new book, so I started re-reading  the Harry Potter series, followed by Ayn Rand and the Inheritance series. I also re-watchedTheLord Of The Ringsand The Hobbit . All this even though I knew that Sauron and Voldemort would be defeated, I just wanted to go back to those familiar scenes. The other most important thing my family did was to be on video most of the time; it was our way of being connected. Since my wife and I both tested positive, it was my mother who kept a watch on us. She would keep the video on in the kitchen while she worked, so that was like our window to the world outside.    Sai Ram,marketing professional  As I work with a hospital, I was busy even while I was admitted there after testing positive. I was constantly on the phone, replying to various queries on beds, vaccine and medication. When I was not able to talk, I was messaging. Being on a hospital bed and battling the virus made me understand the plight of the people seeking help and I couldn’t turn my back. This also helped me feel stronger and diverted my attention.    Sajan Pookkodan,communication professional  After testing positive, I assured myself that I will be fine. I reminded myself of having the privilege of a safety net in the form of supportive friends even though I was away from my family. Staying connected with my wife and daughter through video calls kept me happy. We also made a pact that as a family we would be honest with each other about our feelings and well being. My friends kept me engaged with jokes and chats, jumping in to help with whatever I needed. A strong support system is very important to keep you in the right frame of mind.    Vanaja C,journalist  I spent many days in three different ICUs. Right now, I am home and recovering, but with limited limb function. While in the hospital my friends advised me to practise Vipasana , they sent me chants, verses from theGita, and suggested meditative music. I tried them all and honestly, I found them depressing. Instead, I found my mojo in popular Telugu film songs; their upbeat music made me feel alive — I wanted to break into a dance even in my bed. I insisted on doing some basic exercise. Calming music and meditation didn’t work for me. Everybody is different, so one should be allowed to listen and watch whatever gives them joy.    Dharma Kanta Sharma,retired teacher  I am 81 years old and am not a big fan of music, but I do have a transistor by my bedside right now just to listen to the political discussions. News is depressing. But since I like reading, I finished Ashwin Sanghi’s Chanakya’s Chant . That book was gripping and made me forget my lethargy. I read Sanghi’s The Rozabal Line too. I also call my daughters and friends to check on their well-being and also use the opportunity slyly to ask them if I sound feeble.    Bakiya Sri,analyst  When my mother, brother and I tested positive we preferred home quarantine. We stayed in our respective rooms and decided to stay away from news bulletins. We also spoke to each other from our rooms instead of communicating through phone. I sailed through my isolation days with Vadivelu memes and jokes. Seven days after we were allowed to mingle with each other, we played a lot of board games. As a household that survived COVID-19, my request to others is, be kind to those who are sick. That really lifts up their spirits. I am actively talking to my friends who have the virus now. I want to keep them motivated and do whatever cheers them up.    Shilpa Nainani,emcee  Cal Newports’s book Deep Work was my companion at night when I couldn’t sleep. During the day when I was not coughing, I was on call with my parents and niece. My husband and I both tested positive, so I had company in isolation. I am also part of an NLP group that shared motivational speeches and conducted virtual community meetings. It gave me the push to get dressed, do my hair and wear my earrings, so I could feel like myself again. By the 12th day, I got onto social media to see how I could be of help to others.    Venugopal N,journalist  When I was hospitalised, I kept myself focussed and positive to recover for my wife. COVID-19 hit her severely and I was only focussing on her recovery. For a week, we couldn’t see each other even though we were in the same hospital. That was very frustrating. To distract myself, I read Bahula by A Appala Naidu, a 500-page socio-historical fiction based in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-the-going-got-tough-so-did-they/article34495234.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s easier for a camel...||Roshan’s even toes sink into the sand, dodging scree as he plods along the expansive plains towards Mand, a small town in southern Balochistan bordering Iran. The camel passes sights that belong to a medieval play — small houses, their doorways covered in hessian sacks, pepper the hillside; lone trees stand scattered; and the only colour in the dun landscape is from intricately painted Bedford trucks on the highway and the children dressed in bright salwar kameezes racing to meet him. Roshan’s saddle panniers hang low with books that bring both cheer and a peek into the world outside to these children living in Pakistan’s most impoverished province, which has low literacy rates and has been battling insurgency for over 20 years. COVID-19 is the latest deterrent but that has not stopped the cud-chewing Roshan from making weekly visits to villages carrying English, Urdu and Balochi books for children aged three to 15, as part of the Camel Library Project. When the pandemic closed schools, Zubaida Jalal, a federal minister and Rahima Jalal, a school head-mistress, thought of using camels to distribute books in this desolate terrain with little Internet access. The sisters reached out to the Alif Laila Book Bus Society (ALBBS) and Female Education Trust, two NGOs working for female literacy. Judith’s Reading Room was the first donor and the project was launched in October 2020 across Mand, Gwadar and Tharpakar, Sindh. Murad Ali, Roshan’s herder, had him togged out in colourful buntings and brought him around to help. Basarat Kazim, president of ALBBS that donated the books for the project and an author of children’s books, speaks on the Society’s journey, and giving children a sense of the ‘normal’ in these difficult times. Excerpts from an email interview: How did ALBBS begin?  It was started in 1978 by Dr Juanita Baker, an American living in Pakistan at the time. Till then, there were no children’s libraries in the country, and this stationary double-decker bus won everyone’s hearts. It is symbolic of the children’s library movement in Pakistan. The outreach is through libraries and mobile libraries in schools, distribution of 100-book box libraries to celebrate IBBY’s [International Board on Books for Young People] work in Pakistan and bus, rickshaw, camel and bike libraries. How do you ensure that children from disadvantaged sections understand the books they are reading? Are there guides? The project caters to children from all sections of society with a mission to create understanding. Our funds are however concentrated on the financially disadvantaged. We have developed a reading assessment sheet and facilitators are available to support the children. Imagination and problem solving skills need to be enhanced. Only then will education in our part of the world be worthy of children. Where do you source books from?  We buy books from publishers in Pakistan, who also donate periodically. Hoopoe Books and Big Bad Boo have been magnanimous donors. Book drives in schools and children donating books they have read is a common feature. Given the sub-continental culture, do more girls drop out from the reading habit, especially in rural areas?  If they read less it’s only because they don’t have the opportunity. Within our projects we notice a great leaning of girls to read and excel. Tell us about your rickshaw and camel projects  Rickshaw libraries are very exciting. These colourful three-wheelers can reach children and schools in narrow alleys. Running them is cost effective too. Camels are such gracious, eco-friendly animals. Through the Camel Library Project, we wanted children to value them for the fantastic service they provide. The ALBBS remains responsible for designing the library and supplementary material that goes with it like puppets, games and Tech Bag. We also give each camel a name. Chirag and Raunaq are the other camels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-easier-for-a-camel/article34495236.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Help arrives on a bicycle||Divi K wanted to take some home-cooked food for her elderly aunt, who was unwell, on May 1 in Bengaluru. She stays in Halasuru which is about 20 kilometres from her aunt’s house in Yelahanka. Due to the lockdown in Karnataka, she was unable to drive there herself. She could not find a delivery service either. That is when she came across a helpline number for Relief Riders, a group of cyclists who are volunteering to deliver medicines and other essentials, including food, to vulnerable people in the city. Within minutes of dialling the number, a volunteer — Kunal Bohra, a second-year BCom student — reached her doorstep. The food was delivered within an hour. Relief Riders is headed by Bengaluru’s ‘bicycle mayor’ Sathya Sankaran, who is a part of BYCS, a Dutch social enterprise that heads a worldwide network of international cycle mayors. Along with the Bengaluru cycling community, he formed Relief Riders during the first wave of the pandemic. With the city in the midst of a two-week lockdown, the cyclists returned to volunteer again. Now, more cities have joined the programme. The programme kicked off in Chennai from May 3. Felix John, Chennai’s bicycle mayor, says, “We are aware the situation is much worse than last year. Hence, it’s probably riskier for us to move around. But the people in need of essentials and medicines have also grown which is why we decided to volunteer.” In Bengaluru, the team serves from 6 am to 10 am (on other times as well, in case of emergencies) every day. Once a person in need contacts a helpline number, the request is shared on a WhatsApp group. Then, whoever is available to help, takes it up. Volunteers have made about 90 deliveries so far. They also check on people with physical and mental disabilities. The Bengaluru team has tied up with the elders helpline (1090) as well. “There are about 190 volunteers in Bangalore and 29 in Hubli-Dharwad,” says Sathya. Five more cities — Mumbai, Chennai, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Belagavi — have joined the programme. The Hyderabad edition of Relief Riders, which started on May 1, has done about 10 deliveries so far. “I think the number of requests we get will increase as the helpline numbers are just beginning to reach more people,” says Santhana Selvan, Hyderabad’s bicycle mayor. In Gurugram, Vineet Chopra and his local cycling group, the Rock Riders, formed a couple of years ago with a bunch of people in his apartment complex, are volunteering under the Relief Riders banner. “We have been getting about 40 to 50 calls a day, most asking for oxygen cylinders or Remdesivir. Sometimes, whole families are COVID positive, and even the chemist won’t go to these houses,” he says. Payments are usually cashless. But, occasionally, volunteers help with cash transactions if an elderly person is unfamiliar with digital payments. Santhana Selvan says a volunteer in Hyderabad even paid for medicines as the person in need of it could not afford them. Most of these volunteers who are used to riding long distances operate within neighbourhoods. “We used to cycle long distances for our own health. We don’t get to ride long distances now. But we ride for the health and safety of others,” says Sathya.

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Build your own||Social media in the COVID-19 world is a command centre. As 20-something-year-olds across the country assemble — sharing screenshots, forming verification models and networking across States — relatives of patients find hospital beds, oxygen concentrators and hope. Through the day and night (sometimes in shifts), strangers work together, armed with phones, laptops and an Internet connection, to help people through the current crisis. If there is a word that characterises the past few weeks, it would be ‘relentless’, says 28-year-old Pooja Pradeep. Bengaluru-based Pooja (@pooja.pradeep) starts her day by posting a format for those who send in requests from across the country, while her team of eight gets ready to carry out the back-end work. The format that is shared reads: Patient name; Age; Oxygen Saturation; Other Health Status... “I am not trained for this,” says Pooja, who is an educator. “What I do for a living is far from getting blood, figuring out what ICU bed is required for a particular oxygen saturation level…especially with no resources or backing,” she continues. It all started when a friend asked her if she had any leads for an ICU bed for her mother. Her own parents being dental surgeons and hence vulnerable, aided the trigger. “It comes from a point of having the platform, power and privilege to do it.” From a process standpoint, mobilisation forms the core of this exercise: what she needed were COVID Squads. “The squad is made up of three different teams: one is the request sourcing team, the second is the data streamlining team and the third is the verification team.” Requests and their details are entered into a simple tracker (an Excel sheet). The data streamlining team scouts through relevant data via Twitter searches and other social media data bases that are updated frequently. This is then shot out to the verification team. “They pick up the phone, and call, call, call. Call until they get verified leads and once they get at least two verified leads, the request sourcing team is informed. I, then, close the loop.” Verify, verify, verify Every single person in the verification team of 21-year-old Gautam Monangi’s COVID Squad, makes at least 500 calls a day. They are turned away many times, but soldier on. Formed only a week ago, Gautam’s (@gautam_monangi) is a larger squad of 25 to 30 people working across teams. They have been “thoroughly inspired by Pooja” who helped them come up with their own processes. In fact, days into forming her own team, Pooja had put up templates for anyone who wants to form their own crews. “We formed one more squad a few days back, called the BBMP squad, comprising 10 members who can speak Kannada and directly reach out to the BBMP helpline,” says Gautam, a freelance filmmaker, who is coordinating from Kuwait. He adds, “I have never taken this kind of responsibility before in my life.” Most squads have volunteers from across the world, who can work on different time zones. Twenty seven-year-old Saroj Attal, a volunteer in Pooja’s squad, is recovering from COVID-19. She joined the squad on returning from the hospital, where she was admitted for five days. A data scientist with JP Morgan Chase based in Mumbai, Saroj has been streamlining data and building a platform for the squad between her many fatigue-induced naps. “This work keeps me focussed. You need something to keep yourself engaged and busy. And it helps me have a purpose at the end of the day even if I am up for only a few hours in the day,” she says. The highs and lows The hardest part of the job is when someone gets back saying they wish to close the request, because the patient did not make it. “Even when they get the resources, it might not work in the best way. That hits hard,” says Gautam, adding, “Most of us are also dealing with our personal losses during this time and some in the group involve themselves in this work to make up for that,” says Gautam. And so, keeping a check on the mental health of the team members then becomes important. “Some team members are not seasoned volunteers and they wouldn’t know how to balance or draw a line,” says Pooja. Occasional breaks and Zoom get-togethers are definitely a relief. Gautam’s team also has a psychology therapist on board who helps them recognise and record the importance of their work, on a daily basis. As more groups mushroom across the country, a mass movement is taking form. “[A few days back], we were able to help an old couple with vision-impairments reach a hospital and we keep getting updates on their recovery,” says Gautam adding, “At the end of the day, if there is at least one person we could help, it makes all the difference.”  #COVIDSquads to look out for: Covid War Room by Sriharsha Karamchati (@sriharshakaramchati) COVIDSquad by Kartthika Siv (@karthikasiv) COVIDSquad by Swathi CM (@swatz_swatkat)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/build-your-own/article34495237.ece
06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The big Olympics dream||The year 2011 was one of the worst in paddler Sharath Kamal’s career. His world rankings plummeted to 94, the lowest ever in his career. He started losing Indian national tournaments, a rarity for a veteran player like him. “It was the lowest of lows,” he recalls, “But I believe that you can appreciate the high only if you see the low.” Exactly a decade later, Sharath will represent the country at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, scheduled to kickstart on July 23. He firmly believes that this year he will realise his dream of bagging the prestigious medal. “I’m as close as can be this time,” says the Chennai-resident. This will be Sharath’s fourth trip to the Olympics, considered the holy grail for all sportspersons. “It [the Olympics] is what the whole world is talking about. The stress levels go higher here as there are a lot of expectations from you. This time, it is a lot different because interaction with other sportspersons is going to be minimal [due to COVID-19 protocols].”  Lockdown and later  Despite the pandemic squashing his longing to go out and play, Sharath is thankful he at least has a table at home. “Sathiyan (Gnanasekaran) also has a table at home, but has no one to play against. I was lucky to have my younger brother (Rajath Kamal) and father (Srinivasa Rao) around to help me during practice sessions.” With no specific goal in sight, all Sharath could do was keep working on his game. “Mentally, it was hard....because I was practising without knowing exactly for what. All I could tell was to work in a generic manner on my skills.” That was the time when he also got back to yoga, which he used to practise when he was in school and during his training days. “Flexibility is not my forte as I am used to playing a power game. Yoga helped me work on that,” he says. “It helped me become more aware of my body. Since the last year, I know exactly where I feel stiff and how to work on it. Also, just waking up in the morning and having that time and space for yourself was great.” At 38, Sharath isn’t growing any younger but he is still as active as the new players. His family has been wanting him to call it quits for a while now. He recently posted a picture with his mother, captioning it: “Ever since 2007, till date, my mom has been asking me when I’ll stop playing and spend more time with family.” Draw his attention to that, and Sharath breaks into a big smile, “I’ll just win another medal for them, and then they cannot say much. The families of sportspersons sacrifice a lot to help us focus on the sport.” His sights are set on an Olympic medal but he also has a vision for the future: taking the game he dearly loves to the masses. “It is a sport that most people would have tried at some point of time; there are tables at schools, colleges and offices. Most holiday resorts have TT tables too. But those numbers have not translated into people taking it up professionally. I think it’s about having role models and superstars in the sport. Hopefully, if we get an Olympic medal, things will change.”     Watch the   Olympics on      Sony Sports||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-big-olympics-dream/article34495238.ece

06 May 2021||May 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Tech geeks to the jab rescue||This time last year, India was queuing outside supermarkets and banks. Now the queues have also moved to the digital space, as the vaccination drive for all adults has opened up across the country. It has not been easy; the wait has been riddled with anxiety owing to vaccine shortages. But the past year has been a lesson in the power of online community, with people taking to social media for help, SOS calls and enquiries about registrations on CoWIN and Aarogya Setu apps. Websites such as GetJab.in, FindSlot.in and Under45.in have helped people get appointments at verified vaccine centres. These platforms were possible in the first place because CoWIN’s API (application programming interface) has now been opened to the public. This means developers are free to access the framework of the app and integrate it into their own platform, like how Google Maps is used in food delivery apps. GetJab.in was co-created by four Mumbai-based software developers: Azhar Hussain, Shyam Sunder, Anurag Kishore and Akshay Nautiyal, to smoothen the process. Azhar, who is also a product manager at Microsoft, says, “We are continually updating it (like an SMS feature to come), as we get more feedback.” The founders of FindSlot.in are Bengaluru-based Shubhendu Sharma and Jeroz Nishanth. According to Shubhendu, FindSlot.in “by May 2, saw more than 10,000 successful COVID-19 vaccine slot searches completed from 259 cities in India in the last 48 hours,” and he says the numbers keep rising. Krish Kothipalli, 32, in Hyderabad used FindSlot.in for himself and his wife as he finds the interface faster than CoWIN. Krish points out, “It is just more responsive and it works in real-time. I was also not surrendering personal data such as my Aadhar number.

06 May 2021||JAIPUR,||Spiralling COVID-19 cases put heavy load on Jaipur hospitals||The spiralling cases of COVID-19 infection have put an unprecedented load on both the government and private hospitals in Jaipur and created a shortage of beds with oxygen support and ventilators. Patients are being rushed from one hospital to another by their relatives in search of emergency facilities. The Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) Hospital, which is the State government’s biggest COVID-19 treatment centre, is full with patients for whom the hospital administration was forced to lay beds in corridors from the ground to the eighth floors of the ward buildings. The hospital’s 442 oxygen beds and 153 ICU beds with ventilators were fully occupied on Wednesday. While the Medical & Health Department has asked the RUHS Hospital to shift its less serious patients to Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Government Hospital, where the beds were being reserved, the latter has expressed its inability to admit the patients in the absence of sufficient medical oxygen. The SMS Hospital offers multi-speciality treatment as the State government’s biggest health facility. With the SMS Hospital refusing to take in the patients without being referred from the RUHS, several virus-infected persons have gone back disappointed. Yashpal Singh, who brought his mother Meera Devi, 45, from the nearby Chaksu town, told The Hindu that the para-medical staff gave her oxygen briefly in the emergency ward, but she could not survive. Oxygen cylinders sought SMS Hospital Superintendent Rajesh Sharma has informed the Medical & Health Department of the need for 3,000 oxygen cylinders before the patients were shifted there. As many as 650 patients of other diseases in the hospital are already on oxygen support, according to a letter of Dr. Sharma, who has raised the demand for 2,000 oxygen cylinders everyday for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Most of the private hospitals do not have any beds free for critically ill patients. Neeraj Purohit, Operations Manager at Apex Hospital in Malviya Nagar, told The Hindu that the hospital was barely managing to treat the COVID-19 patients with the oxygen quota allocated to it. The hospital’s 54 oxygen beds, nine ICU beds with ventilators and 19 without ventilators were all fully occupied, he said. The family members of four patients who died created a ruckus at a private hospital on Kalwar Road last week with the allegation that there was no staff to change the oxygen cylinder during night. Another hospital in Jagatpura asked the relatives of patients admitted there to shift them elsewhere because of shortage of oxygen. The district administration brought the situation under control by arranging 43 cylinders as an emergency measure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/spiralling-covid-19-cases-put-heavy-load-on-jaipur-hospitals/article34494700.ece
06 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Minor technical glitches aside, smooth sailing at vaccine centres||Outside a government school in Shahdara, people queued up to take their first shot of COVID-19 vaccine. While most of them went home satisfied, a handful returned without a jab as their names didn’t find a mention in the list at the centre. A 36-year-old, who did not wish to be named, said that he had registered on Monday and got an appointment for Wednesday 9am-11am slot but when he got his details verified, the Civil Defence Volunteers couldn’t find his name in the register. “I have been asked to reschedule and come back. I have stepped out today [Wednesday] and it was scary enough. What is my fault if their system is not working properly?” he said. Recurring incident A senior nursing staffer monitoring at the school, on condition of anonymity, said that at least eight to ten such cases have been coming every day since 18-44 age group started getting vaccinated. “They are then asked to reschedule. We have flagged it but it is not getting solved. If they allow over the counter registration then people won’t face this problem,” he said. At the school, those who had opted for 9am-11am slot and had reached around 8.15 a.m. to prevent a long queue had to wait for over an hour till the vaccination arrived around 9.20 a.m. Subsequently, the waiting period reduced to 15-20 minutes before a set of 20 people at a time was called inside the school to start the process. First, their identities were verified with the names on the list. Afterwards, they were given a chit and asked to proceed towards the vaccination room. Inside the vaccination room where a Civil Defence Volunteer confirmed if the person has had breakfast and updated information in the system. A few were sent back to eat as they said they didn’t have breakfast. After the vaccination, people were asked to sit on classroom chairs, which were laid out in the open. However, no one checked whether people were completing half an hour observation time. Satisfied with process Talking about the process, Gauri Sharma (19) said she was “extremely satisfied” and that everyone should get vaccinated. “It is so important right now. No one should wait or hesitate,” she said. Rubiya Khan (29), who was also happy with the process, said that people shouldn’t compare the two vaccines. “There should be no doubt on getting vaccinated. Even I’ve read up on the two vaccines before getting the jab but we should all get the vaccine that is available,” she said. Raman Arora (39) said that the situation is so dangerous that “vaccination seems to be the only good thing that is going for us”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/minor-technical-glitches-aside-smooth-sailing-at-vaccine-centres/article34495108.ece

06 May 2021||Chandigarh,||Haryana govt. issues guidelines on Tocilizumab distribution||The Haryana government has issued guidelines surrounding the distribution of Tocilizumab doses to individual COVID patients in public or private health institutions. The government guidelines state that no doctor or hospital shall issue prescription for Tocilizumab for purchase of the same from anywhere, as distribution of the drug is controlled by government. The government statement added that it shall be the personal responsibility of the hospital administrator of the institute requisitioning Tocilizumab to ensure appropriate use of prescription medicine, coordination with health authorities and keeping records for audit. “If Tocilizumab is issued and the patient dies before use, then the hospital shall reimburse the cost to the kin and keep the drug in stock for use in future,” it said. Curbs on black market The Haryana Police has since April 23 registered as many as 21 FIRs in connection with black-marketeering of oxygen, oxygen cylinders and anti-viral drug Remdesivir across the State. A total of 45 persons have been arrested in these cases, while 77 oxygen cylinders and 101 vials of Remdesivir have been recovered. Director General of Police (DGP) Manoj Yadava on Wednesday said that the demand for oxygen and Remdesivir had gone up after a massive outbreak of COVID-19. “Taking advantage of the situation, many unscrupulous persons and some employees of private hospitals indulged in the black-marketeering of oxygen and Remdesivir.” Mr. Yadava said since April 23, 2021, a total of 8 FIRs had been registered in six districts of Haryana and 12 persons arrested. “Similarly, 33 accused have been arrested by lodging 13 FIRs against them in eight districts after the recovery of 101 vials of Remdesivir from their possession,” he said. “In addition, a total of 1,249 cylinders have been collected by the police as a voluntary contribution from factory owners, welding shop owners, gas balloons sellers and ordinary citizens which have been made available to district administrations,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-govt-issues-guidelines-on-tocilizumab-distribution/article34494703.ece
06 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||Unfamiliar lineament among Assam earthquake factors||An unfamiliar lineament is among four factors behind frequent earthquakes in northern Assam’s Sonitpur area. A lineament is a linear feature in a landscape dictated by an underlying geological structure such as a fault. According to the Geological Survey of India (GSI), Sonitpur district lies within a tectonically complex triangular area bounded by the east-west trending Atherkhet Fault, the northwest-southeast trending Kopili Fault and a north-south trending lineament.  Two faults The two faults and the lineament, along with the oblique convergence of the Indian plate, have caused frequent earthquakes. The National Centre of Seismology recorded 29 earthquakes of magnitude varying from 2.6 to 4.7 in Sonitpur after the 6.4 tremblor on April 28 that damaged several buildings, bridges and a river embankment. The last of these 29 earthquakes with Sonitpur as the epicentre was recorded early Wednesday morning. Five more of magnitudes 2.6-3.2 were also recorded in neighbouring districts during this period. “Sonitpur was the epicentre of this huge 6.4 earthquake after 33 years because of the tectonic complexity. The Atherkhet and Kopili faults, the north-south lineament and the oblique convergence of the Indian plate is causing repetitive earthquakes,” GSI’s Deputy Director-General Sandip Kumar Som said. “Both the Atherkhet and Kopilli are active but we do not know about the nature of the lineament involved.” Atherkhet and Kopili are not the only faults that impact the Sonitpur region. The Siang Fracture, Yemla Fault, Namula Thrust and Canyon Thrust are spread across the northeast and are active along with Main Himalayan Thrust, Main Boundary Thrust, Main Central Thrust and several subsidiary faults. “The northeast is demarcated as Seismic Zone V, which indicates a zone with high vulnerability. The Indian plate is moving northeast toward the Eurasian plate in the Himalayan region, their oblique collision and release of stress and strain accumulated in the local tectonic or fault environments lead to earthquakes,” Dr. Som said. He also explained why water was oozing out of the fault in Sonitpur and adjoining affected areas after the April 28 earthquake. “This was a result of severe liquefaction [the process of making something liquid] from the unconsolidated substratum [underlying layer of soil/rock],” he said.  ‘Don’t heed predictions’ The GSI specialist advised people not to heed earthquake predictions. “Unlike a landslip, a surficial process that can be constrained, an earthquake is a process deep inside the earth. But scientists worldwide are trying for a breakthrough. The work to understand the strain localisation of future earthquakes is under progress,” Dr. Som said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unfamiliar-lineament-among-assam-earthquake-factors/article34494699.ece
