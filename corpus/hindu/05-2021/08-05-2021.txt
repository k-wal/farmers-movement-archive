08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Karnataka HC judicious in ordering oxygen: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Karnataka High Court order of May 5 directing the Union government to supply 1,200 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen every day to the State. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah described the interim order of the High Court as a “careful, calibrated and judicious exercise”. The top court pointed out that even the Karnataka government had projected a need for 1,800 MT of oxygen if the number of cases climbed to 3.95 lakh. The cases, the Bench noted, had gone up to 4.95 lakh on May 5, and the minimum requirement was 1,100 MT. “Hence, the HC order shows an extraordinarily well-calibrated approach... Prima facie , the government is under an obligation [to provide the oxygen],” Justice Chandrachud addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Mr. Mehta, who represents the Centre which has challenged the High Court order, said the issue was not about supply of oxygen to Karnataka. ‘Pan-Indian issue’ “The Centre is not and cannot be averse to that. I am only sharing a concern about a national problem... This is a pan-India issue. If every HC starts ‘judiciously’ examining what amount of oxygen should be supplied, etc., where would it lead to... The Centre and State should decide the allocation of oxygen. If every HC starts entertaining petitions for allocation of oxygen under Article 226 [of the Constitution], COVID management would become unworkable. There will be a complete lack of pandemic management. This [oxygen] is not an unlimited source, we are trying to distribute it equitably to all,” he argued. Justice Chandrachud said the amount of oxygen required for Karnataka was not arrived at by the High Court on its own, but based on a discussion between the State and the Centre. Besides, the HC had not precluded a resolution on oxygen allocation between the State and the Centre. Justice Shah said the minimum requirement of 1,162 MT was fixed as per the norms arrived at by the government itself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/karnataka-hc-judicious-in-ordering-oxygen-sc/article34510940.ece
08 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Stalin takes charge, rolls out aid for 2.07 cr. poor||DMK president M.K. Stalin, 68, was on Friday sworn in as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Governor Banwarilal Purohit administered the oath of office and secrecy to Mr. Stalin and 33 Ministers on the lawns of the Raj Bhavan. In keeping with Dravidian rationalist tradition, the DMK leader, who took oath as “Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin”, and his Cabinet colleagues took their oaths invoking their “conscience”. Soon after assuming office at Fort St. George, the new Chief Minister signed five files to implement major promises made in the DMK’s election manifesto. These included offering Rs. 4,000 as COVID-19 relief to family cardholders, free travel in city buses (ordinary) for women and a reduction in the retail price of Aavin milk by Rs. 3 per litre from May 16. An official release said the Chief Minister ordered the implementation of a financial assistance of Rs. 4,000 to each of the 2.07 crore rice ration card holders across the State, in view of the hardships they face due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The assistance would be provided in two instalments and the first instalment of Rs. 2,000 would be given in May. The State government would incur an expenditure of Rs. 4,153 crore towards this scheme. Given the virulent second wave of COVID-19, Mr. Stalin also announced that treatment in private hospitals would be covered for beneficiaries of the Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. The Chief Minister also ordered for the setting up of a mechanism to redress within 100 days all grievance petitions submitted to him in the run up to the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stalin-takes-charge-rolls-out-aid-for-207-cr-poor/article34510936.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||We mean business: SC to Centre on Delhi’s quota||The Supreme Court on Friday underlined the obligation of the Union government to comply with the order to supply 700 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to Delhi “every day”, saying “we mean business”. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah warned the Centre of forcing the court into taking “coercive action” against it by reneging on its promise in court to supply 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi, which is battling a devastating second wave of COVID-19.  The court’s comments came soon after senior advocate Rahul Mehra submitted that Delhi had received 86 MT of oxygen till 9 a.m. and another 16 MT was in transit.  The court referred to a tabulated chart detailing the Centre’s “comprehensive plan” for the allocation, supply and distribution of oxygen to the national capital. “You start by saying 700 MT and then as you go on, you bring caveats about containers coming in etc… We are not container drivers here. We want 700 MT every day and we mean business,” Justice Chandrachud addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre. Justice Chandrachud said he and Justice Shah had a discussion before the hearing on the issue and agreed that the court in its previous orders intended that Delhi should get 700 MT every day. “We did not mean that you supply 700 MT on one day. We meant you do it every day until we further examine the modalities. Please do not drive us to a situation where we have to be firm and take the coercive way. It is 700 MT every day, every single day,” Justice Chandrachud emphasised. Mr. Mehta said he would convey the court’s observations to the authorities concerned during the day. May 5 directive On May 5, the Supreme Court ordered the Centre to burn the midnight oil and prepare a “comprehensive plan” for the supply of 700 MT of life-saving oxygen to Delhi on a daily basis. The plan submitted by the Central government had to identify the sources of supply of oxygen to Delhi; the provisions for transport and logistical arrangements, including distribution points for oxygen. The court had noted that the lack of oxygen was causing “tremendous anxiety” in the Capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-mean-business-sc-to-centre-on-delhis-quota/article34511442.ece

She found herself helpless with no savings from the meagre income of her husband, an autorickshaw driver. The amount was needed urgently for three doses of Remedesivir, which the doctors said would cost at least Rs. 30,000 each. The hapless woman had no option but to pledge her mangalsutra ( wedding necklace) and the little gold she had. “I was crying all the way to the nearby pawnbroker, who said he would give only Rs. 1 lakh at an interest of 2.5% a month. I pleaded with him to give Rs. 1.2 lakh, but he reiterated his terms and refused to relent,” said Ms. Jyothi, fighting back tears when contacted by The Hindu . Fortunately for her husband, Madhusudhan Chary, two of his autorickshaw friends pitched in with Rs. 20,000, despite their financial constraints. Having exhausted all her resources, Ms. Jyothi is now dependent on help from friends and relatives as she nurses her husband back to health.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hefty-hospital-bills-lead-to-rush-at-usury-dens/article34510932.ece

VijayRaghavan said on Friday, stressing that, “If we take strong measures, the third COVID wave may not happen in all the places or indeed anywhere.” Dr. VijayRaghavan’s statement comes just two days after he said, “Third COVID wave is inevitable in India given the high levels of virus that is circulating. But it is not clear at what time scale this phase 3 will occur.” Speaking at a Health Ministry press conference, Dr. VijayRaghavan said preventing a third wave depends on how effectively the guidelines are implemented and followed. “Infections rise when the virus has the opportunity to infect humans.” Responding to a question on when the second wave, which has already infected lakhs and killed thousands, will ebb, Dr. VijayRaghavan said it has already started declining in some places. The number of cases and the positivity will decline, and there will be a lag in hospitalisation and mortality, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/second-wave-declining-third-can-be-prevented-scientist/article34510934.ece

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Finance Ministry not for lockdown||The second COVID-19 wave, which is spreading fast beyond the worst-affected districts of the country, could dent economic activity till June and expanding the vaccination pace was the “need of the hour”, the Finance Ministry said on Friday. It indicated that it was not in favour of a national lockdown. The Ministry said the policy response was in sync with the ‘global experience’ and included localised micro-containment measures, State-specific movement restrictions, mobilisation of health supplies and ramping up of health facililites. The impact of the current restrictions was evident in a decline in the Google mobility indicator to -37% in April 2021 from around -22% in March, the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry observed in its monthly economic report for April. “Global experience also suggests that economic impacts from subsequent waves are smaller than from the first as economies learn to ‘operate with COVID’. The increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective both in controlling the spread of Covid and boosting mobility,” it stated. “Recognizing vaccination as the crucial pillar to ‘Test, Track, Treat and Covid-appropriate behaviour’ strategy, the access to vaccines has been deregulated and opened to all persons above 18 years of age,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/finance-ministry-not-for-lockdown/article34510938.ece

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Hindu consolidation pays off for BJP||After wresting Assam from the Congress in 2016, the BJP was able to retain the State in the 2021 Assembly election, strengthening its eastern footprint. In 2016, the party consolidated Hindu votes in a State where elections were largely governed by its multiple ethnicities. The story after five years remains more or less the same, with religious identity yet again emerging as one of the key determinants for electors, but on a slightly muted level. Of course, the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey data indicate relatively high satisfaction with both the Central and State governments among voters and the absence of a strong anti-incumbency sentiment, but whether these favourable sentiments were driven by the religious divide remains a moot point. Though the Congress forged the Mahajot , a grand pre-election alliance with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and Left parties, the ruling alliance managed to defeat it. In fact, the Congress’s tie-up with the ‘Muslim party’ AIUDF seems to have helped the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) cause, helping it keep Hindu voters firmly on its side and wean away a small but sizeable chunk of Assamese Muslim voters. The two local parties, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal (RD), had a limited impact, and the latter could win just one seat in Upper Assam. Their influence was confined to Upper Assam. Religious polarisation, particularly Hindu consolidation, is one factor that helps in making sense of the election verdict. Over two-thirds of Hindus (67%) rallied behind the NDA (the proportion was 57% in the 2016 Assembly election for the current NDA). The Congress alliance, on the other hand, managed to secure only two of every 10 (19%) Hindu votes (down 13 percentage points since 2016). Given the religious profile of Assam, where the Hindu share in the State’s population is around 62%, this consolidation proved to be a decisive point once again. Further, the support for the BJP among Hindus cut across linguistic-ethnic differences and came both from the Assamese- and Bengali-speaking communities — 67% of Assamese Hindus and 74% of Bengali Hindus favoured the NDA this time, as opposed to 64% and 63%, respectively, in 2016. One of the major reasons why Hindus did not show much inclination towards the Mahajot was the Congress’s alliance with the AIUDF. Most Hindus in Lokniti’s post-poll survey were found to consider the AIUDF communal, as many as six of every 10 (57%) people surveyed. This also made a majority of them (58%) strongly oppose the Congress-AIUDF alliance. In fact, the survey found a major dilemma among Congress’s traditional Hindu supporters on this count — three of every 10 (30%) of them were found to be opposed to the Congress-AIUDF alliance, and around four-fifths of them ended up voting for the NDA. Interestingly, a plurality of Assamese Hindus also considered the BJP communal, but this was not a guiding factor in their vote choice. The Congress-AIUDF alliance, however, successfully managed to consolidate the votes of Muslims around itself. Overall, four-fifths of Muslims (81%) rallied behind the Mahajot . In previous elections, in the absence of an alliance between the two parties, Muslims were badly divided between the Congress and the AIUDF. This time, their votes came together, giving the alliance victories in many Muslim-concentrated seats. However, our survey found the consolidation to be far stronger among Bengali Muslims than Assamese Muslims. While as high as nine out of 10 Bengali Muslims backed the Mahajot , among Assamese Muslims, two-thirds backed it. Notably, a quarter of Assamese Muslims (24%) backed the NDA, and around 11% voted for the AJP-RD front and other parties and candidates. The fact that the AIUDF is a party primarily of Bengali Muslims coupled with the growing distance between indigenous Muslims and the so-called ‘Miya Muslims’ may have had a role to play in this. In fact, in our survey, on the communal-secular question, as many as two-fifths of Assamese Muslims considered the AIUDF to be communal. Interestingly, whereas in the Congress-contested seats, 16% of Muslims voted for the NDA, in AIUDF-contested seats, only 4% did. The shift was mainly among Assamese Muslims. One-fourth of Assamese Muslims (26%) voted for the NDA in the Congress-contested seats, as against 11% of Bengali Muslims. Most other explanations become only supplementary to this massive religious polarisation. Yet, it must be noted that there was an absence of any negative sentiment regarding the performance of the Sarbananda Sonowal government in the State and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The survey found that while 58% of voters reported satisfaction with the Sonowal-led BJP-Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) government in the State, 56% expressed satisfaction with the NDA government at the Centre. Dissatisfaction with the two governments was a good 20 percentage points less, at 34% and 38%, respectively. Once again, however, satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the government were also dependent on religion. Hindus were twice as likely to be satisfied with the State government as Muslims — 72% to 36%. The absence of any major dissatisfaction with the State government translated into a pro-incumbency sentimentOn being asked if the incumbent government should get another chance, more than two in five (43%) favoured the status quo, while 38% desired change. Not surprisingly, the NDA swept the pro-incumbency vote, securing about four-fifths of their support. Non-committed voters Another factor that may explain the NDA’s win was its ability to woo non-committed voters. While almost nine in 10 traditional supporters stood by their respective parties, the NDA managed to win over non-committed voters, just enough to ensure a marginal advantage. Also, two-thirds (63%) of voters did not count themselves as traditional supporters of any party; 43% of these voters backed the NDA, 4% more than the Mahajot . The power of having a ‘double-engine ki sarkar’ (having the same party’s government at the Centre as well as the State) was emphasised by the Prime Minister and other leaders time and again during the Assam election campaign. Over three-fifths (63%) agreed that for the State’s development, it was necessary to have the same party ruling at the Centre and in the State.  In sum, Assam, while joining West Bengal and Kerala in returning the incumbent, had probably a very different logic to that choice. What did not happen in West Bengal on a larger scale, Assam witnessed it for the second time in a row: the consolidation of the Hindu vote and as a corollary, the consolidation of the Muslim vote, too.

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Central Vista: SC tells petitioners to move HC for early hearing||The Supreme Court on Friday highlighted the “extremely urgent” concern raised by two Delhi residents over the ferrying of labourers to the Central Vista redevelopment site and back amid a devastating public health crisis, and permitted them to approach the Delhi High Court Chief Justice on Monday with a request to hear their case as “early as possible”. “We hope and trust that upon such request being made, the High Court would consider the same appropriately and pass necessary orders,” a Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari recorded in its order. The court suggested that the mention for an urgent hearing before the Delhi High Court Chief Justice on Monday could even be made jointly by the petitioners’ lawyer, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, and Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. The petitioners, Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi, had moved the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court adjourned the hearing of their case to May 17, ostensibly to “study” a judgment of the Supreme Court pronounced on January 5, allowing the Central Vista project. The Supreme Court said that since the case was already pending before the High Court, it did not want to enter into its merits. However, the Bench said the case could be heard by the High Court “as early as possible”. Humanitarian crisis Mr. Luthra said the workers were ferried by bus from Karol Bagh, Keerthi Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan. The work seemed to continue owing to a stringent deadline. “But how can construction be an essential activity when there is a public health crisis on? We are in a position that the caseload may peak by mid-May, and the HC keeps the case on May 17 to study a judgment? Please understand, this is a peculiar situation... HC adjourns to May 17 without notice... We are facing a humanitarian crisis. When human lives are concerned, government needs to protect.” From April 1 to May 3, the positivity rate had ‘shot up’ from 3.57% to about 30%,” he said. Mr. Luthra referred to how many who were near and dear were affected by the virus. “Today when the health system is broken... People are not getting beds...,” he said. Justice Saran said, “We are conscious of it. A different Bench is seized of this issue... Mr. Luthra, you can make comments about deaths, but we cannot, it may be taken otherwise...” ‘Stop construction’ Mr. Luthra referred to a Disaster Management Authority circular, which had directed construction activities, except where labourers are residing onsite, to be stopped. He said the petitioners were only concerned with the work on the Rajpath, Central Vista and garden stretches and no other. “The nation is considering a lockdown, IPL has been shut off. Despite the Centre’s great efforts to supply oxygen, there is an unprecedented spread of infection. On May 17, we would have reached the peak...,” he argued. Mr. Mehta objected to the special leave petition filed against an order of adjournment by the High Court. “It sets a bad precedent... Our HCs are functioning under great constraints... There are severally factually incorrect statements being made,” he submitted. However, disposing off the case, the Bench asked the lawyers to take their arguments to the High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-vista-sc-tells-petitioners-to-move-hc-for-early-hearing/article34510853.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccines bought first using PM CARES funds cost more||The first lot of vaccines was procured by the Centre using PM CARES funds at a rate higher than the subsequent rounds paid for with budgetary allocations, The Hindu has learnt from the response to a Right to Information request by a transparency activist. The Health Ministry response said that the initial 5.6 crore doses of Covishield were bought at a pre-tax price of Rs. 200 and one crore dose of Covaxin at Rs. 295, but Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan said both vaccines were, in fact, bought at around Rs. 200 only. Many factors This is higher than the Rs. 150 rate at which both vaccines are now sold to the Centre. Dr. Somanathan told The Hindu that bulk orders, advance payments and a lower demand situation had helped in negotiating for the lower rate, “which may not be replicable” for future orders by States or others. The difference in cost in the vaccines paid for by budgetary allocations and by PM CARES, which the Centre says is a non-governmental fund, came to light in the Health Ministry’s May 2 response to an RTI query filed by Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd). It said that initially the Government of India through PM CARES funds procured 5.6 crore doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India at the unit cost of Rs. 200 (plus 5% GST of Rs. 10) and one crore doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech at Rs. 295 (plus tax of Rs. 14.75). This round of vaccines was initially aimed at frontline and healthcare workers, but offtake was relatively poor. “However, at present, Government of India through Union Budget has procured the COVID-19 vaccines (COVISHILED 10 crores doses and COVAXIN 2 crores doses) at the unit cost of Rs. 157.50 including taxes (Rs. 150 + 5% GST),” said the RTI response, adding that an additional 11 crore doses of Covishield and 5.5 crore doses of Covaxin were also being procured at the Rs. 150 rate, in what it described as an “ongoing process”. Dr. Somanathan said that although the list price of the indigenously developed Covaxin was Rs. 295, the Centre had insisted that Bharat Biotech offer a discount to match the level of the foreign-developed, Indian- manufactured Covishield. Hence, both vaccines were bought at a price of approximately Rs. 200 per unit in the first round paid for by PM CARES funds, he said Asked for clarification, a Bharat Biotech spokesperson only pointed to Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan’s statement on January 12 that the company sold 38.5 lakh doses to the Centre at Rs. 295 per unit and gave 16.5 lakh doses for free as a special gesture, bringing the per unit price for a 55 lakh dose order to Rs. 206. Adar Poonawala, CEO, Serum Institute of India, did not respond to a text message for comment on the differences in price. Much larger order The second round of vaccines purchased through the Health Ministry budget came at the lower cost of Rs. 150 because it was a bulk order with a significant advance payment, said the Finance Secretary. “The second round, which was entirely from the government, had two elements. One, it was a much larger order. It is common in all kinds of manufacturing, including in vaccines and drugs, that larger orders get smaller prices, because there is a commitment to a larger quantity, and we are saying we’ll take this much at one go. And there was always a contemplation of and eventually, giving of an advance,” he said. In contrast, payment was only made after supplies were delivered in the case of the initial PM CARES order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccines-bought-first-using-pm-cares-funds-cost-more/article34510882.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||Centre must call all-party meet, says Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday urged the Union government to listen to suggestions offered by the States to bring the COVID-19 situation under control At a meeting of all MPs of the party to discuss the second wave of the pandemic, Ms. Gandhi sought their views and pointed out that tackling the crisis required an able, calm and visionary leadership. The nation was sinking under the weight of the government’s “indifference and incompetence”, she noted. She said: “Let us be absolutely clear — the system hasn’t failed. The Modi government has been unable to constructively channelise India’s many strengths and resources. I say this categorically — India is crippled by a political leadership today that has no empathy for the people. The government has failed the people of our country. “You are all well aware of the very many letters Dr. Manmohan Singh ji , former Congress president Rahul ji , and I have written to the Prime Minister in a spirit of constructive cooperation, giving very pointed and practical suggestions for action. I have personally been in touch with our Chief Ministers. They too have spoken to the Prime Minister and other Ministers concerned about the seriousness of the situation in their States. “Some of our colleagues have been regularly and quite effectively raising legitimate concerns and questions in the media. Unfortunately, these helpful initiatives have fallen on deaf ears. The government has made no meaningful response and continues to believe that it alone has the answers. The situation brooks no delay,” she said. The Congress firmly believed that fighting COVID-19 was not a “government versus us” battle but an “us versus corona” battle. This battle transcended political differences. This battle had to be fought together as a nation, she said. Congratulates leaders Ms. Gandhi congratulated the leaders who won in the recent Assembly polls. She said: “Friends, in closing, may I on your behalf congratulate Mamata ji and Thiru M.K. Stalin and the Left for their handsome victories. Most unfortunately, our own performance in all the States was very disappointing and if I may say, unexpectedly so. The CWC is meeting shortly to review the results but it goes without saying that we as a party collective must draw the appropriate lessons from this setback in a spirit of humility and honesty. “India is in the grip of a deadly health disaster. Thousands have died and millions are scrambling to access basic healthcare, life-saving medicines, oxygen, and vaccines. It is heartbreaking to see people battling for their lives in hospitals, on roads, waiting in vehicles, far too many for want of any medical help at all. “The government’s own empowered groups and its National Task Force for COVID-19 had warned it that a second wave was imminent and urged it to plan and prepare for it. In that spirit, as a first step, I believe that the Modi government must urgently call an all-party meeting on the COVID-19 situation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-must-call-all-party-meet-says-sonia/article34510863.ece
08 May 2021||Chennai,||Single-day toll crosses 4,000 for the first time||India recorded more than 4,000 new COVID-19 related deaths for the first time on a single day, with 4,047 fresh fatalities as of 9.30 p.m. on Friday. The country also recorded 3,95,013 new COVID-19 cases on Friday. India has so far reported a total of 2,18,79,357 cases and 2,38,113 deaths. Maharashtra reported 54,022 infections, followed by Karnataka (48,781), and Kerala (38,460). Maharashtra also recorded 898 casualties, followed by Karnataka (592) and U.P. (372). The figures do not include cases and deaths from Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily figures. About 24.59 lakh daily vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Friday, about 4.4 lakh doses higher than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. However, the number of daily doses has been on a declining trend since mid-April. The seven-day average of daily doses administered by May 6 stood at 18.18 lakh, significantly lower than the 31.31 lakh recorded a month ago. Nearly 18.26 lakh tests were conducted on Thursday (the results for which were made available on Friday), about one lakh lower than the previous day. As of May 7, India’s test positivity rate (cases/tests) is about 22.7%, which means that about one in five tests is turning positive. According to the Health Ministry, positivity has exceeded 15% in 24 States, is between 5% and 15% in nine States, and less than 5% in three States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/single-day-toll-crosses-4000-for-the-first-time/article34510886.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul reiterates need for national lockdown||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that a national lockdown had become “almost inevitable as the COVID tsunami continues to ravage the country unabated”. Assuring the Prime Minister of his party’s support, Mr. Gandhi said various stakeholders must be taken into confidence so that “all can work together to safeguard India” since otherwise it could become a fertile ground for the virus to mutate and transform into a more contagious and dangerous form. It was absolutely critical to track the virus and its mutations using genome sequencing as well as its disease patterns, assess the efficacy of all vaccines against all new mutations and be transparent about the findings to the rest of the world, he noted. The government’s “lack of a coherent COVID strategy, clear vaccination policy, hubris in prematurely declaring victory allowed the virus to grow exponentially and made India a dangerous place where the disease is growing explosively,” he stated. “I am aware that you are concerned about the economic impact of a lockdown. Inside and outside India, the human cost of allowing this virus to continue its march unimpeded will result in many more tragic consequences for our people than any purely economic calculations your advisers are suggesting,” he said. To avoid a repeat of last year — when lakhs of migrant workers were forced to travel on foot — Mr. Gandhi suggested that the government should ensure a proper transportation policy and offer financial and food support to the vulnerable sections. “The pandemic has demonstrated that our size, genetic diversity and complexity make India a fertile ground for the virus to rapidly mutate, transforming itself into a more contagious and more dangerous form. The double and triple mutant strains that we are currently grappling with are only the beginning, I fear. Allowing the uncontrollable spread of this virus in our country will be devastating not only for our people but also for the rest of the world,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-reiterates-need-for-national-lockdown/article34510890.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||CAA, NRC evoke mixed sentiments||In both Assam and West Bengal, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was a contentious issue. However, unlike in West Bengal, CAA faced bipartisan resistance in Assam, with calls for the cut-off date to be clocked back to 1971, as agreed in the Assam Accord of 1986. For the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the debate was centred on concerns around the process, rather than the concept itself. Just 3% of respondents in the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey mentioned CAA/NRC as the most important issue in the election. Almost one-third (30%) of respondents mentioned ‘development’ as the key issue. While the CAA-NRC might not have come up as the most popular issue, a majority of voters (53%) opposed the CAA. There was a 10-percentage advantage to Mahajot among the ones against the law, while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by 30% votes among those backing the CAA. Clearly, the NDA was successful in ensuring that CAA does not become a poll issue. As a result, even among opponents of the law, NDA polled 38% votes. Even though opposition to CAA was high across both Hindus and Muslims, the latter were more likely to be against it, with 61% reporting opposition as against 47% of Hindu voters. Across ethnicities, Assamese Muslims recorded the highest opposition, with three-fourths (73%) against it, followed by Bengali Muslims (59%), Assamese Hindus (51%) and Bengali Hindus (40%). It’s possible that the BJP sensed the dissatisfaction among voters regarding the CAA and steered away from making it the poll plank. In contrast, for the NRC, as high as three in four respondents reported support, as against one in 10 who opposed it. Overall, a large proportion of respondents, irrespective of religion, said they were satisfied with the way NRC was implemented in the State. Again proving to be a divider, among people who were satisfied with the process, the Mahajot trailed behind the NDA by 12% votes, while among those who recorded dissatisfaction, it enjoyed an advantage of 22% votes. The dissatisfaction was greater among Bengali Muslims (34%) and Assamese Hindus (27%). Notably, over half (51%) of dissatisfied Assamese Hindus still backed the NDA, but among the rest, the votes were split between the Mahajot (19%) and the Assam Jatiya Parishad-Raijor Dal (AJP-RD) alliance (25%), with the latter emerging as a more favourable choice while voting. The ‘infiltrator/refugee’ narrative of the NDA, particularly targeting the Badruddin Ajmal-led-All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), a Congress ally, perhaps explains this shift to the AJP-RD front. Two-thirds (63%) of respondents still consider foreigners’ issue important, while 16% think that it has been blown out of proportion. This view was more prevalent among Assamese Hindus (75%) and Muslims (72%) than Bengali Hindus (52%) and Muslims (50%), strengthening the ‘insiders-outsiders’ debate. A solution seems far, as only 39% of respondents thought that the issue can be resolved upon updating the NRC, while 33% opposed that idea.

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Four-digit security code in CoWIN portal from today||In order to minimise errors and inconvenience caused to citizens registering for COVID-19 vaccination, the CoWIN system will introduce a new feature — a four-digit security code — in its portal from May 8, the Health Ministry has said. “It has been noticed in some instances that citizens who booked their appointment for COVID vaccination through the CoWIN portal did not actually go for vaccination on the scheduled date but received a notification through SMS that a vaccine dose has been administered to them. Upon examination, it has been found to occur largely on account of the vaccinator wrongly marking the citizen as vaccinated, an instance of a data entry error by the vaccinator,” the Ministry stated. This new feature will be applicable only for citizens who book online for a vaccination slot. The four-digit code will be printed in the appointment acknowledgement and will not be known to the vaccinator. Before administering the vaccine dose, the verifier/vaccinator will ask for the four-digit code and enter it in the CoWIN system to correctly record the vaccination status. The code will also be available in the confirmation SMS sent to the beneficiary after successful booking of appointment. The appointment acknowledgement can be saved on the phone for easy retrieval. “This will ensure that for citizens who have booked an online appointment, the data entries regarding vaccination status of a citizen, are recorded correctly when they avail the services at the centre where they have booked the appointment,” said the Ministry. It added that this would also reduce possibilities of impersonation. Advisory for vaccination The Ministry has also issued an advisory for those coming in for vaccination. It noted that citizens must carry a copy (digital or physical) of their appointment and/or the registered mobile phone with appointment confirmation SMS, so that the security code can be furnished for easy completion of vaccination recording process. It is also advised that the security code is furnished to the verifier/vaccinator before the vaccine dose is administered. “This is important as the digital certificate would be generated after the vaccine dose administration,” said the Ministry. Citizens should get a confirmation SMS after the process. “The confirmation SMS indicates that the vaccination process has been completed successfully and the digital certificate has been generated. If one does not get the confirmation SMS, one should get in touch with the vaccinator/ vaccination centre in-charge,” it stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-digit-security-code-in-cowin-portal-from-today/article34510888.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Welfare measures not a decisive factor||Contrary to what was reported in some sections of the media, the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey data do not find welfare schemes to have been a decisive factor for the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) performance in the Assam Assembly election. The survey indicates that not many households benefited from the State’s welfare schemes. This was seen when the names of at least nine schemes launched by the State were read out to the respondents — nearly half of the households said they had not benefited from any of them and about 42% said they benefited from a scheme or two. However, among beneficiaries, the NDA enjoyed a comfortable edge. The only schemes that had a fair amount of beneficiaries were the ‘Orunodoi’ (a fixed monthly sum to one woman in the household) and the ‘Chah bagichar dhan puraskar mela’ (financial aid to tea garden workers). About a quarter of voters (23%) claimed that the Orunodoi scheme was helpful to them; of those, 59% voted for the NDA, 27% more than Mahajot . Among non-beneficiaries of Orunodoi, NDA lagged by 9%. Further, among those who claimed to have received cash in their bank accounts, the NDA had an edge of 9% votes over the Mahajot , while among those who did not receive cash, it lagged by 7% votes.

08 May 2021||Mumbai,||Veteran composer Vanraj Bhatia dead||Vanraj Bhatia, who composed music for parallel cinema classics such as Bhumika , 36 Chowringhee Lane and Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and gave lilt to ad jingles remembered decades later, died at his home on Friday, according to a friend. He was 94. “I was in regular touch with him. His caretaker informed me around 9 a.m. that he has passed away. He had dementia and arthritis. He was bedridden for over a month,” music historian and friend Pavan Jha said. Bhatia lived with his caretaker at his apartment in Rungta Housing Colony in Mumbai. A legend in the music world, Bhatia leaves behind a prodigious legacy of compositions in films as varied as Ajooba and Ankur , television serials as well as about 6,000 jingles, including the famousLa Lalalatrack for Liril soap that still strikes a chord and the ad for Dulux paint. The composer’s mastery is visible in the opening credits of the popular Doordarshan serialBharat Ek Khoj, which begins with a shloka from the Vedas. “He provided the soundtrack of our childhoods in the 1980s and 1990s. With him, we have lost a legend,” lyricist-writer Varun Grover said.  His last years were spent as a recluse, said industry insiders. Born into a Kutchi business family in Mumbai, Bhatia started training in music from a young age. After his post-graduation from Elphinstone College in 1949, Bhatia studied at the Royal Academy of Music, London, where he graduated with a gold medal in 1954. Bhatia started his professional journey by composing music for advertisements. He made his cinema debut with director Shyam Benegal's first film Ankur in 1974. It was the beginning of one of the most fruitful collaborations in Hindi cinema music, including Manthan and Mandi . Bhatia went on to become the go-to composer for directors in the new wave of Indian cinema music of the 1970s and 80s.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/veteran-composer-vanraj-bhatia-dead/article34510858.ece

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Substantial allocation for vaccination, says Puri||Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry Hardeep Puri on Friday hit back at the Congress, saying the government had allocated nearly “twice the amount” of the Rs. 20,000 crore to be spent for the Central Vista project for the vaccination programme. The government’s decision to go ahead with the construction of a new Parliament and the Central Vista Avenue amid the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn the ire of the Opposition. In a series of tweets, Mr. Puri said: “Congress’s discourse on Central Vista is bizarre.” “Cost of Central Vista is about Rs. 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs. 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities.” Hundreds of projects He said hundreds of projects were being executed by various government departments and that governance had not come to a standstill. “Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It’s only the Congress that’s obsessed about it, nobody else,” he said. It was only the contracts for the new Parliament building and the revamp of the Central Vista Avenue that had been awarded for Rs. 862 crore and Rs. 477 crore respectively so far, while the other components of the plan would be spread over many years. The Minister said the Congress wanted to distract people “from monumental governance failures in their States by spreading lies”.  He accused the Congress of hypocrisy, saying the party and its allies were also spending on new projects such as an MLA hostel in Maharashtra and a Legislative Assembly building in Chhattisgarh. Congress leaders had raised the demand for a new Parliament building during the UPA government’s rule, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/substantial-allocation-for-vaccination-says-puri/article34510846.ece

He announced free travel for all working women and girls pursuing higher education on board government buses (ordinary fare) in cities across the State from Saturday. He also sanctioned the reduction in Aavin milk prices by Rs. 3 a litre, and ordered Rs. 1,200 crore to effect the reduction in prices. The Chief Minister also ordered for the setting up of a mechanism to redress within 100 days all grievance petitions submitted to him in the run up to the Assembly election and appointed IAS officer Shilpa Prabhakar Satish to head the division. Though the oath-taking ceremony was planned as a low-key affair, there was a substantial increase in the number of invitees and in the process the COVID-19 physical distancing norms were not strictly followed. Mr. Stalin, incidentally, is the first son of a former Chief Minister to occupy the top post in Tamil Nadu. Immediately after assuming office, he tweeted thanking the people for providing an opportunity to him — a native of Tiruvarur on the banks of Cauvery— to serve the State. In a first in the State, the swearing-in witnessed bonhomie between the ruling party and the main Opposition party. The AIADMK, represented by former Deputy Chief Minister O.

More Benches would be constituted for the second and third parts of the holidays until the court re-opens on June 28. The Vacation Benches will hear the cases virtually. The decision to have two separate Division Benches sitting in a week during vacations is significant considering the fact that petitions may be filed concerning COVID management and connected human rights issues. “Under Rule 6 of Order II of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India has nominated Division Benches for hearing extremely urgent miscellaneous matters during the summer vacation for the period (first part) from May 10, 2021 to May 25, 2021,” the SC circular said. The Benches will assemble twice every week on Tuesdays and Fridays. A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and B.R.

08 May 2021||Lucknow,||Journalist Kappan shifted back to Mathura Jail||The family of Malayalam journalist Siddique Kappan, who is incarcerated in Uttar Pradesh over sedition charges, have alleged that he was shifted back to Mathura Jail from AIIMS, Delhi, in a secretive manner, and that they were denied access to meet him during his stay at the hospital. They claimed that Mr. Kappan was shifted back to Mathura without being fully treated for COVID-19. Shailendra Maitreya, Superintendent of the Mathura Jail, confirmed that Mr. Kappan was brought back to the prison on Thursday night and kept in an isolation ward. Mr. Kappan, who tested positive for the coronavirus on April 21, is positive, said Mr. Maitreya and his lawyer Wills Matthew. Mr. Kappan was shifted to AIIMS hospital after the Supreme Court instructed the Uttar Pradesh government to transfer him to a hospital in Delhi for proper treatment. He was initially admitted to the KM Medical College in Mathura where his family alleged he was subjected to mental torture. Speaking through an acquaintance, Mr. Kappan’s wife Raihanath said on Thursday night that she was informed by a source that her husband had been discharged and shifted back to Mathura. She said she had not been informed about it by the officials. Ms. Raihanath and her son had travelled from Kerala to Delhi in hope of meeting Mr. Kappan at the hospital, but she said they were denied access. On Friday, Mr. Kappan spoke to his wife on telephone. “He called her and said he was kind of fine but the treatment had not been completed,” said an acquaintance of Ms. Raihanath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/journalist-kappan-shifted-back-to-mathura-jail/article34510855.ece

For these desperate families, who have no other source, gold has become the mythical Sanjeevani (panacea) to raise the much-needed funds for medical treatment. Similar is the story of Yalamanchili Ramu (name changed) from Gayathri Hill who sold 30 tola (one tola equals 10 grams) of family jewellery for the treatment of his mother, daughter and himself who were admitted to a corporate hospital in Secunderabad. After a week, Ramu ran out of cash and had left with no other option but to dispose of the gold. “Selling land is a long process which might take months or at least weeks and gold has come to the rescue of my family. We paid more than Rs. 10 lakh for treatment of three persons,” he said. Enquiries with pawnbrokers and gold loan companies reveal there is a steady footfall of desperate people to pledge their gold ornaments. “Yes, for the past one month there is a steady increase of people who are pledging gold ornaments for treatment. When they say they want money for treatment, I’m giving money at a very low rate of interest,” said a jeweller from Secunderabad. On Thursday, Kavitha, a nurse from Regimental Bazaar pledged two tola of gold jewellery with this jeweller to support her relatives, who helped with her husband’s treatment a few years ago. When contacted, a representative of a leading gold loan company said they were offering gold loans for 14% interest per annum, and the interest rate varies if the loan amount is huge. “If the loan amount is more than Rs. 5 lakh, we offer a interest of 12%, and one has to renew the loan within 12 months to avoid auction of their gold,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hefty-hospital-bills-lead-to-rush-at-usury-dens/article34510864.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Karnataka HC judicious in ordering oxygen: SC||Mr. Mehta, who represents the Centre which has challenged the High Court order, said the issue was not about supply of oxygen to Karnataka. ‘Pan-Indian issue’ “The Centre is not and cannot be averse to that. I am only sharing a concern about a national problem... This is a pan-India issue. If every HC starts ‘judiciously’ examining what amount of oxygen should be supplied, etc., where would it lead to... The Centre and State should decide the allocation of oxygen. If every HC starts entertaining petitions for allocation of oxygen under Article 226 [of the Constitution], COVID management would become unworkable. There will be a complete lack of pandemic management. This [oxygen] is not an unlimited source, we are trying to distribute it equitably to all,” he argued. Justice Chandrachud said the amount of oxygen required for Karnataka was not arrived at by the High Court on its own, but based on a discussion between the State and the Centre. Besides, the HC had not precluded a resolution on oxygen allocation between the State and the Centre. Justice Shah said the minimum requirement of 1,162 MT was fixed as per the norms arrived at by the government itself. At one point, an exasperated Mr. Mehta said “we are then ready to give the entire supply [of oxygen] and let it be distributed through the High Courts”. Justice Chandrachud intervened at this point, saying the top court was considering the setting up of an allocation committee for supply of oxygen to the States equitably and as per their individual needs. “We are forming a committee and till then the HCs cannot shut their eyes,” he said. Justice Chandrachud said the judges, including Karnataka Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, who passed the order in question, were human beings sensitive to what was happening around them. “They have seen the deaths in Chamarajanagar and Kalburgi...

We want 700 MT every day and we mean business,” Justice Chandrachud addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre. Justice Chandrachud said he and Justice Shah had a discussion before the hearing on the issue and agreed that the court in its previous orders intended that Delhi should get 700 MT every day. “We did not mean that you supply 700 MT on one day. We meant you do it every day until we further examine the modalities. Please do not drive us to a situation where we have to be firm and take the coercive way. It is 700 MT every day, every single day,” Justice Chandrachud emphasised. Mr. Mehta said he would convey the court’s observations to the authorities concerned during the day. On May 5, the Supreme Court ordered the Centre to burn the midnight oil and prepare a “comprehensive plan” for the supply of 700 MT of life-saving oxygen to Delhi on a daily basis. The plan submitted by the Centre had to identify the sources of supply of oxygen to Delhi; the provisions for transport and logistical arrangements, including distribution points for oxygen. The court had noted that the lack of oxygen was causing “tremendous anxiety” in the capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-mean-business-sc-tells-centre-on-delhis-quota/article34510866.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||FinMin not for lockdown||The impact of the current restrictions was evident in a decline in the Google mobility indicator to -37% in April 2021 from around -22% in March, the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry observed in its monthly economic report for April. “Global experience also suggests that economic impacts from subsequent waves are smaller than from the first as economies learn to ‘operate with COVID’. The increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective both in controlling the spread of Covid and boosting mobility,” it stated. “The second wave of COVID-19 has posed a downside risk to economic activity in the first quarter of FY 2021-22. However, there are reasons to expect a muted economic impact as compared to the first wave. Learning to ‘operate with COVID-19’, as borne by international experience, provides a silver lining of economic resilience amidst the second wave,” it noted.  “The need of the hour is to expand vaccination at a fast pace,” the Ministry urged, in order to cope with the downside risks to the economy due to growing infections and consequent restrictions. Rapid vaccination “At this juncture, rapid vaccination lends a ray of hope. April 2021 saw a doubling of global vaccination rates and a concomitant lowering of average transmission rates in countries with high vaccination rates. With vaccines doubly effective in battling the spread and shielding the economy, global cooperation is critical to ensuring availability of vaccines in all countries and addressing inter-country disparities in vaccination rates at the earliest,” it said. Within India, concerns about people refusing to vaccinate have moderated though States with large populations like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as well as large urban settlements such as Haryana and Delhi continue to be a problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finmin-not-for-lockdown/article34510867.ece

He only spoke his ‘Mann Ki Baat’. It would have been better if he had talked business and listened about the issues,” Mr. Soren tweeted. Sources close to Mr. Soren said the Chief Minister reflected what the general public thought about the deteriorating COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s failure to protect lives. However, according to political observers, Mr. Soren was upset over the continued neglect of Jharkhand. At the onset of the second wave of pandemic, Mr. Soren requested Mr. Modi for availing of the services of doctors and paramedics of the Central paramilitary force deployed in Jharkhand. However, the professionals were yet to be made available to the Jharkhand government. In vaccine distribution also, the mineral-rich State claimed it was being treated unfairly.

08 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Koyambedu merchants want business hours extended||The new restrictions curtailing the working hours of retail vegetable shops since Thursday has had a cascading effect on sales at the Koyambedu wholesale market, according to traders. Merchants at the market say the number of retailers visiting has dropped by 40% to 50% after the new restrictions came into force. They want the State government to consider an extension of timings by two hours for retail vegetables and fruits outlets. Less time for purchases S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Periyar Market Licensed Merchants’ Association, said retailers are left with less time to purchase perishable goods from the wholesale market. They have to wind up purchases by early morning and often have only two or three hours left to carry out business till noon. “Sales dropped in the Koyambedu market on Friday as many retailers who had stock left from the previous day avoided visits,” he said. Merchants said that trucks from places, such as Nellore and Rajamahendravaram in Andhra Pradesh, find it tough to load goods in vehicles as the market’s working hours are limited to noon. G.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Associations of Koyambedu Periyar Market, said that though the wholesale market is open till noon, many retailers finish business by 6 a.m. to reach their outlets. About 5%-10% of the produce is getting wasted as there are no takers. No wastage “Normally, there is no wastage in the market in May owing to demand. The prices of most vegetables are within Rs. 20 a kg as only 30% to 40% of the sales are being carried out,” he said. The Federation plans to make a representation to the government to increase the working hours of retail outlets by two hours to cope with the loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-merchants-want-business-hours-extended/article34511053.ece

08 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Better outcomes in later phase of pandemic, says study||A single-centre, hospital-based study from Chennai has shown that the later phase of the pandemic showed better outcomes versus the early group. It also concurred with other studies that late evaluations and presence of co-morbidities meant worse disease. The findings were published in Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health , the official journal of the Indian Clinical Epidemiology Network. The paper by Prithvi Mohandas et al from MIOT International Hospital, a referral centre in Chennai, showed results similar to those seen in other studies that are available on COVID-19 in respect of clinical presentation and prognosis. The primary endpoint was stable discharge from hospital/patient recovery or death. Associations between risk factors and co-morbidities were analysed. “We found a difference in the incidence of disease and mortality between the early and late phases of the pandemic, indicating better awareness and disease management during the later phase of the pandemic in this study,” the authors have recorded. The association between the period of admission (early vs late) and death was significant; the proportion of deaths was higher during the pandemic’s early period. The understanding of the pathogenesis, control, and treatment modalities for COVID-19 has improved over time and could have led to the possible reduction in severity and deaths during the later phase. In comparison with other hospital-based studies, this series of patients, admitted between April 8, 2020 and August 7, 2020, appears to have had a lower mortality rate for COVID-19, the paper recorded. Co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder were the risk factors for poor prognosis. Severity of disease Further, in severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, abnormal radiological discoveries were found to correlate with the severity of the disease. Intensive care unit admission and ventilatory support were frequently required for severe cases. In the absence of preventive measures and evolving treatment modalities based on the current understanding, strict hygienic practices and appropriate protocols must be followed. Dr. Mohandas argued, “Also considering that MIOT is a referral hospital, the number of sick patients referred are higher versus secondary or tertiary care hospitals. This was one of the largest studies conducted in south India during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed the outcome based on the early and late phases of the pandemic as MIOT was one of the first hospitals to dedicate beds and personnel from the beginning of this pandemic for COVID-19 patients.”  This was one of the largest studies conducted in south India during the COVID-19 pandemic Prithvi MohandasMIOT International Hospital||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/better-outcomes-in-later-phase-of-pandemic-study/article34511067.ece
08 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Patients fleeced as demand for drugs goes up||Like last year, non-availability of drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, hoarding and illegal sale of drugs have surfaced in many parts of Tamil Nadu. Relatives of patients are travelling far and wide to Chennai to get Remdesivir, while a number of them are paying exorbitant rates to get the drugs. The number of people testing positive for COVID-19 and requiring hospitalisation is on the rise across the State. In such a situation, drugs such as Remdesivir are unavailable in a number of private hospitals, and the growing demand has led to blackmarketing. A patient from Tiruchi was instructed by a doctor to travel to Chennai to buy Remdesivir at the counter established at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. “Why can’t they have such counters across all districts?” the patient’s attender asked. They were told that the counter dispensed only 500 vials a day, and since their token number was 526, they were asked to return the next day. “We were unable to wait. So, we returned to Tiruchi and paid Rs. 12,000 per vial of Remdesivir,” she said. “Apart from paying a huge amount, we also put ourselves at risk of contracting the infection while travelling to Chennai and waiting in line,” she added. Rs. 1 lakh for 6 vials A volunteer who has been working to help procure Remdesivir and other medication for patients in Tiruchi said that while six vials of Remdesivir should cost Rs. 15,000-Rs. 20,000, hospitals that had stocked the medicine were charging up to Rs. 1 lakh. In Madurai, there is a shortage in the availability of Remedesivir and Tocilizumab across government and private hospitals. Sources in the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) said though the government was supplying medicines to the hospital, it was still not sufficient to meet the growing demand. J. Alexander Romario, a resident of Dindigul, has admitted his uncle at the GRH and his father at a private hospital in Madurai for COVID-19 treatment. “Both of them have been severely infected and are under oxygen support. But both the hospitals say that there is no availability of Remedesivir. While I tried sourcing the medicine from a few friends in Chennai, all my efforts have turned futile,” he said. Black market The growing demand has resulted in medicines being sold in the black market at exorbitant rates. According to sources, a vial of Remedesvir was sold at around Rs. 10,000 in the black market. A.K. Sivakumar, senior general manager of Devadoss Hospital, said that although they were able to procure medicines from the suppliers, there was a delay in obtaining these medicines. Varun Ramamurthy, consultant intensivist, Corona Care team, Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute, said that many family members of COVID-19 patients were insisting on providing these drugs to patients even when it was not necessary. No shortage Sources in the Health Department in Coimbatore said that availability of Remdesivir had improved in government and private hospitals across the district with no reports of acute shortage surfacing in the past week. Each unit of Remdesivir was being sold for Rs. 3,490 in the district. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) is expected to soon establish a counter in Coimbatore to sell drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir. No complaints of hoarding or blackmarketing were reported in Coimbatore district so far. Regarding the imported drug Tocilizumab, the sources said that TNMSC ordered the allocation of this drug to 19 private institutions on Wednesday, of which five were in Coimbatore. These hospitals were allocated six units of Tocilizumab each. The TNMSC has ordered the hospitals to procure Tocilizumab after paying Rs. 33,956.44 per vial by Saturday, according to the sources. Counter at Salem The Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem has sufficient stock of Remdesivir, but attenders of patients in some private hospitals in the district travel to Chennai to procure medicines from the KMC. A sales counter would soon be established at Kumaramangalam Hospital to avoid this trouble. Officials of the Drugs Control Department said they were closely monitoring the movement of every vial of Remdesivir in the State. “There is no Remdesivir manufacturing in Tamil Nadu as of date. It is supplied from States, such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. The drugs are distributed to the stockists, and again, the inspectors conduct a check on the stock received, distributed and stock in hand,” an official said.

He has been Collector in many districts and the Commissioner of Economics and Statistics, and is known for efforts in boosting tourism in the State. Mr. Udhayachandran, who was until recently the Commissioner of Archaeology, is known for his genuine interest in Tamil literature, history and archaeology. It was during his tenure as Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission that it incorporated technology into conducting exams for candidates. As Madurai Collector, the 1995-batch officer was credited for his efforts to successfully conduct local body polls after a decade in Pappapatti, Keeripatti and Nattarmangalam village panchayats, where caste Hindus had refused to accept Dalits being elected as panchayat presidents. Helping fight COVID-19 Mr. Umanath, who was the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC), is credited for efficiently planning ahead for building the oxygen capacity in hospitals and getting testing kits and drugs in time to help combat COVID-19 better. He was also the Coimbatore Collector when the erstwhile DMK government held the World Classical Tamil Conference in 2010. Mr. Shanmugam was posted as the Director of Museums. During his stint as the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu FibreNet Corporation Limited, he refused to allow political interference in his functioning. As Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, he ensured that law and order problems in the Perumbakkam tenements were resolved. An alumna of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Ms. George was the Collector of Ariyalur district and the Joint Secretary (Protocol) in the Public Department during the AIADMK regime under then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. Ms. George has also served as the Commissioner and Director of Industries and Commerce. Ms. Satish was earlier Tirunelveli Collector and was in the news when she chose a government-run anganwadi for her child. She has worked as Deputy Commissioner (Education), Greater Chennai Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/irai-anbu-made-chief-secretary-4-secretaries-to-assist-cm/article34511040.ece
08 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Allocate more oxygen to T.N.’||Citing the increasing demand for oxygen in Tamil Nadu given the number of people testing positive for COVID-19, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday evening wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking the latter’s intervention in revising orders to provide oxygen support to Tamil Nadu. He also requested the Centre to provide at least 20 ISO cryogenic containers and trains to transport oxygen to the State. In his first letter to the Prime Minister after assuming office as the Chief Minister, Mr. Stalin drew Mr. Modi’s attention to the crisis in Tamil Nadu over the availability of medical oxygen. While Tamil Nadu’s daily consumption of medical oxygen was around 440 MT and it was projected to increase by another 400 MT in two weeks, the National Oxygen Plan had allocated just 220 MT to the State. “Since this is untenable, our officers were in discussion with officials of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on May 1 and 2, and it was agreed that at least 476 MT of medical oxygen would be provided to the State immediately. However, this order has not been issued yet, creating supply constraints to hospitals,” Mr. Stalin said. During an emergency meeting of officials of the DPIIT with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala on May 6 over the sharply dwindling stock of liquid oxygen in Tamil Nadu, it was agreed that 40 MTs would be allocated to Tamil Nadu from INOX, Kanjikode (Kerala), for at least four days. It was also decided that 60 MTs from Praxair, Sriperumbudur (Linde Saint Gobain), would be allocated. It was also decided that medium-term requirements would be met and 120 MTs would be provided from SAIL and Linde, Rourkela. The revised allotment orders were still awaited, he said. “The availability of oxygen in Tamil Nadu is critical and there was an unfortunate incident of 13 deaths in Chengalpattu two days ago. We request your kind intervention to get the revised orders issued, and provide full support to Tamil Nadu in this hour of crisis,” he said. He requested the Centre to provide at least 20 ISO cryogenic containers and trains to transport oxygen to Tamil Nadu. “I would like to assure you my full support and cooperation to your unstinted efforts to tackle this unprecedented pandemic,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allocate-more-oxygen-to-tn/article34511049.ece

Stalin said on Friday that his government had to take measures on a war footing to increase the number of beds and check the spread of COVID-19. He asked officials to ramp up bed capacity and the availability of oxygen and medicines. At his first meeting with the Collectors, police officers and medical experts, he said experts projected that cases in the State, which now averaged 25,000 a day, were likely to go up in the next couple of weeks. “Only if the spread of the virus is contained, will we be able to reduce the number of deaths and the load on medical infrastructure. Our government has come to power at a time when we are facing severe challenges, and we have a responsibility to protect the lives and livelihood of the Tamil people,” he said. The Chief Minister said he had a responsibility to support the officials fighting the pandemic. Doctors, nurses and other medical professionals were working hard to save lives. “Chennai city, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tirunelveli are seeing a high case load. This has to be controlled; only then will the number of deaths come down. Officials working in these areas must work diligently and ramp up medical infrastructure,” he said. Mr. Stalin also asked the officials to increase the rate of vaccination, especially in these districts. He advised those aged above 45, who were at an increased risk of hospitalisation and death, to come forward and get themselves vaccinated. He advised officials to make sure that all details were shared with the government so that issues could be resolved. “Be transparent in sharing information about needs, shortcomings, what the government needs to do. Only if we face the truth, we can find solutions to issues,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/urgent-steps-needed-to-increase-beds-stalin/article34511032.ece

Alagiri welcomed Mr. Stalin’s first five announcements after taking charge as Chief Minister. He said the new Cabinet of the DMK government has the unenviable task of handling the COVID-19 pandemic at a time when cases were increasing in the State. “We have the confidence that Mr. Stalin will tackle the situation on a war-footing. 95% of oxygen beds are full in the State. There is a situation where the number of oxygen beds have to be increased,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not bothered about the fact that only 2% of people who had got their first dose of vaccine were able to get their second dose. He questioned the allocation of vaccines for various States and asked why Mr. Modi was favouring Gujarat over the other States, questioning whether he was the Prime Minister of India or the Prime Minister of Gujarat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-welcomes-stalins-first-5-announcements/article34511050.ece
08 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK meet inconclusive over a Leader of Oppostion||A meeting of newly-elected AIADMK legislators held on Friday to choose the Leader of the Opposition turned stormy with supporters of party coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami hurling charges against each other. Both leaders are learnt to have staked claim for the important post. The meeting at the party headquarters remained inconclusive and the two leaders have called for a second meeting of MLAs at 9.30 a.m. on May 10 to decide the issue. A prolonged quarrel between two sections of the partymen outside the party head office suggested internal unrest. Supporters of Mr. Palaniswami, who was the AIADMK’s Chief Ministerial candidate, believe he should be the Leader of the Opposition as the party had performed well in western Tamil Nadu. However, Mr. Panneerselvam’s supporters felt the party fared poorly in other parts due to wrong policies of Mr. Palaniswami when he was Chief Minister. Sources said even as party MLAs arrived, a few senior leaders met separately and held a discussion for over two hours. A senior leader said, “We will resolve all issues amicably.” Political analyst P. Ramajayam said, “The issue of dual leadership has always been problematic, especially for a party like AIADMK, which was efficiently led by one strong leader.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-unable-to-decide-on-leader-of-opposition-post/article34511066.ece

By bagging the award for 2021 for the paper ‘ Why do Modic Changes Result in Poor Clinical Outcomes? – Novel Insights from Proteomic analysis of Lumbar discs with Modic changes’, Ganga Hospital became the first institution to have won the honour consecutively for three years. “This is a very coveted award which is jointly awarded by NASS and The Spine Journal (TSJ) which is the official research publication journal of the society. All the spine research organisations around the world fiercely compete for these awards,” said S. Rajasekaran, chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic and Spine Surgery at Ganga Hospital who heads the team. The winning paper is published as a lead article in TSJ, one of the highest impact factor for spine speciality international journals, and it has also been invited to be presented in the annual meeting of the NASS in the U.S. The award also carries a cash prize of USD 10,000. “Many patients who have low back pain do poorly with both medical and surgical treatment while others have excellent results with the same therapy and surgery. We addressed this question specifically and analysed the biological basis of this poor outcome,” said a statement issued by Dr. Rajasekaran. According to Dr. Rajasekaran, low back pain significantly reduces the quality of life of nearly 70% of the patients worldwide causing a considerable economic and social impact. Degenerative disc disease is the commonest cause of low back pain.

Joint Director of Health P. Paramasivan told The Hindu on Thursday that the government tertiary care facilities were completely full, while the secondary care was filled with patients in semi-critical condition. “A number of cases with false negative reports, admitted to hospitals with breathing difficulty, later revealed COVID-19 infection during scan.” In its wake, the administration needs more beds to offload the number of cases from the government hospitals. He said the administration was expected to add additional 100 beds to St. Peter’s Hospital in Krishnagiri town to take off the load from the government hospital. “We are talking to private hospitals in Hosur to increase the number of beds for tertiary care,” the Joint Director said. On Friday, the district administration released a list of private hospitals in the district with their total beds and the vacant beds for public reference. However, these are figures as on Friday, and the status of availability was bound to vary.

08 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Beds filling up fast in Madurai hospitals||Beds for treating COVID-19 patients, including oxygenated ones, are filling up fast in all government and private hospitals in Madurai district. With the requirement for oxygen support increasing day-by-day, hospitals stress on finding new sources to supply additional oxygen to the hospitals. The COVID-19 positive cases have been rapidly increasing in the district in the second wave. A total of 1,051 new cases were recorded in Madurai on Friday. A total of 14 deaths were recorded, increasing the district’s death toll to 572. According to the data released by the Public Health Department, as at 8 p.m. on Thursday, nearly 72.81% of COVID-19 beds have been occupied in all the government hospitals of the district. In the 44 private hospitals in the district, nearly 58.32% of the beds have been occupied. The data shows that nearly 50% of oxygenated beds in government hospitals and 33% in private hospitals have been occupied. Oxygen supply GRH sources say the hospital was utilising oxygen up to its maximum capacity. Oxygen is being supplied in the morning and evening through lorries by suppliers from Palakkad in Kerala. “In this scenario, handling an additional number of patients requiring oxygen support would be extremely difficult,” said a source. In the second wave, more number of patients have lung involvement, increasing the requirement for oxygen support. “Each patient requires 10 to 12 days of hospital stay. Hence, if new patients require oxygen support, then it will be very difficult for the hospital to manage the situation,” said the source. Many private hospitals say oxygen requirement has increased manifold and stress the need to source additional oxygen. A senior health official said all private hospitals have allocated at least 50% of their total bed strength to treat COVID-19 patients. Some hospitals have even allocated 100% of their beds. “There will be strict enforcement of triaging to ensure that only patients with severe infection get admitted in hospitals,” he said. Collector T. Anbalagan said that oxygen requirement in hospitals have increased drastically in the district. “The two private oxygen manufacturing units have been instructed to ration and supply oxygen to private hospitals. Oxygen production will start at Sterlite Copper in two days and the Thoothukudi Collector has promised to supply oxygen to Madurai. We have also contacted other sources to help supply oxygen to hospitals in Madurai,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beds-filling-up-fast-in-madurai-hospitals/article34511162.ece
08 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Why govt. institutes are not used for vaccine production, asks High Court||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday sought response from the Centre and the State in two public interest litigation petitions that sought production of oxygen in the State and strict implementation of the government order to allocate a minimum 50% of the bed strength in private hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients. A Division Bench of Justices M.S. Ramesh and B. Pugalendhi observed that India was a pioneer in production of vaccines before COVID-19 and the world’s largest exporter of vaccines. Now, only two private manufacturers - Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - were producing vaccines for COVID-19. The vaccine manufacturing institutes owned by the government were not utilised. When the government itself was having such facilities, they must be revived and put into effective use so that the government would be in a position to inoculate all people and need not bargain with private players at this difficult juncture. Oxygen production The court asked the Centre and the State to respond to a series of queries. The court sought to know as to how many government-owned vaccine manufacturing institutes were available in India and details of production capacity. Whether BHEL-Tiruchi, could produce oxygen. When the Central government supported reopening of Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi for the purpose of production of oxygen to meet the exigency, what were the steps taken by the government to work out the possibility of production of oxygen in BHEL-Tiruchi. What was the status of the Integrated Vaccines Complex in Chengalpattu, the court asked. The court also sought to know as to how much India had spent on procuring vaccines for the past five years, including COVID-19 vaccine. What were the steps taken to revive the existing vaccine institutes owned by the government. The court sought response in the case on May 19 and directed the Centre and the State to file the counter affidavits. Private hospitals The court also sought to know as to whether the State government was strictly monitoring the implementation of the government order to allocate a minimum of 50% of bed strength in private hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients. Whether the COVID-19 treatment fee structure fixed by the government was displayed prominently in private hospitals. What were the penal provision or penalty contemplated for violation of the government order and how many complaints the government had received for violation of the order. What was the action taken. The court wanted to know from the government on maintaining a separate portal for details on bed capacity in private hospitals and the fee structure. How many people were treated under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme and whether government employees were entitled to take treatment for COVID-19 in private hospitals under the Tamil Nadu Employees Health Insurance Scheme. The court sought a response in the case on May 12. The court observed that it appreciated the valuable services rendered by doctors, nurses, all health workers and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time exorbitant charges collected by some hospitals during the difficult times cannot be permitted. Both the public interest litigation petitions were filed by A. Veronica Mary of Madurai.  Vaccine & oxygen  What are the steps taken to revive government’s vaccine institutes?  Did it explore possibility of oxygen production in BHEL-Tiruchi?

08 May 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Rangasamy sworn in Puducherry CM||All India NR Congress founder N. Rangasamy was on Friday sworn in as the Chief Minister of Puducherry for the fourth time. He will head a coalition government, comprising the BJP, and the party nominee would be given the Deputy Chief Minister’s post, according to Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy. Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan administered the oath of office and secrecy to Mr. Rangasamy at a function held on the lawns of the Raj Nivas. Immediately after the swearing-in, Mr. Rangasamy reached the Legislative Assembly and assumed charge as Chief Minister. He signed the official registrar and left the Assembly. The swearing-in ceremony was attended by a limited number of people, including Mr. Kishan Reddy, newly elected legislators belonging to the AINRC, the BJP, the DMK, the Congress, Independents and leaders of the AIADMK. The AINRC, which contested as part of the National Democratic Alliance along with the BJP and AIADMK, secured 10 seats. The BJP won 6 seats while the AIADMK drew a blank in the 30-member Assembly. Mr. Reddy, along with BJP legislators, called on the Lt. Governor after the swearing-in ceremony. Shortly after the meeting, the Union Minister told the media that the AINRC and the BJP had come to an understanding on the ministerial berths. Both the parties will have three Ministers each, including the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister. The BJP would get the Deputy Chief Minister’s post and two Ministers, he said. “The Chief Minister assumed office on Friday because it is an auspicious day. The Cabinet will be expanded in two days. Everything will go in a smooth manner,” Mr. Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rangasamy-sworn-in-puducherry-cm/article34511043.ece
08 May 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||U.T. CM has his task cut out||Major challenges await All India NR Congress leader N. Rangasamy, who took over as Chief Minister of Puducherry for a record fourth time on Friday, as he would be be heading a coalition government for the first time. He became the Chief Minister in 2001 as a Congress nominee after Puducherry Munnetra Congress, headed by P. Kannan, merged his regional outfit with the national party. He was sworn in Chief Minister for the second time in 2006 but was dethroned mid-way in 2008 due to a rebellion. He later broke ranks and founded the AINRC, which he guided to a historic win in 2011. Dumping his pre-poll partner, AIADMK, the AINRC chief formed a government with an Independent’s support. Now into the fourth term as Chief Minister with the AINRC having just 10 seats, things are far different politically as he is dependent on the ambitious ally BJP, which has already demanded a huge slice of the Ministries, including the Deputy Chief Minister’s post. Though the immediate challenge before the Chief Minister would be to accommodate the political aspirations of the BJP, his leadership would be put to test in the immediate future in accommodating his own partymen in key positions. Besides political challenges, the Chief Minister would have the task of containing the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-cm-has-his-task-cut-out/article34511030.ece

There were two ministerial berths each for Tiruchi and Pudukottai and one each for Karur and Perambalur districts.

The allotment of six ministries for Tiruchi and surrounding districts was a sound augury for the economic progress,” M. A. Aleem, Advisory Committee Member, Tiruchi International Airport, said. Dr. Aleem, who is also former Vice-Principal, KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College, Tiruchi, said the elected representatives from the region must prevail upon the Central Government to establish an AIIMS-type hospital at Sengipatti for the convenience of the people in Tiruchi, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts. The health infrastructure ought to be planned with foresight in consonance with the rise in population, Dr. Aleem said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-region-gets-six-ministerial-berths/article34511535.ece

The food is provided for both lunch and dinner. Susan Sushma, who owns the Upper Room Cafe in Cantonment, had been looking for a way to contribute to the fight against COVID-19.

The food bank provides raw materials, while Ms. Sushma utilises her kitchen and her manpower to prepare the food. In this way, 200 food packets were distributed to frontline workers and doctors on a daily basis. Sam Ellis, who runs Kalanjiyam Food Bank said that the initiative was born when he was down with COVID-19 last month. “I realised that we need nutritious meal, but the illness is such that there is no energy to cook,” he said. As soon as he recovered, he collected donations to bring the initiative to life. To ensure that the food is nutritious for the patients, a nutritionist based in Chennai was consulted. “She told us that we must provide the patients with high-protein meals,” he said. Vegetarian meals, consisting of green gram (mung bean) salads, chickpeas, greenpeas are included along with portions of rice, such as pulao, ghee rice, etc. The Food Bank also coordinated with Ramyas Hotels to provide dinner to these patients. “Ramyas provides their kitchen, manpower and the ingredients too.

After bifurcation, Tirunelveli has five Assembly constituencies. DMK candidates Appavoo and Abdul Wahab were elected from Radhapuram and Palayamkottai in the election. While supporters of Mr. Appavoo expected his inclusion in the cabinet, given his experience and status as four-time MLA, there was anticipation that Mr. Abdul Wahab could get a berth as he represented the minorities. In the earlier DMK regime, when it was undivided Tirunelveli district, Avudayappan was the Assembly Speaker, while senior leaders T.P.M. Moideen Khan and Poongothai Aladi Aruna were ministers in M.K. Karunanidhi’s cabinet. In neighbouring Tenkasi district, DMK functionaries said they were sure if the victorious Sankarankovil candidate Raja would find place in the cabinet. Mr. Raja defeated AIADMK’s V.M. Rajalakshmi, a minister in the outgoing cabinet. Senior party functionaries, however, said two ministers had been given representation each from Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar districts and one from Kanniyakumari district. They admitted that the defeat of veterans such as Ms. Poongothai and Mr. Avudayappan and A.L.S. Lakshmanan could have led the DMK high command to give a slip to the district so that the local units would work hard for the party’s victory in the coming civic election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-tenkasi-dmk-units-upset/article34511510.ece

08 May 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Assault on elephants: accused still at large||A day after videos of a group of tribal men allegedly torturing wild elephants in Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) near Udumalpet surfaced on social media, the Forest Department said on Friday that the three accused have not surrendered and were absconding. On Thursday, around two dozen video clips of the men attacking the pachyderms using stones and sticks surfaced on social media platforms. Following this, the Forest Department registered a case against three men, who were residents of Thirumurthimalai tribal settlement under the Tiruppur Forest Division areas of the ATR. Officials said that P. Selvam (30), T. Kalimuthu (25) and J. Arunkumar (30) were booked under sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act including section 32 (Ban on use of injurious substances). While the residents of the tribal settlement assured the Forest Department that they would hand over the three men by Friday morning, the accused failed to turn up. On Friday, the officials from Udumalpet Forest Range submitted a copy of the First Information Report registered against the accused to the First Judicial Magistrate at Udumalpet. K. Ganeshram, Assistant Conservator of Forests and Additional Director of ATR (Tiruppur Forest Division), said that the three men did not return to their tribal settlement on Thursday and that the residents were carrying out searches inside the forest areas. About 120 families live in the Thirumurthimalai tribal settlement and its population is around 400, he said. Preliminary investigations revealed that the videos of the assault on the elephants were shot earlier this week, according to Mr. Ganeshram. “They could have done it in a playful manner,” he said. The elephants that were seen being attacked in the video clips, including a female elephant aged about 10 years, did not suffer any injuries, he noted. Further investigations and efforts to nab the accused were under way, Mr. Ganeshram said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/assault-on-elephants-accused-still-at-large/article34511104.ece
08 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Rescuing the elderly from abandonment||In a little over two years, S. Dusthageer, a social worker in The Nilgiris, has rescued more than 120 senior citizens abandoned by their families. “The first thing we do when we bring someone to the shelter is to give them a bath, besides a haircut and a shave. This restores their sense of dignity after living on the streets,” says Mr. Dusthageer, who runs a home for the destitute at Mullikorai, near Udhagamandalam town, with the help of the municipality and the district administration. From other districts Many of the people who are abandoned in The Nilgiris are from other districts. “As it is a tourist destination, people coming here abandon their elderly family members. This is extremely sad, a certain death sentence because the temperature dips to just a few degrees above the freezing point in winters,” says Mr. Dusthageer. So far, the efforts of social workers like him and the district administration have helped to reunite 36 elderly persons with their families. Unlike the others, those who are reunited might have broken with their families owing to medical issues, and their families agree to take them back. Convincing people who have been rejected by their families that there are people who wish to care for them is the hardest part of the job, says Mr. Dusthageer. “When we approach them to take them to the shelter, they are reluctant. We then show them the pictures of the other people at the shelter, and they reluctantly agree. Sometimes, it takes us an hour to convince them that we mean no harm.” Some of the people have been living in the shelter since it was started. Raju, one of the earliest residents, says many people choose to stay there permanently. “We are treated well here by the staff. Even if our families come back to take us, we will not return as we have a very nice community of people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rescuing-the-elderly-from-abandonment/article34511048.ece
08 May 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Doctors exhausted||Continuous work without adequate break unlike given in the first wave of COVID in 2020 has created a sense of desperation among doctors. “Besides treating patients continuously by putting our lives at risk, we are forced to face the angry public who shout at us for lack of adequate doses of vaccines,” a senior medical officer of a Government Hospital said. The State government could have recognised their services with an incentive for fight against the COVID at least during the peak period. “An incentive for a couple of months will keep the fighting spirit of the medical officers and paramedical staff high to continuously work in the COVID wards,” he added. The doctors were demoralised as no hotel accommodation and food were given to them for the quarantine period as in 2020. The hotel accommodation helped to quarantine themselves after a week of duty in COVID-19 ward for a few days before going back home. “Now, we are putting the lives of our family members in danger,” the officer said. Earlier, a RT-PCR test negative report was made mandatory for doctors and other health staff to go home after quarantine. “But now, in the absence of hotel accommodation and mandatory RT-PCR test, the doctors walk straight into their homes from the COVID-19 wards,” said Virudhunagar district secretary of Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association, R. Varaivan. Doctors complain that a judicious deployment of doctors with due rotation in COVID ward and in non-COVID duty will help medical officers and paramedical staff fight fatigue. “The district administration has called for recruitment of doctors and paramedical staff to be employed on contract basis. We will have to wait for more time to get a break,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-exhausted/article34511512.ece

In the Nilgiris, the district administration sealed three shops, including a medical store, on Friday.

The medical store was sealed as one of the employees tested positive for COVID-19, and the other workers did not get tested. Collector J. Innocent Divya told reporters the number of beds available was less due to the increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 and appealed to the residents to stay indoors unless it was absolutely necessary to venture out to purchase essential commodities.

08 May 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Maratha leaders in State perturbed by SC order||Maratha leaders in Karnataka are disturbed by the Supreme Court judgment cancelling Maharashtra government’s provision to provide reservation to the community, and plan to hold meetings to discuss the way ahead. Community leaders such as Rahul Jadhav, member of the Vijayapura City Corporation, said this was a serious blow to the development of the community. “Some Marathas may be owing land and some may be in business. But largely, the community remains backward educationally. Even today, several Marathas in rural areas don’t send girls to school. The proportion of the Maratha youth among doctors, engineers, lawyers, and professors is less than that of many other communities,” he argued. Baburao Biradar, former zilla panchayat member and office-bearer of the Kshatriya Maratha Parishat, said the association does not consider the issue as limited to Maharashtra alone. “We will take up discussions with experts and hold meetings of leaders across the country once the pandemic wanes,” he said. He is concerned about the part of the judgment which says that States can only make suggestions to the Centre on inclusion of castes to the OBC list or re-categorisation. “The government is politicising every issue. It will politicise even social issues such as reservation,” he said. Sudhir Chavan, legal adviser to the parishat, observed that the reservation for SC/ST and OBC communities crosses 50% in more than 15 States. “When this is the case, how can one State be denied the power to extend benefits to a community?” he said. Mr. Chavan who regularly gets invited to meetings and discussions about various social issues in Maharashtra, said the leadership in that State was yet to discuss the judgment. “Once the lockdown ends, we may have meetings. One thing is for certain. The decision will be challenged,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/maratha-leaders-in-state-perturbed-by-sc-order/article34511004.ece
08 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State COVID-19 fatalities reach new high||Karnataka on Friday logged the biggest single day spike in COVID-19 fatalities with 592 patients succumbing to the disease. Of these, 346 are from Bengaluru Urban alone. Of the 592 deaths, 58 died at home and 12 were declared brought dead at hospitals. The number of deaths have been on a steep rise since April 23. From 190 deaths on April 23, the toll increased to 217 on April 30 and 270 on May 1. Subsequently, 292 deaths were reported on May 4, 346 on May 5 and 328 on May 6. The number nearly doubled on May 7 with 592 deaths.  While the day’s case fatality rate (CFR) for Karnataka stood at 1.21%, the cumulative average CFR continues to hover around 1% despite the huge caseload. The highest CFR during the first outbreak was around 1.6%. In the seven days prior to May 4, the highest CFR was recorded in Chamarajanagar at 1.89% followed by Haveri at 1.74%, Ballari at 1.37%, and Shivamogga at 1.32%. Bengaluru Urban, which contributes to nearly half of the total deaths in the State had a CFR of 0.54% then. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the deaths seen today are the cases that were positive two weeks ago. “Usually, fatalities will appear 14 days after the surge in cases. Today’s deaths are of the cases that were reported on April 23-24 who subsequently developed complications,” he said. “Most are reporting late to hospitals after their oxygen saturation dips by when it is too late. The 592 deaths are the reported deaths whereas the actual number of deaths are usually high and can vary anywhere between two-five times more. This is because many would not even have reached the healthcare system to be labelled as COVID-19 deaths. This explains the long queues of ambulances with bodies at crematoria in the last fortnight,” he said. “If there is proper bed management and oxygen and essential drug requirements are met, more fatalities can be prevented,” he added. C.N. Manjunath, director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, and nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said that the very fact that all ICU beds are full clearly indicates that many critical patients are in hospitals. “In such a scenario, fatalities are sure to mount. Initially, the CFR was low but it was too early to predict as actual mortality figures would start showing up only after a week or two of admission,” he said.  Four factors Listing out four factors for the high number of fatalities, Dr. Manjunath said: “With cases increasing at such a rapid pace, there has been a tremendous stress on the entire healthcare system. Many who require ICU beds are not getting them and those who get admitted are not able to make it as their condition would have worsened. Besides, a considerable percentage of home isolation patients are deteriorating after the first week without proper monitoring.” Anoop Amarnath, member, Karnataka’s Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU), who heads the department of Geriatric Medicine at Manipal Hospitals, attributed the increase to the elevated Test Positivity Rate (TPR). He said if a proper system of objective triaging is followed, the right patients can be admitted at the right centres. “It all depends on proper triaging. Those with mild symptoms can be sent to COVID-19 Care Centres or monitored at home. Only those who require intensive care should be admitted till logistical issues are sorted,” he added.  Rising numbers  April 23: 190  April 30: 217  May 1: 270  May 4: 292  May 5: 346  May 6: 328  May 7: 592   CFR on May 7: 1.21%  Cumulative CFR: 0.965%||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-covid-19-fatalities-reach-new-high/article34510994.ece
08 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police question doctors||Sleuths from the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police probing the alleged bed allotment scam have begun an audit of all beds allotted through the city’s civic body in April 2021. With more than 10,000 beds allotted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike during in April, a senior police official said the process was time-consuming. “We have already identified at least 12 cases where beds were blocked in a person’s name only to be manually changed and allotted to someone else. But manual change cannot be concluded as bed-blocking. We are investigating these cases. “However, families of patients who may have paid a bribe are not forthcoming, and we are hitting a dead end there,” the officer explained. Meanwhile, CCB questioned doctors in charge of bed allotment at all the city’s eight war rooms on Friday. “Based on emergency calls made to the helpline, these doctors prioritise allotment of beds based on severity of the disease, which makes them crucial to the process of either bed allotment or blocking,” the official said. CCB has already arrested the doctor in charge of the South zone war room. Sleuths questioned 18 persons on Friday, including doctors in war rooms, representatives of private hospitals and ambulance service providers. “We have collected CCTV camera footage from all the eight war rooms. We are in the process of analysing them to see if there was any unauthorised person in the war rooms influencing bed allotment,” said the official.

08 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. caps CT scan price in private hospitals, laboratories||With High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest becoming a common investigation method for COVID and suspected COVID cases to rule out lung involvement, Karnataka on Friday capped the price of such scan and digital X-ray in private hospitals and labs at Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 250, respectively. “We have received complaints that some hospitals and labs are exploiting people by charging high prices. To check this, the government has capped the prices of CT scan and X-ray at private hospitals and labs,” said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. He said strict action will be taken against hospitals and labs which violate rules and charge high prices. Government hospitals are providing the facility free of cost. People should utilise it, the Minister said. With several patients turning up false negative on RT-PCR, doctors have been prescribing CT scans and bio-marker tests to rule out lung involvement. Following this, most of the private diagnostic facilities have been arbitrarily charging people. Although a CT scan is free in government hospitals, where the facility is available, private centres have been charging anywhere between Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 6,000. With some doctors cautioning that the scanning centre or room itself can be a source of infection if proper sanitisation protocols are not followed, people had been flocking private diagnostic facilities.  TAC recommendation The State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had discussed the issue and had recommended that the government should cap the CT scan prices. Accordingly, the government issued an Order on Friday, the Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-caps-ct-scan-price-in-private-hospitals-laboratories/article34510989.ece

BBMP’s Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that there was intense pressure on the medical infrastructure. “The solution lies in increasing beds, ICU, oxygenated beds, while ensuring adequate oxygen, nursing and medical staff,” he said. Monitoring oxygen Earlier, the civic chief chaired a review meeting on oxygen supplies and instructed the officials to make sure the supervisors and nodal officers not only provide information but also monitor if oxygen refilling agencies are supplying the required amount of oxygen to specific hospitals in BBMP limits. He said this should be done along with the information provided by nodal officers/ camp officers, as appointed by the Directorate of Industries and Commerce, for each of the supply of oxygen refilling agencies on oxygen stock, supply etc. at the oxygen supply agency level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/531-beds-with-oxygen-facilities-in-stabilization-centres-and-cccs/article34510980.ece
08 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Panel suggestion to make hospital beds available to needy||In order to make beds in hospitals available to the needy, the Treatment Protocol Committee has suggested to the authorities to take stricter measures to shift 30 to 40% of the bed occupants who are non-serious to COVID care centres (CCC) or step-down hospitals. Deputy Chief Minister and head of the COVID-19 task force C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday said patients whose conditions improve and become stable after the initial days of treatment need not continue to stay in hospital for 14 days or more. Normally, the condition of the infected becomes stable after four or five days of treatment and then they should be shifted to CCCs or step-down hospitals. This would be applicable for patients both in government and private hospitals, he said. He said more number of infected were getting admitted to hospitals even when it was not necessary, and added, the committee had decided to put a check on this also. Hospitalisation was necessary only for those whose oxygen saturation dips below 90. For others with mild symptoms, he said, fever clinics would be augmented. The supply of anti-viral drug Remdesivir for the State would be increased to 37,000 vials per day starting from May 11, Dr. Narayan said. The Union government had increased the allotment of Remdesivir for the State to 2,62,000 doses for a period of seven days, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panel-suggestion-to-make-hospital-beds-available-to-needy/article34511005.ece

08 May 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Two killed in elephant attacks||A plantation worker and a forest guard died in two elephant attack cases on Friday. The worker was attacked when he was in a coffee estate in Hassan district and the forest guard was attacked while he was on duty near Aldur in Chikkamagaluru district. At coffee estate Shivanna, 55, was attacked by a tusker while he was working at Lingapura Coffee Estate located near Arehalli on the borders of Sakleshpur and Belur taluks around 9 a.m. He died on the spot. Shivanna, a native of Dakshina Kannada district, had moved to Lingapura about 20 years ago. He is survived by his wife and six children. This is the sixth death in elephant attacks in Hassan district since this January. It is said that the tusker lifted him and threw him away. “The department handed over a cheque for Rs. 2 lakh to his family. Later, the family will get another Rs. 5.5 lakh, besides a monthly pension of Rs. 2,000,” K.N. Basavaraj, Deputy Conservator of Forests of Hassan, told The Hindu . Around 60 elephants spread over a couple of herds are roaming in parts of Alur, Sakleshpur, and Belur taluks. People have been demanding that all the elephants be captured and rehabilitated. Mr. Basavaraj said the department had got clearance to capture two trouble-causing tuskers in the district. “We are not in a position to take up the operation to capture the elephants as our two veterinarians have tested positive for COVID-19. We are hoping to start the operation after May 12,” he added. Forest guard In the another incident, the forest guard, Puttaraju, 38, died after he was hit by a tusker near Gullanapete in Aldur range around 11.30 a.m. He was part of a team of guards and watchers engaged in driving the tusker, which had been roaming in the coffee estates nearby for the past few days, back to the forest area. Local people had urged the department to drive it back to the forest area so that they couldmove around without fear.

08 May 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Health Dept. instructed to give medical kits to every family in Dharwad: Shettar||Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar has said that the Health Department had been instructed to conduct door-to-door visits and distribute medical kits meant for preventing COVID-19 to every family in Dharwad district. Speaking at an outdoor review meeting conducted on the Circuit House premises in Dharwad on Friday, Mr. Shettar said that steps were being taken to further increase the healthcare facilities and medical infrastructure for COVID-19 patients in the district. The Minister said that two senior officials would be coordinating and monitoring the distribution of medical kits in urban and rural areas of the district. To ensure success of the campaign, gram panchayat staff, ASHAs, beat police, and if necessary local NGOs will also be involved, he said. Despite several patients from other districts of northern Karnataka pouring into Hubballi, particularly KIMS Hospital, the district administration was handling the situation efficiently, he said, clarifying that there was no shortage of beds in the district for COVID-19 treatment. Mr. Shettar asked health officials to set up another swab collection centre at KIMS Hospital in addition to the existing two. Admitting that there was a delay in receiving the test reports, which consequently was leading to confusion and problems, he said that technical issues if any would be sorted out and the process would be expedited. Terming the death of five COVID-19 patients on a single day in a private hospital in Hubballi as unfortunate, he directed the district health officer to conduct a comprehensive inquiry and submit report to the Deputy Commissioner. He also asked the officials to coordinate with private hospitals to ensure that no hospital was closed down for COVID-19 treatment. Admitting that availability of Remdesivir injection in the district was limited, he said he would take up the issue with state level officials to sort it out. Commending the good work being done by district hospital and KIMS hospital in COVID-19 treatment, Arvind Bellad, MLA, requested the KIMS administration to ensure that patients got quick information regarding treatment and other procedures. Pradeep Shettar, MLC, suggested that unused ventilators in taluk hospitals should be handed over to district hospital and KIMS hospital. He also requested the Police Commissioner to set up a mechanism to allow various non governmental organisations to distribute food packets, fruits, medicines, masks, and sanitisers and also fix a time for the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-dept-instructed-to-give-medical-kits-to-every-family-in-dharwad-shettar/article34511086.ece

08 May 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||People resort to panic buying as DK imposes weekend lockdown||The Dakshina Kannada district administration’s decision on Thursday to impose weekend lockdown beginning 10 a.m. on Friday till Monday morning and shrink the window to buy essentials from six hours to three hours on weekdays triggered panic buying across the district. The district administration on Thursday decided to impose rigorous curbs as the number of COVID-19 positive cases did not reduce even after eight days of the curfew. People lined up in front of department stores, shops selling grocery, vegetables, fruits, fish and meat, milk parlours, and fuel stations to buy essentials enough for three days. A notification issued by Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Thursday said no other activity, except healthcare, would be allowed to function during the weekend lockdown in order to curb unnecessary movement of people. Consequent to the panic buying, shops selling essential items witnessed huge crowds even as people gathered in large numbers at places where vegetables and fruits were being sold on roadside. Criticising the district administration’s sudden move, social activist Gerad Towers said curtailing people’s activities from 6 a.m. to noon to from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., has resulted in chaos. Increased crowding would enhance the spread of the pandemic instead of curbing it, Mr. Towers said. If COVID-19 positive cases increase in the city, the administration would be responsible, he said. While the State government was mulling imposing complete lockdown for a fortnight from Monday, the Dakshina Kannada administration’s decision adding more conditions to State Disaster Management Authority’s order has wondered many people. Attempts to get clarification from Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar as to whether district disaster management committees could alter the State authority’s directive were not successful. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, former Minister B. Ramanath Rai said the government should extend essentials package to the needy before imposing the lockdown on the lines of Kerala and other States. It also should open Ganji Kendras in every gram panchayat as well as district Government Wenlock Hospital, Mangaluru, to feed the poor. The State’s situation would not have been this bad had the Siddaramaiah government been in power, Mr. Rai said, adding Jan Ki Baat was important and not Mann Ki Baat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-resort-to-panic-buying-as-dk-imposes-weekend-lockdown/article34511084.ece

08 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Pratap Simha, Suresh Kumar lock horns over allocation of oxygen||The State’s lack of a robust mechanism for oxygen distribution to districts based on actual requirements is coming to the fore with the elected representatives squabbling over oxygen allocation. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha on Friday took exception to Ministers K.C. Narayana Gowda and S. Suresh Kumar allegedly monitoring and personally overseeing the transportation of oxygen cylinders to Mandya and Chamarajanagar, the districts they are in-charge of, from a private refilling agency in Mysuru. Mr. Simha said Mysuru was ensuring equitable supply of oxygen based on demands and the ‘overbearing attitude’ of the Ministers was uncalled for and amounted to creating distrust among different districts. “A Minister cannot use the Chamarajanagar tragedy as a pretext to commandeer the refilling plant in Mysuru to ensure supply to their districts. Instead of coming to Mysuru they should sit with the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary to place their requirements,” said Mr. Simha.  ‘Not unscientific’ Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar reacted strongly to this allegation and said that his politics was ‘not based on impulsive outbursts and unscientific thinking’. He said that as a Minister he was aware of his responsibilities and the government was committed to ensuring the welfare of all. “I am not given to such thinking as to divert Mysuru’s oxygen requirement to Chamarajanagar,” he added. He said his decision to visit the oxygen refilling units in Mysuru was to acquaint himself with the processes pertaining to refilling of the cylinders and the duration it entailed. Earlier in the day, the issue had also came up in the meeting convened by the Mysuru district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar. Mr. Somashekar said he would seek the intervention of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to ensure that Mysuru’s requirement of 48 kilolitres of oxygen per day was not affected. Mr. Simha said Mysuru too had its requirements and was getting half of its 48 KL per day requirements while there were more than 100 hospitals in the district.  Fix quota “I will write to the Chief Minister to fix a quota for each district based on the number of COVID-19 cases and the requirement,” he said. The MP sought to tighten the monitoring mechanism at the refilling plant in Mysuru and installed CCTV cameras so as to keep tabs on the dispatch of cylinders personally. Mr. Simha told mediapersons that the existing load of COVID-19 patients on the hospitals was crippling and these numbers are expected to double by the time the second wave peaks. Hence, it was imperative for districts to assess their oxygen requirements and write to the government to ensure their supplies.  A Minister cannot use the Chamarajanagar tragedy as a pretext to commandeer the refilling plant in Mysuru to ensure supply to their districts. Pratap Simha MP, Mysuru   I am not given to such thinking as to divert Mysuru’s share of oxygen to Chamarajanagar. I visited refilling units in Mysuru to acquaint myself with the process. S.

08 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Demand for reopening hospital in Mysuru||A campaign has been launched by residents of Kesare in Narasimharaja Assembly constituency in Mysuru to reopen the Bibi Ayesha Hospital. which was closed in February this year owing to a dispute between the hospital management and the Wakf Board. The 75-bed hospital, which had served as a comprehensive Covid Care Centre during the first wave of the pandemic las year, has remained closed for about two months now, but the infrastructure including beds and other equipment has remained intact. MCC corporator Samiulla, who led a demonstration in front of the hospital situated on the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway, told a meeting convened by Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Thursday that the authorities should reopen the hospital if the number of COVID-19 deaths among the people of the adjoining localities is to be reduced. The number of patients facing breathlessness and requiring immediate hospitalisation is increasing with each passing day while the chances of securing beds in existing hospitals are becoming even more remote. “The hospital had helped save several lives in the first wave of pandemic last year”, he said while making an appeal to Narasimharaja Assembly constituency MLA Tanveer Sait, who was also present in the meeting, to facilitate the reopening of the hospital. Mr. Samiulla said the authorities, who are being stretched to start new Covid Care Centres, need not make much efforts to start a facility at Bibi Ayesha Hospital. “There are beds, oxygen system, ventilators, ambulance etc. We can use the ready infrastructure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demand-for-reopening-hospital-in-mysuru/article34510979.ece

Deve Gowda , former Minister and Chamundeshwari MLA, on Friday urged the State government to immediately fix oxygen quotas for each district to avert an ‘oxygen war’. At a press conference here, he regretted that the government had not ensured equitable distribution of oxygen in districts even after the Chamarajanagar deaths. In the absence of any guidelines by the government, he said the district in-charge Ministers of Mandya and Chamarajanagar, K.C. Narayana Gowda and S. Suresh Kumar respectively, have come to Mysuru and ‘taken away’ cylinders with full police security. “What about the oxygen needs of people in Mysuru when the stock here is exhausted? Are we waiting for a tragedy?” he asked. He said the government as well as State officials had not yet woken up to the need for rationing oxygen. Mr. Gowda also urged the Centre to sanction the State its full quota of oxygen. If the Centre is reluctant, the MPs elected from Karnataka, irrespective of party affiliation, should go to the national capital and demand their due, the JD(S) MLA representing Chamundeshwari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/avert-oxygen-war/article34510990.ece

Yashavantha, who was in charge of the COVID-19 war room in Bommanahalli, and demanded an FIR against the culprits. Bommanahalli MLA Satish Reddy, who is facing allegations of bed-blocking, went to Bommanahalli war room on April 30 with his supporters and reportedly demanded that beds be allotted to patients in his constituency. When his demands were not accepted, Mr. Yashavantha was pushed around and manhandled. Videos of the incident have been circulating on social media. Mr. Reddy was among the three MLAs who accompanied BJP MP Tejasvi Surya to the South zone war room earlier this week to expose an alleged scam in bed allotment. “Mr. Yashavantha was part of the team of officers who had obtained additional hospital beds from private hospitals. But the officer did not yield to pressure to offer the additional beds to representatives of honourable members of the legislative Assembly. As a result, Mr. Yeshavantha was manhandled and abused in public...”, the letter said. Mr. Reddy told The Hindu that he had gone to the war room on behalf of his agitated constituents, on a day that saw a large number of deaths in the area due to non-availability of beds.

They have been asked to stay away from work till the police clear their names. After questioning the youths for two days, the police have let them go for want of evidence of their involvement, sources said. “On Tuesday evening, police came and took only Muslims to the police station. Our mobiles were checked and we were questioned for two days before being allowed to leave,” said Syed Moin Shah, one of the people targeted. They are among over 200 employees on the rolls of an agency contracted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike for the South zone war room. Another youth, who did not wish to be named, said their company had asked them to stay away from work till the police completed the probe and assured that they will be taken back once they get a clean chit. “We are wary of a police investigation, which we fear will target us. “On the other hand, we fear losing our jobs for no fault of ours,” he said. He pointed out that others, who are also being questioned by the police, are not being asked to stay away from work. “It is like we have already become accused and we need to prove our innocence,” he added. While the police have let them go home, they are yet to give them a clean chit. “The investigation is at a very early stage. It is tough to either say they were involved or give them a clean chit. The process needs to be completed,” a senior official said. Sources said police are questioning one of the youths, based on some leads, and his phone is being analysed by Cyber Crime Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muslim-youths-in-the-lurch/article34510985.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Bed management system: Emulate Kerala, says panel||The three-member committee, which was formed to make the Central Hospital Bed Management System (CHBMS) transparent and plug loopholes, has recommended that the portal be developed on the lines of the dashboard of the government of Kerala. The committee submitted its report to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Friday. According to highly placed sources, the committee recommended an overhaul of access control, a security audit, generation of daily reports and analytics, and improvements to the existing portal. Kerala’s dashboard is data driven and provides daily reports, details on active cases, vaccinations, hotspots and community kitchens. “Many features from Kerala’s dashboard can be incorporated. Right now, CHBMS is just reflecting availability of beds under government quota in various healthcare facilities. It may require some work to develop new interfaces,” said a source. The committee submitted its report two days after Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya, along with MLAs Ravi Subramanya, Uday Garudachar and Satish Reddy, alleged bed-blocking by staff of the South zone war room. Secure access Sources told The Hindu that the committee’s recommendation on stricter norms for access control have already been implemented. It has recommended that the computers used in zonal war rooms be white-listed to ensure that only they are used for bed allotment. Every user in the war room will have his or her own ID and must login with a password and OTP. This, sources said, will improve accountability and security in the system. As soon as a bed is allotted, either the patient or attendant should get an SMS. Currently, the SMS is sent when an ambulance is booked and not when the bed is blocked. Reduce auto-unblock time The committee has recommended reduction in auto-unblock time from 10 hours to 6 hours, which is the time until which the bed will remain booked. Explaining this, sources said that the 10-hour duration was too long and miscreants could try to misuse the system during this period. The committee has recommended an overall security audit of the software through an authorised agency to ensure that both the software and data are secure. Some major issues had already been flagged prior to the MP and his BJP colleagues storming the South zone war room, said Mr. Gupta. “While we didn’t have specific cases, there was a feeling that the system was being misused. Hence, the committee had been constituted,” he said. While work on improving the CHBMS has already begun, it has been affected by the ongoing investigation, sources said. “For the past few days, software engineers are being summoned by the police as part of the investigation. This has resulted in work getting hampered. We have requested the police to allow the software developers to work,” a source said.  Many features from Kerala’s dashboard can be incorporated. Right now, CHBMS is just reflecting availability of beds under government quota in various healthcare facilities. It may require some work...

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Shivarama Karanth Layout: SC order gives relief to owners||In its recent order related to Shivarama Karanth Layout, the Supreme Court told the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) not to acquire land for layouts which were approved and sanctioned before August 3, 2018. The order comes as a huge relief for hundreds of property owners living in high-rise buildings, and others who had purchased sites in these layouts and built houses. In its affidavit, the BDA had informed the apex court that in the land notified for formation of Shivarama Karanth Layout, there were 17 layouts developed on 126 acres, with due approval from the authority. The court was informed that buildings, including high-rises, have come up in these layouts. Expressing its view, the SC said, “It is just and proper not to demolish constructions made in these layouts”. The court has asked the Justice (retired) A.V. Chandrashekar committee to examine approval granted to these layouts and submit a report. Developers of the layouts are permitted to file the documents in relation to approval of these layouts to the committee within three months. Coming to the aid of those who purchased revenue sites in the notified land before August 8, 2018, the court in its order said that they are entitled to allotment of sites in Shivarama Karanth Layout. Those who have purchased revenue sites have been permitted to register in the BDA as applicants for allotment of sites under the Bangalore Development Authority (allotment of sites) Rules, 1984 within four months. However, they should not own any other residential property in Bengaluru or in the surrounding vicinity, and are bound by other allotment rules. “The allotment of sites is restricted to sites measuring 30 X 40 square feet being the maximum extent, irrespective of the measurement of their sites that have been acquired by the BDA,” stated the SC order. A committee of retired district judges will examine the title deed of the applicants and submit a report. The BDA will allot sites only to those applicants who are duly certified by the committee. Justice (retired) A.V. Chandrashekar who is heading the committee which is looking into lawful constructions made on the land notified for formation of Shivarama Karanth Layout, told The Hindu that the Supreme Court order has protected the interest of those who had legally purchased revenue sites and properties in authorised layouts prior to August 3, 2018. Mr. Chandrashekar said that the committee has received 3,800 applications from builder owners, and while help desks have been temporarily shut, people are submitting reports online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shivarama-karanth-layout-sc-order-gives-relief-to-owners/article34510986.ece

08 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fresh guidelines issued to streamline vaccination||Even as vaccination centres like the one at the Ernakulam General Hospital witnessed long queues on Friday, with people including elderly persons waiting for tokens to take their second dose, the district administration has issued new guidelines to streamline the process. Some who arrived at the General Hospital early in the morning and stood in line for a few hours, were turned away when tokens began to be issued. The hospital could administer 200 doses a day, and over 200 people had lined up. “Tokens were, in fact, issued to less than 200 people, since some doses were for those who had booked slots online. Although online bookings are not possible anymore, some bookings were already made well in advance, and we cannot turn those beneficiaries away,” said a doctor at the hospital. The General Hospital will not have a COVID vaccination session on Saturday, since children’s immunisation sessions are scheduled for the day. All online registrations for vaccination have been suspended till further notice. People due for their second shot are being identified by ASHA workers and councillors, and these lists are being verified by health officials at the district level. For people who have taken the first dose of the vaccine at a private hospital before April 30, the second dose will be available for free at government vaccination centres. Separate vaccination centres are being arranged for these beneficiaries. While health officials in the district have already identified halls, private hospitals are now required to identify beneficiaries awaiting the second dose. A total of 200 doses will be administered daily in this manner. Private hospitals will deploy their own vaccinators at these sites. “These sites will begin functioning depending on the availability of vaccines in the coming week,” said Dr. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for vaccination. While the district received 33,000 doses of Covishield earlier this week, officials are uncertain about when fresh supply can be expected. So far, 8,69,960 doses have been administered in the district. A total of 5,69,861 people aged above 45 years have taken the first dose. Of them, 75,540 people have taken the second dose. On Friday morning, Ernakulam had 41,730 doses of the two vaccines remaining (13,080 doses of Covaxin and 28,650 doses of Covishield). Those who have taken their first Covaxin dose at private hospitals can take the second dose at the Edapally family health centre on all days except Wednesday and Sunday. They can also take it at taluk hospitals, the Muvattupuzha General Hospital and the Aluva District Hospital on Saturdays from May 15 onwards. For those above 18 Meanwhile, Dr. Sivadas said that Apollo Adlux Hospital had procured 5,000 doses of Covaxin and permission was given to the hospital on Friday to begin administering the vaccine. Registrations for vaccination at the hospital will be through the CoWIN portal, he said. “The hospital has been permitted to administer 200 doses daily, and this will be open to all over 18 years of age,” Dr. Sivadas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fresh-guidelines-issued-to-streamline-vaccination/article34511248.ece

Those who are proficient in migrant languages have been assigned with the task of visiting migrant worker settlements to interact with them. Mr. Karthik held online meetings with traders on the measures to be undertaken in connection with the lockdown. It was decided that shops and establishments dealing in essential items would be operated only in accordance with the restrictions in place. Meanwhile, the Rural police on Friday registered 325 cases for violations of the COVID protocol, arrested 102 persons and seized 309 vehicles.

08 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC declines to stay govt. order on RT-PCR rate||The Kerala High Court on Friday declined to stay the government order reducing the charge of RT-PCR test in private laboratories to Rs. 500 from Rs. 1,700. Justice N. Nagaresh observed that prima facie, it appeared that the government had arrived at the rate of RT-PCR test after conducting a market survey and a study conducted through Kerala Medical Services Corporation Limited (KMSCL). In other States The court said that it was discernible from the statement filed by the government that the cost of RT-PCR test, including swab collection, would come to Rs. 135-Rs. 240 only. In fact, the charge for the test in many of the other States, including Haryana, Telangana, and Uttarakhand, were within the same range as that fixed by the State government. Therefore, the court did not find any reason to pass an interim order, the court added. The court also declined a plea by laboratory owners to restrain the government from taking coercive steps against the lab owners who did not adhere to the pricing policy of the government. The order was passed on a writ petition filed by a group of laboratories challenging the slashing of prices for the test. The laboratory owners argued that that the average cost for conducting an RT-PCR test came to Rs. 1,500. Therefore, they could not afford to conduct the test at Rs. 500.  On a writ plea by labs against rate cut to Rs. 500, HC says govt. statement makes it clear that the cost will come to only Rs. 135-Rs. 240.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-declines-to-stay-govt-order-on-rt-pcr-rate/article34511255.ece
08 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC quashes Kerala University notification||The Kerala High Court has quashed the notification of the University of Kerala inviting application for various teaching posts, treating all departments as one unit for applying communal reservation. The court passed the verdict while allowing a writ petition filed by the Society for Social Surveillance, Kottayam, and some teachers challenging the notification. The court observed that the attempt of clubbing, as noticed from the notification dated 27.11.2017, is not of a different and distinct cadre, carrying different scales of pay, but in fact for all the posts, Professors, Assistant Professors, Associate Professors of all the departments as one unit. Thus it would bound to create a 100% reservation of such posts. The petitioners contended that the by keeping all the departments as one unit and applying reservation would amount to 100% reservation, which was against the mandate of various judgments of the Supreme Court. Single post According to the petitioner, all the departments, wherever there is a single post, had been clubbed together, dis-entitling meritorious candidates from making application.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-quashes-kerala-university-notification/article34511518.ece

08 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Teams set up at district-level to check surge in cases||In view of the surge in COVID-19 cases in Kozhikode, District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao, in his capacity as Chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority, has set up teams to discharge duties under Section 30 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The first team in charge of contact tracing and testing is to ensure that local bodies have sufficient number of staff members to discharge their duties related to COVID-19 management. They need to ensure that the control rooms in local bodies are effectively tracing all contacts, and that the same is marked on the Jagratha portal. All traced contacts need to be tested, while priority-based testing in areas with high test positivity rate (TPR) and testing of vulnerable sections should be ensured. The second team is to manage containment activities such as identifying areas for containment, critical containment or high TPR, and mark them accordingly on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal. The number of cases every week needs to be considered before releasing the area from containment zone status. They are to identify and propose declarations of local bodies with very high TPR as well as critical local self-government institutions (LSGIs). The data management team is to handle data related to COVID management activities such as tests, contact tracing, result analysis, containment zone management and availability of resources, update it regularly and make it available on real-time basis. Another team is to monitor and report the infrastructure at hospitals, first-line and second-line treatment centres, including occupancy status of beds, ICUs, ventilators, and oxygen facilities. Every hospital has been asked to appoint a nodal officer and establish a help desk with a fixed mobile number and landline number for better coordination. There is a team for oxygen availability assurance (district oxygen war room), the duty of which is to understand oxygen supply infrastructure and network of all hospitals and establish systems to ensure seamless supply of oxygen tanks, cylinders and liquid oxygen to all hospitals. Nodal officers have been appointed at every hospital to coordinate with the team, which is to manage any incidents of oxygen shortage in the district. The team in charge of ambulance services is to ensure that the ambulance control room functions round-the-clock and provides patient service. The team in charge of monitoring patients in home isolation is to ensure that rapid response team (RRT) volunteers have enough pulse oximeters with them and that they monitor the symptoms of patients. They need to make sure that migrant workers and patients belonging to the Scheduled Tribe category are shifted to first-line treatment centres. The RRTs of local bodies have been asked to take special care if all members of a family turn positive, to ensure supply of essential goods and services. A team has been formed to take care of antenatal cases, COVID-positive children, dialysis and cancer patients , for which a network of hospitals will be arranged. Tele-consultation will be arranged for all patients in need of support. There are teams set up for patient welfare (call centre management), counselling and psycho-social support services, tele-consultation, mobile medical units, vaccination coordination, travel management, volunteer management, enforcement coordination, fire safety standards compliance and for welfare of vulnerable people, migrant workers and transgenders. There are also teams for waste management, management of information, education and communication, coordination of hospitals and resource mobilisation. Help desk for transgenders A help desk has been set up for transgender persons to ensure their safety and care. The facility set up by the Department of Social Justice will guide transgender persons who are infected with COVID-19. The help desk can be contacted on 0495-22377911. Transgender Justice Board members Nagma Susmi (99472 62317) and Sisily George (95396 72278) will also be at service.

As part of the comprehensive plan worked out by the City police, barricades will be placed at Kazhakuttam Vettu road, Chengottukonam, Udayagiri, Attinkuzhi, Pallithura, Valiyakulam junction, Kakkamoola, Pallichal, Pappanamcode, Punamoodu, Uchakada, Chappath bridge, Vallaikadavu, Nettayam, Vazhayila, Maruthoor, Keraladithyapuram, East Mukkola, Kundamankadavu bridge and Mangattukadavu bridge to screen the vehicles and travellers. The vehicles and travellers will also be screened at 59 other checking points spread over the city. More patrol units had been deployed. District Police Chief, Thiruvananthapuram City, Balram Kumar Upadhyay said only those needing medical aid, going for vaccination, working in emergency services and others permitted by the government will be allowed to travel.  Those working in the essential services have been asked to travel in a specified time and to carry identity cards and certificate issued by the head of the department. Only medical shops and those selling essential items will be allowed to function, adhering to COVID-19 protocol. Home delivery only will be allowed from supermarkets and shopping malls. Shops flouting the rules will be closed down and stern action taken. As far as possible, only one person should step out of the house to purchase essential items from the nearest shop. Those flouting rules will be booked under the Kerala Epidemics Disease Ordinance 2020. Rush in shops, markets Meanwhile, city residents were seen scurrying to markets and shops on Friday to stock up on vegetables and other essentials. Shops, in fact, had been seeing more sizeable crowds for the past few days amid reports of an impending lockdown. At Kailasam vegetables at Karamana, owner Murugan said there was a good crowd at the shop. He and the staff, in fact, were so tied up that they had no time to prepare packs for home delivery. At the adjacent margin free shop too, there was a crowd through the day. People were being allowed only in small numbers, while others waited outside. Manager Abdul Khader Sha said even their home delivery was on the rise, though there was no cause for concern as the shelves were full.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/strict-checking-at-entry-points/article34511157.ece
08 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Don’t drop caution at home: CM||COVID-19 is spreading in a major way within families and there are innumerable family clusters across the State. An attempt should be made to check this and all those who go outside homes should take special precautions within homes when interacting with other family members, especially young children and the elderly, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The virus is airborne, which means that its transmissibility is much higher. Addressing the media here on Friday, he said the COVID situation was such that common interactions within homes, as during meal times or prayers, should be minimised or avoided. Those going outside homes should wear double masks at home. Houses should also be kept well-ventilated, he added. Why lockdown He said the State was forced to declare a lockdown as COVID disease transmission was going far above the predictions of experts and there was no other way to ensure the safety and welfare of the people. The tremendous rise in case numbers was also threatening to breach the State health system’s surge capacity, he said. “However, the case graph is not going to come down as soon as the lockdown is declared and it will take at least a week before the impact of the lockdown begins to show up as a reduction in new cases.” Mr. Vijayan said the State had readied a good surge plan ahead and had doubled the number of ventilators and ICUs in the government sector. The oxygen position in the State was adequate at present. The State had 6,008 bulk cylinders in storage, 21,888 ‘B’ type cylinders, and 119.7 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in tanks. The State had oxygen stock of 220 metric tonnes, while the daily utilisation of oxygen had risen to 111.49 metric tonnes now. He, however, warned that if disease transmission continued at this pace, no preparations by the State would be enough to cater to the rising number of patients. Vaccination With acute shortage of COVID-19 vaccine continuing in the State, the government would not be able to offer vaccination to the 18-45 year age group in one go, Mr. Vijayan said. Depending on the availability of vaccines, priority could be given in vaccination to those with other diseases or chronic conditions in the 18-45 age group, he said. Though the State had decided to purchase one crore doses of vaccine for vaccinating the 18-45 age group, there had not been much progress in this endeavour. A small part of the quantity asked by the State was expected to be delivered this month and this would be distributed on the basis of priority. Meanwhile, the engagement with the Centre to secure more vaccine stocks for the State would continue, he added. The government would soon come out with a decision fixing the treatment rates for COVID in the private sector, as directed by the Kerala High Court. Mr. Vijayan said the government was grateful to the High Court for intervening in the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dont-drop-caution-at-home-cm/article34511264.ece
08 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Janakeeya hotels mark a milestone||Even as the State moves towards a total lockdown from Saturday, the Kudumbashree mission is set to launch its 100th Janakeeya hotel in the district. The Janakeeya hotels were included in the State Budget for 2020-21 by Minister for Finance T.M. Thomas Isaac as part of the Hunger-free Kerala programme. Inspired by the success of similar initiatives in Alappuzha district, the hotels’ goal was to provide affordable meals to the common man. Envisaged as Kudumbashree enterprises, they provide food for Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per head. During the lockdown last year, the Janakeeya hotels emerged successors to the community kitchens started by local self-government institutions to feed the masses. Home delivery did much to boost their popularity and they continued to operate even after the phased easing of restrictions. As demand shot up, so did their numbers. The 100th Janakeeya hotel is all set for inauguration at Murinjapalam, opposite Cosmopolitan Hospital, in the capital on Monday by former Mayor and incumbent MLA V.K. Prasanth. This exceeds the government target for the Janakeeya hotels in the district by 20. Livelihood to many The hotels have been able to provide a livelihood to nearly 1,000 Kudumbashree women, thus improving their financial security. Vegetables and grocery required are provided by microenterprises (ME) functioning under the Kudumbashree, thereby ensuring an income for them too. The Kudumbashree provides the hotels Rs. 10 as subsidy for a meal. Kudumbashree district mission coordinator K.R. Shaiju says the Janakeeya hotels will remain open during the lockdown and will continue to deliver food. Free food for the most needy will be given away from the new Janakeeya hotel at Murinjapalam from 1 p.m. every day, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/janakeeya-hotels-mark-a-milestone/article34511148.ece
08 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||COVID-19 slowly showing up at Rajaji Nagar colony||Rajaji Nagar (Chenkalchoola) is one of the housing colonies in the capital that remained almost impervious to COVID-19 during its first wave last year, but now in the second wave, some mild cases have been reported from here. On Thursday, as many as 30 residents from here who had tested positive were shifted to the COVID-19 first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at Samethi in Anayara. With more than 1,000 houses on 11.5 acres, physical distancing is not easily achieved here. Yet, right from the initial days of the pandemic, a group of youth from the locality joined hands with the civic authorities to create awareness and take measures to shield the locality from the virus. Several steps These measures, including handwash points, continuous awareness campaigns, and a bar on outsiders for some period, all paid off, with the colony reporting zero cases in the first few months last year. However, with the waning of the first wave, the guard was let down a bit, which seemed to have reflected in the cases being reported from here. “Most of the cases that were reported have been asymptomatic. There was one death in the colony a few days ago, of a 70-year-old person. Only following the tests that were conducted after the death that we came to know that the person had contracted the virus. The second phase came too fast, and now we have stepped up prevention measures like last year. Disinfection is being carried out,” says Akhil, a resident of Rajaji Nagar. Thampanoor ward councillor C. Harikumar says that tests are being carried out among those who remain there. There was a delay in identifying the first few patients, but now all of them have been shifted to FLTCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-19-slowly-showing-up-at-rajaji-nagar-colony/article34511149.ece

This included 8,787 Covishield doses and 649 Covaxin doses. In all, 2,399 people above the age of 45 received their first dose of Covishield, and 5,790, their second dose. Three hundred and fifty people received their first Covaxin dose, and 285, the second jab. A total of 422 front-line workers and 198 health-care workers received their second doses on the day. Double masking People who visit the centres should wear two masks, and take care to maintain a physical distance of two metres from each other. Those who have obtained their first dose from private hospitals could get their second jab from government facilities, the Collector said. The online registration for the next day’s vaccination would be open from 3 p.m. At all the centres, 20% of the doses will be reserved for people who register online and 80% would be set aside for people whose second doses were due though spot registration. Meanwhile, community organisations had been asked to increase facilities for cremations/burials at crematoriums and cemeteries run by them, Subcollector M.S. Madhavikutty said after a meeting with representatives of the organisations. The organisations could seek the district administration’s help for additional manpower.

08 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Congress starts dissection of poll defeat||The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee’s (KPCC) political affairs committee (PAC) on Friday commenced the painful process of dissecting the party’s defeat at the hands of the LDF in the Assembly polls. The details about the internal deliberations were elusive and clouded in speculation. Nevertheless, there were reportedly some attempt to play the blame game. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran decried the bid to scapegoat him. Few leaders reportedly condemned Hibi Eden’s “public denunciation” of Mr. Ramachandran as a “sleeping president”. The PAC urged members to keep criticism within party fora. Mr. Ramachandran said he would step down if the All India Congress Committee (AICC) demanded. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who chaired the election management and strategy committee, owned up responsibility for the Congress’s poor showing. Congress leaders felt the LDF benefited from a marked reluctance among voters to change the government mid-pandemic. Sabarimala issue and corruption charges failed to dent the LDF. Some felt Muslim votes had gravitated towards the LDF in central and southern Kerala. The LDF had projected itself as a better counter to the Bharatiya Janata Party than the Congress. Traditional fealty The LDF also attracted a larger share of Christian voters. Dalit and backward class voters maintained their traditional fealty to the LDF. However, the UDF kept its traditional supremacy among Hindu forward caste voters. Some leaders felt that the Congress party had risked projecting itself as the ideological echo chamber of the BJP by “harping on about Sabarimala”. The subject also failed to make any discernible impression on Hindu voters. In hindsight, the party’s “recriminatory campaign” moored to the UAE gold smuggling case made little impression. The pandemic-hit population seemed more bothered about livelihood and well-being issues. A few leaders felt the Congress had failed in communicating its secular and development-oriented liberal agenda effectively. Its campaign was trapped in the political themes well past their shelf life. The emotive issues had a scarce bearing on the people’s lives as they weathered the pestilence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-starts-dissection-of-poll-defeat/article34511251.ece

Councillors have been raising concerns about the lack of transportation for those who want to get tested. The local bodies have to provide transportation to those suspected of having contacted the virus to and from testing centres, take those who need to be admitted to domiciliary care centres or First Line Treatment Centres or hospitals . The LSGD has stipulated that each local body should have a transport plan based on size, population, and the current rate of increase in positive cases in the local body. One or more persons should coordinate these activities. Grama panchayats should have a minimum of five vehicles, municipalities 10, and corporations 25 vehicles. In case of shortage of ‘108’ ambulances, taxis or ambulances with double chambers can be used for COVID-19-related cases. The vehicles chosen should be available day and night. The local bodies should rent the vehicles or hold talks with cooperative institutions, private institutions, trusts or other institutions with ambulances to use these vehicles. They can also explore the option of speaking to those who are willing to spare their vehicles for the purpose. Arrangements can also be made with autorickshaw and taxi unions. The local body has to provide PPE kits to drivers in such cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-told-to-be-ready-with-transport-plan/article34511259.ece

08 May 2021||ALAPPUZHA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Volunteers save life of COVID-19 patient||Two COVID-19 volunteers have been lauded for saving the life of a COVID-19 patient at Punnapra here on Friday. Earlier, a video of the seriously ill patient seated between two PPE-kit clad persons being shifted to a hospital from a domiciliary care centre on a motorcycle went viral on social media. The patient, identified as a 37-year-old man from Ambalappuzha, reached the domiciliary care centre at the College of Engineering and Management, Punnapra, the other day due to lack of facilities at his home to quarantine himself. On Friday morning, he complained of uneasiness and breathlessness. After being informed of his deteriorating health by other patients, the two COVID-19 volunteers, identified as Ashwin Kunjumon and Rekha, who came there to serve breakfast, immediately attended to him. The duo, with the help of another person, brought the patient from the third floor to the ground floor. They took him to Sagara Co-operative Hospital, Punnapra, about 100 metres away, on a motorbike. The volunteers, associated with the Democratic Youth Federation of India, later said that after seeing the patient, who was showing signs of cardiac arrest, they did not want to wait for an ambulance. “He started to experience breathlessness around 9 a.m. As there were no ambulance or other emergency medical facilities at the centre, the volunteers took him to the hospital on the motorbike of another COVID-19 patient,” said Vishnu P., a COVID-19 patient at the centre who witnessed the incident. Shifted to GH District Collector A. Alexander said he had sought a detailed report from the District Medical Officer (DMO) on the incident. Mr. Alexander said that after the patient reached the hospital, authorities were informed. They dispatched an ambulance and he was shifted to the General Hospital (GH). DMO L. Anithakumari said a probe had been launched and the preliminary findings were shared with the District Collector. “The domiciliary care centre at the Punnapra Engineering College is run by the grama panchayat. Neither the panchayat call centre nor COVID-19 helpline numbers received any call from the centre for help. As the patient’s condition worsened, those at the centre panicked and volunteers appointed by the grama panchayat took him to the hospital without wasting time. As only asymptomatic or patients with mild symptoms are lodged in domiciliary care centres, no doctors or medical facilities are available there,” Ms. Anithakumari said. Praise from CM Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan congratulated the youth who risked their health and transported the COVID-19 patient to the hospital. He slammed media reports that suggested the youth had violated the pandemic protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/volunteers-save-life-of-covid-19-patient/article34510899.ece

08 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||2-week lockdown from May 10 in Karnataka||With the second wave of COVID-19 wreaking havoc in Karnataka and the existing curfew measures not being effective in containing it, the State government on Friday decided to impose a stricter lockdown for 14 days from May 10 to 24. This time, the movement of people, especially in vehicles, will be more strictly monitored and curbed. The State government had earlier clamped a two-week curfew on April 27, and it was to end at 6 a.m. on May 12. After holding a two-hour meeting with officials and Ministers on Friday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced the lockdown measures and said people can buy essential items from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the two-week lockdown. Till now, it was allowed till noon. Not desired impact “The curfew imposed in the State has not yielded the expected result in reducing the infections and death rate,” the Chief Minister admitted. “Total lockdown will be imposed in the entire State from 6 a.m. on May 10 to 6 a.m. on May 24.” All shops and commercial establishments, hotels, pubs, bars, and industries would remain closed during the lockdown. However, all essentials goods and services, such as food items and medicine, would be available for four hours in the morning. Milk booths will be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., said an order issued by Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar.

Movement of all types of goods, including empty goods vehicles, is permitted. Movement of officers/personnel travelling with valid ID issued by their organisation/institution to the place of work and back is permitted. Many violations Though Karnataka is already under curfew, Ministers and legislators admitted that the curfew has not been effective in controlling the pandemic. The current partial lockdown allowed many sectors to operate with 50% staff, including government offices and garment industries.

08 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Question mark over BJP MP’s apology||Bengaluru South BJP MP Tejasvi Surya revisited the South Zone war room on Thursday where he reportedly apologised and expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to those working at the war room when he and three MLAs live-streamed their expose of the alleged bed allotment scam. Two independent sources in the war room confirmed the development and said that Mr. Surya had apologised, though his office put out a tweet claiming that the apology was “fake news”. The MP later retweeted this. However, according to sources in the south zone room, Mr. Surya said it had not been his intention to tarnish them or affect work, but was only trying to do good to citizens. He also reportedly claimed he only read out the list of names given to him by someone, and did not intend to communalise the issue. Repeated calls to Mr. Surya and his office did not elicit a response. Mr. Surya had on Tuesday read out a list of 16 staffers, all Muslims, questioning their role, even as two MLAs — Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya — made communally loaded statements against them. On Thursday, the war room saw nearly 40% absenteeism, which affected emergency services. Those that reported to work said that they received many abusive calls after the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/question-mark-over-bjp-mps-apology/article34510894.ece
08 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police crack diamond jewellery theft case||The Chittoor Urban police on Friday nabbed two persons who were allegedly involved in the theft of Rs. 3 crore worth diamond-studded jewellery and Rs. 90,000 in the house of a Chittoor-based industrialist and Telugu Desam Party leader D.K. Badri Narayana on April 29. Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar and Deputy SP (Law and Order) N. Sudhakar Reddy produced the accused before the media here. The accused, identified as Karri Satish (37) of New Gajuwaka of Visakhapatnam district, and N. Narendra (26) of Bapammur Thanda of Chennapeta mandal of Nalgonda district, were allegedly involved in several crimes in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha, and wanted in over 70 cases each. In the early hours of April 29, the two allegedly broke into the house of the industrialist at the posh BV Reddy Colony, and decamped with jewellery worth Rs. 3.04 crore and a cash of Rs 90,000. They had allegedly sold 90 grams of the valuables to a Kadapa-based jeweller Achari, who had allegedly entered into a deal though he was reportedly aware that it was stolen property. The officials said that four special teams were formed after receiving a complaint from Mr Badri Narayana. The police could solve the case with the help of CC camera footage, mobile signals, verification of prison records and other technical aspects. Detecting the movement of the accused at Reddigunta checkpost on the outskirts of Chittoor, the special teams rushed there in the early hours of Friday. Seeing the police, the accused tried to flee on their motorbike, but were overpowered and nabbed. The accused were produced before the local court, and were remanded in custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-crack-diamond-jewellery-theft-case/article34511541.ece
08 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rise in mental ailments during second COVID wave||A number of people, affected by mental health issues, including anxiety, panic attacks and psychiatric disorders, are seeking attention. The devastating second wave of COVID-19 unleashed since April, had a number of people, affected by a range of mental disorders seeking medical help. “We are seeing that everyone is affected, as they have either a close family member or friend infected, or would have lost some of them to the pandemic. People are affected by a series of disorders, and only some of them are seeking medical help. People complain of insomnia, panic attacks at night, brooding, and a sense of ‘learned helplessness’, and having to be a mute spectator, to the horrific scenes unfolding right in front of their eyes,” said senior psychiatrist D. Phanibhushan. Dr. Phanibhushan said he had been treating patients on the lawn right in front of his residence by following social distancing protocols. Stating there was a sense of apathy and helplessness among the people, he suggested that the State government should make use of voluntary services of senior medical practitioners in these times. “In 2020, the government utilised our services and I offered my free counselling to those calling from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well, and I suggest that the government should utilise our services this time too. Trained counsellors could offer counselling over phone numbers like 104 and district helpline phone numbers. A little bit of counselling can do wonders for the mentally affected persons. Since, most hospitals are now dedicated to COVID care, telephone counselling could be effective,” said Dr. Phanibhushan. Remedies The suggested remedies include engaging the mentally affected people, talking to them, making them walk or do any mild exercise near their homes, treating with mild antidepressants, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rise-in-mental-disorders-during-second-wave-of-pandemic/article34510944.ece
08 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu blamed for curbs on A.P. people travelling to Delhi and Odisha||Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has lashed out at TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu for “spreading falsehood” over the new strain of COVID-19, N440K, as a result of which the governments of Delhi and Odisha have imposed restrictions on the people travelling from Andhra Pradesh. Addressing the media at the party central office here on Friday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy alleged that Mr. Naidu’s aim was to defame the government. “Thanks to Mr. Naidu’s malicious propaganda, the governments of Delhi and Odisha have imposed new restrictions on the people travelling from Andhra Padesh. People visiting these State will now have to be in quarantine for 14 days,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said. “Mr. Naidu lacks knowledge in science or medicine. The CCMB Director has said that ‘N440K’ is not a deadly one and that is it not new as it has already been found in States such as Kerala and Karnataka,” said Mr. Reddy. ‘Cases should be filed’ Accusing Mr. Naidu of portraying people of Andhra Pradesh as “super spreaders,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that cases should be filed against the TDP president for spreading rumours. “As Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Naidu has to give advice to the government. But it has become a habit for him to criticise whatever the government does,” he said. Referring to the steps taken to check the spread of virus, Mr. Reddy said, besides constantly reviewing the situation, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had written letters to the Union government seeking adequate supply of vaccine doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blamed-for-curbs-on-ap-people-travelling-to-delhi-and-odisha/article34511550.ece
08 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Law students advised to study technology||Former Supreme Court Judge Jasti Chalameswar said that students pursuing law will need to have a sound knowledge of technology as well in order to have a flourishing career. Inaugurating the online classes of BA, LLB and BBA, LLB at Vignan University virtually, Justice Chalameswar said that a sound knowledge of subjects like cybersecurity, digital crimes, and integrated legal education will equip law students for the future. “Students pursuing legal education diligently are being rewarded for their hard work,” Justice Chalameswar said. Vignan Group chairman Lavu Rathaiah said that there is a great demand for legal cells across sectors, be it agriculture, industry, sports, or entertainment. “Every firm has a legal cell which requires law professionals,” Dr. Rathaiah said. “We will ensure that students pursuing law would get the highest quality of education. Leading advocates from the High Court will teach at our university and we will send students on internship from the first year itself,” said Dr. Rathaiah. Vice-Chancellor M.Y.

08 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccine delivery by drones set to take off||State government project for using drones to deliver vaccines moved closer to take off with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday granting conditional exemption from certain rules to undertake experimental Beyond Visual Line of Sight flights. “MoCA grants conditional exemption from Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2021 to government of Telangana for conducting experimental Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights for delivery of vaccines,” the Ministry tweeted. Vikarabad has been identified for the project. A release from the office of IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao said the airspace in Vikarabad was already cleared by the Airports Authority of India. It is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Subject to MHA clearances, the project, to deliver vaccines using drones, is planned to start in the 4th week of the month or early June. The drone flights are to be conducted with the Area Hospital in Vikarabad as hub. Spread over 24 days, the programme will involve four batches, of selected firms, perform sorties for six days each. The payload would be vaccine cold storage boxes equipped with temperature sensors and data loggers to record the performance. In each batch, the first two days will be set aside only for VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) flights, followed by BVLOS flights over different distances. The Civil Aviation Ministry’s approval for BVLOS follows the one it gave last month for VLOS flights and was critical to explore feasibility of the intended last mile coverage. “This is because medical centres at remote locations are typically far beyond the VLOS range of the vaccine/medical distribution hubs. The BVLOS clearance is a major step towards testing the drones over long distances and gathering information on their reliability,” the release said. In another tweet, the Union Ministry said “approval of the proposed airspace for trials is to be obtained from MHA. SOPs need to be approved by @DGCAIndia. Trials likely to commence by May end.” Vaccine supplies through drone will mark the beginning of the ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project launched by Mr. Rama Rao in late 2019. It is an initiative of the Emerging Technologies Wing of the State IT Department in partnership with World Economic Forum. An expression of interest released in early 2020, inviting participants for the study, had received 16 applications, of which seven would be undertaking flights under the project in Vikarabad, the release said. IT and Industry Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said success of these trials would establish the use-case and pave the way for adoption of the drones at scale and leveraging them for the healthcare supply chain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccine-delivery-by-drones-set-to-take-off/article34511487.ece
08 May 2021||HYDERABAD/ SANGAREDDY,ANDHRA PRADESH||Digital divide curbs vaccine access||The government-mandated online registration process for COVID-19 vaccination has starkly exposed the digital divide in Telangana, with the Internet savvy urban population cornering access while the poorer, less aware rural people are left out as the second phase is rolled out. Unable to find online slots in the Twin Cities, several urban residents are zeroing-in on available slots in the countryside for their vaccination even though it might mean a drive of nearly 100 km. While the digitally savvy city-dwellers are happily walking out after a jab, the local villagers are struggling to book slots. The divide is clearly visible at the Chinchod Primary Health Centre, 76 km from Hyderabad on the Ranga Reddy-Mahboobnagar district border, where staff are administering COVID jabs to urbanites swooping in as slots are unavailable in the city for 45/60+ citizens. High-end cars line outside the nondescript PHC as nurses step out to vaccinate beneficiaries seated inside the air-conditioned vehicles. Akondi V.M. Rao, 63, and his wife Vasantha Lakshmi are typical of these beneficiaries, who drove from Manikonda in Hyderabad after days of searching for slots, running through lists of postal pin codes before they zeroed on Chinchod. On the other hand, rural residents, many without access to smart phones and lacking the digital skills needed to book slots — many are unaware of the requirement — are left out of the crucial safety net. “Some youth from Kamsanpalle village in Shadnagar are helping a few villagers to register on the CoWIN app. When told by the PHC staff to register their names, the hapless villagers are forced to travel in autos to Shadnagar — the nearest town 23 km away — and search for an Internet kiosk to register their names paying Rs. 10 per head,” said P.V. Siva Kumar of Hyderabad, who drove his wife B. Satyavani to the Chinchod PHC to get her second jab. People like M. Shantamma, 80, of Chinchod were turned away by nurses from the free vaccination drive as she had not registered on the CoWIN app. “We are uneducated, what do we know,” wept the octogenarian as she bent to touch the feet of the nurse. Second jab In erstwhile Medak district, those who have had their first jab are desperate to get the second one but to no avail. Mallikarjun, a teacher in Marepally of Sangareddy district, made a futile bid to get the second dose of vaccination. Its 43 days since he got his first one but there are no slots available. The plight of those who lack literacy is worse as many of them got their first jab on site but are now returning empty-handed everyday as there are no slots. “There are several people in our village who got the first dose of the vaccine. Now, officials are asking them to register their names online. Many do not have smart phones. Several of them do not know how to operate even the keypad-based normal phones. For registration, they have to visit Mee Seva centres, which are at far-off places. Hence, many common people are not showing any interest in getting the second dose. They say that they will get vaccinated whenever the government offers it without any glitches,” said Sudarshan of Teropl village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/digital-divide-curbs-vaccine-access/article34510904.ece
08 May 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Migrants undeterred by lockdown||The Kerala government’s decision to go for a week-long State-wide lockdown seems to have evoked mixed response among the migrant community, going by the initial signs a day before the lockdown. Notwithstanding the reflex impulse among the community to return home at the first sign of uncertainty, a majority of the migrant workers engaged by contractors seems to have chosen to stay back at least for the time being, reassured by their employers’ promise of care during the lockdown and guarantee of jobs thereafter. The same, however, cannot be said about the footloose migrants left to fend for themselves. “They have a desire to return home since the lockdown will render them jobless, making their stay infeasible. It is better for the jobless migrants to return home, as, unlike the last lockdown when they were well taken care of, the healthcare sector and the civil society organisations remain crippled by the fresh onslaught of the pandemic this time. But non-payment of wages are holding them back at many places,” says Benoy Peter, executive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development. ‘Scenario may change’ He says that while there is no panic scramble to return home among migrants as of now, it may change if fatalities rise either here or among their families back in their home States. S. Chithra, State Labour Commissioner, too says that there is no trend of a panic return visible yet. “District Collectors and joint labour commissioners have also confirmed it. Migrants seem to be happy with assured work and high wages here. Besides, a large section of those who desired to return have already done so,” she says. It also seems likely that the government may permit works engaging migrant workers, provided it involves little movement and is contained within a small area. “We have introduced special trains in the West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar belt, which is much in demand among migrant workers,” says a Railway spokesperson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/migrants-undeterred-by-lockdown/article34510902.ece
08 May 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||When will vaccine shortage end, Kerala HC asks Centre||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday directed the Centre to inform the court when a meaningful solution to anti-COVID vaccine scarcity could be found and also when the vaccines ordered by the State government could be made available. The Bench comprising Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath issued the directive on a public interest litigation seeking a directive to the Centre to bring the COVID vaccines under the ambit of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order and allocate sufficient funds to the State government for procuring vaccines. Centre’s respose Assistant Solicitor General P. Vijayakumar, appearing for the Centre, submitted that vaccines were released incrementally when doses were available. It was not possible to distribute vaccine exclusively to a State. There were well-thought out plans to distribute vaccine according to the need and demographic numbers. The Bench said there should be some plan of action for catering to the need of the State government. In fact, a proactive plan had to be chalked out to make available vaccines to the States equally. There was a scare that the people could not get vaccinated because of the scarcity of vaccines. Perils of crowding As a result, those who wanted to be vaccinated flocked to the vaccination centres leading to crowding in the centres. They feared that unless they were vaccinated, their life would be in danger. Crowding at vaccination centres should be avoided as theycwould become super-spreader events. The court noted some isolated incidents of crowding in Palakkad happened because of the communication gap between the officials of the vaccination centre and the police. The court, therefore, directed the authorities of all the vaccination centres to inform local police in advance on vaccination dates. Sufficient police force should be deployed to avoid crowding of people in excess of the available doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-will-vaccine-shortage-end-kerala-hc-asks-centre/article34510893.ece
08 May 2021||ONGOLE/NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cases decline in South Coastal A.P.||In a welcome development, new COVID cases fell by more than 1,000 even as nine more patients succumbed to coronavirus in South Coastal Andhra Pradesh in a span of 24 hours. Health professionals, who have been working overtime to treat the ever-increasing number of patients, had some relief as only 1,915 persons got infected in the last 24 hours ending 9.00 am on Friday as against 2,958 cases registered on the previous day. The number of active cases continued to be high at 28,724. The number of casualties continued unabated as five persons in Prakasam and four in SPSR Nellore district died of COVID during the period. With this, the toll rose to 669 in Prakasam district and 642 in SPSR Nellore district. The gap between the fresh cases and recoveries narrowed to a little less than 500 as one short of 1,000 patients posted recovery in SPSR Nellore district and another 452 in Prakasam district. Meanwhile, patients rushing to the hospitals with breathlessness had a tough time in getting allotment of oxygen-supported beds. Some of them were seen arranging oxygen cylinders/oxygen concentrators on their own while waiting for admission. Friends and relatives of a 55-year-old patient who died while waiting for admission into the Government General Hospital in Ongole staged a protest and alleged that the the patient had died due to delay in starting the medical treatment. State Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy tweeted saying, “I am grateful that during this #pandemic, corporates are coming forward to assist #COVID patients (via #CSR activity). Big thanks to @asianpaints @piramals & @RVR_projects Vizag for arranging #Oxygen cylinders. Request more companies to take this initiative & come forward”. Meanwhile, a Dubai-based NRI P. Mallikarjun, hailing from Singarayakonda in Prakasam district, donated Rs. 50,116 to the District Police Training Centre that has been converted into a COVID Care Centre (CCC) to provide treatment at par with corporate hospitals.

08 May 2021||Railway Kodur (KADAPA),ANDHRA PRADESH||An insect trap that obviates the need for pesticide||This five-foot-tall stand installed in the middle of the farm is touted as a significant intervention that keeps the environment clean as well as fetch the farmers decent returns. Working on a technology promoted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), this solar-powered insect trap kills most of the pests that wreak havoc on crops. How it works Like any other solar device, it stores power in a battery, with which a bulb glows for four hours from sunset. The harmful insects and flies hovering over the crops in search of food get attracted to the bright light and perish on coming into contact with the electrified fence around the bulb. “It is during this warm time that harmful insects invade the farms. As the self-operating light switches off in four to five hours, the crop-friendly insects flying after midnight are not threatened,” explains G. Venkatrama Raju, an ex-serviceman-turned-progressive farmer, who has installed the insect trap in his field. In an interview to The Hindu , Mr. Raju explained that the trap would kill stem borers, bark borers, fruit flies, mango hoppers and sucking pests. “By killing a large number of pests, the trap breaks their life cycle and prevents future generations from taking over the farms,” says Mr. Raju, while clearing the dead insects from the base of the trap using a soft brush. One trap can take care of crops in 8,000 sq. m, or two acres, and farmers can have multiple traps installed for larger extents. The easy-to-operate trap can be handled even by farm assistants. Advantage Working on the economics, he said that an average farmer could get back his investment in a year, or one cropping season. “For example, a farmer growing musk melon in two acres gets the cost back in the very first crop by obviating the need to go for pesticide spray once in five days for 60 days. This not only avoids burning a hole in the pocket but also saves a lot for the environment,” points out Mr. Raju. “A farmer has to plan only for likely viral and fungal infections affecting the crops, as this trap takes care of pest management for 20 years,” Mr. Raju explains. After successfully using the technology for his watermelon farm, the jawan-turned-kisan is contemplating extending it to his banana and papaya farms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/an-insect-trap-to-avoid-pesticides/article34510896.ece

Gunadala village of Dhone mandal in Krunool district as the sponsor has failed to fulfil the conditions stipulated on alienation of land and contribution of public fund for the project. It was at the request of Minister of Finance Buggana Rajendranath Reddy that the TTD had in February 2020 resolved to construct the kalyanamandapam at his native village at a cost of Rs. 5 crore with all modern facilities. The TTD had also written a letter to Mr. Reddy seeking fulfilment of the conditions on alienation of land and payment of Rs. 2 crore towards public contribution. But, much to its dismay, the TTD had received a communication from the Endowments officials in October last stating that one-acre of land belonging to the Lakshmi Chenna Kesava Devasthanam had been allotted to it for the purpose. It had also affirmed that the construction of the kalyanamandapam should be taken up with the TTD funds, and the facility should be handed over to the Lakshmi Chenna Kesava Devasthanam for maintenance. As per the guidelines, it is mandatory for the sponsor to register one acre of plain, undisputed land in a prime location in favour of the TTD free of cost, with full ownership rights over the property, and also pay 40% of the estimated cost of the project as public contribution. The TTD Trust Board, which discussed the issue at length, has deferred the proposal as none of the conditions has been fulfilled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-defers-decision-on-building-kalyanamandapam-in-kurnool-dt/article34511551.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to activate the Agriculture Advisory Boards (AABs) and ensure that they function in coordination with the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Addressing a review meeting on distribution of rice under the Public Distribution System (PDS) and procurement of paddy at the farm gates, on Friday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the AABs should advise the farmers in advance about the crops to be grown and their procurement. Farmers should be educated about the crops that they could grow as an alternative to paddy if the latter did not fetch minimum returns. ‘Keep millers away’ He said there should be no involvement of millers in paddy procurement. District Collectors should procure gunnysacks if necessary and get the grains checked for moisture content before purchasing them. The Chief Minister said the Civil Supplies Department should own up RBKs so that a joint effort could be made to make agriculture profitable, and insisted that there should be no lapses in door delivery of PDS rice. Besides, the rice should be of good quality. The officials informed the Chief Minister that the government had set a target to procure 45.20 lakh tonnes of paddy in 2020-21 rabi season, which was 15% more compared to the previous year. Paddy procurement They said a production of 65.23 lakh tonnes of paddy was expected this year, and 50,000 tonnes were being procured per day. It would be increased to 70,000 tonnes soon.

08 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Raising the bar on teachers to ensure quality education, says Minister||Education Minister A. Suresh on Friday said that the funds being spent on education were aimed at securing a bright future for the students. “Every penny spent today is an investment on future,” he asserted. Speaking after virtually inaugurating an online training session for primary school teachers organised by the School Education Department’s Samagra Shiksha wing, the Minister said only a good teacher could contribute towards quality education. He said teachers should discourage students from resorting to the rote model of education, and instead encourage them to think out of the box. Mr. Suresh said after closely studying various education models, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) had compiled syllabus of very high standards. Bi-lingual books Bi-lingual books, though an expensive affair, had been printed to help the teachers and students to migrate from Telugu to English medium with ease, and also because they were in line with the chief components of the National Education Policy-2020. Besides, workbooks had also been supplied to the students, he added. The Minister said, as part of the proposal to introduce CBSE syllabus from Class VII in a phased manner, it was planned that Class 10 students of 2024-25 batch would write the CBSE exams.  Knowledge base knowledge base He said teachers in government schools, recruited through the District Selection Committee (DSC), had a sound knowledge base. All they needed was training in English medium, which was being done now. The Minister urged the teachers to utilise the 50-hour training programme, comprising 24 live programmes, where resource persons drawn from the SCERT and Anna University would train them. Pre-primary schools To catch children young, YSR Pre-Primary Schools were being set up for children between three and six years. Teachers of the pre-primary schools were also being trained on how to handle children and also tutor them in rhymes and other activities. Class 10 exams The Minister said in view of the intensity of the virus surge, all schools had to be closed down. The Class 10 exams would be conducted whenever the situation permitted, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/raising-the-bar-on-teachers-to-ensure-quality-education-says-minister/article34511545.ece

A Vijayawada-bound 18-tonne oxygen tanker went missing late in the night on Thursday. Nearly 400 patients who are presently being treated at the Government General Hospital here were dependent on the tanker for their survival. Within minutes of the tracking system failing, Vijayawada Commissioner of Police B. Sreenivasulu alerted all the Superintendents of Police, whose jurisdiction falls on the way to Vijayawada from Odisha. All the alerted units of the Andhra Pradesh Police swung into action and traced the tanker to a dhaba at Dharmavaram in East Godavari district. Investigation revealed that the driver halted at the dhaba owing to fatigue caused by a number of trips undertaken by him. Understanding the situation, orders were given by higher officials to the local police to ensure that an experienced home guard accompanied the driver throughout the way and that the tanker was escorted to the destination using the ‘green channel’ as soon as possible, according to a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-create-green-corridor-to-ensure-oxygen-tanker-reaches-hospital-on-time/article34510948.ece
08 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC suspends G.O. on Sangam Dairy takeover||Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Friday issued an interim order suspending the G.O. dated April 27, through which the government proposed to take over Sangam Dairy, and directed that while its administration and management should continue to be exercised by the directors, Tenali Sub-Collector should not be present on the premises of the producer company or take part in its operations or administration. The court observed that the posting of an IAS officer would lead to administrative difficulties as it (Sangam Dairy) was a process industry that required special expertise. It said the regular day-to-day activities, payment of salaries and statutory dues and contractual obligations could be carried out by the company as before. However, the court restrained the Board of Directors from creating any further charge, encumbrance, etc. on the company’s properties and from alienating, mortgaging or transferring movable and immovable assets without obtaining prior permission of the court, which allowed the normal business activities to continue without any hindrance. The directors had challenged the proposed take over, questioning the authority with which the government issued the order. They refuted the allegation that the dairy was converted from a mutually aided cooperative society to a company fraudulently. The ACB had registered a case against company chairman and former MLA Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar and MD P. Gopala Krishnan, accusing them of committing various irregularities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-suspends-go-on-sangam-dairy-takeover/article34511558.ece

In a representation made to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh, Federation president K. Bhanu Murthy and general secretary P. Panduranga Varaprasada Rao said that teachers come under the Vacation Department and that was why they were not entitled for 30 earned leaves availed by the non-Vacation Department employees. Immediately after declaring holidays for schools, teachers were asked to come to school. “This is at a time when the virus surge is at dangerous proportions. It has already claimed the lives of more than 200 teachers,” said Mr. Rao. CBSE syllabus Referring to the government proposal to introduce CBSE syllabus for students of Class VII from the next academic year, the Federation leaders said a similar attempt made in the past proved to be a failure, prompting authorities to revert back to the SCERT syllabus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/teachers-resent-work-in-summer-holidays/article34510949.ece

In a statement, the Collector said there was a need to identify four to five permanent vaccination centres in every municipal corporation, municipality and panchayat body.

VSEZ Development Commissioner A.

Ratification by UAC “In normal circumstances, such proposals is sent to the Unit Approval Committee (UAC). But given the exigency, the same was approved by a committee of the VSEZ, and the same will now be sent to UAC for ratification,” said Mr. Rama Mohan Reddy.

08 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Needed: authentic information in real time||On Thursday, Ch. Swamy, an employee of a CPSU, had to take his 65-year-old father who tested positive for COVID-19 to at least seven hospitals seeking a bed equipped with oxygen facility. After about one hour of frantic search, Mr. Swamy could finally get his gasping father admitted in a notified private hospital. “Shouldn’t there be a platform, or a portal that gives the right and updated information on beds available at the hospitals?” questions Mr. Swamy. Spurt in COVID-19 cases and the consequent shortage in the supply of beds, oxygen and life-saving medicines, there is a growing demand for a detailed and a comprehensive portal, or App that provides accurate information in real time. Role of IT “Lack of authentic information is confusing people. The State government and the district administration are doing their best to provide it. But more authentic, updated and real time information is needed. That is where information technology comes in,” says Ravi Eswarapu, former president of IT Association of Andhra Pradesh (ITAAP). “The State government has portals, but the information is not updated. At times, they do not function. What we need is a portal on the lines of the one provided by the Delhi government,” says E.A.S. Sarma, a former Union Secretary. Industry experts say that the portal should give comprehensive real-time information. Availability of beds “Apart from the summary and status of cases, it should focus on showing the availability of beds in each of the COVID-designated hospitals, with specific information on beds with oxygen supply, normal beds, ICU beds and beds with ventilator support. And, most importantly, it should be on real-time basis,” they say. “The portal should also give details on testing labs and vaccine centres with phone numbers, addresses and timings for testing and vaccination. It should also provide numbers of telemedicine,” they say. The experts also say that the portal will not be complete without an FAQ column, with answers for all COVID-related issue. Initial focus “Such a portal is the need of the hour. The IT sector can chip in if the State government, or the district administration desires so. It may be difficult to put such a comprehensive portal in place immediately. But it can be done in phases, with the initial focus being on availability of beds,” Sridhar Kosaraju, ITAAP president, told The Hindu . “It can be worked out on a war-footing in partnership with the government, but private hospitals have to come forward to update the data in real time. They need not focus on rates. But, the entry and exit of patients should be updated on real-time basis. To ensure this, the government should appoint a nodal officer,” he said. Experts in Fluentgrid, who have already set up a COVID Command Control Centre at the GVMC, said that the CCC could also be ramped up and integrated to the portal for better COVID care management. BMC model Mr. Sarma suggested that the State government could follow the system adopted by the Bombay Municipal Corporation, which initiated the reach-the-patient model by creating a patient-friendly system. Under this system, the BMC Commissioner was able to control the COVID-19 surge, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/needed-authentic-information-in-real-time/article34511560.ece

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Delay in POCSO trial will not entitle accused to bail: HC||The accused booked under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, cannot get benefit of release on bail if trial courts are unable to record evidence of the victim-child within 30 days or complete the trial within one year from the date of taking cognisance of offences, the High Court of Karnataka has held. “The object and purpose of Section 35 of the POCSO Act is to ensure that the victim-child is secured from the trauma of trial of the case at the earliest so that she or he could be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society at the earliest. The said provision is not to be interpreted in favour of the accused so as to mandate release of the accused,” the court said while interpreting the law. The court issued a series of directions to the State government for effective implementation of the Act and for welfare of child victims. A Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice M.G. Uma delivered the verdict while answering the reference made by a judge on whether delay in recording of evidence of victim and completion of trial could result in favour of accused for enlargement on bail. “In our view, non-compliance of Section 35 of the POCSO Act cannot be the basis for releasing the accused on bail as that would be a misreading of the provision,” the Bench said. The Bench pointed out that one has to bear in mind the fact that the docket explosion under the POCSO Act is not commensurate with sufficient number of special courts being constituted with the requisite human resources as well as infrastructure. “It may be practically impossible for the trial court to conclude the trial within one year from the date of cognisance by the said court in a majority of the cases. But, that does not give a right to the accused to seek bail for the reason...,” the Bench observed. Dedicated units The Bench also directed the government that a dedicated unit had to be set up in every district hospital to attend to the victim and provide proper medical facility. The assistance of mental health professionals should be provided to every child victim to overcome trauma, and their rehabilitation and reintegration should be done at the government’s cost, the Bench said. Directing judges oftrial courts to ensure compliance to the deadline fixed in the POCSO Act, the court said they should ensure that “justice delivery system does not in any way contribute to the trauma, mental disturbance and anxiety of the victim-child, which could lead to severe impact on the behaviour and personality of the child”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/delay-in-pocso-trial-will-not-entitle-accused-to-bail-hc/article34510892.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy not to go ahead with the decision to sell away 10.39% of its stake in Gangavaram Port to the Adani Group. In a letter to the Chief Minister on Friday, FDNA general secretary A. Aja Sarma said that the land given to the Gangavaram Port by then State government was spread over 2,800 acres, which was originally acquired for the Visakhakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The previous government had allotted the land to the Gangavaram Port at a cost much below the market price. “Had the then government given it at the market price, it would have held 90% of the stake and the Gangavaram Port would have been in the public sector now. The decision had benefitted the private port,” said Mr. Aja Sarma. The State government is now planning to sell away 10.39 % of its stake to the Adani group for Rs. 645 crore, which is much lower than the market price of the land fixed by the Registration and Stamps Department, he said, adding that people were agitating over the decision to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The proposed sale of Gangavaram Port land to the Adani group and the decision of the Centre to sell away the VSP land to the POSCO would give undue advantage to these private players, said Mr. Aja Sarma. He urged the government to review the Cabinet decision. The Adani Group has acquired the 89.61% of stake from two private entities and is planning to acquire the government’s share in the port. It would give it freedom to act as per whims and fancy, he said and demanded that the government take over the port.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fdna-opposes-move-to-sell-away-govts-stake-in-gangavaram-port/article34511571.ece

08 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Women rule the roost in corporations, municipalities||Women walked away with top positions of the municipal corporations and municipalities for which the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) finalised its candidates after winning majority seats in the elections conducted recently. It is also the first time that Khammam and Warangal corporations will be ruled by women occupying both the Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts. The TRS has also ensured that the Muslim minority women got a major share of the top positions. Siddipet, Kothur and Jadcherla municipalities will also see women as chairpersons. Former Rajya Sabha member Gundu Sudharani took oath as the Mayor of the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) on Friday as the choice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Rizwana Shameem from the TRS will be the Deputy Mayor. Observers In Khammam, Punukollu Neeraja was elected as the Mayor and Fathima Johra the Deputy Mayor. The Chief Minister sent in observers for the election along with names finalised by the party for municipal corporations and municipalities that went to polls recently. Ms. Sudharani was the Rajya Sabha member from the Telugu Desham Party (TDP) from 2010 but joined the TRS after the formation of Telangana.

Indrakaran Reddy, Gangula Kamalakar and Errabelli Dayakar informing the corporators about the choice of the top posts by the Chief Minister. The corporators were asked to support Ms. Sudharani and Ms. Shameem for unanimous election. Out of the 66 corporators, TRS won in 48 divisions while BJP emerged successful on 10 divisions. Congress managed to win four while others won four. In Siddipet, the party chose Kadavergu Manjula as the Chairperson while Jangiti Kanakaraju will be the Vice-Chairman.

The recent elections to the seven ULBs in Telangana, held during the ongoing pandemic, the process for which was concluded on Friday with the indirect election of Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson posts, have set many precedents for such processes held during pandemic situations. Curtailing the period of campaigning, restrictions on campaigning, on holding rallies, road shows and meetings, extending the silence period to 72 hours before the commencement of polling, restricting number of persons in campaigning teams only to five, including the candidate, restrictions on the number of vehicles allowed in road shows and allowing campaigning only between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. were some of the firsts the recent ULB elections saw. Although there was large-scale criticism,the SEC carried out the exercise with several precautions and restrictions.Making COVID-negative certificate mandatory for all staff involved in polling and counting exercises was also one of the firsts, according to the SEC authorities. SEC C. Parthasarathi said that it was for the first time in the country that ULBs’ members, who were in isolation due to the infection, were administered oath virtually. Exchange of garlands, shawls and bouquets was also not allowed during the ULB chiefs’ election.

08 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Second dose is priority now, says DPH||There is relief in store for scores of people, especially senior citizens, who had been endlessly waiting and running around for the second dose of the COVID vaccine with the government making it clear that the priority till May 15 will be to ensure they get the available stocks at the designated vaccination points. “The government has decided to give importance to those waiting for their second dose as per the due dates as it will provide them full protection against the coronavirus. Since the Co-WIN app does not provide any facility to indicate the same, we have requested the Centre to tweak it so that these sections can get early access,” said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao on Friday. There are 3.75 lakh doses — 4.69 lakh of Covishield and 2.16 lakh of Covaxin — available with the government whereas there are 5 lakh people who need the second dose. That means 1.20 lakh doses backlog of both vaccines. The government is expecting another 3.11 lakh doses by May 15 and plans to complete the second dose round completely before focusing on those seeking the first dose. Those eligible for second dose will be given the jab at government vaccination centres with six-week interval for Covishield and four weeks for Covaxin from the date of taking first dose. All persons eligible for second dose will be permitted to take vaccine by spot registration by showing their certificate of partial vaccination. The arrangement is for May 8-12 period except May 9 (Sunday). “We are preparing a list with the data available with us to send messages to the people eligible for second dose. Entire vaccine distribution is in the hands of the Centre. The Chief Minister has already sought 2-2.5 lakh doses more. We are hopeful of receiving them soon,” he said. Dr Srinivasa Rao also stated that the schedule for vaccinating the 18-44 years age group would be announced based on the vaccine supplies. “There is no need to get alarmed as vaccine production has been enhanced and everyone would get it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/second-dose-is-priority-now-says-dph/article34511477.ece

Ramesh Reddy said n Friday that two triage centres were coming up at TIMS (Gachibowli) and Gandhi Hospital so that patients need not be kept waiting in ambulances before getting a bed. These facilities will have beds with oxygen supply so that the healthcare personnel can immediately attend to them before a bed is made available. Dr. Reddy told a press conference flanked by Director of Public Health, Dr. Rao, that Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar had visited the Gandhi Hospital to check the upcoming facility and efforts were on a war footing to increase the bed strength from 9,000 to 15,000 in the capital. At least 100 beds more with oxygen facility were being added within a month under sheds to meet the demand, he said. “There is no shortage of oxygen or Remedisivir injections as far as government hospitals are concerned as we have sufficient stocks. We have also begun procurement of monitors and other needy medical equipment to cater to the increased number of beds. Out patient clinics have been opened in all health centres across the districts,” he explained. A committee of experts would decide on genuine demands from private hospitals for any medicine as they do not want to give any scope for any kind of hoarding of life saving drugs. The CS also opened the new 2,000-litres-a-day oxygen tank in Gandhi where a new 160-bed ICU facility has been created. “Right now there is no shortage but if the cases rise further we many have an issue with oxygen as supply from other States have been stopped.

The judicial commission should probe into the issue and steps should be taken to ensure that those guilty of irregularities, irrespective of their position, be booked. The party expressed concern that the lack of coordination between the Revenue and Registration departments was giving scope for irregularities and steps should be taken to protect over 2 lakh acres of land that reportedly went into the hands of ‘ineligible’ people. State CPI secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said in a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that the alleged purchase of assignment land by former Minister Eatala Rajender had led to a debate on the transactions involving assignment and other land yet again. The government had ordered an inquiry by a four-member IAS officers’ team, but the report submitted would be of little use as the transactions happened with the knowledge of the Revenue officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpi-for-judicial-panel-probe-into-land-deals/article34511489.ece

Reinforcing its dominance over the KMC, the ruling party bagged both the Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts by virtue of its majority in the new council. The party has won 43 of the total 60 wards and its ally the CPI bagged two wards in the just concluded elections to the KMC. The Congress has won 10 wards and its ally the CPI (M) bagged two wards. The BJP has won just one ward and the independent candidates emerged victorious in two wards. The TRS has not only retained its sway over the KMC by winning the urban local body (ULB) for the second consecutive term but handed over the reins of the ULB to women. In 2012, the Khammam Municipality was upgraded to Municipal Corporation and the maiden election to the KMC were held in 2016. Dr. G Papa Lal of the TRS was the first mayor of the KMC. As the KMC Mayor post was reserved for women (General) this time, there were many aspirants for the coveted post among the newly-elected women corporators of the ruling party. The TRS leadership has communicated the names of the party’s nominees for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts to the newly-elected corporators through a sealed cover at a meeting held earlier in the day, sources said.

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A predictable drama||The Telugu film Thank You Brother , which is streaming on Aha, deals with a potentially interesting ‘what if?’ scenario. An affluent, entitled brat who squanders his mother’s money and indulges in one night stands is stuck in an elevator with a heavily pregnant woman from a middle-class background. The rest of the story is easy to guess. It could have been an intriguing suspense drama, but for its rather simplistic narrative. In its 90-minute duration, director Ramesh Rapathi’s film spends roughly half the time narrating the stories of the two primary characters. Abhi (Viraj Ashwin) doesn’t bat an eyelid before blowing up Rs. 85000 on a night out with friends. He hooks up with women and kicks up a storm when his mother (Archana Ananth) tries to explain that he is turning out to be arrogant He resents that his mother moved on after his father’s death to find a soulmate in Dr Prem (Anish Kuruvilla). The friends, played by Viva Harsha and others, are made to dish out lame jokes. Viraj Ashwin befits the part of a rich brat, but he has a long way to go as an actor. As Priya, Anasuya Bharadwaj has a commanding screen presence and tries to portray her character with all the earnestness she can muster. We get an idea of the bond she shared with her late husband (Aadarsh Balakrishna in a cameo) and how she now shoulders financial responsibilities, helped by a caring mother in law (Annapurna). We get that Abhi and Priya are polar opposites, but it would have been nicer to know some more about the circumstances that made them the people they are. Characters needn’t always be starkly black or white. Of the two, Anasuya’s character is etched out better and she tries to carry the weight (pardon the pun) of the film. In the later portions, there are no surprises. The lockdown and therefore the heightened constraints add to the suspense. The elevator portions give a sense of the claustrophobia (cinematography by Suresh Ragutu) the two protagonists are up against. If only the preceding portions had some more nuance, the impact of the later portions would have been better. I haven’t seen the 2019 Nigerian film Elevator Baby , but this one is just about passable.

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine woes: citizens complain of glitches in government portal||A week into the vaccination drive for people in the 18-44 age group, several of those trying to book appointments complained of glitches on the online portal. They alleged that the booking process was tedious with available slots “vanishing” within seconds. Deepika Bhatia, a teacher said: “After months of waiting, when the government announced vaccines for the 18+ category, I thought that finally, it was our turn to feel safe. But soon I realised the ground reality. I have been trying to book an appointment since April 28 but all in vain. Vaccine day comes with more than the shot, including the frustration that one goes through while finding a centre. As soon as you hit ‘confirm’, they show a message that the centre is fully booked.” She said one can’t do much when it comes to choosing a centre, which is nearby. “Several of the ones which I tried booking were still restricting it to 45+ age group. Searching for slots using the CoWIN portal was cumbersome and so my second choice was sites developed by third parties even though one would still require to visit the government portal, which would always be fully booked within a fraction of a second,” she added. Like Ms. Bhatia, several others said they turned to updates on social media and other mobile apps, which send alerts on slots opening up in each district. Ayanti Ghosh, a public relations executive, said: “The government portal most of the times doesn’t show any empty slots as they vanish within seconds of opening up. One has to be really onto the website for hours to be able to get lucky to find a slot. After three days of such an intense process, a friend told me about this app where immediate alerts were being sent for empty slots. It was through those alerts that I managed to book a slot in one of the government schools.” Describing the process as “infuriating,” Barathi Nakkeeran, a researcher, said: “I had been trying to book an appointment since the day the portal opened up. It was infuriating as, by the time we reached the page after logging in, the slots would get filled. After a few days, I got to know about links on social media that were updating the slots. It was through one such update that I finally managed to book a slot in a school in Chattarpur. However, there have even been instances when despite the notification, by the time we reached the page, the slots were all booked.” Long distances covered Due to the restrained availability of vaccines, people are also traveling across NCR in order to get the jab. Andrew Lu, a 37-year-old media professional from Noida, said he was not able to find an available slot for the first dose of the vaccine in Noida or Gautam Budhha Nagar district. “I was able to book a slot in Najafgarh — about 50km from where I live. My friend had informed me about the available slots at the place. The process was quite smooth and because of the lockdown, there was no traffic on the roads,” he said. Gurugram resident Arani Chaudhuri said he had to travel to Lajpat Nagar for the vaccine due to the unavailability of slots in the vicinity. “The only hurdle was that I had to travel to Lajpat Nagar. Other than that, the process was smooth. One has to keep checking the portal at various times of the day. I got a slot in the fourth attempt,” said Mr. Chaudhuri. Anupama Dhawan from Indirapuram arranged a jab for her 80-year-old father at a Central government hospital in the Capital after she was turned away from a private hospital in Ghaziabad where she was scheduled to receive her first dose and her father his second. “We had an appointment but when we reached according to our time slot we were asked to return because there was no stock available. Both of us then travelled to Delhi the next day and got vaccinated. The process was smooth,” she said. Ghaziabad resident Sushant Kumar (name changed) said he had to ask his elder brother, a media professional, to “pull some strings”, so he could get his jab on time. “My brother arranged a shot for me by making some requests; I went to a school in the New Delhi district and got vaccinated earlier this week. I am a bank employee and need to go to office on a daily using public transport and hence I wanted to get vaccinated as earlier as possible,” he said.

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Lockdown 2021 less stringent than last year’||The lockdown rules in Delhi this year might resemble the ones in 2020, but there is a significant difference — there is traffic on the roads with most people out taking care of COVID-19 patients or arranging supplies for them. Last year, the roads were deserted, police barricades were put up at regular intervals checking for an e-pass and there was no public transport.  City under medical crisis The police said unlike the previous lockdown, the situation is different this time. The city is under a medical crisis and people are running from pillar to post to arrange or refill oxygen cylinders and they can’t be stopped, they said. There are many exempted categories in this curfew. “We have witnessed vehicles on the road as people are out for medical assistance. People with genuine reasons have not been fined. And inter-State movement is also not restricted. So, people from NCR are also visiting Delhi for medical reasons,” said a senior officer. Many feel there is self-discipline among people this year. “I have never been stopped in the four to five times I have stepped out. I feel the lockdown is less stringent than last time because the police also realise the helpless situation and how many people are out on the road to coordinate oxygen and medicine for their loved ones,” said Sayan Kundu, a development researcher. Ritu Singh had to pick up medicine, which was in short supply, from a friend in North Delhi and deliver it to another friend in Dwarka. She said she was prepared with the prescriptions and other details to share with the police if she was stopped but said it was a smooth journey. “When the weekend curfew started, there were many volunteers on the road checking for passes. But now, I think everybody in Delhi is scared and not roaming around unnecessarily,” Ms. Singh said. In other parts of the NCR, checks have been more stringent. Police barricades at borders and checkpoints on main roads have been put in place across Noida and Greater Noida with checking round-the-clock. The lockdown in the district, which was initially supposed to be in effect till Thursday, was extended till Monday. “The market has been shut since last week and only medical shops are being allowed to open,” said Pradeep Suryavanshi, a businessman based in Noida’s sector 18. “A checkpoint has been made on the main road right near the metro station overlooking the market where e-passes are checked. I had to pick up some documents from my office yesterday [Thursday], but was asked to return from the checkpoint because I didn’t have an e-pass,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lockdown-2021-less-stringent-than-last-year/article34511456.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh asked the Ministries of Health and Education and the Delhi government to respond to the plea by three lawyers. Additionally, the court asked whether the COVID-19 vaccines being used now can be administered to those below 18 years of age. Both the Delhi government and Central government’s Standing Counsel informed the court that the Class X board exams have been cancelled and that of Class XII postponed. The court was hearing a plea by advocates Jyoti Aggarwal, Sanjivani Aggarwal and Pradeep Shekhawat. The plea said as per news reports the new strain of COVID-19 affecting youngsters the most and hence, the students appearing for the exams need to be vaccinated on an urgent basis if the examinations cannot be held online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/notice-sent-to-centre-delhi-govt-on-petition-to-vaccinate-board-students/article34511452.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||105 more oxygen concentrators seized from city eateries, search on for owner||The police on Friday said they are conducting raids in search of the owner of those restaurants from where they have recovered 523 oxygen concentrators. They said they have arrested CEO of Matrix Cellular Services Gourav Khanna for his alleged involvement in the case. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said in a follow-up raid, they have recovered 105 more concentrators from Town Hall and Khan Chacha restaurants in Khan Market at the instance of accused Hitesh, who was arrested on Thursday. “A total of 523 oxygen concentrators have been recovered till now,” said an officer. He said the concentrators were recovered during raids at restaurants in Lodhi Colony on Thursday and Khan Market on Friday. They said Navneet Kalra, is the owner of the eateries — Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege Ju — from where the concentrators have been recovered. “His phone is switched off. We are going through details to identify his role in the case,” said the officer. Police said the managing director of Matrix Cellular Services, Gagan Duggal, had imported oxygen concentrators in December. He contacted Mr. Kalra for the sale of the same in April. His restaurants were used as booking centres and pickup points. Mr. Kalra allegedly sent WhatsApp messages to his friends regarding the sale of the concentrators for Rs. 70,000-Rs. 80,000 each, the police said. Efforts are on to nab other offenders, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/105-more-oxygen-concentrators-seized-from-city-eateries-search-on-for-owner/article34511460.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two arrested for black marketing of Remdesivir||A tuition teacher and a security guard were arrested for black marketing of Remdesivir injections, in two separate incidents on Friday, police said. According to police, on Thursday, information was received about a person coming near Nangloi Metro Station to deliver Remdesivir injections at exorbitant price. A trap was laid and the accused was apprehended. The accused was identified as Prahlad Kumar, a resident of Rohini Sector-7. Three Remdesivir injections were recovered from his possession. Interrogation revealed that Kumar has been working as a security guard at Agrasen International Hospital, Sector-22, Rohini for the last two years. The accused, who was posted at the COVID ward of the hospital, used to steal the injections lying on the bedside tray of patients while they were asleep. He came to deliver three injections at Rs. 20,000 each, police said. Similarly, in south-east district, a tuition teacher was arrested for allegedly overcharging COVID-related medicines, police said. The accused has been identified as Abhishek Pruthi, a resident of Govindpuri. He is a private tuition teacher, they said. On Tuesday, Kalkaji police got information that one Abhishek Pruthi is demanding higher rate for Remdesivir injection. During investigation, a raid was conducted and the accused was nabbed from his residence. Pruthi disclosed that his family members had become COVID positive and at that time, he had purchased COVID related medicines. After his family members recovered, he decided to earn money by selling these at higher rates, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/two-arrested-for-black-marketing-of-remdesivir/article34511458.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ensure food security to migrants, daily wagers: NGO writes to CM||The Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA) on Friday wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, urging him to ensure food security for migrants, daily wagers, and other vulnerable groups who do not possess ration cards. In the letter, the DRRAA said: “Over the last few days, on account of the continuing lockdown, the condition of daily wagers, migrant workers, residents of slums — who do not possess ration cards — has become even more precarious. In such a scenario, it is inexplicable why the government has not revived the e-coupon scheme, under which last year 60 lakh people who did not possess ration cards were provided free foodgrains.” The DRRAA has also demanded that the distribution of foodgrains to ration cardholders be started immediately without delay for May. “We are shocked to note that despite the first week of May coming to an end, ration distribution for the month has not started in any of the ration shops [70 audited by DRRAA]. This is alarming as Delhi is in the third week of lockdown. Those who have lost their livelihood are dependent on the foodgrains provided under the PDS to feed themselves and their families,” the letter read. The DRRAA also said setting up 250 hunger relief centres as compared to 2,500 last year was not enough to address the problem. DRRAA suggests “Start an effective hunger helpline. Give wide publicity to the helpline to record all SOS requirements of food and ration and make provision to address the same. Provide rations to all needy persons who do not possess a ration card by reviving the e-coupon scheme under the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayata Yojana, or initiating other programme or schemes for this purpose,” the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/ensure-food-security-to-migrants-daily-wagers-ngo-writes-to-cm/article34511462.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks govt. response on plea for 3 meals/day in shelter homes||The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the Delhi government on a petition seeking to provide three meals a day to inmates of all shelter homes in the city during the ongoing pandemic. The court also sought response from the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) on the petition filed by Bandhua Mukti Morcha (BMM). The BMM, which works for the marginalised people in the country, has sought implementation of DUSIB’s October decision, taken in its board meeting, to provide three meals a day in the shelter homes. Delhi government Standing Counsel said the three meals a day scheme was discontinued last year and only two meals are being provided now. “Most of the workers staying at shelter homes don’t have any documents. Some are inter-State migrant workers, who don’t have a Delhi-based ration card. Therefore, the workers have little means to feed themselves and their children,” the plea said. “In the shelter homes, people are reported to be sick. However, the isolation centres which were running in 2020 have been closed,” BMM said. Additionally, the petition sought directions to “provide soaps, detergents, hand sanitizers, handwash and masks to urban homeless in all shelter homes in the national capital and also medical aid”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-for-3-mealsday-in-shelter-homes/article34511453.ece

The accused identified as Sunny, a resident of Nangloi, has cheated seven such victims and obtained Rs. 1 lakh. Few days ago, a woman who was tested positive and admitted to Max Hospital Saket, was in need of a plasma donor. Guneet Singh Jaggi, the complainant’s relative, got a contact number of a person on Facebook who could provide plasma donor. As he was in dire need, he contacted the man, who demanded Rs. 50,000 for arranging the plasma. But after Rs. 10,000 was transferred into his account, he started ignoring calls and messages of the complainant before switching off the phone.

08 May 2021||Mumbai,||BJP questions move to redevelop MLA hostel at the time of corona||As the Congress questions the Central government’s expenditure on the central vista project in Delhi, Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra has now questioned the decision of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to issue Rs. 900 crore tenders for the redevelopment of Manora MLA hostel at the time of the pandemic. The Congress shot back saying the hostel was demolished by the previous BJP-led State government and the delay in redevelopment had already cost the State exchequer Rs. 700 crore as every month around Rs. 3.5 crore was being paid to MLAs, including those of the BJP. BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar on Thursday tweeted, “Rs 900 crore tender has been issued by the Thackeray government for the MLA hostel. This seem to have slipped the eyes of those advising the Prime Minister to focus on vaccination rather than the construction of the parliament complex. Tell the Chief Minister to focus on corona pandemic. He will get the percentage there as well.” Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said the decision to revamp the MLA hostel was taken by the Devendra Fadnavis government in 2018. “Agency NBCC appointed by them demolished structure. Due to delay govt has already lost more than Rs. 700 cr - as every month around Rs. 3.5 crs are being paid to MLAs, even BJP MLAs are paid Rs. 1 lakh each,” he said. The BJP MLA alleged that the projected expenditure by the Fadnavis government was Rs. 600 crore while the MVA government increased it by Rs. 300 crore. “We think there are a number of irregularities involved and therefore the tender price has increased so much. The Chief Minister must cancel the tenders and if he fails to do so, the BJP will lead an agitation against the project,” he said. Mr. Sawant said a high-powered committee took the decision to hand over the work to the State Public Works Department last year and a provision of Rs. 875 crore was made for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-questions-move-to-redevelop-mla-hostel-at-the-time-of-corona/article34511142.ece
08 May 2021||Mumbai,||‘Invite philanthropists to set up LPG crematoria’||The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court on Friday directed authorities to invite philanthropists, industrialists, people’s representatives, and non-government organisations to come forward to set up LPG crematoriums. The Special Public Prosecutor told a Division Bench of Justices Ravindra Ghuge and B.U.Debadwar that LPG crematoriums would be established at various places by the end of May. The court was also informed that there were two LPG crematoriums in Ahmednagar. The Bench has directed all authorities to increase rapid antigen tests at rural hospitals so that the test results, which are made available in 30 minutes, could be conveyed immediately to infected persons and they could be shifted to COVID Care Centres. The Bench passed this direction after noting that residents of far-flung villages on developing symptoms of COVID-19 rushed to primary health centres where RT-PCR tests may not be available, so they had to travel to a city, and by the time the results were conveyed, time was lost. Two days were crucial for the infection to reach the lungs and could turn out to be fatal in many cases, the court said. The court took cognisance of news reports that showed people wearing masks below the chin, keeping their nose and mouth open. The court said, “We find that the problem with citizens is that they are unable to discipline themselves. People take pride in hanging their masks on their chin, and also hang their helmets rather than wearing them. They wear it only after they see a traffic police officer.” The court went on to say, “It is unfortunate that people have to be advised to protect themselves and they have to be penalised to make them protect themselves, as if they have no responsibility towards themselves. Each citizen desires to blame the administration and the government for the increase in novel coronavirus cases.” “It is shameful that we have to pass orders to make masks and helmets compulsory, as if it is only the duty of the administration and not the duty of the people. We therefore observe that the administration, which includes the police, shall strictly implement COVID-19 restrictions and ensure that people wear masks and helmets,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/invite-philanthropists-to-set-up-lpg-crematoria/article34511141.ece
08 May 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Fire breaks out at ND Studio, no casualties||The set of Jodhaa Akbar at ND Studio at Khalapur in Raigad district was partially damaged after a major fire broke out on Friday afternoon. No casualties were reported. Around five fire tenders from the Khopoli Municipal Council, Karjat Municipal Council, MIDC Patalganga, and Panvel Municipal Corporation were sent to the spot. Khalapur tehsildar Iresh Chappalwar said, “As soon as I got to know about the blaze, I called for fire tenders. The set was made of fibre and hence, dousing the fire was a challenge. The fire broke out around 12 p.m. and till 5 p.m., the firefighting operation was on.” According to Mr. Chappalwar, there is a railway track adjoining the set and someone had set dry grass near the track on fire. “The blaze spread and engulfed one corner of the set. The estimate of the losses and the exact area that was damaged will be calculated in the panchnama,” Mr. Chappalwar said. ND Studio is owned by art director Nitin Desai. Jodhaa Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, which was released in 2008, was shot here. “After we receive a formal complaint, we can file an FIR. We will deploy one fire tender there for the night as a precaution as the material largely consists of plaster of Paris, fibre, plywood and iron angles, and the set is still very hot,” senior police inspector Anil Vibhute from Khalapur police station said. Fireman Pradip Hire from Karjat Municipal Council said the challenge was to get water. “We had to drive around three km to fetch water from a Shiv Sena activist’s house. We made multiple rounds and by 5 p.m., we managed to control the blaze,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fire-breaks-out-at-nd-studio-no-casualties/article34511136.ece

He said that if adequate vials were not forthcoming from the Centre soon, then vaccines meant for the 18-44 age-group would have to be diverted to complete the second dose for senior citizens. “Two days ago, we received nine lakh vaccines for the 45-plus age-group of which eight lakhs have been consumed already.

08 May 2021||COLOMBO,||Nasheed ‘critical’, remains in intensive care||Speaker of the Maldives Parliament and former President Mohamed Nasheed  was in a “critical condition”, a Male-based hospital said on Friday, a day after he sustained multiple injuries in a targeted explosion that the Maldives police described as “an act of terror” “President Nasheed underwent a successful final, critical, life-saving procedure this afternoon. Over the course of past 16 hours he had life-saving surgery on injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs. He remains in a critical condition in intensive care,” the ADK hospital treating him said in a tweet. Mr. Nasheed’s brother, Nazim Sattar, tweeted earlier on Friday: “They have finished the surgery and now it’s the long road to recovery.” Sources close to the family told The Hindu from Male that the former President’s condition appeared stable, and was being closely monitored. The former President was injured as he was about to get into his car outside his home on Thursday night, when an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attached to a two-wheeler parked nearby exploded. While no one has claimed responsibility for the apparent assassination attempt, police said all available evidence indicated that the incident was “a deliberate act of terror” targeting Mr. Nasheed. A probe has commenced, and at least “four persons of interest” have been identified so far, local media reported, following a press conference by the police chief. A team from the Australian Federal Police is expected to arrive in the Maldives on Saturday to assist with the investigation. Mr. Nasheed, 53, is a prominent advocate of democracy and the Maldives’s first democratically elected President and a global climate change hero. Known for his bold criticism of religious extremism, Mr. Nasheed has on multiple occasions warned of Islamist radical forces within the country. ‘Attack on democracy’ President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih convened the National Security Council as well as an emergency Cabinet meeting following the incident on Thursday night that shook the region and beyond. In a televised address to the nation on Friday morning, President Solih strongly condemned the explosion, calling it an attack on Maldives’s democracy and economy. Promising a swift and thorough investigation into the incident, he said perpetrators would face “the full force of the law”. Several governments, including India and China, as well as diplomatic missions in Male, and those accredited from Colombo, condemned the attack. “Deeply concerned at the attack on Speaker @MohamedNasheed. Wish him a speedy recovery. Know that he will never be intimidated,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in a tweet. Addressing a media conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said: “We strongly condemn this attack.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nasheed-critical-remains-in-intensive-care/article34510835.ece
08 May 2021||Vienna,||Talks ‘intensify’ on bringing U.S. back to Iran nuclear deal||World powers held a fourth round of high-level talks on Friday aimed at bringing the U.S. back into the nuclear deal with Iran, with both sides signalling a willingness to work out the major stumbling blocks. The talks began in Austria in early April. Russian delegate Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted following Friday’s meeting that “the participants agreed on the need to intensify the process.” “The delegations seem to be ready to stay in Vienna as long as necessary to achieve the goal,” he wrote. The U.S. pulled out of the landmark 2015 deal in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump said the pact needed to be renegotiated. The deal had promised Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and the Trump administration reimposed heavy sanctions on the Islamic republic in an unsuccessful attempt to bring Tehran into new talks. Iran reacted by steadily increasing its violations of the deal by enriching uranium to a greater purity than permitted. U.S. President Joe Biden says he wants to rejoin the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, but that Iran needs to return to compliance. The pact is meant to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, something the country insists it is not inclined to. Iran insists all sanctions must be lifted before it reverses violations. Delegates to the Vienna talks concede that Iranian nuclear scientists cannot unlearn the knowledge they acquired in the last three years, but it is not clear whether Iran’s new centrifuges would need to be destroyed, mothballed and locked away, or simply taken offline. Because the U.S. is currently out of the deal, there were no American representatives at the talks. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, said after the meeting that his impression was that all sides were committed to finding a solution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/talks-intensify-on-bringing-us-back-to-iran-nuclear-deal/article34510843.ece
08 May 2021||Bangkok,||Myanmar’s Karen insurgents burn another govt. outpost||Guerrilla soldiers from Myanmar’s Karen ethnic minority burned down a government military outpost on Friday after capturing it without a fight when its garrison fled, a senior Karen officer said. The position is approximately 15 km from a larger camp that the Karen National Liberation Army stormed and burned 10 days earlier. The KNLA is the armed wing of the Karen National Union (KNU), the main political organisation representing the Karen minority, whose homeland is in eastern Myanmar. The Karen and the Kachin in northern Myanmar are the two major ethnic armed organisations that have allied themselves with the movement against the junta that took power in Myanmar after the Army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February. The role of the ethnic fighting groups has become more important as the number of people joining street protests in Myanmar’s cities and towns has declined, in large part due to deadly violence used by security forces to suppress them. Hundreds of demonstrators and bystanders have died. There is now daily fighting between the government and the military forces of the Karen and the Kachin. A shadow National Unity Government formed by the junta’s foes announced this week the formation of a “People’s Defense Force” intended to serve as a precursor to a “Federal Union Army” of democratic forces including ethnic minorities, underlining the major rule they may play. Fighting between the guerrillas and the junta has intensified in recent days. “Yesterday our troops fired a few shots and today when we approached there was no one there, so we just entered,” KNLA Maj. Gen. Ner Dah Mya said by phone Friday. The KNU has been fighting for greater autonomy for the region for decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmars-karen-insurgents-burn-another-govt-outpost/article34510837.ece
08 May 2021||RIO DE JANEIRO,||Deadly police shootout in Brazil prompts claims of abuse||A bloody, hourslong gunbattle in a Rio de Janeiro slum echoed into Friday, with authorities saying the police mission killed two dozen criminals while residents and activists claimed human rights abuses. It was just after sunrise Thursday when dozens of officers from Rio de Janeiro state’s civil police stormed Jacarezinho, a favela in the city’s northern zone. They were targeting drug traffickers from one of Brazil’s most notorious criminal organizations, Comando Vermelho, and the bodies piled up quickly. When the fighting stopped, there were 25 dead — one police officer and 24 people described by the police as “criminals.” Rio’s moniker of “Marvelous City” can often seem a cruel irony in the favelas, given their violent conflicts, stark poverty and subjugation to drug traffickers or militias. But even here, Thursday’s clash was a jarring anomaly that analysts declared one of the city’s deadliest police operations ever. And it was by far the most violent since Brazil’s Supreme Court issued a ruling banning most such actions during the pandemic, which drew a rebuke from the UN’s human rights office. The bloodshed also laid bare Brazil’s perennial divide over whether, as a common local saying goes, “a good criminal is a dead criminal.” Fervent law-and-order sentiment fuelled the successful presidential run in 2018 by Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain whose home is in Rio. He drew support from much of society with his calls to diminish legal constraints on officers’ use of lethal force against criminals. The administration of Rio state’s Governor Cláudio Castro, a Bolsonaro ally, said that it lamented the deaths, but that the operation was “oriented by long and detailed investigative and intelligence work that took months.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/deadly-police-shootout-in-brazil-prompts-claims-of-abuse/article34510839.ece
08 May 2021||Berlin,||Islamophobic group Pegida is extremist: German spy agency||German intelligence services said on Friday they would widen their surveillance of Islamophobic protest movement Pegida in its home state of Saxony, as the group had become “extremist” and “anti-constitutional”. While Pegida had previously attracted “heterogeneous” support and taken “moderate” positions, it had developed “an increasingly right-wing extremist orientation”, Saxony’s domestic intelligence agency LfV said. “By regularly offering right-wing extremists a platform to propagate anti-constitutional ideologies, this movement acts as a hinge between extremists and non-extremists,” said agency president Dirk-Martin Christian. He added that “all people and activities” within the group would now be put under surveillance, with the exception of those merely taking part in peaceful demonstrations. Pegida, which campaigns against what it calls the “Islamisation of the West”, was born in October 2014 with xenophobic marches every Monday evening. Its protests gained momentum during the refugee crisis of 2015, when Germany became deeply polarised over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to keep the country’s doors open to asylum seekers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/islamophobic-group-pegida-is-extremist-german-spy-agency/article34510840.ece
08 May 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel police kill two Palestinian attackers||Israeli security forces on Friday killed two Palestinians and critically wounded a third after the men had opened fire on a base in the occupied West Bank, the latest flareup in violence after clashes in east Jerusalem. The exchange of fire at the Salem base outside the northern West Bank town of Jenin came as tensions soar in annexed east Jerusalem over an eviction threat hanging over four Palestinian families. “Three terrorists fired towards the Salem border police base,” a statement from the border police said, adding that two of the attackers were shot dead, while the third was taken to hospital in Israel in a “critical condition”. Guns, knives and a large supply of ammunition were found, police said. The Palestinian Health Ministry said they had “no official information about the identity of the two martyrs”. The unrest came on Al-Quds Day an annual day of pro-Palestinian rallies held by Iran, the arch-enemy of Israel. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday called Israel “not a country, but a terrorist base”, and in a televised speech said that fighting the Jewish state was “everyone’s duty”. Friday’s killings follow days of clashes and shootings. On Sunday, a 19-year-old Israeli was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting. Israeli security forces later announced they had arrested Montasser Shalabi, 44. Palestinian sources said Shalabi is a dual U.S. national.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-police-kill-two-palestinian-attackers/article34510841.ece
08 May 2021||London,||Conservatives win in U.K. Labour stronghold||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday welcomed early election results in Britain’s first major vote since Brexit and the pandemic, including a stunning by-election victory for his Conservative party in an opposition Labour stronghold. The “Super Thursday” local and regional contests could reshape the U.K. as pro-independence forces in Scotland, where voting for the devolved parliament was also held, bid to break away. Comprehensive results in Scotland are due on Saturday. But in the initial returns in England on Friday, the Conservatives were performing strongly in various regions and won by a landslide in the northeast parliamentary seat of Hartlepool, in a bitter blow for Labour and its leader Keir Starmer. The rust-belt town constituency, which is deep in traditional Labour heartlands and has never voted Conservative since its creation in 1974, saw a 16% swing to the Tories. “It’s a very encouraging set of results so far,” Mr. Johnson said. “What this election shows is that people want a party and a government that is focused on them, focused on delivering change,” he added. Newly-elected Tory MP Jill Mortimer called her win “truly historic” and accused Labour of taking its people “for granted for too long”. The vote came about after its Labour incumbent quit over sexual harassment allegations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/conservatives-win-in-uk-labour-stronghold/article34510842.ece
08 May 2021||London,||U.K. issues new advice on jabs for under 40||People under 40 in Britain will not be given the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine if another shot is available because of a link to extremely rare blood clots, the government said on Friday. It said the change would not affect the goal of giving all U.K. adults at least one vaccine dose by July. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people aged 30 to 39 without underlying health conditions should receive an alternative vaccine, “where available and only if this does not cause substantial delays in being vaccinated.” Last month it gave the same advice for people under 30. U.K. has recorded more than 1,27,500 COVID-19 deaths so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-issues-new-advice-on-jabs-for-under-40/article34510844.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||An IT hub and its struggle for healthcare||On the night of May 2, Sajidunnissa, 56, who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, developed acute respiratory problems. She experienced a rapid drop in her oxygen saturation levels. What followed was a harrowing 14 hours, as her family did the rounds of seven hospitals in Bengaluru desperately searching for a bed. They finally got her into the emergency room of a private hospital by which time her saturation levels had dropped to 40. Although she was administered oxygen, Sajidunnissa did not make it. On the morning of May 3, 65-year-old Jayesh R. took a turn for the worse as his oxygen saturation levels dropped to 68. His family hired a private ambulance and went knocking on the doors of hospitals for an oxygenated bed. They watched helplessly as his saturation levels dropped further. He died in the ambulance four hours into the frantic search. In both instances, the Bengaluru civic body’s central hospital bed management system had shown that there were no oxygenated beds available. Sushma G. recalled the lonely and terrifying six days she spent waiting to hear back from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) war rooms, which allot beds to COVID-19 patients based on their position on the waiting list and severity of disease, about a bed for her brother. That call never came. While Bengaluru’s less-than-adequate public medical infrastructure is under severe stress with an exponential rise in cases, an alleged scam in the South Zone has also raised questions on the integrity of the bed allocation system in the city. All war rooms are currently under investigation by the Central Crime Branch police. So far, two doctors are among the four people who have been arrested and hospitals are under the scanner. The civic body has conceded that such cases may have occurred but may not be widespread. Bed allocation racket On May 4, Bengaluru South Member of Parliament Tejasvi Surya, with three BJP MLAs in tow, stormed into the BBMP South Zone war room and accused staff of blocking beds for cash. “As soon as a bed is released from the hospital, people in the control room block it in the name of some asymptomatic patients, only to later manually change it and allot it to a person who pays them. This ensures beds are always blocked to the full and are not available for the needy,” alleged Mr. Surya, who live-streamed the ‘exposé’. Mr. Surya and the MLAs, while exposing the racket, made it a point to target 16 Muslim employees of a total workforce of 206. Citizens, political leaders in the Opposition and activists have criticised the BJP for communalising a problem at a time when the city is fighting a vicious second wave, with many calling for an apology or police action. Volunteers from minority communities and organisations such as Mercy Mission, spearheaded by Muslims and at the forefront of relief work from providing oxygen to cremating bodies, have expressed dismay at how the ruling dispensation continues to demonise the community. Mr. Surya claimed victory of “reforming the system” and announced hours after his ‘exposé’ that the BBMP website was showing 1,500-odd beds as available. That claim was, however, misleading. The bed allocation racket, which senior police and civic officials say is not as widespread as it is being made out to be, exposes the lack of preparedness and poor medical infrastructure in a city that wears its ‘IT capital’ tag with pride. Given how oxygenated beds, ICU beds and ventilators are hard to come by, touts have entered the fray. They charge anywhere between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 30,000 to find a bed, but their “business” is constrained by the dearth of beds. “Oxygenated and ICU beds are hard to come by. People are ready to pay up to Rs. 2 lakh to get an ICU bed, but even I am struggling to find one,” said Dhanraj (name changed), a tout in the city. A social worker and her nephew who were arrested by the police in a sting operation for selling beds are suspected to have ties with war room staffers. Caught on the back foot Why is the health infrastructure in Bengaluru, once touted to be a popular medical tourism hub with affordable world-class facilities, crumbling during this second wave? Karnataka’s highest case load per day so far has been 50,112 and deaths, 592. As daily new cases rose from 210 on March 1 to 23,706 on May 6, and the number of deaths from four to 139 during the same period, the government was caught on the back foot. An inadequate number of ICU and oxygenated beds, scarcity of life-saving oxygen, and shortage of vaccines and drugs like Remidesivir, Favipiravir (Fabiflu) and Tocilizumab have pushed citizens to despair, allowing touts and black marketeers to thrive. Giridhar R. Babu, epidemiologist and member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which had sounded the alarm of a second wave last year, said a surge such as this, which is nearly five times higher than the first wave, simply cannot be managed by a system that was barely augmented to take on the pandemic. “In addition, a far more contagious variant has resulted in a high number of cases in a very short span of time. Adding to the woes is the complete mismanagement of the bed distribution system. This shows poor management and coordination by urban local bodies. Even today, mechanisms have not been evolved to cater to the critical care needs of the people of Bengaluru,” he said. However, according to officials from the State Health Department, Karnataka did ramp up its health infrastructure to increase its bed count to 1.20 lakh. With a population of nearly 7 crore, the bed to patients ratio is 1:583. Compared to pre-COVID-19 days, the bed strength in public hospitals has also increased. While the number of general beds has risen from 37,817 to 42,584, oxygenated beds have gone up from 1,970 to 18,593. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds have been ramped up from 1,054 to 3,190 and ICUs with ventilator beds (ICU-Vs) have more than tripled from 610 to 2,034. In Bengaluru, 157 hospitals — government, private and medical colleges — have allocated a total of 6,002 general beds, 4,299 high dependency units (HDU), 591 ICUs, and 500 ICU-V beds. The numbers may seem impressive until you look at the demand, especially for ICU and ICU-V beds. As on May 5, 562 ICU and 494 ICU-V beds were occupied. For a brief time that day, the bed management system showed only 13 ICU-V beds as available, as per BBMP’s records. Officials claim that Karnataka and Bengaluru’s infrastructure is much better in comparison to other States, but numerical comparisons are no solace to people running from one hospital to another looking for beds for their friends or family members. One of the biggest problems in providing affordable medical aid seems to be the high dependency on the private sector. Nearly 60% of the patients are treated in private hospitals, a trend that is playing out across the country. While the government is trying to make private hospitals hand over 75% of their total beds to government-referred COVID-19 patients, this is yet to happen. The beds ceded by the private hospital to the government are added to the government’s database. As on May 6, private hospitals had allocated 2,054 general beds, 1,554 HDU beds, 291 ICU beds and 174 ICU with ventilator beds. In private medical colleges, 3,578 general beds, 1,849 HDU beds, 146 ICU and 161 ICU with ventilator beds were made available for government-referred patients. As on Thursday, all ICU and HDU beds were occupied. But numbers are also manipulated for profit, since private hospitals get paid far less for government-referred patients. In Bengaluru, BBMP health officers have found well-known hospitals attempting to “hide” beds by showing them as occupied when patients have either died or been discharged. The BBMP’s bed database is not foolproof either and it is not clear if it is by design or human error in an overwhelmed system. Last week, a 41-year-old COVID-19 patient who was isolating himself at home with his wife took a turn for the worse. As his oxygen saturation levels started to drop, he contacted the BBMP control room seeking a bed. After several calls, he was sent an ambulance and asked to go to a private hospital in south Bengaluru. On arrival, he was told that there had been “a mistake” and that no beds were available. He waited in the lobby of the hospital for nearly two hours after which the hospital authorities asked him to wait outside in the ambulance. He was eventually allotted a bed at another private hospital in the opposite end of the city. There have been multiple cases of patients being allotted beds only for them to arrive at the hospital and learn that there is none available. However, the system, which is currently being fine-tuned to weed out illegal sale of beds, does give patients an idea of the resources available. Such a system did not even exist for private sector beds. It was only towards the end of April that the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) agreed to roll out a database so that citizens can monitor availability of beds in real-time. At the time, Dr. H.M. Prasanna, president, PHANA, told The Hindu , “The situation is so bad that, as president of the Association, I myself don’t know where beds are available.” The portal was yet to be updated at the time of going to press. As the clamour for resources grows louder with each passing day, civic officials, legislators and even the police are inundated with requests for HDU and ICU beds. An opposition MLA said every morning his office sees a flood of people requesting him to get an oxygenated or ICU bed for a relative. “There are absolutely no beds. And how do I even prioritise among them? Why am I playing God here,” he asked. Confusion and testing delays In thousands of instances, confusion begins even at the time of testing. When a person’s COVID-19 test returns positive, he or she is assigned a patient identity or BU (Bengaluru Urban) number. A delay in this early stage of the process has a cascading effect as the identity number is essential for citizens to avail themselves of any health facility, be it ambulance service or hospitalisation. With more people lining up to get tested, however, the pipeline choked, and laboratories, especially privately run facilities, started taking days to upload the results on the Indian Council of Medical Research website. False negatives and people developing severe symptoms while still waiting for their report became a common problem. The Karnataka High Court directed all laboratories and testing agencies to provide RT-PCR test results within 24 hours, but the problem persists. The BBMP administration has repeatedly appealed to private laboratories to give the test results within 24 hours, but to no avail. Over the last few weeks, civic officials have issued show cause notices to over 20 such private laboratories and sealed over six for non-compliance. Many, either because of the long wait for RT-PCR reports or a false negative report, have resorted to taking CT scans despite high costs to ascertain infection. It was only a few days ago that the government took cognisance of this issue and decided to issue BU numbers for those who test positive on CT scans. For Arvind, a taxi driver in Bengaluru, the change in rules came too late. When his mother-in-law suddenly started showing symptoms of COVID-19 and complained of breathlessness, he didn’t have a BU number to get her hospitalised. He drove all night in his taxi from one hospital to another but couldn’t get a bed. He took her home where she died. “I couldn’t afford beds in high-end private hospitals,” he said. Shortage of oxygen The government plans to augment Bengaluru’s ICU bed count by 4,000. But many health experts point out that it may prove to be an exercise in futility when there is shortage of oxygen for the existing beds. On May 4, two patients, including a 38-year-old mother of two children, died in the wee hours of Tuesday at Arka hospital in Yelahanka, allegedly due to non-availability of oxygen. Hospital authorities said both patients had come in a critical condition and the families had been informed about the oxygen shortage. The previous day, 24 people died due to alleged oxygen shortage at a government hospital in Chamarajanagar, 170 km away from Bengaluru. Hospitals sending out letters to patients’ relatives to shift them out as they are running out of oxygen has become an everyday routine. Doctors and management of hospitals attribute the crisis to logistical issues in the oxygen supply chain. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra corroborated this. “We are streamlining supply and addressing the logistical issues,” he said. Dr. Prasanna of PHANA said, “Quantity is not an issue, but the problem lies in the supply chain. With very few supply tankers, vendors are unable to visit hospitals two-three times a day for refilling.” Karnataka does not have a system in place for the storage and distribution of oxygen. Chamarajanagar, where the 24 patients died, has no manufacturing facility of its own and depends on Mysuru for supply. There is no State-monitored mechanism to ensure that each district is assured a certain quantum of supply depending on its need, and so the districts try and procure supply on their own. On May 4, Dr. Babu, who also heads Life Course Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India in Bengaluru, tweeted: “In a country where ice creams, chilled coke and chips reach villages, it is simply astonishing to believe that the industry cannot help in solving the logistic crisis of oxygen distribution. How many governments have reached out to industry for help or partnership?” Unlike the previous year, the strain prevalent in the city is pushing more patients to hypoxia and hence the demand for oxygen is several times more, said a senior health official. As per Union government norms, the State placed a demand for oxygen in the range of 1,471 MTD to 1,791 MTD between April 30 and May 5, but said a minimum of 1,162 MTD was absolutely necessary. However, the Union government first allotted only 300 MTD, increased it to 802 MTD and later 865 MTD. During an ongoing hearing of a PIL in High Court, the Centre offered to further raise it to 965 MTD. However, the Karnataka High Court ordered the Union government to allot 1,200 MTD for the next four days to the State and asked the State government to place new demand. The Union government appealed against it to the Supreme Court, which refused to interfere noting that the Karnataka High Court’s order is a well calibrated and thought-out one. “We will not keep the citizens of Karnataka in the lurch,” the Supreme Court said. How did it come to this? TAC had on November 30 last year submitted a report to the government recommending that ICUs, ICU-Vs, oxygen, etc. be kept ready by the first week of January to meet levels that the city had witnessed during the first COVID-19 peak in October. More importantly, it recommended restricting mass gatherings like fairs and festivals, religious congregations and cultural events. However, the State government, which had initially announced certain restrictions including night curfew during the New Year week (which was later rolled back), did not consider the report in toto. It waited for by-elections and urban local body elections to end before announcing stringent measures. “Restrictions for cinema halls too were rolled back a day after the announcement. If the report was taken seriously then and stringent measures were initiated early, the situation could have been controlled,” said V. Ravi, TAC member and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka. “Declaring elections was the biggest blunder. Elections could have been postponed considering the pandemic as a national medical emergency. However, the State followed a wait-and-watch policy and we are seeing the consequences,” another expert said. Citizens wanted to believe that the worst was over and ignored the warning signs as neighbouring Maharashtra and Kerala saw cases rise. As the death toll mounts in Bengaluru, furnaces in the 12 electric crematoriums are breaking down. The district administration has set up open crematoriums on the outskirts of the city with a capacity to burn more than 20 bodies at a time. Another makeshift crematorium is coming up at the Mavallipura landfill, where the civic body is working towards building a capacity to cremate 50 bodies at a time. At these open crematoriums, pyres burn simultaneously and the air shimmers in the haze of smoke and orange flames. Within Bengaluru, the silence in residential neighbourhoods observing lockdown is regularly broken by the wails of ambulances. Experts have once again urged the government to finalise a plan for the long haul, one that will enable Bengaluru to withstand multiple waves of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-it-hub-and-its-struggle-for-healthcare/article34510833.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The fig leaf of patent protection has to drop||The decision of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, to support the India-South Africa proposal, seeking a waiver of patent protection for technologies needed to combat and contain COVID-19, comes as a shot in the arm for global health. The proposal that was placed before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had been facing resistance from several high income countries including the U.S. administration. A change in the American position supporting a temporary waiver could act as a catalyst for building consensus in favour of that proposal when it comes up for fresh consideration at the WTO in June. However, the path ahead is not clear. While France and Russia have declared support, Germany has voiced its opposition. Predictable responses Response to the proposal was divided during earlier debates at the WTO. While many low and middle income countries supported it, resistance came from the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland, Australia and Japan. A strange addition to this group was Norway, which usually supports initiatives that promote global health equity. On this occasion, it chose to shield patent rights. Since the WTO operates on consensus rather than by voting, the proposal did not advance despite drawing support of over 60 countries. Predictably, the pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposed it and vigorously lobbied many governments. Right-wing political groups in the high income countries sided with the industry. Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates was strident in his opposition to patent waivers for vaccines, justifiably drawing ire from the public health community for a stance that was at great variance from his projected image as a messiah of global health. It appeared that patent rights would be doggedly defended even in the face of a devastating pandemic. Hollow reasons Many specious reasons were offered for such a defence. It was argued that the capacity for producing vaccines of assured quality and safety was limited to some laboratories and that it would be hazardous to permit manufacturers in low and middle income countries to play with technologies they cannot handle. This smacks of hypocrisy when pharmaceutical manufacturers have no reservations about contracting industries in those countries to manufacture their patent-protected vaccines for the global market. The low labour costs in those countries are obviously so attractive that confidence in the quality and the safety of their products is high, so long as patents and profits are protected. This amazing duplicity has been seen for years when multinational firms have subcontracted manufacture of patented products to industries with low production costs in developing countries. This has been true of pharmaceutical products, as it has been of branded consumer products and luxury goods. This fig leaf has to drop, at least in a pandemic. The counter to patent waiver is an offer to license manufacturers in developing countries, while retaining patent rights. This restricts the opportunity for production to a chosen few. The terms of those agreements are opaque and offer no assurance of equity in access to the products at affordable prices, either to the country of manufacture or to other developing countries. It was also stated that developing countries could be supplied vaccines through the COVAX facility, set up by several international agencies and donors. While well intended, it has fallen far short of promised delivery. Some U.S. States have received more vaccines than the entire Africa has from COVAX. The trickle down theory does not work well in the global vaccine supply, just like its dubious application in economics. Critics of a patent waiver say there is no evidence that extra capacity exists for producing vaccines outside of firms undertaking them now. Even before the change in the U.S.’s position, manufacturers from many countries expressed their readiness and avidly sought opportunities to produce the approved vaccines. They included industries in Canada and South Korea, suggesting that capable manufacturers in high income countries too are ready to avail of patent waivers but are not being allowed to enter a restricted circle. The World Health Organization’s mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub has already drawn interest from over 50 firms. Instead of arguing that capacity is limited, should not high income countries and other donors be supporting the growth of more capacity to meet the current and likely future pandemics? They should learn from the manner in which India built up capacity and gained a reputation as a respected global pharmacy by moving from product patenting to process patenting between 1970 and 2005. China line, safeguards Patent waivers are also dismissed as useless on the grounds that the time taken for their utilisation by new firms will be too long to help combat the present pandemic. Who can set the end date for this pandemic, when many countries have low vaccination rates and variants are gleefully emerging from unprotected populations? If the world boasts of the speed with which previously little known companies produced vaccines in record time in 2020, why not support others to develop that capacity through technology transfer? Efficacy and safety of their products can be assessed by credible regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization. Patent waivers will benefit by increasing access not just to vaccines but also to essential drugs and diagnostics. Surely, that will not take much time. An argument put forth by multinational pharmaceutical firms is that a breach in the patent barricade will allow China to steal their technologies, now and in the future. The original genomic sequence was openly shared by China, which gave these firms a head start in developing vaccines. Much of the foundational science that built the path for vaccine production came from public-funded universities and research institutes. Further, what use is it to hold on to patents when global health and the global economy are devastated? Who will buy their precious products then? The perennial argument, offered for defending patent protection, is that innovation and investment by industry need to be financially rewarded to incentivise them to develop new products. Even if compulsory licences are issued bypassing patent restrictions, royalties are paid to the original innovators and patent holders. They will continue to gain revenue, though not super profits. Pfizer’s vaccine generated $3.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, while mostly reaching the arms of the world’s rich. It expects $15 billion sales this year. Moderna says it expects sales of $18.4 billion in 2021. The incentive to protect profits is very strong indeed. Building on Biden’s gesture The World Trade Organization resolves debates by consensus and not by voting. The process may drag on, despite U.S. intervention. If Mr. Biden succeeds in driving consensus to provide a global thrust to combat a global threat, he will match Franklin D. Roosevelt’s leadership in the Second World War. He does not have such an alliance in place now. So, developing countries must take heart from his gesture and start issuing compulsory licences. The Doha declaration on TRIPS flexibilities permits their use in a public health emergency. National governments must be trusted to promote credible companies and not permit fly-by-night operators. High-income countries and multilateral agencies should provide financial and technical support to enable expansion of global production capacity. That will reflect both ennobling altruism and enlightened self-interest. Prof. K. Srinath Reddy, a cardiologist and epidemiologist, is President, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Rent issues as an ignored COVID stress point||As State governments have begun implementing weekend curfews and lockdown-like conditions amid the second wave of COVID, there is another issue that is emerging — rent crises within informal rental housing markets. For example, domestic workers in Jaipur, Rajasthan, have begun reporting to the Rajasthan Mahila Kamgar Union (RMKU) that landlords have only one line: “ Pichli baar maaf kar diya tha, iss baar nahi karenge (The landlords say they will not be waiving any rent this time).” Trauma returns Meanwhile, reports of loss of livelihoods, in an eerie echo of 2020, have begun. In a crisis, the issue of rent does not get as much attention as food and income support do. Yet, the findings from a survey of 500 domestic workers in Jaipur by the RMKU and the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) showed that rent formed 40% of their average expenses in the first five weeks of the lockdown in 2020, was a majority component of debt post the lockdowns, and was a key component of the vulnerability of urban workers. This is not just true of domestic workers. Reports by the Stranded Workers Action Network showed that fear of rent payments was one of the main reasons cited by migrants in their decision to leave cities and walk along highways. It is imperative that we learn from the lessons of last year and protect the rental housing of informal workers early, effectively, and expansively. How should this be done? In February, we learnt crucial lessons from follow-up interviews with 76 domestic workers in Jaipur to see what had happened to rental housing through last year, and what lessons it offers for better protections this year.  Unenforceable moratoria On March 29, 2020, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs in an order (https://bit.ly/3b9M6qu) said, “Where ever the workers, including the migrants, are living in rented accommodation, the landlords of those properties shall not demand payment of rent for the period of one month.” It was an order that largely failed. It was vague (was the rent to be waived or just deferred?); offered no relief to landlords (many of whom rely on rent for their own sustenance, not unlike their tenants); and unenforceable in a market with no written rent agreements. Further, there was no apparatus to monitor the enforcement of this order. In most cases, it was the tenants who had to negotiate with their landlords and request for leniency. When one of our interviewees, Meena ( name changed ) cited the state announcement to her landlord, she was told, “ Yeh sab sunne ka hai, koi maaf nahi karega (All of this is impractical, nobody will actually waive the rent).” Some landlords waived off rent for a month or two while others agreed to defer the rent. A few made no compromises and expected the rent to be paid on time, sometimes employing threats and coercion. Interviews show that domestic workers had to make difficult trade-offs, redirecting money reserved for necessary expenses such as food, school fees, and life savings to be able to pay rent and retain a roof over their heads. With pending rent and school fees worsening with no money coming in, many domestic workers had to borrow from informal moneylenders. Even in cases where the rent was deferred, it led to a piling up of debts for domestic workers who took more than a few months to get even a part of their jobs back. Some domestic workers borrowed from their employers, on the condition of paying it off with their work over the next few months, which meant a further paucity in income. Rent is particularly pivotal for workers who do not consider themselves migrants. For all the domestic workers we interviewed, returning to their villages was not an option. This was both because of their investments in decades of life in the city where, for many, their children were born, as well as the lack of jobs in the village, no skills for agricultural employment, and the absence of social ties. As Mangal ( name changed ) said, “ Bachche yaha padayi karte hain, hum bhi shuru se yahin hai toh jaise ab gaanv me kheti-baari ka kaam hai kuch nahi aata hai, toh me wahaan baske karungi kya ? (The children are studying here, we have also been living here since the start, we do not even know any farm work, so what will we do after settling there?)” The only condition that renders such workers as “migrant” is their exclusion from the State programmes because they have not been able to get, for example, local ration cards despite years of trying. As Sindhu ( name changed ) narrates, “ Hum toh na Bangal ka ho gaya naa Rajasthan ka ho gaya, hum toh aatankwaadi ho gaye naa ? (We are neither of Bengal, or of Rajasthan, are we terrorists?”) Rent anchors the lives workers have built; it must be seen as a key part of the urban social safety net, as critical as food and wage. Some solutions First, a moratorium should be announced with a clearer enforcement mechanism and a clear distinction between deferment and rent waivers. Working with worker organisations and unions could greatly aid enforcement. Landlords should be offered means to access partial compensation for lost rent from the state shifting the onus onto them rather than on workers. Second, cash transfers being conceptualised by many State governments must treat rent on a par with food and income support. The amount of cash transfer for rent support can be estimated on the basis of the rental market conditions (Rs. 2,500-Rs. 3,000 being the average monthly rent among our respondents in Jaipur). Third, States can also aid workers through limited waivers on utility expenses. For example, the electricity bills and penalties charged on non-payment were quite a burden for domestic workers. Unlike rent, there was no negotiation possible for utility payments, with some workers reporting the need to borrow from landlords to pay electricity bills. The second wave of COVID-19 has shown us the consequences of not preparing in advance. We cannot afford to not think ahead on the income and rent shocks that will follow this second wave as they did during the first wave. In doing so, urban safety nets must bring together food, income and rent so that no person should be forced to make an impossible choice between roti and makaan .

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Assam discord||A combination of welfarism, communalism and smart though daring alliances helped the BJP win a second consecutive term in Assam. The party and its allies, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), won 75 of the 126 seats in the State. A 10-party alliance, or Mahajot, around the Congress-AIUDF axis turned out to be no match for the BJP. A third front of Assamese nationalists, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal, could win only one seat. The Congress and AIUDF have accused it of helping the BJP. The BJP performed well in Upper Assam, and the Barak Valley, though marginally weaker than its 2016 performance. With its newfound ally UPPL, the BJP outperformed the Mahajot, which had the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) as a constituent in the Bodo region. The AIUDF-Congress alliance swept Lower Assam, but overall, they ended up with a net loss by joining hands. The BJP campaign focused on the imaginary prospect of AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal becoming the CM, mobilising two variants of backlash — from the Assamese nationalists and Hindu nationalists. The alliance question posed a dilemma for both parties. They had to choose between the disadvantages of not having a partnership and having one. The AIUDF has now blamed the underperformance of the Congress in Upper Assam as the reason for their defeat; the irony is that the Congress faced the brunt there for its tie-up with the AIUDF. The winners have their own curse. Communal polarisation in the State fanned by the acrimonious debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been further reinforced in the outcome. All eight Muslim candidates of the BJP, including a sitting MLA, lost. Of the 29 Congress MLAs, 16 are Muslims. The BJP has dismantled its minority cell in response to the outcome. The key strategist of the BJP, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who curated the party’s agenda, spearheaded its welfare schemes, and managed its alliance, has a rightful claim for the CM’s post. He is certainly more popular than the incumbent CM, Sarbananda Sonowal, in the 60-strong BJP legislature party. The BJP has managed to assemble the support from Assamese nationalists, and Hindu nationalists in a deft balancing act on the CAA, but that ambiguity is difficult to sustain. The party has also promised to revise the National Register of Citizens and exclude more ‘illegal’ residents from it. Assam is a border State, and it has numerous fault lines within its society. The BJP single-mindedly focused on the religious divide that earned it rich dividends. But a political order that excludes a third of the population in a systematic manner is no order at all. The BJP’s victory is built on a deeply divisive and combustive agenda. Before it turns into a whirlwind of strife and chaos, the party must act with political wisdom and douse the fire it has lit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/assam-discord/article34510820.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A difficult union||A change of guard in Puducherry, where governance and development took a backseat from mid-2016 due to continuing friction between the elected government and Raj Nivas, ushers in hope for its people. The electorate’s frustration with the erstwhile Congress government was amply reflected with just two of its 14 candidates getting elected, as opposed to 15 last time. At the same time, All India NR Congress (AINRC) founder N. Rangasamy, who on Friday took oath as Chief Minister for the fourth time, has his task cut out, administratively and politically. For the first time he will be heading a coalition government with the BJP, whose cabinet composition is in the making. The people are looking forward to quality governance and public service delivery in the midst of the COVID-19 second wave. It would be safe to infer that the electorate had backed the AINRC-BJP alliance in anticipation that the cordiality between the Territorial administration and the Centre would yield dividends. Their expectations are legitimate as no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched to them the promise of making Puducherry the BEST (Business hub, Education hub, Spiritual hub and Tourism hub). But such acronyms are easier to coin than implement. There needs to be cohesive action from the allies to translate them into action. That said, on the ground there are indications that more than the battered and fatigued Opposition, Mr. Rangasamy is likely to face challenges from his openly ambitious ally. The BJP has tasted political blood in the Union Territory that is for most parts geographically contiguous and linguistically aligned with Tamil Nadu, which the national party has set its sights on next. It is seeking its pound of flesh by demanding that its nominee be made the Deputy Chief Minister. Mr. Rangasamy’s reservations in accommodating this demand are pronounced. The tiny territory has never had such a political post. The early disagreement between the allies has led to a delay in the swearing-in of the Cabinet. But it may not be easy for him to fend off the BJP. He would be conscious that the fragmented numbers thrown up in the election results leave the field open for manipulations to tilt the scales against him. In the 30-member House, the AINRC has 10 legislators, the BJP 6, DMK 6 and Congress 2. Independents account for 6 and indications are that three of them could lean towards the BJP. It will also not be long before the BJP appoints three nominated legislators who, thanks to a Supreme Court judgment, will have voting rights. Therefore, it would be a tightrope walk for the Chief Minister. Nonetheless, for the welfare of Puducherry, it would be best if the allies march on by focusing on governance without prioritising narrow, short-term political interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-difficult-union/article34510821.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Almost half new cases rural, shots key’||The pandemic’s second wave has spread far beyond the worst-hit cities, with almost half the new cases being reported from rural districts, and economic activity has taken a ‘severe hit’ SBI’s economics researchers said in a report on Friday. Red-flagging the slowing pace of vaccinations, which has fallen to an average 17 lakh per day from 28 lakh in April, State Bank of India’s research team observed that vaccinations were the primary tool to reduce the severity of infections and India ‘must vaccinate its people on a mission mode, even if it means suspending economic activity for a while after the second wave subsides’. With daily cases of more than 3.5 lakh in the past nine days, the share of the top 15 districts in total new cases had dropped sharply from 55% in March to just 26.3% in May, suggesting the spread of infections was now far more widely dispersed, SBI group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh wrote. Terming the increase in rural infections, flagged earlier by micro-finance lenders to the RBI, as ‘worrying', Mr. Ghosh said the share of rural districts in new cases had increased to 48.5% in May, from 36.8% in March. ‘Mid-August low’ “With the second wave and associated lockdown/restrictions, economic disruption is now clearly visible,” the researchers wrote. “At least 20 States are now in lockdown... our business activity index which has been declining steeply since April, has dipped to a new low of 71.7”, a level attained in mid-August 2020, they added. Mr. Ghosh also observed that the case load was not directly related to people’s movement, with cases having increased in Kerala, Bihar, Haryana and Uttarakhand even as mobility had declined in these States. India’s hopes of a healthy rate of economic growth in 2021-22, after last year’s sharp contraction, also now appear hard to realise, according to the researchers. On April 23, SBI had cut its GDP growth forecast to 10.4%, from 11%. Two weeks later, it is a ‘little apprehensive’ of the economy posting even double-digit growth. “We had earlier revised our FY22 real GDP estimate... At that time, only a few States (like Maharashtra and Delhi) had imposed lockdowns and most of the States adopted night curfew only,” the researchers noted. But the situation had altered completely, with 48 lakh new cases recorded since April 23, and the virus’s extensive spread forcing almost every State to impose total or partial lockdowns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/almost-half-new-cases-rural-shots-key/article34510814.ece
08 May 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Indian offshore model will dominate IT scene for a decade’||IT markets are picking up to such a degree that both the U.S. and Europe are running out of critical skills, and with this, offshore and Indian alternatives are increasingly becoming attractive for tech buyers, analysts said. In addition to the skills shortage, the pandemic-induced work-from-home has further raised the openness of global tech buyers to working in a distributed environment, away from onshore (or the client’s location), Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, said. “These factors are working together and have gone a long way to offset the pre-Covid trend to onshore. The effects of the pandemic may go away but the talent shortage looks to be increasing and is likely to stay for several years... Be it offshoring or onshoring, a robust market is floating all boats and they are likely to sail steady for the next few years.” Typically, offshore accounts for 70-80% of a project while onshore is in the 20-30% range. In the COVID-19 era, markets are seeing a clear 50% reduction in onshore and 5-15% rise in offshore share, said Phil Fersht, founder and CEO, HfS Research. The rise in offshore share is smaller in existing projects while new ones come with a higher ratio. “For all IT work conducted remotely, it makes perfect sense to run it from India and the Indian model will dominate the IT service scene for at least another decade,” he added. Offshore providers have ended up being ‘pandemic winners’, seeing quantum growth in revenues and substantial decline in operational cost after the WFH trend kicked in, said Siddharth Pai, founder, Siana Capital. On the impact this has had on pricing, Mr. Fersht said, “We’re now seeing some of the most aggressive pricing ever. Several deals are priced as low as $4-6 per hour for IT and business process work.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indian-offshore-model-will-dominate-it-scene-for-a-decade/article34510809.ece
08 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Non-life insurers get health boost in April||Growing demand for health insurance, evident since the pandemic began last year, played a role in non-life insurers posting more than 22% year-on-year rise in gross direct premium underwritten to Rs. 17,310 crore in April. Among them, standalone private health insurers posted a 55.6% increase to Rs. 1,259.2 crore, according to flash figures released by insurance regulator IRDAI. General insurers, for whom too health insurance is the mainstay, reported a 19.6% rise to Rs. 15,946.5 crore. With the inclusion of the two specialised PSU insurers, the non-life insurers gross premium underwritten rose 22%. On the life insurance front, the first year premium mobilised by the private insurers increased 55.2% toRs. 4,882 crore. Their market share stood at 50%, the business statement for April released by IRDAI said. Behemoth and State-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) posted a 35.6% increase in the first year premium to Rs. 4,856.8 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/non-life-insurers-get-health-boost-in-april/article34510807.ece
08 May 2021||Mumbai,||‘Pandemic won’t impact India’s rating for 2 years’||India’s sovereign rating will remain unchanged at the current level of BBB- for the next two years despite the potential adverse impact of the surging pandemic on its economy, said a top official at S&P Global Ratings. The country would witness a slightly faster pace of growth in the next two years, effectively supporting the rating, he said. “India’s sovereign rating remains stable,” said Andrew Wood, director, Asia Pacific Sovereign Ratings, S&P Global Ratings. “We do not expect a change in rating level over the next two years. “Of course, there are going to be some near-term ramifications for India’s economy stemming from the severe second wave of COVID-19 and that may peep through into our sovereign-credit metrics,” he said. Maintaining real GDP growth forecast at 11% for this fiscal, Mr. Wood said, “It is a baseline scenario with some downside risk. But, if we do see a number creeping lower, most likely it will not go too far in our current downside scenario.” He said India in all likelihood will have positive growth this fiscal year but there is potential for a lower rate of growth owing to the current health crisis. However, “we would more likely see a slightly faster pace of growth in the ensuing two years.” He said the second wave would not have any major impact on the government’s fiscal position in a moderate downside scenario. There could be upside pressure on fiscal deficit as revenue generation could be weaker but the government’s debt stock would remain roughly stable at just above 90% of the GDP. “In the severe scenario, there could be more additional fiscal spending from the government and revenue growth would be weaker. This would mean that the debt stock would stabilise in the next fiscal,” he said. Earlier, S&P, in a report, stated that India’s nascent economic recovery through March solidified government revenue. But the rapidly developing health crisis may derail this progress. Record number of cases, limited healthcare system capacity and localised lockdowns would likely take a toll on household consumption and retail activity. Fiscal challenge “The severity of the crisis is challenging the country’s fiscal settings, which were already weak before COVID struck,” said S&P. “Our moderate scenario suggests a hit to GDP of about 1.2 percentage points,” S&P said. “This means full-year growth of 9.8% for fiscal 2022. This compares with our baseline forecast of 11% growth for the period.” In the severe scenario, the hit is 2.8 percentage points, with 8.2% growth, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pandemic-wont-impact-indias-rating-for-2-years/article34510811.ece
08 May 2021||MUMBAI,||HDFC sounds caution on economy, Q4 net jumps||Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC) reported standalone net profit for the fourth quarter surged 42% to Rs. 3,180 crore. However, it sounded a note of caution considering the second wave of COVID-19 gripping the country. “Since April, India has been witnessing an eruption of a second wave of infections,” HDFC said in a filing. “There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty on the duration and intensity of the second wave and the resultant impact it may have on the Corporation and the overall economy.” For the fiscal ended March 31, it reported a net profit of Rs. 12,027 crore compared with Rs. 17,770 crore in the previous fiscal. However, the profit numbers were not comparable on account of one-time gains in FY20. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 23 per equity share. HDFC said demand for home loans remained robust owing to low interest rates, softer property prices, concessional stamp duty rates in certain States and fiscal incentives. During the fourth quarter, individual loan disbursements rose 60% year-on-year, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hdfc-sounds-caution-on-economy-q4-net-jumps/article34510812.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘Move fast on TRIPS waiver for COVID-19’||WTO Chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has urged the proponents of the proposal for temporary waiver of certain provisions of TRIPS agreement for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 to submit the revised document “as soon as possible” so that text-based negotiations can begin. Welcoming the statement of U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on the issue, the Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said she “warmly” welcomes Ms. Tai’s willingness to engage with proponents of a temporary waiver of the TRIPS pact to help combat the pandemic. In October 2020, India and South Africa had proposed a waiver for all World Trade Organization (WTO) members on the implementation of certain provisions of the agreement in relation to the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19. The proposed relaxations are aimed at ensuring quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries.

Another Indian, Jakar Khan, finished fourth in the men’s singles sculls final which offers five Olympic quotas, but he missed out as a country gets only one qualifying spot from this regatta. The top three qualify for Olympics in men’s lightweight double sculls event. “A country can qualify in only one boat from this regatta and since Arjun Lal Jat and Arvind Singh had finished second in men’s lightweight double sculls, they will qualify,” Rowing Federation of India president Rajlaxmi Singh Deo told PTI . “Jakar Khan finished fourth in men’s singles sculls and unfortunately, he will not qualify for Olympics. Arjun Lal and Arvind Singh were better placed as they were second,” she added. Arjun Lal and Arvind will be the only Indian rowers in Tokyo Games which open on July 23 as the country will not participate in other Olympic qualifiers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “There is another Olympic qualifier in Italy but we are not sending anybody due to the COVID-19 situation. So, this will be our only participation in the Olympics,” Deo said.

08 May 2021||MUMBAI,||Jadeja, Vihari and Shami return||Having recovered from injuries they suffered in Australia, the trio of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, middle-order batsman Hanuma Vihari and pacer Mohammed Shami has returned to India’s squad for the World Test Championship final against New Zealand and the five-Test series in England. From the squad that took England on at home in February-March, all-rounder Hardik Pandya and wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav have been omitted from a gruelling tour that will last almost four months. Pacer Shardul Thakur, who was released for domestic duties during the home Test series, has expectedly returned to the squad. Provisional selection The national selection committee, chaired by Chetan Sharma, picked the squad through videoconferencing on Friday. Two of the 20 players — K.L. Rahul and Wriddhiman Saha — are selected provisionally and will have to clear fitness tests at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru before the squad’s departure for England. While Rahul underwent an appendicitis surgery last week, Saha was diagnosed COVID-19 positive on Tuesday. Jadeja, Vihari and Shami were among those who suffered injuries during the tour to Australia and missed the home season of international cricket. Speedster Umesh Yadav also was ruled out midway through the Australia series but was recalled to the squad for the last Test against England in March. When Hardik was recalled to the Test squad for the England series after more than a year, captain Virat Kohli had hoped his pace bowling will be handy in England. However, a shoulder niggle resulted in Hardik having not bowled at all during the Indian Premier League, thus forcing the selectors to not consider him. Downswing Kuldeep, on the other hand, has been on a downward curve over the last two years. Having disappointed in his only Test appearance in Chennai in February, Kuldeep’s omission for the England tour was on the cards. Besides the 20 cricketers, the selectors have also announced four stand-byes. It isn’t surprising that barring opening batsman Abhimanyu Easwaran, the other three are pacers since they will double up as net bowlers due to COVID-19 protocols. While Avesh Khan has travelled with the squad earlier, Prasidh Krishna made his ODI debut in March. Gujarat left-armer Arzan Nagwaswalla is the other one. It is understood that after serving a week-long isolation in Mumbai, the men’s and women’s squads will board the flight to England on June 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jadeja-vihari-and-shami-return/article34510910.ece
08 May 2021||Harare,||Abid and Azhar put Pakistan in control||Centuries by Abid Ali and Azhar Ali put Pakistan in a strong position on the first day of the second Test against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Friday. Abid (118 not out) and Azhar (126) put on 236 for the second wicket before tall fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani brought Zimbabwe back into the match by taking three wickets with the second new ball. Pakistan was 268 for four at stumps. Abid and Azhar came together with the total on 12 in the eighth over and ground down the Zimbabwe bowlers before Azhar edged Muzarabani to gully in the last half hour of the day. Azhar's dismissal was followed by a second failure in the series for Babar Azam, Pakistan's captain and star batsman, who drove Muzarabani to point after scoring two. Muzarabani struck again when first Test centurion Fawad Alam dragged a short ball onto his stumps after scoring five.  Zimbabwe started the day well, claiming the wicket of Imran Butt in the eighth over. Butt top-edged a pull to midwicket against left-arm opening bowler Richard Ngarava. But Abid and Azhar settled in on an easy-paced pitch after seeing off some good bowling by Ngarava and Muzarabani. Pakistan gave a debut to 36-year-old seam bowler Tabish Khan.  The scores: Pakistan 268 for four in 90 overs (Abid Ali batting 118, Azhar Ali 126) vs Zimbabwe.

08 May 2021||Chennai,||I pray they make a speedy recovery: Sait||Former India hockey goalkeeper and Olympic medallist Muneer Sait expressed concern over the serious condition of Ravinder Pal Singh and M.K. Kaushik, who are both battling COVID-19 in Lucknow and New Delhi. Sait, who won a bronze medal in the 1968 Mexico Olympics and was regarded one of the finest custodians, was a National selector when Ravinder Pal and Kaushik were first picked for the country in the late 1970s. The 80-year-old Sait told The Hindu on Friday, “This is a shocking piece of news. Ravinder Pal was a fine centre-half and Kaushik a lively right winger. “I pray to the almighty that both make a speedy recovery. This is a disturbing piece of news.” Skill and speed Sait recalled, “I remember watching Ravinder Pal in a tournament here and was immediately struck by his skill level, fluidity and distribution. I was sitting next to IHF boss M.A.M. Ramaswamy and he said to me, ‘this boy plays very well.’” The octogenarian said, “Ravinder Pal, a simple quiet player, was duly roped in for India. And Kaushik caught the eye with his speed and thrust. He too was selected.” The former India goalkeeper added, “Both Ravinder Pal and Kaushik had a rewarding career for the country, winning the Gold medal in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. And Kaushik also became a successful coach.” Good team Sait said, “India had a very good team then. Ravinder Pal as centre-half and then Kaushik, Meryvn Fernandes, Mohammed Shahid and Jalaluddin in the forward line. Zafar Iqbal joined them later.” The remarkably fit Sait concluded, “Right now my thoughts are with Ravinder Pal and Kaushik and their families.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-pray-they-make-a-speedy-recovery-sait/article34511014.ece
08 May 2021||KOCHI,||Should the Tokyo Games be held?||The Malaysian Open has been postponed, leaving badminton stars like Saina Nehwal and K. Srikanth shattered. And last week, Indians were forced to miss the World Athletics Relays in Poland, an Olympic qualifier, as many European countries banned flights from India. There were also issues with the archers’ travel plans to Lausanne for the World Cup Stage-2. The Olympics are less than 80 days away but the coronavirus surge, travel restrictions and long quarantine have been left athletes restless and confused. So, should the Olympics, which are scheduled to begin on July 23, be held? “I’m all for having the Olympics. They come once in four years and a lot of hard work is involved,” said former badminton international and coach Vimal Kumar. “Only an athlete and people involved will know the pain a cancellation brings. I’m very confident the Japanese will manage it with super efficiency, without any issues. Those who are worried can stay away.” V. Baskaran, captain of the Indian hockey team that won gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, said the Games should be postponed to November-December. “If they are unable to do that, they should cancel it. In a team game, what happens if one player tests COVID positive. Will they stop the whole team? Whatever it is, the life of an athlete is more important than anything else,” he said.   Anju Bobby George, the lone Indian to win a World Championship medal in 2003 (long jump bronze), was undecided. “If you look from the athletes’ angle, years of hard work will go waste if the Games are not held. But if you have an Olympics now, it will not be a fair event because many athletes may miss the event and sometimes athletes may catch COVID in Japan and may not be able to compete,” she said. “So, am completely confused where to stand.” Anas for it “Having prepared so much for it and after having missed the World Relays, the Olympics should be held,” said former Asian champion Muhammed Anas, the 400m National record holder. “Of course, even if it is held there could be problems since the situation is bad. If they are having it, they should have it with only athletes.” Asian champion Jinson Johnson feels that if the Olympics happen, it will remove all the uncertainty over next year’s events like the Asiad and Commonwealth Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/should-the-tokyo-games-be-held/article34510957.ece

An inspired goalkeeping performance by David de Gea ensured United was only beaten 3-2 by Roma in a wild second leg of the Europa League semifinals, allowing the English team to complete an 8-5 victory on aggregate. It ended a run of four losses in the semifinals of major tournaments in the last 18 months for Solskjaer, who is under pressure to win United’s first trophy since 2017. Critical manager Yet Solskjaer was critical of his team for giving Roma so many chances at the Stadio Olimpico to turn around a semifinal that looked over after United scored five second-half goals to win the first leg 6-2 last week. “We played one very good half at Old Trafford that got us through,” he said. “The second half today was disappointing. Very, very poor.” Unai Emery, meanwhile, is heading back to the Europa League final on May 26 — at the expense of the club that fired him last season. Villarreal held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw in the second leg of its semifinal, which was enough to secure a 2-1 aggregate win. Emery will be looking for his fourth Europa League title after winning three straight with Sevilla and then taking Arsenal to the final two years ago.  The results (semifinals, second leg): Roma 3 (Dzeko 57, Cristante 60, Telles 83-og) bt Manchester United 2 (Cavani 39, 68) ( United wins 8-5 on aggregate).   Arsenal 0 drew with Villarreal 0 ( Villarreal wins 2-1 on aggregate).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/man-united-hangs-on-to-progress/article34510970.ece
08 May 2021||MADRID,||Zverev has the measure of Nadal||Rafael Nadal lost 6-4, 6-4 to Germany’s Alexander Zverev in the Madrid Open quarterfinals on Friday, casting doubts over the Spaniard’s form ahead of this month’s French Open. Zverev’s impressive straights-set win at the Caja Magica earns him a meeting with Dominic Thiem, in what will be a repeat of last year’s US Open final, which was won by Thiem. Thiem had earlier come from a set down to beat John Isner 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 and reach the last four. It started well for Nadal when he broke Zverev to love to lead 4-2 in the first set, Zverev serving a double fault to give away the first advantage. But the World No. 5 immediately hit back and then pulled away, four straight games clinching him the set. A whipping forehand down the line put Zverev up another break midway through the second and while Nadal resisted more pressure in the seventh game to hold, Zverev served out an impressive victory. In the women’s section, fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus eased past Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 6-3 to set up a final clash against top seed Ashleigh Barty.  The results: Men: Quarterfinals: Alexander Zverev bt Rafael Nadal 6-4, 6-4; Dominic Thiem bt John Isner 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.   Pre-quarterfinals: Zverev bt Daniel Evans 6-3, 7-6(3); Isner bt Andrey Rublev 7-6(4), 3-6, 7-6(4); Casper Ruud bt Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6(4), 6-4; Matteo Berrettini bt Federico Delbonis 7-6(4), 6-4.   Women: Semifinals: Aryna Sabalenka bt Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 6-3 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/zverev-has-the-measure-of-nadal/article34510912.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||Kohli and Anushka donate Rs. 2 crore||India captain Virat Kohli and his actor wife Anushka Sharma have donated Rs. 2 crore to a fund-raising project, which will raise a total of Rs. 7 crore, to support the country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The two are raising money through crowd-funding platform Ketto. “Virat Kohli and Bollywood superstar Anushka Sharma are aiming to raise Rs. 7 crore for COVID relief in India,” a press release from the celebrity couple stated. “They are kickstarting a fundraising campaign #InThisTogether on the crowd-funding platform Ketto and are putting Rs. 2 crore for this initiative.” The campaign will run for seven days on Ketto and the proceeds will be directed to ACT Grants, the implementation partner which will work towards providing oxygen, medical manpower, vaccination awareness and tele-medicine facilities all through the pandemic. “We are going through an unprecedented time in the history of our country and our nation needs all of us to unite and save as many people as possible. Anushka and I have been shocked to see the human suffering since last year,” Kohli said. Kohli said that he and his wife had tried to help as many people as possible in their fight against the virus. ACT Grants spokesperson Gayatri Yadav said, “Having strong voices like Anushka and Virat help drive fundraising efforts will go a long way towards helping us realise this goal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-and-anushka-donate-rs-2-crore/article34510916.ece
08 May 2021||SEVILLE,||Nadal and Osaka take the top honours||Tennis players Rafael Nadal and Naomi Osaka picked up the Laureus Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year awards on Thursday with football star Mo Salah and Formula One World champion Lewis Hamilton also recognised. World No. 2 Nadal claimed his fourth award as he was recognised for his 13th French Open and record-equalling 20th Major. Osaka, who won the US Open for the second time and has four Majors, is now a two-time Laureus winner. “Winning the French Open and equalling the 20th Grand Slam of Roger Federer has been an unforgettable moment,” said Nadal. “It means a lot to equal my great rival, but at the same time, my great friend.” Osaka was recognised also for her anti-racism stance particularly at the US Open where she wore face masks bearing the names of Black Americans who died as a result of police clashes or were victims of racial injustice. “Regarding my activism on the court, I think it is important to use my voice, because for me I feel like I often hold back a lot and worry about what people think of me, but you know if you have a platform it is very important you use it,” said the Japanese star. Bayern Munich, winner of the UEFA Champions League and the Bundesliga, took the Laureus World Team of the Year Award. Salah gets award Liverpool and Egypt footballer Salah won the Sporting Inspiration Award for his support of various charities, many in his home town of Nagrig. Hamilton was named the inaugural winner of the Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year award for his support for racial justice, wearing a Black Lives Matter helmet and black race suit and taking a knee at each GP. Canadian snowboarder Max Parrot was one of the most emotional winners. He received the Laureus World Comeback of the Year award after fighting back from cancer to win X-Games gold medals. Tennis great Billie Jean King was honoured with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement award.

08 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Sathiyan preparing in right earnest||G. Sathiyan has started preparing with his sparring partner Anirban Ghosh at the Raman High Performance TT Centre here. For the next two months the Indian star paddler said he would be working on “small details” with the sole focus being to put up a better show in the Tokyo Olympics. “The Sports Authority of India-Talent Olympic Podium Scheme (SAI-TOPS) has given whatever equipment I’ve asked for so that I keep up my level. I am a much better player than I was in the 2018 Commonwealth Games (CWG),” said Sathiyan, during a virtual press meet, organised by SAI-TOPS on Friday. “That showed in my game in the National championships and Olympic qualifiers in Doha recently. I’ve gained a lot of confidence and am keen to put up a strong show in Tokyo and hopefully win a historic medal in the quadrennial event.” Playing with an all-round player like Anirban would help him sharpen his game-skills, Sathiyan said. “I am focusing on things that are not my strengths like strokes that are powerful. I am also working on improving my serves and receives. I am working seven hours a day with my coach S. Raman with two hours of fitness under the supervision of Ramji Srinivasan,” he said. Sathiyan said he’s already asked SAI for a table (San-ei Absolute W Advanced) that is similar to the one to be used at the Tokyo Olympics. “I’ve already put that up with SAI-TOPS and I hope to get it soon,” he said. According to the newly-crowned National champion, playing in pro-leagues in Poland and Japan helped him maintain his level. “It helped me to be in match-mode. I hope I can carry that momentum in Tokyo,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sathiyan-preparing-in-right-earnest/article34510921.ece
08 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Blow to Olympic hopefuls as Malaysian Open is postponed||The Badminton Association of Malaysia and Badminton World Federation have jointly agreed to postpone the Celcom Axiata Malaysia Open championship scheduled to start from May 25 to 30, according to a BWF release on Friday. “All attempts were made by the organisers and the BWF to provide a safe tournament environment for all the participants, but the recent urge in cases left no choice but to postpone the tournament,” it said. The Malaysian and the Singapore Opens (the second one to follow immediately after the first one) are the last two qualifying events for the Tokyo Olympics to be held this July. Qualifying window Importantly, the BWF confirmed the rescheduled tournament will no longer take place in the Olympic qualifying window. New tournament dates will be confirmed at a later date. This is a big blow to the hopefuls from India including the London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal, former World No. 1 K. Srikanth and women’s doubles combine of Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy. “Yes, this is a huge blow to our chances. With the postponement of Malaysian Open and the 21-day quarantine period mandatory for the Singapore Open starting on June 1, it is almost over for us,” said Sikki Reddy, aiming to make her first appearance in Olympics. Ashwini also felt disappointed as this move comes close after the India Open in Delhi was postponed last month. “It is unfortunate just when we were really optimistic of making an impact and gaining crucial ranking points to make the cut thanks to the preparations under Mathias Boe (doubles coach). This postponement has hurt badly,” she said. “The Europeans have an edge over the Asians because their continental championship is over and they have picked up important points compared to us as we didn’t have it,” Ashwini said. “We were looking to playing in the Olympics. “We have been enjoying the training for the last few months after a pretty good showing in the few events we played early this year,” she said. World championship bronze medallist B. Sai Praneeth, who is assured of an Olympics slot by virtue of his ranking, also rued the missed opportunity of competing in two majors before the Olympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blow-to-olympic-hopefuls-as-malaysian-open-is-postponed/article34510924.ece

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Significance of mantras||Thirumoolar says that if one can understand the Vedas and also tell others about them, one will experience joy. He says Lord Siva has given him a suitable body and the mental ability to comprehend the Vedas and to speak about them. Only those who know fully the inner meaning of Vedas and the Saiva Agamas can be said to live auspicious lives. By talking of the significance of Vedic mantras and their uses, Thirumoolar shows us the significance of his work, Thirumandiram, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. Tholkappiyar, author of the grammar text Tholkappiyam, defines mantras. He says words that come from virtuous, knowledgeable persons are mantras. Thiruvalluvar in kural number 28 says the greatness of righteous people is evident from the mantras they give us. Thirumoolar says that the celestials and others recite mantras and worship Siva. (Thirumoolar refers to Lord Siva as Nandi). And just as the celestials recite mantras, so should his students. Although here Thirumoolar is addressing his students, his message is intended for the entire world. He wants everyone to have the benefits of chanting mantras and knowing their meaning. Here it would be apt to recall what Sekkizhar says about Gnanasambandar. He says that Gnanasambandar composed his Namasivaya Padhigam, so that the devas and those in this world could hear it. Sages like Thirumoolar are chosen by God to do good for the world. They do it through their deeds and words. Thirunavukkarasar was given the name Marulneekkiyar by his parents. When Marulneekkiyar was cured of his stomach ailment by Lord Siva, an asareeri voice announced that henceforth he would be called Navukkarasar. Navukarasar not only composed verses in praise of Lord Siva, but he also undertook the work of cleaning temples.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/significance-of-mantras/article34510875.ece

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A lazy Sunday biryani||In the good old days when Sundays were Sundays, and not just any old day squeezed in between two other nondescript days, part of our holiday fun was in going to Andhra Bhavan for some Hyderabadi biryani, which was available only on Sundays. I loved its hot flavours and the plump egg in it. A couple of Sundays ago, I suddenly pictured that delicious golden rice with juicy pieces of meat in it and thought I needed to do something about this yearning. I had earlier ordered from a place called Biryani Badshah, which had Andhra food on the menu. This eatery has branches and I tried out the outlet in Laxmi Nagar, which delivers through Swiggy and Zomato. There was some consternation about the name, a debate that we’d been having at home ever since I expressed a desire to order food from a Chinese restaurant called Shagun. But never judge an eatery by its name, I have always held. So, the order was placed: Hyderabadi dum biryani with mutton (Rs. 329), extra salan (Rs. 15), kaju ki sabzi (Rs. 209), chicken 65 (Rs. 249) and double ka meetha (Rs. 99). I started my meal with the chicken 65, which has been an old favourite ever since I first had it when a breakaway faction from Andhra Bhavan cooked it for us at some get-together long years ago. Legend has it that chicken 65 was first started by Chennai’s Buhari Hotel in 1965, though some said it was so named because it was cooked with 65 spices. Badshah’s fare did not disappoint me. The chicken, marinated in and cooked with yoghurt, was deliciously tender, and had taken in all the spices that it had been mixed with before being pan-fried. The chillies and curry leaves gave the dish a punch. What surprised me was the kaju sabzi . I have never had this, but I am quite a cashew nut fiend and thought the dish sounded promising. It had a creamy sauce of roasted ground cashew, flavoured with onions and tomato. I then went on to the biryani and salan . The salan — a mix of ground peanuts, sesame seeds and coconut — was nicely spicy, and went well with the biryani, which was hot, but had retained the flavours of the whole spices it had been cooked with. The rice was the way it should be in a good biryani — long and aromatic, and not sticking to one another like loyal members of a clan. I was a little suspicious of the double ka meetha , as it didn’t look much like the famous Hyderabadi dessert and seemed a bit runny. But it turned out to be rather nice — there was the flavor of saffron in the sauce, and cardamom added to the taste of the bread that had been softened and soaked in thickened and sweetened milk. The sweet dish brought the curtain down on what was quite a nice meal. I took the last spoonful of the double ka meetha and sighed. What’s in a name, I said to no one in particular.

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The good old days||Yesterday, as I was fighting the blues like everyone else in the country, I rediscovered Satyam Sivam , a Telugu film from the ’80s, on YouTube. It stars both ANR and NTR (if you need to know who they are, you’re from Uranus.) I went straight to the climax. I know my way around this territory. In a scene reflecting family values of the time, thespian Kaikala Satyanarayana is holding veteran actress Pushpalatha hostage (with a gun to her head) to escape from ANR. Satyanarayana and Pushpalatha are playing husband and wife, by the way. And ANR, 10 years older than his cinematic father, is playing their son. ANR also happens to be gloriously blind. This is made evident by his stumbling around looking at the ceiling and grabbing a hapless Rati Agnihotri for support. Now why would a man with a gun need a hostage if all he has to do is escape a blind man? ANR, you see, is a crack shot. And he can hit his target by ‘seeing’ with his ears. He proves his marksmanship a few minutes earlier by throwing a flower vase and shooting it. So wily old Satyanarayana is not taking any chances. He grabs his wife by the neck just as soon as she returns from the temple after performing an archana in his name. Well, Satyanarayana, and a fairly co-operative Pushpalatha (she has been estranged from her husband for many years, after all, and probably wants alone-time without a creepy, blind son who is older than her peering over their canoodling), make good their escape from their family home in a conveniently parked outdoor unit van. They head off in high speed in the direction of the docks. In the climax, it is mandatory for cast and crew of those times to head off to the docks, an abandoned factory or the villain’s den in a convoy of vehicles. But ANR has other plans. A rope that has been tied to the luggage carrier on the van’s roof snakes past him as the vehicle zooms off. ANR, still looking at the ceiling, grabs hold of it. And off he goes with the van. Dragged along the road horizontally, kicking and bleeding, you say? No! Why? Because ANR has roller-skates on his feet. When did he put them on? Maybe when his mother was being strangled by his father a minute ago? Maybe they’re built in? Maybe, unbeknownst to viewer, Pushpalatha bought them on her way to the temple and slyly passed them on to her blind son? Who cares. Now we have a van zigzagging across the bewildered roads of Vizag with a blind ANR on skates attached to it. Multi-tasker Satyanarayana juggles driving and kidnapping duties with firing intermittently at his son who is holding on like a blind barnacle. There is some hardcore back-projection with ANR doing an equally hardcore impersonation of a vision-impaired man on skates powered by a runaway van. Finally, one of the bullets gets the rope — dishkiyaoon — and ANR is disengaged from the vehicle. Or is he? From a nearby hill, the till-now absent other hero, NTR, espies this, and makes an entry like only he can. By diving on top of the van, grabbing the broken rope and keeping the chase alive... I can’t reveal any more. I suggest you watch this film. And every Amitabh Bachchan remake made in Tamil and Telugu with NTR, ANR and Sivaji Ganesan doing the honours. You’ll realise how good life used to be. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-good-old-days/article34510759.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Young brands, big heart||We are in a time of crisis. While at any other time, fashion could have been an escape — eight black dresses to match your inner rage and helplessness, perhaps — it just doesn’t work in the current scenario. Instead, amidst the pandemic chaos, young indie fashion brands have been leading the way with fundraising drives. With online sales actioned, proceeds are being donated to organisations working towards Covid relief. “The last 15 months have been tough on young brands. Still, given how dire the situation in India is, help is help,” says Gauri Verma of crafts-focussed brand, Jodi. Brushing aside questions on whether the ‘me too’ pressure has been a factor, Karuna Laungani, her partner, adds, “There will always be someone doing something first. What’s important is one is not last.”  Clothes for a cause  Most small brands function on cash flow business models. And the positive flow for these sales has been heartening. While Jodi managed to raise Rs. 18,75,400 — 50% of which has been donated to organisations like Hemkunt Foundation, Khalsa Aid and Mission Oxygen India — Olio Stories, a contemporary jewellery brand from New Delhi, raised Rs. 12,40,974 (6x of their initial target from a three-day sale). “I understand that sales right now can feel like a marketing gimmick, but at the end of the day, people’s lives will be saved [by what we collect],” says Rashi Agarwal Favier, of Raff, an ethical leather bags brand based in Pondicherry, that will be donating 50% from their May sales to Hemkunt Foundation, an NGO that is helping with oxygen and meal distribution. “Transparency about the contribution would be great, so it is not just about generating new orders.”  Sensitising and amplifying  And it’s not just about the money. Delhi-based veteran Urvashi Kaur, who is supporting karigars via Dastakar and Crafts Council of India, says that “amplification pushes other brands, both small and big, to offer support and be part of a much larger conversation. It helps sensitise brands to be more proactive, and build a collective consciousness”. For instance, up-and-coming brand Saundh, that focusses on Indian resort prints, worked with a Surat-based NGO to set up a 100-bed Covid treatment facility. As Sounak Sen Barat of Bengaluru-based House of Three (who will be donating 100% of their own sales and that of partner brands to ACT Grants, Doctor For You and Hasiru Dala) says, “Money isn’t the only thing that can resurrect us. Human effort is what’s keeping our country’s pulse ticking. Our hearts may be broken, but our spirits never will be.” Here’s to building back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/young-brands-big-heart/article34510746.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Kangana’s new clothes||On May 4, two fashion designers announced via social media that they will never work with Kangana Ranaut and took down all previous content featuring the actor. In doing so, Anand Bhushan and Rimzim Dadu marked the first time Indian designers have expressed and committed themselves to a moral and political stance so publicly. Fashion designers in India are known to be notoriously absent from any political discourse, especially in public. Few dared raise their voices during the CAA-NRC protests last year, knowing full well that a majority of their workforce is Muslim. So what led Bhushan and Dadu to do this? Ranaut is hardly the first Bollywood actor to be involved in politics. Was it because she stands apart as the most invective-laden supporter of the Central Government from the ranks of Bollywood currently aligned with the BJP? Truth bears witness that she regularly misrepresents facts, and that her words are the very essence of hate speech. But it was her reference to the Prime Minister’s stint as Gujarat’s CM during the worst pogrom in the history of Independent India — and openly calling for similar violence — that was the last straw for Bhushan and Dadu. “What I’ve communicated should not even be a talking point,” says Bhushan. “What is the significance of this over someone with millions of followers openly calling for violence?”  Creating a ripple effect?  What people outside fashion circles don’t know is that Ranaut has been a difficult person to dress for a few years now. Without making it public, many brands have repeatedly refused her stylists, and others have been horrified to see their clothes on her, which she happened to buy herself. So far, avoiding sourcing requests and being anxious of any perceived association had been an, ahem, internal matter. “But we don’t live in that world any more,” says prominent Bollywood stylist Mohit Rai. “Today, it’s no longer possible to continue dressing everyone blindly. The online environment demands you take responsibility and be answerable for your associations.” And this is what makes Delhi-based Bhushan’s and Dadu’s stance all the more poignant. “We should hold our celebrities, and the influence they have, responsible to help this country heal [at this difficult time] irrespective of which side of the political spectrum they stand on,” says Dadu. “In that light, I didn’t find it right that any celebrity even remotely try to insinuate violence.” Both Dadu, known for her metallic, fluid drapes, and Bhushan, for his unusual texturing, are popular with Bollywood actors. Since they posted their announcements on social media, the designers have been subjected to vicious trolling. “I am happy to say though, there was a lot of love as well,” says Bhushan, adding that users on Twitter were particularly supportive. “I hope this causes a ripple effect and even more established and influential designers make their voices heard in this matter,” adds Rai. Publicly calling out and disassociating with a Bollywood star can possibly have consequences. At the time of writing, Ranaut’s sister and manager, Rangoli Chandel, put up a series of Instagram stories where she threatened to sue Bhushan. “I have simply stated my intent to not work with someone, that’s all,” says Bhushan. “What is that compared to Twitter permanently suspending an account?”  Recognising their role  The fact that Bhushan’s stance elicited the threat of legal action from Chandel shows that it matters to the sisters, just as it does to many others; this small act of righteousness will inspire them to make their opinion known. Many influential people have already re-posted Bushan’s and Dadu’s posts, including actor Swara Bhaskar (on both Twitter and Instagram). As I write this, designer Gaurav Gupta, reacting on Instagram to an article in a Mumbai-based publication, commented: “Yes, never working with her again — ever!!” By now it should be obvious that the taint of association never truly goes away. History teaches us so. Look at Coco Chanel’s alleged ties to the Nazis, still the stuff of legend — as is the very real history of Hugo Boss making uniforms for the Hitler Youth and the Waffen-SS (the company rendered a public apology in 2011). It’s time that the fashion industry recognise the role it plays in creating the myth, glamour, and romance around their favourite actors. Everyone needs to start taking responsibility for the associations they foster — do they stand for a horrifying belief system that gives rise to a Kangana Ranaut? Because the art and the artist can no longer be separated. Give the emperor no new clothes and the truth will stand stark naked. All it takes, as Bhushan and Dadu have shown, is a simple no.

But at a time when the battle against the coronavirus is being fought on social media and messaging apps — rallying volunteers, sharing resources, hunting down hospital beds and oxygen cylinders — it’s tough to stop that thumb from moving. And occasionally, you chance upon small glimmers of joy. Like a 12-year-old baking cookies under #BakeForIndia, to collect funds for Covid relief, or a philanthropist donning a PPE suit just to bring food to street dogs, or neighbours pitching in to make sure an isolating family gets to celebrate a birthday. Delhi-based chef Eeshaan Kashyap, for instance, has been making frittatas, flat breads, and even a dhokla ‘cake’ for friends who’ve not been able to cook their own meals. His most recent success story: a decadent banana bread with chocolate chunks for children whose parents have tested positive and were getting antsy by themselves. “Now a lot of people have got in touch, asking if I could bake for them. So I make something twice a week for them,” says Kashyap. But who is celebrating these volunteers? As the second wave grows in intensity, people are stepping up with little gestures of kindness to acknowledge the tremendous work others are doing. From free brownies and haircuts for plasma donors to free therapy sessions, there’s plenty of goodwill out there. We highlight a few.

As many as 65,539 cases have been disposed of by the respective state authorities as of 24 April 2021, according to data by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Out of this, nearly 40% cases (approx. 26,510 complaints) were resolved in Uttar Pradesh alone, followed by Haryana with 13,269 cases and Maharashtra with 9,265 cases. The three states cumulatively accounted for nearly 75% of the total disposed cases under RERA in the country. Project and real estate agent registrations under RERA have also been growing steadily. As of April 24, 2021, nearly 63,583 projects and 50,256 real estate agents have been registered under RERA across the country. Back in the corresponding period in 2019, about 40,155 projects and 29,208 real estate agents were registered. This amounts to an increase of 58% and 72% respectively over the last two years. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants says, “One of RERA’s primary purposes is to address real estate consumers’ grievances. As such, the fact that the RERA authorities of various states and UTs have resolved over 65,539 consumer complaints in the last four years is noteworthy.” He adds that Uttar Pradesh has resolved the highest number of cases, which is again notable considering how severely Noida and Greater Noida had been impacted by shady dealings of unscrupulous players. Maharashtra remains the frontrunner for project registrations — of all projects registered under RERA to date across 34 states/UTs, Maharashtra accounts for a 45% share. Gujarat comes next with a 13% share, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka with about a 6% share each, and Uttar Pradesh with a 5% share. Progress of RERA So far, 34 States/UTs have notified rules under RERA. The North Eastern State of Nagaland is still under process to notify its rules while West Bengal enacted its own legislation that was challenged by the MoHUA before the Supreme Court. However, in a major development, the apex court very recently struck down West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (WBHIRA) stating that it overlaps with RERA that was enacted a law in the Parliament.  30 States/UTs have already set up a Real Estate Regulatory Authority since implementation, and of this at least five are interim. Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Meghalaya and Sikkim have also notified their RERA rules but are yet to establish Authorities.  28 States/UTs have set up Real Estate Appellate Tribunal for disposing of consumer complaints, including six as interim. Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim are still underway to establish theirs.  Regulatory authorities of 27 States/UTs have operationalized their websites under RERA provisions. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur are under process to operationalise.

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The good old days||Yesterday, as I was fighting the blues like everyone else in the country, I rediscovered Satyam Sivam , a Telugu film from the ’80s, on YouTube. It stars both ANR and NTR (if you need to know who they are, you’re from Uranus.) I went straight to the climax. I know my way around this territory. In a scene reflecting family values of the time, thespian Kaikala Satyanarayana is holding veteran actress Pushpalatha hostage (with a gun to her head) to escape from ANR. Satyanarayana and Pushpalatha are playing husband and wife, by the way. And ANR, 10 years older than his cinematic father, is playing their son. ANR also happens to be gloriously blind. This is made evident by his stumbling around looking at the ceiling and grabbing a hapless Rati Agnihotri for support. Now why would a man with a gun need a hostage if all he has to do is escape a blind man? ANR, you see, is a crack shot. And he can hit his target by ‘seeing’ with his ears. He proves his marksmanship a few minutes earlier by throwing a flower vase and shooting it. So wily old Satyanarayana is not taking any chances. He grabs his wife by the neck just as soon as she returns from the temple after performing an archana in his name. Well, Satyanarayana, and a fairly co-operative Pushpalatha (she has been estranged from her husband for many years, after all, and probably wants alone-time without a creepy, blind son who is older than her peering over their canoodling), make good their escape from their family home in a conveniently parked outdoor unit van. They head off in high speed in the direction of the docks. In the climax, it is mandatory for cast and crew of those times to head off to the docks, an abandoned factory or the villain’s den in a convoy of vehicles. But ANR has other plans. A rope that has been tied to the luggage carrier on the van’s roof snakes past him as the vehicle zooms off. ANR, still looking at the ceiling, grabs hold of it. And off he goes with the van. Dragged along the road horizontally, kicking and bleeding, you say? No! Why? Because ANR has roller-skates on his feet. When did he put them on? Maybe when his mother was being strangled by his father a minute ago? Maybe they’re built in? Maybe, unbeknownst to viewer, Pushpalatha bought them on her way to the temple and slyly passed them on to her blind son? Who cares. Now we have a van zigzagging across the bewildered roads of Vizag with a blind ANR on skates attached to it. Multi-tasker Satyanarayana juggles driving and kidnapping duties with firing intermittently at his son who is holding on like a blind barnacle. There is some hardcore back-projection with ANR doing an equally hardcore impersonation of a vision-impaired man on skates powered by a runaway van. Finally, one of the bullets gets the rope — dishkiyaoon — and ANR is disengaged from the vehicle. Or is he? From a nearby hill, the till-now absent other hero, NTR, espies this, and makes an entry like only he can. By diving on top of the van, grabbing the broken rope and keeping the chase alive... I can’t reveal any more. I suggest you watch this film. And every Amitabh Bachchan remake made in Tamil and Telugu with NTR, ANR and Sivaji Ganesan doing the honours. You’ll realise how good life used to be. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-good-old-days/article34511415.ece
08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Kangana’s new clothes||On May 4, two fashion designers announced via social media that they will never work with Kangana Ranaut and took down all previous content featuring the actor. In doing so, Anand Bhushan and Rimzim Dadu marked the first time Indian designers have expressed and committed themselves to a moral and political stance so publicly. Fashion designers in India are known to be notoriously absent from any political discourse, especially in public. Few dared raise their voices during the CAA-NRC protests last year, knowing full well that a majority of their workforce is Muslim. So what led Bhushan and Dadu to do this? Ranaut is hardly the first Bollywood actor to be involved in politics. Was it because she stands apart as the most invective-laden supporter of the Central government from the ranks of Bollywood currently aligned with the BJP? Truth bears witness that she regularly misrepresents facts, and that her words are the very essence of hate speech. But it was her reference to the Prime Minister’s stint as Gujarat’s CM during the worst pogrom in the history of Independent India — and openly calling for similar violence — that was the last straw for Bhushan and Dadu. “What I’ve communicated should not even be a talking point,” says Bhushan. “What is the significance of this over someone with millions of followers openly calling for violence?”  Creating a ripple effect?  What people outside fashion circles don’t know is that Ranaut has been a difficult person to dress for a few years now. Without making it public, many brands have repeatedly refused her stylists, and others have been horrified to see their clothes on her, which she happened to buy herself. So far, avoiding sourcing requests and being anxious of any perceived association had been an, ahem, internal matter. “But we don’t live in that world any more,” says prominent Bollywood stylist Mohit Rai. “Today, it’s no longer possible to continue dressing everyone blindly. The online environment demands you take responsibility and be answerable for your associations.” And this is what makes Delhi-based Bhushan’s and Dadu’s stance all the more poignant. “We should hold our celebrities, and the influence they have, responsible to help this country heal [at this difficult time] irrespective of which side of the political spectrum they stand on,” says Dadu. “In that light, I didn’t find it right that any celebrity even remotely try to insinuate violence.” Both Dadu, known for her metallic, fluid drapes, and Bhushan, for his unusual texturing, are popular with Bollywood actors. Since they posted their announcements on social media, the designers have been subjected to vicious trolling. “I am happy to say though, there was a lot of love as well,” says Bhushan, adding that users on Twitter were particularly supportive. “I hope this causes a ripple effect and even more established and influential designers make their voices heard in this matter,” adds Rai. Publicly calling out and disassociating with a Bollywood star can possibly have consequences. At the time of writing, Ranaut’s sister and manager, Rangoli Chandel, put up a series of Instagram stories where she threatened to sue Bhushan. “I have simply stated my intent to not work with someone, that’s all,” says Bhushan. “What is that compared to Twitter permanently suspending an account?”  Recognising their role  The fact that Bhushan’s stance elicited the threat of legal action from Chandel shows that it matters to the sisters, just as it does to many others; this small act of righteousness will inspire them to make their opinion known. Many influential people have already re-posted Bushan’s and Dadu’s posts, including actor Swara Bhaskar (on both Twitter and Instagram). As I write this, designer Gaurav Gupta, reacting on Instagram to an article in a Mumbai-based publication, commented: “Yes, never working with her again — ever!!” By now it should be obvious that the taint of association never truly goes away. History teaches us so. Look at Coco Chanel’s alleged ties to the Nazis, still the stuff of legend — as is the very real history of Hugo Boss making uniforms for the Hitler Youth and the Waffen-SS (the company rendered a public apology in 2011). It’s time that the fashion industry recognise the role it plays in creating the myth, glamour, and romance around their favourite actors. Everyone needs to start taking responsibility for the associations they foster — do they stand for a horrifying belief system that gives rise to a Kangana Ranaut? Because the art and the artist can no longer be separated. Give the emperor no new clothes and the truth will stand stark naked. All it takes, as Bhushan and Dadu have shown, is a simple no.

08 May 2021||May 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A trucker’s tale||Ivan Ayr’s Milestone (Hindi name: Meel Patthar ), which released on Netflix on May 7, has no background score. It is, therefore, full of sounds you hear on the road, on the kind of industrial-belt pathways the film is set in. The truck engine’s spectrum of sounds, drivers checking up on each other (and on the possibility of police stoppages ahead) in the middle of a hectic evening, the banter overheard at a line hotel — it is authentic in the extreme, which is just one of the movie’s many fine qualities.  Milestone , which premièred in the Orrizonti (Horizons) section of the 77th Venice International Film Festival in 2020, is the story of Ghalib (Suvinder Vicky), a truck driver going through a phase of existential despair. His wife recently died and he’s dealing with a compensation claim from her family. Plus, there’s the prospect of his bad back and advancing years conspiring to replace him with a younger, hungrier man called Pash (Lakshvir Saran). The film, edited and produced by Ayr, is distinguished by its character studies and its scenes of quietly powerful contemplation, where the audience is invited to make up their own minds about a man confronting his obsolescence.  The name game Speaking about the origin of the film’s screenplay, Ayr says, “Some of my extended family was in the trucking business at one point. I’d heard many anecdotes from them, about the trials and tribulations of truck drivers. But since that was a long time ago, I wanted to see how things were like on the ground today, on the outskirts of Delhi, especially Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar [a prime commercial locality],” adding that he started scouting for locations in mid-2019. Intriguingly, the two central characters in the movie are named after legendary poets — Ghalib and Pash. Is this a deliberate contrast between the narrative’s overall bleakness and the flair and flamboyance associated with, say, the verses of Ghalib? Or was it just Ayr’s version of a cinematic red herring? “I like to do visual poetry rather than having explicit poetry in my films,” says the director about his second feature length film, after 2018’s much-acclaimed Soni , based on a young policewoman, also in Delhi, who is working towards addressing crimes against women. “In an earlier draft of the screenplay, I was thinking of making the truck driver an aspiring poet, but I dropped the idea since it wasn’t really being true to the rest of the script. So then it became a question of do I want to retain the names? In the real world, nobody talks about poetry so the names wouldn’t matter at that level. It’s a cynical idea but the names really are there just for people to wonder over.”  Casting a poet Another poetic connection comes about through a minor character, a union leader who’s helping labourers negotiate better wages for themselves. This young Bihari union leader is played by Aamir Aziz, the Delhi-based poet whose poem Sab Yaad Rakha Jaayega catapulted him to online fame last year, including a shout-out by Roger Waters (co-founder of the band Pink Floyd), who recited a translated version of the poem at a charity event in London. Talking about this, Ayr says, “The casting of Aamir Aziz was not planned. When we reached out to him, he hadn’t become as well-known as he is today. We wanted a young guy who could play a union leader from Bihar. He was involved with some theatre groups, one of which put us in touch with him. Back then, we had no idea that his poetry is so powerful!”  The walls of Delhi Ayr originally wrote the film back when he was in the US. He was imagining the truck driver in a place that’s “like a melting pot”. As such, immigration is a big part of the puzzle that Milestone poses in front of the audience. Nearly all the characters are struggling with literal or metaphorical displacement. He says, “When I adapted the story to Delhi, I didn’t have any problems because the city, for me, is like a melting pot. People from all over the country come here to earn their livelihood, adapting to new cultures, blending in. So you have this neighbour who’s Kashmiri, the wife is from Sikkim, Ghalib himself comes from Punjab. It’s what I have experienced personally and I felt I could use that aspect of Delhi life in this story. ” Milestone is now   streaming on Netflix||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-truckers-tale/article34511438.ece
08 May 2021||New Delhi,||Revisit circular capping rates for COVID treatment, says HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the AAP government to “revisit” its June 2020 circular capping per-day package rates for COVID-19 treatments in private hospitals at Rs. 18,000, saying “hospitals will run at loss” at this rate in the current scenario. “This circular is nearly a year old. The situation – what it was then [June 2020] and what it is today – is drastically different,” a High Court Bench said highlighting that the medical infrastructure and manpower have become a scarcity due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. It noted that now if a COVID patient wants a paramedic staffer or a private attendant at home, he will be hard-pressed to find one. “They are charging on a per-day basis. For a nurse, they are charging around Rs. 10,000 per day. The paramedic staffers and doctors, if they are risking their lives, then they are entitled to charge more. We should not hold grudges,” the Bench said. “There is huge scarcity of BiPAP and medicines and the rates have gone up. So this [circular] needs to be revisited and brought to a realistic level so that hospitals are able to follow it,” the High Court said. “You have to realistically revisit this... if you are to implement this circular at this time, at Rs. 18,000, hospitals will actually run at loss,” the court added. The court’s direction came while hearing a plea of a lawyer who raised the issue of overcharging of beds by private hospitals. The lawyer argued that there are hospitals in Delhi, which are advertising COVID packages with exorbitant charges. He said that as per the June 20, 2020 circular of the Delhi government, Rs. 18,000 includes everything. “Every hospital I called told me that they are charging Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 per night,” the lawyer said. “I can show a bill where a hospital is charging Rs. 30,000 per day for an ICU package, over and above they are charging for oxygen, BiPAP, gloves. The circular of Delhi government says that it has to be Rs. 18,000, including everything,” the lawyer said. As per the circular, the per-day rates, including the cost of PPE, in hospitals accredited by NABH are Rs. 10,000 for isolation bed, including supportive care and oxygen; Rs. 15,000 for ICU without ventilator; and Rs. 18,000 for ICU with ventilator.

08 May 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Situation in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh critical, says HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday asked the Centre to consider reorientation of the supply of oxygen from various plants in such a manner that the allocated quantity reaches the respective States before already allotted quota is exhausted to avoid loss of life. Hearing a petition over the ongoing pandemic management in Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory – Chandigarh, the Court of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh said at present the situation in the two States and the UT appears to be critical and deserves immediate attention of the Union Government. During the hearing, the Punjab government in an affidavit said while the State was facing a deficit of 32 lakh doses of vaccine for people above the age of 45 years, it requires 2.64 crore doses for those between the 18-44 age group for which the State is in dialogue with private suppliers, who have so far managed to supply only 1 lakh doses. Punjab’s Advocate-General Atul Nanda said the State requires 300 MT oxygen whereas the Centre has allocated 227 MT oxygen, and that too is not reaching the State.  Life-saving drug Besides, the State needs 600 doses of Tocilizumab, a life-saving drug in critical cases. Haryana’s Advocate-General Baldev Raj Mahajan said the State is facing extreme shortage of oxygen despite the fact that it has a plant located at Panipat which is manufacturing 260 MT. Instead of allowing the State to get the supply from this plant, it has been allocated far off places like Rourkela and Jamnagar. The resultant delay has led to several deaths, he added. Satya Pal Jain, Additional Solicitor General of India, representing the Union of India, said the allocation of oxygen is being done equitably to all the States. He said difficulties are being faced in view of the fact that certain States do not have oxygen plants and they have also to be supplied oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/situation-in-punjab-haryana-chandigarh-critical-says-hc/article34511120.ece
08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||A glimmer of hope as fresh cases remain below 20,000||The Capital recorded 341 deaths and 19,832 new COVID-19 cases on Friday. A heath bulletin released by the Delhi government said that 79,593 tests were conducted over a 24-hour period with a positivity rate of 24.92%. The positivity rate was below the 25% mark for the second consecutive day. After staying above the 30% mark for 12 days, the positivity rate fell below the 30% mark on May 2, providing a glimmer of hope that the number of cases were not rising. This is the fourth time in the last five days that the number of new cases has remained below 20,000. The bulletin said that there are currently 91,035 active cases in the Capital with 50,425 patients under home isolation. The cumulative figures since the pandemic started stand at 12,92,867 cases with 18,739 deaths and 11,83,083 recoveries.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said 1.84 lakh people in the 18-44 age group had got their first dose since the inoculation of this category started on May 3. Bed availability The Delhi government also directed all healthcare facilities in the national capital treating COVID-19 patients to update the status of bed availability on Delhi Corona App and website “as frequently as feasible”. The health department said that many hospitals are not updating status of different categories of bed availability regularly on the designated portal which was creating great hardship to the public who, in the absence of reliable information, are forced to spend time and energy in searching vacant beds and are subjected to harassment and agony. “Medical Directors, Medical Superintendents and Directors of all such facilities are directed to update the status of beds on the “portal and Delhi Corona App as frequently as feasible, but not later than two hourly”, the health department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-glimmer-of-hope-as-fresh-cases-remain-below-20000/article34511129.ece

Three of these, including a 1,000 LPM oxygen plant at Gurugram’s Sector 10 Civil Hospital, are likely to be operational by the end of the month.

He also informed that makeshift hospitals were being set up in the city and 400 additional beds would be available in a week’s time. Dr. Garg also informed that 25-30 points would be set up for the distribution of liquid oxygen to COVID-19 patients to avoid long queues at Manesar Plant. Chief Medical Officer, Virender Yadav, in the meeting, said that the oxygen plant at Civil Hospital and two plants with of 200 LPM capacity each at sub-division level hospitals in Sohna and Pataudi would be functional by May-end.

08 May 2021||New Delhi,||‘Ensure all eligible people in Delhi get jab in next 3 months’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday chaired a high-level meeting on the current situation of COVID-19 in Delhi where he directed officials concerned to ensure all eligible people in the city are vaccinated within the next three months. The government said that at the meeting, Mr. Kejriwal told the officials that following the improvement in the situation of oxygen in Delhi, there should be no death due to oxygen shortage. The government said that he also directed all District Magistrates to pay surprise visits to vaccination centres and relief camps in order to review the preparations for the convenience of the people. “Now that Delhi has received oxygen, no one in Delhi should suffer due to shortage of oxygen. All the hospitals in Delhi should increase their beds and every DM should arrange new oxygen beds in their districts so that no deaths happen due to lack of oxygen,” Mr. Kejriwal was quoted as having said at the meeting. “The hampering of oxygen distribution has to be corrected so that there is no disruption in its supply. We have to try to prevent oxygen wastage and save as much oxygen as we can. If we can, we should save oxygen and return it to the Central government so that it can be used somewhere else,” he also said. The 48 oxygen plants coming up across Delhi, the Chief Minister said, should be installed immediately. These plants have an oxygen production capacity of 40 tonnes and will further help in improving Delhi’s oxygen situation, he said. The Delhi government, he said, had to prepare long-term plans and build the capacity of oxygen storage on a very large scale in the city as well as create a special storage capacity for oxygen. At the meeting, the government stated, the officials concerned told Mr. Kejriwal that the biggest difficulty at present was supplying oxygen and that the companies doing so should be asked to supply oxygen at the earliest. The Chief Minister, according to the government, expressed displeasure at patients in home isolation not being given oximeters at home and directed that it should be ensured that oximeters are given to all such patients recovering from COVID in home isolation. “We will be able to stop the third wave of COVID from coming to Delhi only by being able to administer vaccines to everyone in Delhi as soon as possible in the next three months,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “We need to recruit retired doctors, nurses, and medical staffers on a large scale. Whoever wants to help the society should join the government and lend help in this difficult situation,” he also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ensure-all-eligible-people-in-delhi-get-jab-in-next-3-months/article34511133.ece

08 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi gets 577 MT oxygen against demand of 976 MT||The Delhi government on Friday said that it was supplied 577 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen by the Central government on Thursday against its total demand of 976 MT. The previous day, the government said, it had received 730 MT of oxygen after the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court intervened in the matter and added that unless it continues to receive over 700 MT of oxygen a day regularly and with certainty, it will not be able to increase the number of oxygen beds in the Capital and give proper care for patients in need of oxygen. AAP MLA Radhav Chadha, while releasing the oxygen bulletin, said: “By supplying 730 MT on a day, the Central government does not live up to their responsibilities. The supply of oxygen is supposed to be regular on a daily basis. We cannot be transferring sufficient oxygen and giving it to our patients on one day because of their increased supply, and completely deprive them on another day because the Centre decreased our supply.” “I would like to reiterate that this demand of ours is not one-time or temporary, but a quantity that we need on a daily basis. This demand has also been proved and backed by the Supreme Court and High Court time and again,” he also said. Mr. Chadha said that the fight against COVID-19 did not require a normal bed with a mattress and medication for a patient to recover, but needed a continuous supply of oxygen to the patient occupying the bed. “As oxygen supply increases, the Delhi government is working on a war footing to formulate all plans and policies to increase the number of beds further,” he said. The oxygen bulletin added that on Thursday, SOS calls were received from nine hospitals and the government addressed all of them. “To these nine SOS calls, we delivered 5.10 MT of oxygen from our reserves. Approximately 909 beds were on oxygen support in these nine hospitals. This means, the Kejriwal government saved 909 lives yesterday,” Mr. Chadha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-gets-577-mt-oxygen-against-demand-of-976-mt/article34511131.ece
