16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two killed in Kerala as cyclone intensifies||Cyclonic storm Tauktae (pronounced Tau’te) in the Arabian Sea is expected to intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm by Sunday, with windspeeds expected to touch 160 kmph by Monday. Heavy rain accompanying the storm claimed two lives in Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts of Kerala and forced more than 2,000 to move to 71 camps. The State recorded an average rainfall of 145.5 mm on Saturday, Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan said, citing data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with the power and agriculture sectors reporting heavy damage. The storm moved northwards and lay about 250 km southwest of Panjim-Goa and 620 km south-southwest of Mumbai. The Lakshwadeep Islands and the Ghat districts of Tamil Nadu also received significant rain. Rain is expected to intensify in coastal Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat over the next 48 hours, causing damage to plantations, thatched houses and roads. Fishermen have been warned to stay off the sea. The IMD expects Tauktae to touch the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon or evening, with wind speeds increasing to 175 kmph. Current forecasts show heavy rain in the coastal districts of Gujarat, including extremely heavy rainfall in Junagadh and Gir Somnath and heavy to very heavy rain in Saurashtra, Kutch and Diu, Junagadh, Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Amreli, Rajkot, and Jamnagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-killed-in-kerala-as-cyclone-intensifies/article34569610.ece
16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Over 4,500 ‘missing deaths’ in Delhi||More than 4,500 people, who lost their lives in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, slipped through the cracks of the Delhi government death records. A dovetailing of funerals with the death toll issued by the government between April 18 and May 11 throws up a cumulative discrepancy of 4,783; the figures varied every day with the difference as high as 336 at its peak. According to the municipal records, 12,833 COVID-19 patients were cremated or buried during the 24-day period, at an average of 534 funerals a day or 22 every 60 minutes. The government, however, registered 8,050 COVID-19 deaths during the same interval. The BJP-led civic bodies attributed the mismatch to the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government’s attempt to “deliberately hide” the actual number of deaths by suppressing statistics and excluding suspected coronavirus patients from the tally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/over-4500-missing-deaths-in-delhi/article34569612.ece
16 May 2021||UNNAO,||As administration clamps down, Unnao’s poor struggle to conduct funerals||Having travelled 30 km from his village Parsanda with the body of his teenage niece in an open mini-truck without any fuel or wood for cremation, Bachu Lal was caught in a fix when the cleaners at the Baksar Ghat informed him he would not be allowed to bury the body following new directions from the administration. The ghat came under official spotlight earlier this week after visuals showed a large number of bodies believed to be of COVID-19 victims buried there, allegedly due to scarcity of cremation resources and rise in fatalities due to the infection — a claim yet to be officially acknowledged. Since the girl was unmarried, Bachu Lal’s family, as per customs, had planned to bury the body instead of cremating it. Cremation with the proper rituals would cost the family around Rs. 6,000-8000, a sum they could ill afford amid the lockdown. A distraught Lal said just a month ago, the family had buried the body of a relative at the same site without any hindrances. Baksar Ghat is located in Unnao along the Ganga but is very close to the borders with Rae Bareli, Kanpur and Fatehpur districts. The administration recently launched a probe after an unknown number of bodies were allegedly found buried in the sand at two locations by the Ganga — one of them Baksar. At the ghat on Saturday, half-a-dozen bodies have already arrived for cremation though it is not even 10 in the morning. Three pyres have been lit. There is hardly any physical distancing as kin and friends of the dead prepare for their turn. Beyond the cremation sheds, mounds in the sand are marked with saffron or white cloth. Clothes, broken objects and dirt are strewn on the uneven ground as dogs and crows scan the landscape for possible remains. Some dogs can be seen digging aggressively in sandbars in the river where a few bodies were recently buried after the main ghat ran out of space. It is difficult to estimate how many bodies may have been buried at the site but locals say the figure is above 200. Rakesh, one of the many cleaners on the ghat, has spent two decades of his life digging the pits and clearing the surface of the cremation ghat. He says that while the ghat usually received 15-20 bodies or fewer daily, during the peak of the COVID-19 in April, as many as 70-80 bodies arrived for final rites on a single day. Of these, children and those from poor families were buried as many could not afford the cost of firewood, he said. “Nobody cremates their little children,” he explained. Prakash, another cleaner, says there had been a long queue at the cremation site last month. “We tell the people to not throw the body into the river but bury them instead,” he said. The number of bodies coming to the ghat has dropped over the past week and none of them were buried since the controversy broke out, said Rakesh. Asked if those buried had died of COVID, both Rakesh and Prakash said they did not know. “The relatives don’t even take the name of corona. Some say death happened due to fever, others say it was a ‘sudden death; breathing, TB, heart attack...,” said Prakash. ‘No abandoned bodies’ Bighapur sub-divisional magistrate Daya Shankar Pathak said not a single body was found in the open on the ghat. “All were found buried,” he said, when asked what the probe had found so far. Asked if instructions had been given banning burials after the matter came to light, Mr. Pathak said, “No, people who are conducting the last rites are doing it as per their customs.” District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said not a single body was found floating in the Ganga. There are several sites in Unnao where, as per customs, bodies are either cremated or buried, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-administration-clamps-down-unnaos-poor-struggle-to-conduct-funerals/article34570004.ece

16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||ENT Hospital nodal centre for Black Fungus treatment||The government ENT Hospital at Koti has been designated nodal centre for admitting and treating Black Fungus (Mucormycosis) cases. The fungal infection patients who are still COVID-positive or may need multidisciplinary treatment, such as those with pulmonary involvement, will be admitted at Gandhi Hospital, Musheerabad. As some of these cases would need intervention of ophthalmologist, services of specialists from SD Eye Hospital would be used. Orders to this effect were issued by Telangana’s Director of Medical Education (DME) K. Ramesh Reddy on Saturday. He said that the nodal centre was created based on instructions from Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to treat the cases. The DME noted that some steroids are used as part of COVID-19 treatment, which leads to reduction in immunity levels. “The patients may be prone to fungal infections due to associated co-morbidities like severe diabetes, and one of these fungal infections is Black Fungus. A few cases are being reported form various parts of the State,” Dr. Ramesh stated.  The DME has acknowledged the shortage of the drug Liposomal Amphotericin B used in treating these cases, as is the case all over the country. It was published in these columns a few days ago that ENT surgeons and consultants have flagged possible shortage of the anti-fungal medicines as the fungal infection cases are surging. Dr. Ramesh said that Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMIDC) has initiated steps to procure them. “There are alternative drugs for treatment of this fungal disease like Posaconazole and Fluconazole, which are also in short supply and steps are being taken to procure them. No one need to get panicky about this and they can approach these hospitals for necessary advise and treatment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ent-hospital-nodal-centre-for-black-fungus-treatment/article34570008.ece
16 May 2021||KALABURAGI,||Oxygen problem manageable in Kalaburagi: DC||Kalaburagi district that had faced severe medical oxygen crunch a few days ago is now able to manage the problem after the supply of liquid medical oxygen has been streamlined, said Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna. “Now the oxygen problem is under complete control. After the supply of liquid medical oxygen is streamlined, the district has enough for the available oxygen beds. Earlier, two cryogenic oxygen tankers were deployed to supply the liquid medical oxygen. Now, one more has been added. These supplies, along with the locally generated oxygen, brought the problem under control,” Ms. Jyothsna told presspersons during her weekly interaction with journalists at her office here on Saturday. When asked about the bed availability, the officer said that 583 beds, including 81 with oxygen, were unoccupied and available for the new patients at the moment. Expressing discontentment over the people’s careless behaviour, Ms. Jyothsna said that even after fining 12,550 individuals for not wearing masks at public places, seizing 2,518 vehicles that were out on streets without valid reasons, and booking cases against 259 people for violating lockdown restrictions, the people continue to be disrespectful to the COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines. “Despite knowing the fact about the fast-spreading of COVID-19, an increasing number of deaths, tremulous pressure on the healthcare staff, the crunch of resources, people continue to be careless. I once again appeal to the people to display pandemic-appropriate behaviour,” she said. When asked whether the COVID-19 testing was reduced, Ms. Jyothsna responded by stating that the testing was, as per the revised guidelines from the government, being done only on those who had COVID-19 symptoms and those who were the contacts of confirmed patients. “Earlier, we had tested 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. Now, the number is reduced to 3,000 to 4,000 after we stopped random testing,” she said. To a question on the patients with COVID-19 symptoms being treated at the local medical practitioners in the rural areas and going unreported in the official data, Ms. Jyothsna said that it was a genuine concern and she had issued a number of directions to the local practitioners to keep the track on the patients. “We have to have a completely different strategy to handle the crisis in the rural areas. We have asked local medical practitioners to collect the throat swab samples of the patients with COVID-19 symptoms. If any of the patients tests positive for the pandemic, we can track and guide,” she said. When asked about the district administration’s preparations to face the possible third wave of the pandemic, Ms. Jyothsna said that, considering the experts’ warning that the third wave would hit the children as they were not vaccinated, she had initiated a number of measures. “We are going to place orders for the paediatric masks and oxygen masks that could fit the children. We have directed the officials to mobilise resources to treat the infected children such as ventilators. Since we cannot use the adult medication in the same form for children, we will have to order for syrups,” she said. Zilla panchayat Chief Executive Officer Deelish Sasi and District Health and Family Welfare Officer Sharanabasappa Ganajalkhed were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oxygen-problem-manageable-in-kalaburagi-dc/article34569702.ece

16 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA/GUNTUR,||High Court sets up Division Bench to deal with MP’s petition||Within hours of the dismissal of the bail plea of Member of Parliament from Narasapuram K. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju, the Andhra Pradesh High Court set up a special Division Bench comprising Justices C. Praveen Kumar and K. Lalitha Kumari by treating a letter by the MP’s advocate B. Adinarayana, wherein he complained that the MP was manhandled during the CID custody, as a habeas corpus petition. Taking cognisance of the letter, in which Mr. Adinarayana Rao sought the constitution of a Division Bench citing paucity of time to file a formal petition for staying the single judge’s order and requested to look into his complaint that the MP was beaten up in spite of his frail health, the court referred his contention to the medical board of the Government General Hospital in Guntur and ordered that a report be submitted by Sunday (May 16) morning.  Meanwhile, the VI Additional Junior Civil Judge in Guntur before whom the MP was produced after Justice K. Suresh Reddy of the High Court struck down his bail petition, granted his custody to the CID for 14 days. In the morning, Justice Suresh Reddy rejected the MP’s bail plea and said he was at liberty to approach the sessions court, notwithstanding Mr. Adinarayana Rao’s insistence that the bail petition should be admitted in view of the right to protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution and the urgency arising from the MP’s health condition. After his bail plea was turned down, Mr. Raju was produced before the Sixth Additional Junior Civil Judge Court in Guntur amid tight security. On being told that the MP was roughed up in custody, the court directed that a medical committee be constituted and a report submitted in right earnest. The MP’s advocates requested permission to get him treated at Ramesh Hospital. Earlier, the CID police quizzed Mr. Raju about the intentions behind his hate speeches aired in select media channels and the possible assistance provided to him to air those speeches. Additional DG (CID) P.V Sunil Kumar questioned Mr. Raju for over two hours on Friday night and tried to elicit key information about the MP’s speeches. The police are believed to have seized some key electronic evidence. On Friday, the MP was arrested from his residence in Hyderabad and was brought to the CID office in Guntur. The CID police have named Mr. Raju and TV5 and ABN Channels as the accused in the case registered under Sections.124-A, 153 (A) and 505 read with 120 (B) of the Indian Penal Code. In the FIR, the CID said an inquiry into the hate speeches of Mr. Raju in various media channels and social media channels found that Mr. Raju did not restrict himself to fair criticism of the government, but made every attempt to create hatred, contempt and disaffection towards the government, through words and also through visual gestures of face and hands to provoke his followers to take up violence. The speeches were thus seditious in nature, the CID claimed. The FIR also said Mr. Raju targeted communities and tried to stoke hatred against them by trying to portray that the government was favouring two particular communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/high-court-sets-up-division-bench-to-deal-with-mps-petition/article34569605.ece
16 May 2021||GAZA CITY,||Israel strikes media building, refugee camp in Gaza City||An Israeli air strike targeted and destroyed a high-rise building in Gaza City that housed the offices of The Associated Press , Al-Jazeera and other media outlets hours after another Israeli air raid on a densely populated refugee camp killed at least 10 Palestinians from an extended family, mostly children, on Saturday. The strike on the high-rise came nearly an hour after the military ordered people to evacuate the 12-storey building, which also housed other offices and residential apartments. The strike brought down the entire structure, which collapsed in a gigantic cloud of dust. There was no immediate explanation for why it was attacked. The air strike on the refugee camp was the deadliest single strike of the current conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Both sides are pressing for an advantage as ceasefire efforts gather strength. The spiralling violence has raised fears of a new Palestinian “intifada,” or uprising, when peace talks have not taken place in years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/israel-strikes-media-building-refugee-camp-in-gaza-city/article34569614.ece

Subramanian said on Saturday. The Minister said the State had already paid Rs. 46 crore for 15 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin, of which five lakh doses had arrived. “The drive will start in Chennai in two or three days,” he said. Meanwhile, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T.S. Selvavinayagam said, “We are expecting 13.85 lakh doses from the Centre. We have received 5.16 lakh doses.

We need to vaccinate 3.6 crore people aged 18 to 44 with two doses.” Tamil Nadu, as of May 14, achieved an overall coverage of 68,16,389 (both doses). When asked if the low vaccination rate was due to hesitancy or inadequate supply, he said, “It is multi-factorial and is improving now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jabs-for-those-below-45-soon/article34569666.ece

In the initial days, there were even bodies brought here from distant locations. “We are now prepared to handle 15 to 20 cremations or burials a day. There was a very hectic day last week when we cremated 20 bodies with the facilities available at the West Hill and Mavoor Road crematoriums,” says Mr. Sibil, who has been working as volunteer coordinator with the squad. “For us, it continues to be a dawn-to-dusk task now," he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/testing-time-for-crematoriums-as-pandemic-deaths-go-up/article34569778.ece

16 May 2021||Patna,||Kin of 119 Bihar doctors yet to get relief||Compensation has not reached the families of the doctors who have died in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Bihar. Only one of 120 dead has got it. The Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has submitted memoranda to the government several times in this regard but “the government is yet to respond”. The Central government had announced a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to the family of a doctor who dies of COVID-19. The State government too had announced Rs. 4 lakh as compensation. As many as 120 doctors have lost their lives: 42 in the first wave last year and 78 in the second one this year. Only the family of Rati Raman Jha, civil surgeon of Samastipur, has got the compensation so far. Family members of Avinash Kumar, who was the first doctor to die due to COVID-19 in June 2020, are still waiting for the compensation. “Approval [for compensation] has been given for the families of five other doctors, but the rest are still awaiting,” Dr. Sacchidanand, former IMA chief, Bihar chapter and member of the central working panel, toldThe Hindu. “Delaying compensation to the families demoralises the working doctors,” he added. On May 14, Bihar had 89,563 active cases. “Family members of some of the doctors may receive the compensation amount in a day or two,” IMA secretary Dr. Sunil Kumar said. The association also demanded that the State government should raise the compensation amount from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 20-25 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kin-of-119-bihar-doctors-yet-to-get-relief/article34570000.ece

16 May 2021||Bengaluru,||Vaccination sites to be moved in State||To reduce the risk of people contracting COVID-19 while getting vaccinated, the government plans to shift vaccination sites from primary health centres (PHCs) and hospitals to schools and colleges. This way, those who are due to get their first or second shot will not be exposed to patients visiting hospitals for treatment or to get tested. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is the chairman of the COVID-19 task force, announced this decision at a press conference on Saturday. “People infected with COVID-19 will be visiting hospitals and PHCs. We don’t want people who come to get vaccinated to get infected, so we will be stopping vaccination at health facilities,” he said. Sources in the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said vaccination sites would also be moved to spots such as community halls and large office complexes. “All that is needed is an ambulance, a staff nurse, three rooms, and emergency drugs,” a member of the committee said. It was also decided at the meeting that crematorium workers would be treated as frontline workers and provided insurance. It was decided that Rs. 10 to be provided daily for the disposal of waste generated by each COVID-19 patient. The COVID-19 task force has also decided  to stop the practice of home isolation in rural areas and urban slums to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among family members. Instead, those who test positive have to shift to a COVID Care Centre even if they don’t have symptoms. According to a committee member, this move will prevent family members of the patient from getting COVID-19. “There are certain prerequisites to be isolated in a house, which includes a separate well-ventilated room, a separate toilet, and a caregiver who can take care of the patient. As all this is not feasible in rural areas and urban slums, we have decided to stop allowing home isolation,” said a TAC member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccination-sites-to-be-moved-in-state/article34569639.ece
16 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State to float global tender for vaccines||The State will be going ahead with steps to secure more COVID-19 vaccines by floating a global tender as soon as possible, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Saturday. The State will explore the opportunity to procure more vaccines from multiple players in the market. However, the stringent quality criteria by which the State normally purchases drugs, will have to be kept flexible as the vaccines have not been in the market for long, he said. It is learnt that a final decision on floating the global tender is expected to be taken by Monday. Mr. Vijayan said that the Health Department has drawn up a list of 20 illnesses, including cardiac diseases, renal diseases, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, as well as categories of patients such as those on dialysis or who have been organ recipients, to be given priority for vaccination in the 18-45 age group. These persons should register themselves and get vaccinated as soon as possible when the government makes the shots available. Black fungus Mr. Vijayan said that a few cases of Mucormycosis, a black fungal infection being increasingly reported in Maharashtra and Gujarat, have been detected in the State as well. The Infectious Diseases Departments in medical colleges are keeping a close watch on this, though the infection is reportedly more linked to the indiscriminate use of steroids and poor glycaemic control in COVID patients. The Chief Minister said that the second dose of Covishield vaccine will be made available to people who have received the first dose only after 12 weeks of the jab, and the software on the registration portal has been programmed accordingly. However, for people who received the first dose here and who might be returning to jobs abroad, this extended interval could cause problems. The government has taken note of this and will write to the Centre, seeking exceptions for such citizens, Mr. Vijayan said. He stressed that there should be no scare-mongering that children would be hit hard in the possible third wave of COVID-10. In the Europe countries and the US, despite the second and the third waves, children were not affected badly, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-to-float-global-tender-for-vaccines/article34569779.ece

A communique from the Deputy Commissioner here said four families on the seafront were shifted to a relief centre at Uppunda in Byndoor taluk while seven families in Kundapur taluk and one family in Kapu taluk were shifted to relatives’ houses. About 60 residents of Kodi village in Brahmavara taluk were asked to shift to the relief centre, it said. The raging Arabian Sea has caused extensive damage to the beachfront along the coast from Hejmady in the south till Shiroor in the north in Udupi district. Hundreds of coconut trees fell down due to the erosion. Padubidri, Kapu, Kodi-Bengre, Kundapur-Kodi, Gangolli, Maravanthe, Uppunda, Byndoor, and Shiroor witnessed massive erosion. At Maravanthe village, about 600m of fisheries road was almost washed away by the swelling waters of the Arabian Sea. The area, located to the north of the outer fishing harbour, saw constant erosion since a week and the cyclone only added to the miseries. Authorities concerned dumped boulders on the affected stretch as an emergency measure even as houses of fishermen were in the danger of getting washed away. Kundapur Assistant Commissioner K. Raju and other officials visited the spot. At Malpe Padukare, the sea reached very close to the fisheries road threatening over 300 houses in the region. K. Raghupathi Bhat, Udupi MLA, tahsildar Pradeep Kurdekar, and other officials visited the area and were coaxing residents to shift to relief centres at Mogaveera Sabha Bhavana and Narayana Guru Sabha Bhavana at Malpe by deploying KSRTC buses. Salt water entered agriculture fields and damaged standing crops of vegetables at many places.

Paul, Chairman, National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19, on Saturday. It was taken by consensus by a group of experts, he said. Dr. Paul said it was “sad” that there were “narratives” that the decision was taken adhoc and due to shortages. “The standard protocol of vaccine administration is 4-6 weeks. When the U.K. decided to delay their second dose, there was little scientific evidence to justify it at that time. That’s why our own recommendation was first 4-6 weeks and based on newer evidence, it was increased to 6-8 weeks. However, evidence from there has shown that their decision to delay the second dose upto three months has seen 65%-85% protection against severe disease. Also, there was a definite break in transmission of the disease. So that’s the evidence considered by the committee to expand dosage interval,” he said during a press briefing. Dr. NK Arora, who heads the expert group tasked with recommending the appropriate interval between doses, seconded Dr. Paul.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/extending-gap-between-doses-scientific-paul/article34569637.ece

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Islamists, militants and nationalists — all in one||When Israeli troops stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque on May 10, the day Israel observed as Jerusalem Day this year, commemorating the capture of the eastern part of the city in 1967, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that runs Gaza Strip, immediately issued an ultimatum. Hamas asked Israel to pull back all troops from the Al-Aqsa compound, and stop all actions to evict Palestinian families from East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah by the evening. Israel ignored it. In the evening, Hamas launched dozens of rockets from Gaza. Israel responded with hellfire on Gaza, launching its biggest operation against Hamas since the 2014 attack on the strip. This is an ongoing story. Ever since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, there were at least three major conflicts between Israel and Hamas. It’s an irony that Hamas, whose founding members were encouraged by Israel in the 1970s and 80s against Yasser Arafat’s secular national movement, has turned out to be Israel’s biggest rival in the Palestinian territories. The roots The roots of Hamas go back to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood, established by Egyptian Islamist Hasan al-Banna in 1928, made a presence in the British-ruled Palestine in the 1930s. Its focus had been on reorienting Muslim society, while the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), founded in 1964, championed the Palestinian nationalist sentiments . After Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and Gaza Strip from Egypt in 1967, the PLO, vowing to liberate the whole of Palestine, would start a guerilla war against Israel. The Muslim Brotherhood would still stay away from politics, but their leadership was increasingly critical of the PLO’s secular nationalism. The Brotherhood’s approach was that time for “jihad” had not come yet and they should first rebuild a stronger, pious Islamic society — they called it “the upbringing of an Islamic generation”. During this time, Israel established contacts with the Brotherhood leadership in the occupied territories. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the physically challenged, half-blind cleric of the Brotherhood, established al-Mujamma’ al-Islam (The Islamic Centre) in 1973. Israel recognised the Centre first as a charity and then as an association. This allowed Yassin to raise funds, build mosques and set up educational institutions, including the Islamic University of Gaza. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran would change the landscape of Islamist politics across West Asia. Islamist organisations, having witnessed the political success of the Mullahs in Iran, started becoming politically more ambitious and active. The rise Hamas was established after the first intifada broke out in 1987. The occupied territories were swept by a mass uprising. The PLO called on its supporters to join the intifada. The Brotherhood also found it an opportunity to enter the struggle against the occupation. On December 14, the Brotherhood, under the leadership of Yassin, issued a leaflet, asking Palestinians to stand up to the Israeli occupation. In January, they issued another leaflet under the name Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah (the Islamic Resistance Movement) — in short, Hamas, which means “zeal” in Arabic. In 1989, Hamas launched its first attack, abducting and killing two Israeli soldiers. Israel cracked down on the group, arresting Yassin and jailing him for life. Unlike the PLO, which was modelled around the leftist guerilla national movements in the third world, Hamas had a completely different vision. The charter it issued on August 19, 1988 was studded with anti-Semitic remarks. According to the charter, Palestine is “an Islamic Waqf land consecrated for Moslem generations until Judgement Day”; “there is no solution to the Palestine problem except jihad” and all peace initiatives are a “waste of time and acts of absurdity”. When the PLO moved to join peace efforts seeking a solution to the Palestinian issue, Hamas hardened its position. It opposed the Oslo agreement, which allowed the formation of the Palestinian Authority with limited powers within the occupied territories. When the PLO recognised Israel, Hamas rejected the two-state solution and vowed to liberate the whole of Palestine “from the (Jordan) River to the (Mediterranean) Sea”. It has built a organisation with several branches — the social wing is involved in Islamic education and charity works, while Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing, is in charge of military planning and weapons acquisitions. It also has a political bureau. In October 1994, a year after the Oslo Accord was signed, Hamas carried out its first suicide attack, killing 22 in Tel Aviv. The evolution In the 1990s and early 2000s, Hamas conducted several suicide attacks, targeting Israelis. In 2000, when the second intifada broke out, Hamas was in the driving seat. Hamas supporters fought pitched street battles with Israeli troops, who used brute force to crush the protests. Israel had also taken a policy of targeted assassinations. Hamas continued to remain defiant, targeting Israeli troops and settlers. In 2005, faced with Hamas’s violent resistance, Israel unilaterally decided to pull out of Gaza. Hamas’s violent tactics and Israel’s collective punishment of Palestinians in return seemed to have helped the Islamists gain popularity. In the 2006 legislative elections in the Palestinian territory, Hamas won 74 out of the 132 seats, while the Fatah party, the PLO’s backbone, got only 45 seats. Hamas formed the government, but faced opposition from Israel and most international powers. Like Israel, the U.S. and several European countries have designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation. As tensions rose between Fatah and Hamas in the West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the Hamas government and declared a state of emergency. This led to violent clashes between Fatah and Hamas. Fatah ousted Hamas from the West Bank and Hamas ousted the former from Gaza in 2007. Since then, Hamas is the government in Gaza. Following Hamas’s capture of Gaza, Israel has imposed a blockade on the strip, which practically turned the territory of 2 million people into an open prison. While Hamas never gave up its right to armed resistance, the organisation’s outlook has evolved over the years, like the PLO’s did in the pre-Oslo years. It still refuses to recognise Israel but has offered hudna (a lasting ceasefire) if Israel returned to the 1967 border. In 2017, it adopted a new charter from which the anti-Semitic remarks of the original charter were expunged. The new document stated Hamas is not seeking war with the Jewish people — only with Zionism that drives the occupation of Palestine. “Hamas advocates the liberation of all of Palestine but is ready to support the state on 1967 borders without recognising Israel or ceding any rights,” it said back then. Ideally, this should have opened a new beginning. But Israel continues to maintain the position that it won’t hold talks with a “terrorist entity” that doesn’t recognise it, while at the same time deepening the occupation. Hamas’s view is that unless Israel withdraws to the 1967 border, there won’t be peace. It’s a stalemate. Hamas may not have the capability to push Israel back to the 1967 border or the deterrence to stop Israel from pounding Gaza. But it does two things with its resistance to the superior Israeli Army — one, it has emerged as a key force in Palestine’s political landscape, which in the past had largely been driven by secular nationalism. A solution to the Israel-Palestine problem cannot be reached without taking Hamas into consideration. Two, its survives. Over the years, Hamas has lost most of its founding leaders, it is categorised as a terrorist outfit by the U.S. and others and it faces disproportionate Israeli attacks frequently. Every time it bombs Gaza, Israel vows to destroy Hamas's militant infrastructure. But Hamas survives, to fight another day.  In Focus  Hamas was established after the first intifada broke out in 1987. Muslim Brotherhood leaders in the occupied Palestine formed Hamas as an Islamist alternative to the secular PLO in the fight against occupation  In its original 1988 charter, Hamas rejected recognising Israel and called peace efforts a "waste of time and acts of absurdity"  But in the renewed 2017 charter, Hamas says it is not fighting Jews but the occupation of Palestine by Zionists, and has offered a lasting truce with Israel if it withdraws to the 1967 border   While Hamas never gave up its right to armed resistance or recognised Israel, the organisation’s outlook has evolved over the years, like the PLO’s did in the pre-Oslo period||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/islamists-militants-and-nationalists-all-in-one/article34569557.ece
16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Navy teams deployed in Kerala amid rain||The Indian Navy on Saturday deployed relief teams from the Southern Naval Command which undertook rescue operations in areas affected by Cyclone Tauktae on the Chellanam coast in Kerala. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has kept 16 transport aircraft and 18 helicopters on operational readiness in peninsular India in preparation for the cyclone which is expected to cause very heavy to extremely heavy rain along the western coast in the next few days. “Towards providing assistance to flood-hit villages of Malaghapadi, Kampanipadi and Maruvakad in Chellanam, three Naval diving teams and one Quick Reaction Team from Southern Naval Command swung into action,” the Navy said in a statement. The teams undertook rescue of personnel, provisioning of food and water and shifting of people trapped in houses to relief camp at St. Mary’s High School Chellanam in the harsh weather conditions, it added. The Navy has also put ships, aircraft and helicopters on standby in coordination with district administration. “One IL-76 aircraft has airlifted 127 personnel and 11 tonnes of cargo from Bhatinda to Jamnagar. A C-130 aircraft has airlifted 25 personnel and 12.3 tonnes of cargo from Bhatinda to Rajkot. Two C-130 aircraft have airlifted 126 personnel and 14 tonnes cargo from Bhubaneswar to Jamnagar,” an IAF statement said on Saturday. In addition, the IAF said COVID-19 relief operations have been focused in these coastal areas for the coming few days, as bad weather is likely to affect air operations later. The cyclone relief operations are in addition to those under way for COVID relief, it added. According to the Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), the cyclone in the Arabian Sea is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and further intensify into very severe cyclone storm late hours of May 15 or early hours of May 16. Oxygen transport On the ongoing transportation of emergency oxygen and other medical supplies, both within the country and from abroad, the IAF said that as on Saturday morning domestically it had carried out 778 sorties accumulating 1,147 hours and airlifted 490 tankers with 8,343 MT capacity and 209 MT of other equipment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-teams-deployed-in-kerala-amid-rain/article34569515.ece

Earlier this week, posters were found pasted on walls and boards with the message: “Modi ji humare bachon ka vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya ?” (Why did you send our children’s vaccines abroad?), after which all the districts where the posters were found registered FIRs under relevant Sections of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, the Delhi Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code. Some of the FIRs had Sections under the Press and Registration of Books Act, and Sections 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Information sought from each district stated that four FIRs had been registered in North West district; three each in North East, East, West and Outer districts; two each in South, Rohini and Central districts; and one each in North, South West, Dwarka, Shahdara, East and South East districts, respectively. Senior officers said four persons each had been arrested from Central and East districts; two persons each were arrested from North East, West, North West and South West districts; and one person each was arrested from the North and Dwarka districts, respectively. No arrests were made from South, Rohini, Outer, Shahdara and South East districts. In two districts No posters apparently surfaced in two districts — New Delhi and Outer North — and no FIRs were registered here. Sources said most of those held were released on bail. They were interrogated on whether they were hired to paste the posters or if it was a voluntary decision. Technical investigation was also under way, they said, adding that posters and banners had been recovered from the possession of some of the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/24-arrests-in-delhi-over-posters/article34569533.ece
16 May 2021||Ahmedabad,||Gujarat fatality figures reveal discrepancies||Though the pace of increase in coronavirus infections has slowed down as have the number of COVID-19 deaths in Gujarat, the State continues to see a sharp mismatch in the number of COVID-19 deaths reported by the health authorities. Now, with the number of deaths emerging from rural and remote districts, official figures appear lower by as much as 20 times in some districts.  The Hindu had earlier reported on the large-scale under-reporting of deaths in major cities such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar and Gandhinagar. However, the figures from rural districts reported in local media based on information from cremation grounds and local government offices from the State’s north, south and central regions, and Saurashtra and Kutch, bring out the horror of the pandemic’s devastating second wave. For example, in Surendranagar district, there were 814 deaths in March 2020 and 957 deaths in March 2021. In April 2020, there were 784 deaths while in the month this year (2021), the total deaths in the district stood at a high 3,140. In May 2020, 756 deaths were reported from the district whereas only till May 8, 2021, that figure stood at 1,739. “I have obtained the month-wise figures from the district panchayat and other agencies and compiled them to show how much under-counting of deaths is being resorted to by the Gujarat government,” said Congress legislator Naushad Solanki from Surendranagar district. He added that there was a difference of more than 3,000 deaths in a less than 70-day period in the years 2020 and 2021. But as on May 15, the official death toll in Surendranagar district has been around 130 since the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020.  “There is a massive under-counting of deaths in our villages. In Tapi district alone, more than 1,500 people have already died of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the Gujarat government is not recognising it,” said former Union minister and Congress leader Dr. Tushar Chaudhary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gujarat-fatality-figures-reveal-discrepancies/article34569547.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||From student leader to CM||A student leader, Congress Minister-turned-rebel and now the much-feted Chief Minister of BJP-ruled Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, 52, has covered almost the entire spectrum of politics in Assam with reassuring ease. The position of Chief Minister was the culmination of a political journey that started as a teenager; one in which he successfully moved from the politics of cultural and regional identity to the BJP’s overarching idea of “one nation, one culture”. Known for his oratory from his early days, Mr. Sarma, like many from that generation, plunged into student politics by becoming a member of the powerful All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), the student body that had catapulted student leaders like Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and the late Bhrigu Kumar Phukan as the State’s Chief Minister and Home Minister. The Assam Agitation from 1979 to 1985, also known as the anti-foreigners’ movement, to detect and deport undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh not only saw the emergence of Assamese sub-nationalism but also a breed of student leaders whose politics was tied to the question of cultural identity and regional aspirations. Post the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985, the AASU became the training ground of many a regional leader, including Mr. Sarma and his predecessor as Chief Minister, Sarbananda Sonowal. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when student leaders dominated Assam’s political landscape — under the shadows of Mr. Mahanta and Mr. Phukan, who had founded the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — Mr. Sarma, or HBS as he is known in political circles, went on to head the students’ union of the prestigious Cotton College (now upgraded as a university). Quick rise His quick rise as the general secretary of the All Guwahati Students’ Union, his organisational skills and the ability to mobilise youth attracted the attention of then Congress leader Hiteshwar Saikia. Mr. Saikia, who had become the Chief Minister in the middle of 1991, was looking for a young leader who could bring the youth — an influential voting segment that had been driven away by the anti-Congressism of the Assam Agitation — back into the Congress fold. While the Congress found a promising youth leader in HBS, his former mentors at the AASU were forced to sever ties with him. The bitter parting prompted the Congress to field him against Mr. Phukan from the Jalukbari constituency in the 1996 Assembly elections, a contest that he lost but it set the stage for his future politics. In 2001, as the Congress regained the State from the AGP, Mr. Sarma scored his first electoral victory from the Jalukbari constituency, a seat that has now given him five terms including his latest win. He not only endeared himself to Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi but soon became the main troubleshooter and a crisis manager for the Gogoi government. Their relationship soured with the entry of Mr. Gogoi’s son, Gaurav, into the political arena. As Gogoi senior made it clear that his son would be his political heir, an ambitious HBS got impatient. His claim to the Chief Minister’s post met with resistance from former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. After unsuccessfully leading a rebellion to dislodge Mr. Gogoi, Mr. Sarma, along with supporters, joined the BJP in August 2015. Mr. Sarma not only successfully weathered the storm but soon became the BJP’s chief crisis manager, the force behind the Sonowal government and the master strategist who ensured that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was in power in all the north-eastern States. If his work as the State’s Health Minister in the previous government to contain the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic got noticed, his strident Hindutva position with regard to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and strong support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that went against the Assam Accord endeared him to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Much like the theories of disruptive innovation taught in business schools, Mr. Sarma’s rise in politics too has been through disruptions in his political career of more than three decades. But his skills will be tested now as his government negotiates controversial laws such as the CAA that had met with massive protests on the ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/from-student-leader-to-cm/article34569559.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||A man of many comebacks||It was past 11 p.m., on September 23, 2018. The banquet hall of the three-star hotel in central Colombo was buzzing with young men and women. They were restlessly following updates on a big screen showing live news from another island, not far away. The chatter in Dhivehi was hard to follow, but the outcome they desired was clear. They wanted to see the common oppositional candidate from the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) win the crucial presidential election. Watching the developments intently, but calmly, was former President and exiled leader Mohamed Nasheed. He had played a critical role in that poll. His party colleague Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s decisive victory against incumbent Abdulla Yameen, widely regarded an authoritarian leader, gave the Maldives another chance with democratising the Sunni Muslim nation that is home to over 500,000 people. “Destiny has a habit of always choosing the right and the good. When history is on the march, you can’t stop it. President Yameen has to go,” he told The Hindu that night. In the international arena, Mr. Nasheed is best known as the Indian Ocean archipelago’s first democratically elected (2008-2012) President, who was controversially ousted and convicted on terrorism charges that the Maldivian Supreme Court later deemed wrongful and quashed. He shot to global fame as a climate hero in 2009, when his government held the world’s first underwater Cabinet meeting. In the realm of domestic politics, Mr. Nasheed, 53, is arguably the country’s most charismatic politician, consistently speaking out against religious extremism and corruption. A week after the MDP alliance’s big election win in 2018, Mr. Nasheed landed in Male, ending three years of exile, as huge crowds thronged the streets to welcome him back. Barely three years since — during which time the ruling alliance won the parliamentary elections, and Mr. Nasheed was appointed Speaker — he was targeted in a deadly explosion in the capital 10 days ago. Mr. Nasheed survived, although with serious injuries, and is currently receiving treatment in Germany. The police arrested three suspects allegedly involved in the “terror attack” that they have linked to religious extremists. While observers have flagged religious extremists, corrupt individuals, and political rivals as forces hostile to the ex-President, the motivations or actors behind the May 6 attack remain unknown, with no one claiming it as yet. Challenging time The assassination bid targeting Mr. Nasheed not only exposed security threats within the country, but also came at a politically challenging time for Mr. Solih who is confronted with mounting criticism and a relentless pandemic imperilling its economy. The local council election in April was a reality check — despite beating the opposition in total, the party lost its traditionally held mayoral seat in the capital. However, the party’s problems did not stop Mr. Nasheed from constantly pressuring the government to act on corruption allegations. The Speaker openly accused senior Cabinet Ministers of corruption, in an act that his critics saw as a deliberate effort to embarrass and discredit President Solih. Some party insiders sensed a deepening rift within the MDP. The ex-President’s political ambitions are no secret, as his pet demand for the Maldives to transition to a parliamentary system of governance shows. Soon after the local council election last month, Mr. Nasheed confronted President Solih on the subject, reportedly conveying his desire to lead the country as Prime Minister. President Solih, seen as a leader more amenable to the MDP’s diverse alliance partners, maintains that the system of governance could be changed only by the citizens’ will. Meanwhile, the recent attack has put political debates on hold, and national security under the spotlight. Mr. Nasheed himself was shocked, according to his family. “We don’t know who did this, but what we know is Nasheed is not safe here. Those who wanted to eliminate him will see this as a job unfinished,” Ibrahim Nashid, brother of the former President, told The Hindu from Male. But that is unlikely to deter Mr. Nasheed, who has vowed to return stronger. Ahead of his departure to Berlin, he told nurses treating him: “I have already planned my comeback speech”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-man-of-many-comebacks/article34569561.ece
16 May 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra BJP claims MVA is fudging data||While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government’s agencies praise the ‘Mumbai model’ of fighting the coronavirus, BJP’s Maharashtra leaders seem to think otherwise. The party, which is in the Opposition in the State has once again alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is fudging data. Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, claiming the State hid 9,603 deaths in 2020 and the practice is still prevalent. “Mumbai has not only reduced the number of COVID tests, but increased the rapid antigen test in a bid to develop new model. Mumbai has registered 40% deaths in the category of ‘deaths due to other reason’ when other districts stand at 0.8% only. Every method is being used to hide the number of deaths,” said Mr. Fadnavis in his letter, which came in response to Ms. Gandhi’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress said that since Mr. Fadnavis cannot dare to question Mr. Modi over the misgovernance of BJP-ruled States, he has chosen to target Opposition leaders like Ms. Gandhi. Mr. Fadnavis claimed that out of 4,000 deaths in the country, 850 are in Maharashtra alone. Complaining that MVA government, of which Congress is a part, has left regions like Marathwada, Vidarbha and north Maharashtra to fend for themselves, he claimed that people were struggling for Remdesivir, oxygen and medical treatment. Mr. Fadnavis said that the Centre has provided maximum help to the State. “While criticising the Central government, it is your duty to check on the performance of the State governments where your party is in power or in the ruling alliance,” he said. The Congress shot back at Mr. Fadnavis, calling his letter an attempt to hide Mr. Modi’s failure. “Mr. Fadnavis has lied on every possible count in his letter. Be it about the aid from the Centre or number of deaths. While pointing fingers at number of tests in Maharashtra, he is conveniently ignoring BJP-ruled States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar where no tests at all are being conducted,” said Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole. Mr. Patole said Gujarat has recorded over one lakh deaths in 71 days but government is recording only 4,218 deaths. “BJP-ruled States are burying dead bodies to hide deaths while people are dying due to lack of oxygen in Goa. This is the BJP’s model of governance. Mr. Fadnavis should have written to Narendra Modi, but since he has no guts to ask questions, he chose to write to an Opposition leader,” Mr. Patole added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-bjp-claims-mva-is-fudging-data/article34569757.ece
16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Virus takes a big toll on Central staff||Nearly 50 government officials across Ministries and departments in the national capital have died of COVID-19 in just the past one month, according to a representation sent by the employees to the Centre. The forum representing the officials of the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) has said at least 30 who died were under 40 years of age. Vaccination camps It demanded that the government organise vaccination camps for all the CSS employees similar to those run for frontline workers on priority. On May 4, Minister for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh tweeted that the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) was organising a vaccine camp at North Block. A CSS official, however, said such camps were not enough. “North Block comprises the offices of the Ministries of Finance, Home and Personnel. It [the camp] is barely enough for them. Many fear going to other government buildings to get the shots; this should be held at every government building,” said the official on condition of anonymity. The Cabinet Secretariat will be organising a vaccination camp at the President’s House on May 17 for those above 45 years and on May 18 for employees in the 18-45 age group. On April 19, the DoPT had asked all Central government offices to reduce the strength of under-secretary and equivalent ranks to 50% in office. The deputy secretaries have, however, been asked to report daily. The order has been extended till May 31. Pregnant women, persons with disability and those who live in containment zones have been exempted. “In the age of digital India, why cannot government employees work from home? Hundreds of those who were infected were going to the office daily, many have died, leaving behind young children. We are demanding work from home as it will not impact productivity,” another CSS official said. On May 6, the CSS forum tweeted: “It is disheartening that GoI [Government of India] has lost 50+ hard working CSS Officers in the span of just one month… We have requested @DoPTGoI on several occasions vide letters dated 27 & 29 April to implement Work From Home (WFH). In view of the dreadful situations in India and it being the World’s worst hit nation, but due to insensitive behaviour, we are losing the precious jewels of our bureaucracy and hard working officers every day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/virus-takes-a-big-toll-on-central-staff/article34569540.ece
16 May 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Odisha expanding cremation capacity||Odisha, which has been reporting an average of 20 COVID-19 deaths every day, has nevertheless started expanding cremation capacity across the State, which indicates an under-reporting of fatalities. Though the State has been adding on an average over 10,000 cases to its daily COVID-19 tally, the daily death toll has remained around 20. According to government data, Khordha district, of which State capital Bhubaneswar is a part, is losing four COVID-19 patients daily. Most of the bodies are cremated at the Satya Nagar crematorium. The government, which has remained tight-lipped about revealing the number of persons who died while undergoing treatment for COVID-19, admitted that the Satya Nagar crematorium is unable to handle the increased pressure on the facility. There have been long queues of bodies waiting to be cremated late in the evening at the crematorium. The newly appointed Bhubaneswar Municipal Commissioner has instructed officials to get ready another crematorium near Patia by May 25. This facility will be operated with LPG, speeding up the process of incineration. The Commissioner said the Patia crematorium has been designated for the cremation of COVID-19 victims. He, however, attributed the rush at the Satya Nagar crematorium to restrictions on performing funerals at Swargadwar, a crematorium at Puri. The corporation also intends to make another crematorium operational at Bharatpur in the city. Cremation of COVID-19 patients, which was hitherto performed at one place in Sambalpur, is now conducted at four new places (one at Sambalpur and three at Burla). The Rajghat crematorium in Sambalpur has, however, been shut down. Siddheswar Naik, who helps at the crematorium at Keonjhar district, said, “I have been instructed to keep mum over the number of bodies being disposed. In the last one month, on an average, 12 or 13 bodies are being brought for cremation every day. All bodies are brought by people draped in PPE (personal protection equipment) kits.” Contradictory figures have been reported from Nuapada district. While the government’s bulletin says 38 persons have succumbed to COVID-19 since last year, there were reports of over 70 deaths at the COVID-19 hospital at Nuapada alone in the second wave of COVID-19. In Sundargarh, another district devastated by the second wave of the pandemic, bodies are sent to the respective panchayats for burial, as a sizeable population belongs to the Christian community. However, facilities designated for COVID-19 victims at Sundargarh and Rourkela have recorded increased cremations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odisha-expanding-cremation-capacity/article34569544.ece
16 May 2021||UNNAO,||Unnao’s poor struggle to conduct funerals||Having travelled 30 km from his village Parsanda with the body of his teenage niece in an open mini-truck without any fuel or wood for cremation, Bachu Lal was caught in a fix when the cleaners at the Baksar ghat informed him he would not be allowed to bury the body due to new directions from the administration. The ghat came under official spotlight earlier this week after visuals showed a large number of bodies of suspected COVID-19 victims buried there, allegedly due to scarcity of cremation resources and rise in fatalities due to the infection — a claim yet to be officially acknowledged. Since the girl was unmarried, Bachu Lal’s family, as per customs, had planned to bury the body instead of cremating it. Cremation with the proper rituals would cost the family around Rs. 6,000-8000, a sum they could ill afford amid the ongoing lockdown. A distraught Mr. Lal said just a month ago, the family had buried the body of a relative at the same site without any hindrances. Baksar Ghat is located in Unnao along the Ganga but is very close to the borders with Rae Bareli, Kanpur and Fatehpur districts. The administration recently launched a probe after an unknown number of bodies were allegedly found buried in the sand at two locations by the Ganga — one of them Baksar. At the ghat on Saturday, half-a-dozen bodies have already arrived for cremation though it is not even 10 in the morning. Three pyres have been lit. There is hardly any physical distancing as kin and friends of the dead prepare for their turn. Beyond the cremation sheds, mounds in the sand are marked with saffron or white cloth. Clothes, broken objects and dirt are strewn on the uneven ground as dogs and crows scan the landscape for possible remains. Some dogs can be seen digging aggressively in sand bars in the river where a few bodies were recently buried after the main ghat ran out of space. It is difficult to estimate how many bodies may have been buried at the site but locals say the figure is above 200. Rakesh, one of the many cleaners on the ghat, has spent two decades of his life digging the pits and clearing the surface of the cremation ghat. He says that while the ghat usually received 15-20 bodies or less daily, during the peak of the COVID-19 in April, as many as 70-80 bodies arrived for final rites on a single day. Of these, children and those from poor families were buried as many could not afford the cost of firewood, he said. “Nobody cremates their little children,” he explained. Prakash, another cleaner, says there had been a long queue at the cremation site last month. “We tell the people to not throw the body into the river but bury them instead,” he said. The number of bodies coming to the ghat has dropped over the past week and none of them were buried since the controversy broke out, said Rakesh. Asked if those buried had died of COVID, both Rakesh and Prakash said they did not know. “The relatives don’t even take the name of corona. Some say death happened due to fever, others say it was a ‘sudden death; breathing, TB, heart attack...,” said Prakash. At another end of the ghat, Guddu, a priest, is guiding the family of a deceased elderly woman through the cremation. “Unlock the braids. Remove the necklace. Let the rest of the adornments be,” screams Guddu.  ‘No abandoned bodies’ Sub-divisional magistrate Bighapur Daya Shankar Pathak said not a single body was found in the open on the ghat. “All were found buried,” he said, when asked what the probe had found so far.  District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said not a single body was found floating in the Ganga. There are several sites in Unnao where, as per customs, bodies are either cremated or buried, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unnaos-poor-struggle-to-conduct-funerals/article34569555.ece
16 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||Elephant carcasses found in 2 groups||The carcasses of the 18 elephants reportedly killed in lightning strikes in Nagaon district of central Assam on May 13 were found in two groups 1 km apart, an official statement said Saturday. The State government also said the “freak natural incident” was being corroborated based on meteorological reports while the samples collected by a team of experts after a post-mortem were being “further examined for microbiological and toxicological aspects” in the laboratory. According to the statement, the assistant manager of Topajuri Tea Estate had at 1.45 p.m. on May 13 informed the officials at the Kathiatoli Range of Nagaon Forest Division about four carcasses. The local forest officials later found 14 more strewn in the foothills of the Bamuni Hill within the Konduli Proposed Reserve Forest about 1 km away. “After thorough investigation of the carcasses and based on circumstantial evidence, the team of experts and officials suggested that the cause of death of these elephants, which appeared to be part of a herd, could be due to the strike of lightning,” the statement said. The statement added the microbiological and toxicological report received from the forensic laboratory would be made public at an appropriate time. Experts from the College of Veterinary Science in Guwahati, veterinarians from the Assam State Zoo and the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation in Kaziranga were among the team that collected samples and conducted the autopsy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elephant-carcasses-found-in-2-groups/article34569522.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,||2.92 lakh fresh infections, 3,807 deaths reported||India recorded 2,92,092 new COVID-19 cases until 9.50 p.m. on Saturday. As many as 3,807 more deaths were also registered. The country has so far reported a total of 2,46,43,693 cases and 2,69,598 deaths. Karnataka has moved ahead of Maharashtra with 41,664 infections. Maharashtra reported 34,848 cases, followed by Tamil Nadu (33,658). However, Maharashtra recorded the most casualties (960), followed by Karnataka (349) and Delhi (337). The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. Over 9 lakh doses less Only around 11.6 lakh daily vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Saturday, over 9.25 lakh doses lower than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. It was also over 9.35 lakh doses lower than that recorded one week ago. The number of daily doses has been declining since mid-April. The seven-day average of daily doses administered by May 14 stood at 18.7 lakh, significantly lower than the 34.7 lakh recorded a month ago. As of May 14, only 13 vaccine doses have been administered per 100 persons in India. Around 16.93 lakh tests were conducted on Friday (the results for which were made available on Saturday), which was 1.82 lakh tests fewer than the previous day. India’s test positivity rate (number of positive cases upon tests) has been declining this week. From 22.6% last Saturday, it has dropped to 19.7% a week later. India continued to lead the world in the number of daily average recorded deaths. It now accounted for one in every three daily deaths reported globally. The country also leads in the number of daily average reported cases. It now accounted for one in every two daily cases reported worldwide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/292-lakh-fresh-infections-3807-deaths-reported/article34569538.ece
16 May 2021||Melbourne,||Stranded Australians finally fly home||The first repatriation flight carrying Australians stranded in India landed in Darwin on Saturday following the end of the federal government’s controversial ban on their return home. The repatriation flights facilitated by the Australian government for its stranded citizens in India resumed from Friday, following a two-week ban due to the COVID-19 health crisis in India. The Qantas jet touched down at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base shortly before 9 a.m. local time. It was scheduled to carry up to 150 passengers but, in the end, only carried 80 people back to Australia. “Many passengers on the first flight on Friday were grounded due to COVID-19 positive test results,” Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell was quoted as saying by ABC News. A total of 70 people were barred from boarding. Of them, 46 tested positive for the coronavirus, while 24 others were identified as close contacts. The arrivals will be taken to the Howard Springs Centre. Passengers on this flight had to undergo and return a negative result on two tests before they could get on the plane — an RT-PCR test in the two days beforehand and then a rapid antigen test. The Australian government had introduced the travel ban for its residents and citizens a fortnight ago to mitigate the risk of a high infection rate at its quarantine facilities, including the Howard Springs Centre in Darwin. The repatriation flight was the first flight after the Australian government imposed a temporary ban with the threat of criminal sanctions, including five years in jail and fines of up to 66,000 Australian dollars for people who tried to return from India. The next flight from India is scheduled in just over a week. Almost 10,000 Australians, permanent residents and their immediate family members, are seeking to return to Australia, with around 1,000 who have been prioritised as “vulnerable” for health or financial reasons. The flight from Australia to India on Friday (to bring back Australians) carried 1,056 ventilators, 60 oxygen concentrators and other essential supplies, adding to medical equipment sent last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stranded-australians-finally-fly-home/article34569549.ece
16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 deaths are being under-reported, says Cong.||The Congress has alleged under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths in some States, especially Gujarat, and demanded an explanation from both the Centre and the State governments. Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, addressing a virtual press conference along with Rajya Sabha member Shaktisinh Gohil, questioned the alleged huge discrepancy between the number of death certificates issued by authorities and the official data on COVID-19 deaths. He argued that the increase in death certificates between last year and this year could not be explained as a natural increase. He asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to call for the data on deaths from every State. Talking about the data on the deaths in Gujarat, Congress leaders claimed that the deaths in the State this year had doubled compared with 2020 and the substantial increase could only be attributed to the pandemic. “We have a strong suspicion that the Government of India, in conjunction with some State governments, is suppressing the true numbers of new infections and COVID-related deaths. If our suspicions are true, this is a grave misdeed apart from being a national shame and a national tragedy,” Mr. Chidambaram said. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi questioned the government’s vaccine strategy and said a “flawed policy” would now ensure a third wave in the country. “It can’t be repeated enough — India needs a proper vaccine strategy,” he said on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-deaths-are-being-under-reported-says-cong/article34569553.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,||SRMIST- The Hindu webinars delve into AI, cybersecurity||As part of its career guidance series in association with The Hindu , the SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Chennai, hosted two webinars on Friday. The first was on ‘How AI is changing the technology perspective from learning to jobs under COVID-19’. Dr. R. Annie Uthra, associate professor, School of Computing, SRMIST, began by discussing the prospects of AI in automation, learning and business, and how it has been used during the pandemic. She also highlighted the increasing job opportunities for AI and ML (Machine Learning) engineers. Shweta Khurana, director, APJ Global Partnerships and Initiatives, Intel, spoke about the future of work. “Data is the new oil,” she said, and emphasised the growing AI skills crisis. She spoke of digital readiness and the need to empower youth with AI technology and social skills in an inclusive way for current and future jobs. Dr. Pratyush Kumar, assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Madras, and co-founder, One Fourth Labs and AI4Bharat, highlighted three crucial points: learning the basics (understanding the foundational topics learnt at school), learning to learn (the ability to learn, relearn and upgrade skills as technology progresses) and learning to ask (asking questions such as ‘what can I do with this?’, finding problems that haven’t been solved and finding solutions with technologies that already exist). The second session focused on ‘How cybersecurity concerns are topping the headlines today due to the pandemic and what this means for the students in the field’. Dr. Revathi Venkataraman, chairperson, School of Computing, SRMIST, opened the session by talking about cybersecurity threats before and during the pandemic. Pankit Desai, co-founder and CEO of Sequretek, a cybersecurity firm, pointed out that the higher use of digital mediums in the past year had both empowered the users and also made them more vulnerable. He shared examples to show the mistakes people made online and the methods used by attackers. He reiterated that the best way was to follow the A.B.I.D.E principle: Anti-malware, Backup your data, Identity security, Data privacy, and Enhance and update. The session ended with advocate and cyberlaw expert N.S. Nappinai sharing some ethical and legal aspects of cybersecurity. She spoke of the threats that young adults face and their lack of awareness about cyber laws to protect themselves. She emphasised the need to act fast in case of a cyber attack and reminded the audience to be responsible citizens and students of cybersecurity. All three panellists pointed out that cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary subject and affects everyone, regardless of their field of interest.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||ULFA-I declares three-month ceasefire citing pandemic||The outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) has declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire with immediate effect. The announcement on Saturday came less than a week after Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed to extremist groups in Assam to shun violence and pursue talks. Paresh Baruah, the outfit’s self-styled commander-in-chief said in an Assamese statement that the COVID-19 situation prompted the ULFA-I to “unilaterally suspend all military operations in Assam for three months from May 15”. He accused the Indian security forces as well as the Assam police of hatching “some clandestine plan to malign” his outfit. This was in reference to two grenade blasts that killed three people, including a 12-year-old boy in eastern Assam’s Tinsukia within four days. This is the second instance of the anti-talks faction of the ULFA declaring a unilateral ceasefire. The outfit had in 2005 suspended operations to facilitate a team of mediators headed by the late author Mamoni Raisom Goswami to broker a peace deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ulfa-i-declares-three-month-ceasefire-citing-pandemic/article34569520.ece
16 May 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Adityanath, Amarinder in spat over new Punjab district||A day after Punjab declared Malerkotla a new district, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday were embroiled in a verbal spat on the announcement. Mr. Adityanath termed the Punjab government’s decision of declaring its only Muslim-majority town a district “a reflection of the divisive policy of the Congress”. Capt. Singh hit back saying Mr. Adityanath‘s remark was an attempt to incite communal hatred in the peaceful State as part of the BJP’s divisive policies. Captain Singh asked the U.P. Chief Minister to stay out of his State’s affairs, which he said are in much better shape than those in U.P. under the divisive and destructive BJP government that has been actively promoting communal discord for the past over four years. “What does he [Mr. Adityanath] know of Punjab’s ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus was known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled upon every day by his own government,” Capt. Singh asked. Mr. Adityanath, in his tweet, said: “Any distinction on the basis of faith and religion is contrary to the basic spirit of the Constitution. The formation of Malerkotla is a reflection of the divisive policy of the Congress.” Captain Singh had on Friday declared Malerkotla as the 23rd district of the State. In a tweet, he said, “Happy to share that on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, my govt. has announced Malerkotla as the newest district in the State. The 23rd district holds huge historical significance. Have ordered to immediately locate a suitable site for the district administrative complex.” On the U.P. Chief Minister’s comment, Captain Singh said given Yogi Adityanath’s government and the BJP’s track record of spreading communal hate, such a remark was ridiculous, unwarranted and uncalled for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-amarinder-in-spat-over-new-punjab-district/article34569526.ece
16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Public, govt. had become inattentive after first wave’||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said everyone — society, the government and the administration — had become inattentive after the first wave of COVID-19. Dr. Bhagwat was speaking during the online lecture series organised by RSS Delhi’s COVID-19 response team titled “Positivity Unlimited”. The RSS chief said he had been asked to speak about positivity, which was a tough ask as times were tough and many families had lost their loved ones, including sole breadwinners. He said while nothing could be done about those already lost, those surviving were left to deal with the circumstances. “We don’t need negationism, to say that nothing happened and everything is fine… We have to keep our minds positive, the bodies corona-negative,” he said. He said though times were tough, there was still hope. “It is time to fight,” he said. “After the first wave, we all became inattentive, whether the public, the government or administration. We knew, doctors were giving signals. But we all became inattentive. Now, they are talking of a third wave. Do we have to be scared? No, we don’t have to be scared,” he said, adding that there was a need to prepare for the next wave. He said now was the time for everyone to work as a “team” and that the time for assigning blame would come later. Citing the example of stakeholders in Pune coming together, he said the same should be replicated all over. “Doesn’t matter if you woke up late,” he said, adding that the efforts should be sped up now. The RSS chief also cautioned people against believing anything without verification and suggested they keep themselves busy by spending time with their families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/public-govt-had-become-inattentive-after-first-wave/article34569531.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,||AI begins zeolite cargo service||National carrier Air India (AI) has begun the first of its “zeolite cargo flights”, with the Central government having commenced the process of importing zeolite from across the world for use in medical oxygen plants. The government has appointed the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as the charterer for these consignments. Under the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund, the DRDO is to set up these medical oxygen plants. An April 28 Press Information Bureau (PIB) release said the medical oxygen plant technology being developed by the DRDO would now help in supplementing oxygen supplies for COVID-19 patients, with the transfer of technology having been made to Tata Advanced Systems Ltd., Bengaluru, and Trident Pneumatics Pvt. Ltd., Coimbatore. The technology uses the pressure swing adsorption process and molecular sieve zeolite in oxygen generation.  On-site generation The release said the technology would be especially useful in urban, remote and rural settings with the on-site generation of medical oxygen in a cost-effective manner. The airline said the first set of seven chartered flights, from Rome to Bengaluru, would start from May 15-18. Two aircraft, with 35 tonnes of the substance, would land on Sunday, at 4.45 a.m. (Delhi-Frankfurt-Rome-Bengaluru, AI 1152; 13 tonnes) and 6.45 a.m. These would be followed by eight charter flights, from Korea to Bengaluru between May 19-22. There would be uplifts, too, from the U.S. on its scheduled flights from Newark Liberty airport between May 20 and 25. The airline has planned these flights from Brussels, Tokyo and the U.S. again later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ai-begins-zeolite-cargo-service/article34569541.ece
16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Plea in SC seeks cancellation of Class 12 exams||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court to direct the authorities to cancel the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) examinations for Class 12 students. The petition asked both the boards to instead conceive an objective methodology to declare the Class 12 results within a specific time-frame. “Issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to cancel the examination of Class 12 and devise an objective methodology to declare the result within a specific time-frame,” advocate Mamta Sharma, who filed the petition, urged. He said the CBSE and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations notifications deferring the exams to an unspecified date should be quashed. Students cannot be made to suffer uncertainty in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis posed by the COVID pandemic. There should not be any uncertainty on exams crucial to the future academic study of Class 12 students, the plea stated. Last year, the court asked the boards to determine and declare Class 12 exam results on the basis of their earlier grading. The petitioner said the same methodology could be used this year too. Both the boards cannot remain mute spectators and opt to wait and watch for the pandemic wave to ebb. Delay would put the future of the students in peril. The boards had cancelled the Class 10 exams. The same should be done for Class 12 students. “As far as the innocent students of Class 12 are concerned, a step-motherly, arbitrary, inhuman direction have been issued to postpone their final examination for an unspecified duration instead of following the directions propounded and accepted by them last year,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-in-sc-seeks-cancellation-of-class-12-exams/article34569545.ece

16 May 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra BJP claims MVA is fudging data||While the BJP-led Central government’s agencies praise the ‘Mumbai model’ of fighting the coronavirus, BJP’s Maharashtra leaders seem to think otherwise. The party, which is in the Opposition in the State has once again alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is fudging data. Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, claiming the State hid 9,603 deaths in 2020 and the practice is still prevalent. “Mumbai has not only reduced the number of COVID tests, but increased the rapid antigen test in a bid to develop new model. Mumbai has registered 40% deaths in the category of ‘deaths due to other reason’ when other districts stand at 0.8% only. Every method is being used to hide the number of deaths,” said Mr. Fadnavis in his letter, which came in response to Ms. Gandhi’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress said that since Mr. Fadnavis cannot dare to question Mr. Modi over the misgovernance of BJP-ruled States, he has chosen to target Opposition leaders like Ms. Gandhi. ‘People struggling’ Mr. Fadnavis claimed that out of 4,000 deaths in the country, 850 are in Maharashtra alone. Complaining that MVA government, of which Congress is a part, has left regions like Marathwada, Vidarbha and north Maharashtra to fend for themselves, he claimed that people were struggling for Remdesivir, oxygen and medical treatment. Mr. Fadnavis said that the Centre has provided maximum help to the State. The Congress shot back at Mr. Fadnavis, calling his letter an attempt to hide Mr. Modi’s failure. “Mr. Fadnavis has lied on every possible count in his letter. Be it about the aid from the Centre or number of deaths. Courts had to intervene on every step to force the Centre to provide aid to Maharashtra. While pointing fingers at number of tests in Maharashtra, he is conveniently ignoring BJP-ruled States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar where no tests at all are being conducted,” said Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-bjp-claims-mva-is-fudging-data/article34569795.ece
16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Samyukt Kisan Morcha plans to observe May 26 as ‘black day’||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers’ unions, on Saturday announced that it will observe May 26 as ‘black day’, marking six months of their protest at Delhi’s borders against the Centre’s three farm laws. In a virtual press conference, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal appealed to the people to raise black flags at their houses, vehicles and shops on May 26 to protest against the contentious farm legislations. “On May 26, we will complete six months of this protest and it also happens to mark seven years since Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the government. We will observe it as black day,” Mr. Rajewal said. A large number of farmers reached Delhi’s borders on November 26 after facing water cannons and police barriers as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s farm laws. Thousands of farmers from across the country joined the protest in the following months at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders around the national capital. Mr. Rajewal appealed to the people to support the call for observing ‘black day’ on May 26. Demands not heard “We appeal to people of the country and also Punjab to hang black flags at their house, shops, trucks and other vehicles. We will also burn effigies of (PM) Narendra Modi as a form of protest,” he added. He said that the government has not heard the farmers’ demands to repeal the three farm laws and “with increasing prices of fertilisers, diesel and petrol, the farming business is not possible”. Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops. However, the government, which has held multiple rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/samyukt-kisan-morcha-plans-to-observe-may-26-as-black-day/article34569755.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of States, central ministries and agencies concerned and asked them to ensure all were safely evacuated. At a meeting that included Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Modi directed officials to ensure special preparedness on COVID-19 management in hospitals, vaccine cold chain and other medical facilities on power back up and storage of essential medicines and to plan for unhindered movement of oxygen tankers, said a statement from the PMO. Storms are common in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in May, ahead of the monsoon onset though climatologists have said there is an increase in the number of such storms in the Arabian Sea in recent years. Tauktae is the fourth cyclone in as many years over the Arabian Sea in the pre-monsoon months. This is being attributed to a rise in average sea surface temperatures driven by global warming.

16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kuwait to deliver more medical oxygen: envoy||Kuwait is expected to deliver a total of 1,400 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to India, its envoy told The Hindu on Saturday. Ambassador Jasim Al Najm said Kuwait had emerged as one of the largest contributors of oxygen-related support to India. Kuwait on Saturday sent 75 mt of liquid medical oxygen and 1,000 oxygen cylinders to the Mumbai port by using the sea-bridge agreement with India. A statement from the Embassy of Kuwait informed Saturday’s delivery was carried on MV Capt Kattelmann . This was the fourth such ship that carried Liquid Medical Oxygen to Indian hospitals that are dealing with the rush of COVID-19 affected patients. Three more Indian Navy ships, INS Kochi, INS Tabar and INS Kolkata brought oxygen supplies to Mangalore port earlier in the week. “We are doing our best to help India with the bilateral sea-bridge agreement. We produce a huge quantity of oxygen for Iraq and Jordan. So now we are also producing for India because of the emerging health crisis,” said Ambassador Jasim Al Najm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kuwait-to-deliver-more-medical-oxygen-envoy/article34569518.ece

Earlier, Reuters reported that Cairn had filed a lawsuit on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to make Air India liable for the judgment it was awarded. The lawsuit argued that the carrier, as a state-owned company, is “legally indistinct from the state itself”. “The nominal distinction between India and Air India is illusory and serves only to aid India in improperly shielding its assets from creditors like (Cairn),” the filing said. The action against Air India could put a roadblock on its disinvestment process as the government was hoping to conclude the debt-ridden carrier’s sale by September this year. Timelines may also get affected in the proposed transaction by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The government or public sector entities have not received any such notice,” said a source when asked about the Cairn filing against Air India. “As and when any such notice is received, the Government or concerned organisation shall take all necessary steps to defend against any such illegal enforcement action,” he said. The Centre has challenged the December 2020 arbitration tribunal award in favour of Cairn in an appropriate court in The Hague.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cairn-moves-us-court-to-attach-ai-assets/article34569527.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Extending gap between doses scientific: Paul||Delaying a second dose by a month or two wasn’t a solution to address the shortage if the overall supply didn’t improve, he told The Hindu in a phone conversation. He said he expected a significant increase in supply only by August. “However we’ve recommended a vaccine ‘sparing strategy’ and it is likely to be announced by the government next week,” he stated. While Dr. Arora didn’t explain what such strategy was, he said it would apply to all future supply and was designed to make the entire vaccine supply process “more efficient.” From August, the expectation was that there would be 27 crore doses available a month with increased supply of Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V. “By December, I’m confident that we’ll even have enough to give our neighbouring countries.” In February, an expert panel of the World Health Organisation recommended an 8-12 week interval between two doses of the AstraZeneca. Clinical trials had shown that vaccines 4-6 weeks apart had around 54% efficacy compared to 79% if the gap was 12 weeks. India currently averages between 2-2.5 million doses a day with over 65% of them given to those over 45. Though open to all and with an option to access paid doses, it’s a challenge for adults below 44 to find a slot for the first shot. Dr. Arora said that vaccination ideally ought not to have been made available for those below 45 as the risks from the disease— even after the second wave— continued to be much higher for those older as in the first wave. On Saturday, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) said discussions were on between the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, Hester Biosciences and OmniBRx and Bharat Biotech to scale up the Covaxin technology and to produce minimum 20 million doses a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/extending-gap-between-doses-scientific-paul/article34569528.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Over 4,500 ‘missing deaths’ in Delhi||“The government has been hiding (death) figures since the pandemic started. Not only did they ignore our request for help in procuring firewood for cremations so citizens do not face inconvenience, they are sitting on funds meant to pay salaries of doctors and sanitation workers engaged everywhere from COVID hospitals to funeral venues,” Jai Prakash, Mayor, North MCD, alleged. ‘Technical reasons’ A senior MCD official, cited other “technical reasons” for the mismatch. “There are two main reasons: the government excluding suspected COVID cases, patients with life-threatening illnesses and non-Delhi residents from the death tally. For us, the last rites of all designated COVID bodies are performed as per protocol irrespective of these reasons,” the official said. “The other reason is bodies of COVID patients are not being laid to rest on the day of their death. Many times families refuse to claim such bodies for one reason or another; these are then brought to funeral venues for last rites in batches of multiple bodies by the police, NGOs and Good Samaritans,” the official said. The Delhi government has denied such charges and said the mismatch is commonly due to the deaths of COVID-19 patients occurring either on their way to hospitals or outside one as they could not get admission on time. “We are completely transparent in all matters and especially the pandemic, all deaths are accounted for. In many instances, patients also die due to comorbidities aggravated by COVID after testing negative either at a hospital or at home,” a Delhi government source said. The cumulative death toll since the outbreak last year breached the 20,000-mark on May 11, standing at 20,010; 63% of the deceased were cremated or buried in the past 24 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-4500-missing-deaths-in-delhi/article34569529.ece

16 May 2021||Patna,||Kin of 119 Bihar doctors wait for compensation||Compensation has not reached the families of the doctors who have died in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Bihar. Only one of 120 dead has got it. The Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has submitted memoranda to the government several times in this regard but “the government is yet to respond”. The Central government had announced a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to the family of a doctor who dies of COVID-19. The State government too had announced Rs. 4 lakh as compensation. As many as 120 doctors have lost their lives: 42 in the first wave last year and 78 in the second one this year. Only the kin of Rati Raman Jha, civil surgeon of Samastipur, has got the compensation till date.Family members of Dr. Avinash Kumar, who was the first doctor to die due to COVID-19 in June 2020, are still waiting for the compensation. “Out of all family members, only those of Rati Raman Jha, who was the civil surgeon of Samastipur, have got the compensation, while approval for the same has been given to those of five doctors but the rest are still awaiting,” former IMA president, Bihar chapter and member of the central working committee, Dr. Sacchidanand told The Hindu . The IMA had written to the government for compensation and other facilities to the working doctors “several times but we’re yet to get any response of any of our letters from the State government”. “However, family members of some of the doctors may receive the compensation amount in a day or two”, IMA secretary Dr. Sunil Kumar said. The association demanded that the government should raise the compensation amount from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 20-25 lakh. “It appears that both the Central and State governments have forgotten the services rendered by the doctors in this adverse condition whom they have declared as front line workers. Such a move by the governments in delaying compensation to the families certainly demoralises the working doctors”, stated Dr. Sacchidanand. “In several hospitals, doctors have been working for long hours while being away from their family to treat COVID-19 patients, but when they die, the government prefers to forget what it had announced,” rued Dr. Atul Verma of Hajipur. “It is stressful”, he added. Bihar has so far reported 6,37,679 positive cases, with 89,563 active ones till May 14. However, 3,670 people have died with 85.63% recovery rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kin-of-119-bihar-doctors-wait-for-compensation/article34569542.ece

Father Joseph Xavier, who spoke to Fr. Stan Swamy on Friday morning, told the media via a virtual press conference that the Jesuit priest had cough, fever and an upset stomach, and that Fr. Swamy had told him he was feeling very weak and fragile. Fr. Swamy was arrested on October 9, 2020. “Fr. Stan told me that he was given antibiotics, but he was very weak,” said Fr. Xavier, and added, “The situation inside Taloja prison is not good, with COVID-19 cases rising. Fr. Stan has also been denied vaccination as he does not have his Aadhaar card.” Harshali Potdar, activist, Republican Panthers Jatiya Antachi Chalwal, said the majority of staff and canteen members at the Taloja jail had tested positive for COVID-19. She said jail authorities were only testing the fit and leaving out the sick. ‘Mental harassment’ She added co-accused Sudhir Dhawale (arrested on June 6, 2018), along with Vernon Gonsalves (arrested on August 28, 2018), were in the same barrack where eight others had tested positive, but they were still not being tested. Mr. Dhawale was not being vaccinated because he did not have his Aadhaar card. She said that if they complained, the jail authorities told them they would stop all phone calls and meetings with the family members. This was mental harassment and they needed to be released immediately, Ms. Potdar said. ‘Denied vaccination’ She said despite the Central government’s standard operating procedure that inmates would be vaccinated without Aadhaar cards, this was not being done. Jenny Rowena, wife of co-accused Professor Hany Babu (arrested on July 28, 2020), said, “The situation in Taloja jail is dangerous. There is no plan, infrastructure or equipment to tackle the situation. A 22-year-old prisoner died of COVID-19 after continuously complaining of throat pain. There are no doctors, nurses, support staff or medicines to look after the sick.” Talking about Mr. Babu’s condition, she said he had developed an acute eye infection which spread to his face, and after repeated calls and follow-ups from his lawyer, he was admitted to the JJ Hospital, where he tested positive for COVID-19. ‘No testing facility’ Monali Raut, sister of co-accused Mahesh Raut (arrested on June 6, 2018), said, “Taloja jail has no equipment for basic testing of COVID-19 and jail authorities do not allow any medicines, thermometer or oximeter. Every time I send these or go there personally to deliver them, I am told, ‘it’s not allowed.’” Minal, wife of co-accused Surendra Gadling (arrested on June 6, 2018), said: “Like most of the Bhima-Koregaon accused, Surendra also has comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and asthma. They have been denied the basic right to health inside prison. They all should be released on bail.”  They have been denied the basic right to health inside prison.

16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Only 15% of the streets in city have active COVID-19 cases||While 196 of the 200 wards in Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) had at least one active COVID-19 case, a street-wise analysis showed that the active cases were concentrated in 15% of the roughly 42,000 streets in the city. In other words, one in every seven streets had an active case. The analysis was done based on the data released by GCC, according to which there were 42,500 active cases as on Thursday. The active cases were spread across nearly 6,300 of the 42,000 streets. While the civic body has earlier provided the names of the streets with six or more cases, this was the first time it has released the full list of active cases in every street. But this data does not mean that the remaining four of the 200 wards or the other streets had not reported any case earlier during the second wave. Teynampet worst hit Teynampet had the highest number of streets with active cases. Of the nearly 2,000 streets in the zone, 813 or more than 40 % of them had at least one active case. It was followed by Kodambakkam (2,600 streets) and Royapuram (1,600 streets). One in every four streets had active cases in these zones. Perungudi, one of the geographically bigger zones with more number of streets, had the lowest proportion of streets with active cases. Of the nearly 5,600 streets, active cases were present in only 293 streets. In absolute numbers, Manali had the least number of streets with active cases. One hundred of the nearly 1,450 streets in the zone had active cases, according to the data. 1,000 streets Within the 6,300 streets, 1,000 streets with ten or more active cases accounted for 40% of the active cases. Over 5,300 streets or nearly 85 % of all these affected streets had less than 10 active cases. The IMH Street in Kilpauk had the highest number of 82 active cases as on Thursday. Eleven more streets had more than 50 active cases. With the city reporting over 6,000 new cases a day and with the active case load rising sharply by another 4,000 since Thursday, the geographical spread of the cases may widen further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-15-of-the-streets-in-city-have-active-covid-19-cases/article34569671.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chaos prevails at Remdesivir counters in Nehru stadium||Utter chaos and confusion prevailed at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium on Saturday when the sale of Remdesivir began. People had started waiting in the queue from Friday night without following any COVID-19 safety protocol. There was a stampede-like situation and people sat on road roko demanding the distribution of the drug. The counter was shifted to the stadium from the Government Kilpauk Medical College because of overcrowding. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) distributes only 300 tokens every day. Relatives or family members of patients can enter the stadium from Gate 5 and exit through Gate 4. Desperate relatives and family members of patients started waiting in the queue since Friday night. The crowd swelled on Saturday morning. A section of the crowd managed to reach the counter and collected the drug but a large number of people were unable to get it and were frustrated. They jostled, pushed the police personnel and broke the cordon. The crowd then squatted the road demanding sthe drug. R. Vasudevan of Villivakkam said: “My friend who is a person with disability and his wife have contracted infection. I have been waiting at the Government Kilpauk Medical College from April 12 to buy the drug and to save their lives. But I have not been able to buy it till today. In fact, I had registered at Kilpauk. We were told that all our registration details would be forwarded here. Expecting smooth distribution, we were waiting from Friday night here. We were turned away here citing that we have to register once again. We don't know how long we have to wait. “Around 5.30 am., I came here to buy for my wife and I had registered at Government Kilpauk Medical College. Even the policemen on duty here have no clue on where we should wait in the queue. They told us that there was no separate queue for people who already registered and asked us to stand in the queue wherever we wanted. More than 2,000 people stood before me and I did not get the drug. I was dragged here and there. Tomorrow is a holiday,” he said. Tulsi Rao from Kilpauk said, “Here physical distance is not at all maintained. Authorities are laying emphasis on physical distance. Now, they gathered a huge crowd here. Will we not contract infection here now? Most of the people here are possibly exposed to COVID patients.”  Joint Commissioner of Police (East) V. Balakrishnan and other officers held talks with the protesters and assured them of delivery of drugs soon. Then they dispersed from the spot while a few of them stayed back. Expert’s concern Prabhdeep Kaur, public health expert tweeted, “This is perfect setting for #Covid19 cluster. Will make lockdown ineffective. Remdesivir is not a life-saving drug. Yet, if Govt wants to help patients in private hospitals - it should be given directly to the hospitals.”  Most of the people here are possibly exposed to COVID patients who are their family members or relatives Tulsi Rao Resident of Kilpauk||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chaos-prevails-at-remdesivir-counters-in-nehru-stadium/article34569675.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Experts draw up dos and don’ts||What are the dos and don’ts for home isolation? Do all patients need to undergo a CT scan? When should steroids be prescribed for COVID-19 patients? What are the red flag signs? More than a year into the pandemic, several doubts and questions linger in the minds of people. Experts draw up a list of dos and don’ts for home isolation, screening and treatment protocols. “Persons in home isolation require a separate room to stay in, a person to take care of them and monitor their oxygen saturation levels. All they need is paracetamol and vitamins. Depending on the age, some may need extra blood tests to monitor their condition. No routine CT scan is needed,” says V. Ramasubramanian, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals. The majority of patients can be treated at home, notes K. Kolandaswamy, former Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. “If a person does not have high grade fever or cough and the oxygen saturation level is good, he/she can be isolated at home. Doctors’ standard prescription includes paracetamol and multivitamins. Do not self-medicate,” he says. There are concerns over indiscriminate use of CT scans. Not all patients require a CT scan, say doctors. “CT scans are required when there are discrepancies in the clinical picture and history. If a person says he/she developed a fever the day before, and has developed breathlessness today, I will prescribe a CT scan. A CT scan is required if a person develops sudden breathlessness or has persistent symptoms for 10 days or if he/she is worsening clinically,” Dr. Ramasubramanian points out. Another area of concern is the use of drugs. He notes that there is no role for antibiotics in COVID-19 treatment. “Steroids should be prescribed for patients with low oxygen saturation levels — less than 95%. Theoretically, using steroids early could worsen the infection. They may be less efficacious in the later part of the illness if used early.” So what are the danger signs? Dr. Kolandaswamy says, “One of the signs is an oxygen saturation level below 95%. If the level dips after a six-minute walk test, approach a peripheral institution and stay under observation. A person with an oxygen saturation level of less than 90%, a significant lung involvement and co-morbidities should be taken to a higher treatment facility.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/experts-draw-up-dos-and-donts/article34569691.ece

16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||When Stalin answered an emergency call at war room||When Chennai resident Archana Padmakar made a call for a medical emergency on Friday, she was in for a surprise. Her late night distress call to the COVID-19 war room seeking a bed for an elderly relative was attended to by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin who was visiting the facility. He promised her timely help. In 30 minutes, the patient, whose oxygen saturation level dropped to 84%, was allocated a bed at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). Ms. Padmakar, who is the deputy director of the Emergency Care and Recovery Centre, The Banyan, has been volunteering on social media to find beds for patients. “I have been volunteering on Instagram and Facebook. But this was the first time that I called the 104 helpline for my relative,” she said. It all started at 8.30 p.m. when she received a call from her cousin. “My aunt was experiencing breathlessness, and her oxygen saturation level dropped to 84%. I spent 45 minutes calling nearly 10 hospitals, but did not get a bed. We did not want to take any risk, given her age. As they live near Nerkundram, she was taken to the casualty ward of a nearby private hospital. The hospital assured us that it will provide oxygen support for two hours but said there were no beds to manage her beyond that,” she explained. Faced with the need to shift her to another facility, Ms. Padmakar made a frantic call to the 104 helpline at 11.15 p.m. “The first ring went unanswered. So I called again. This time, a staff member answered the call and asked for the required information. After a while, he handed over the call to another person. I was so tense that little did I realise that I was speaking to the Chief Minister after he introduced himself,” she said. It was only a few minutes later that she realised it was the Chief Minister who was at the other end. “I was taken aback, and requested the staff member to allow me to talk to him again. I thanked the Chief Minister and appreciated the work being done. He realised that I was in a state of panic and calmed me down, and said they would find a bed for me,” she said. In less than 15 minutes, her cousin received a call about a bed at RGGGH. An ambulance shifted the patient by 11.45 p.m.  I was so tense that little did I realise that I was speaking to the Chief Minister after he introduced himself Archana Padmakar  Resident of Chennai||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-stalin-answered-an-emergency-call-at-war-room/article34569667.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man tags CMO on Twitter, help arrives in a few hours||Within a few hours after a man from Tiruvallur tagged Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s official Twitter handle complaining that a Sub-Inspector had imposed a Rs. 500 fine on him for violating lockdown while he was on his way to purchase medicines for his child, police arrived at his doorstep with the money and medicine for the child. On Friday, R. Balakrishnan posted a tweet tagging @CMOTamilnadu and stated that the attitude of the police would not change irrespective of the political party that came to power. “Around 11.30 a.m, I had gone to purchase medicine for my 9-year-old son who is autistic. I get the medicines once in 10 days from a shop in Kakkalur,” said Mr. Balakrishnan who was with a social media wing of a political party and is currently unemployed. However, the shop was closed and when he was riding back home, he was stopped at the Kakkalur check-post by a Sub-Inspector. “I was not wearing a helmet. The police officer pointed this out and also told me that I had violated lockdown norms and took Rs. 500 from me. I don’t mind paying a fine, but I was feeling bad that they had taken the money meant for my son and I didn’t have any other cash to pay for the medicines,” said Mr. Balakrishnan. After returning home, he tagged the Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s official Twitter handle and posted a picture of the prescription. “Soon, a media person called me and later a senior police officer called and pacified me. Within a few hours, a police inspector came home and returned the money and also gave medicine for my son. After this incident, my perception about the police changed completely,” he added. K. Shankar, IG, North Zone, confirmed the incident. “We are enforcing lockdown strictly, but we also have to be humane. Collecting fines is just a deterrent. When we came to know he had no money and had gone to buy medicines, the Tiruvallur taluk police were directed to return the cash and additionally buy the medicine for the child,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-tags-cmo-on-twitter-help-arrives-in-a-few-hours/article34569679.ece

16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Four MLAs in race for CLP leader post||The Congress high command is in a fix as four MLAs are in the race for the post of Congress Legislative Party leader (CLP). Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri has convened a meeting of party MLAs on Monday at Sathyamurthy Bhavan to elicit their opinion on the CLP leader. Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, Puducherry MP V. Vaithilingam and Dinesh Gundu Rao, who is in charge of party affairs in Tamil Nadu, will participate in the meeting. S. Vijayadharani, who was elected from Vilavancode for the third time, J.C. Prince, representing Colachel for the third time, two-time MLA S. Rajesh Kumar elected from Killiyoor and Selvaperunthagai, representing Sriperumbudur constituency, are in the race. “Six of the MLAs belong to Nadar community. Caste is one aspect. We should also keep in mind that Kanniyakumari and Tirunelveli districts have elected seven Congress MLAs,” said a senior leader, making a case for a leader from this community. Even though Ms. Vijayadharani and Mr. Prince are the seniors among the MLAs, the high command is not fully in favour of them. In fact, their names could not find a place in the first list of the Congress candidates. As for Mr. Selvaperunthagai, he has entered the Assembly for the second time. The first time, he was elected as a member of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK). Party sources said another senior MLA A.M. Munirathinam, representing Sholingar, is not interested in the post. Of the 18 Congress MLAs, 11 of them are new faces and they are interested in electing Mr. Rajesh Kumar from Killiyoor. “Secret ballot is the best way to elect the leader,” said another senior leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-mlas-in-race-for-clp-leader-post/article34569696.ece
16 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to adopt syndromic approach towards COVID-19 management||Given the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases and sample load, the State will adopt a syndromic approach towards the pandemic management. Under this, active case search will be taken up through house-to-house visits, and screening/triaging will be taken up at Interim COVID-19 Care Centres (ICCCs). All persons with suspected symptoms approaching screening centres/ICCCs may not be subjected to RT-PCR testing as all syndromic cases are considered COVID-19 unless proved otherwise. In a May 13 circular, the Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine said the positivity rate for the past one week was 15.9%, the highest so far. The average number of deaths for the past 10 days was 150. Around 80% of the confirmed cases can be treated as outpatients in home isolation or at COVID-19 Care Centres (CCC), while 20% may require hospitalisation and 5% need intensive care. The State government took a policy decision to diagnose COVID-19 through the RT-PCR method. But the exponential increase in the case and sample loads has added to the burden on the health system. At the same time, appropriate treatment is necessary to reduce mortality. So it was proposed to adopt the syndromic management. Some of the advantages of the approach include implementation on a large scale, patient-centred care, lab tests are not required always, cost-effective and simplified surveillance. SOP issued The Director of Public Health issued the Standard Operating Protocol for the approach. This included active case search and referral — the local body/the Greater Chennai Corporation/the Health Department must engage health workers, including trained volunteers, self-help groups and NGOs (one per 100 houses at all places). A health worker must visit a house twice a week, check the temperature of all residents and the oxygen saturation level of symptomatic persons and confirmed cases in home isolation. Under passive surveillance or screening/triaging at ICCCs, all persons with suspected symptoms may not be subjected to testing. The medical history, including symptoms, duration of symptoms and co-morbidities, would be enumerated. Based on the findings at the screening centres/ICCCs, suspect/confirmed cases would be categorised as mild, moderate and severe and referred to appropriate institutions. One upgraded Primary Health Centre (PHC) in each block will be converted into an ICCC. The 30-bed ICCC would have partitions for confirmed patients and those with suspected symptoms. Mild and moderate cases would be managed at ICCCs. All beds should have oxygen support and adequate drugs, including those prescribed for COVID-19. One vehicle should be kept ready for referral. All antenatal clinics and delivery services in the PHC upgraded as ICCC should be shifted to the nearest PHCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-adopt-syndromic-approach-towards-covid-19-management/article34569697.ece

The TNMSC floated the tender to procure five crore doses, with the delivery schedule of 90 days progressively from the date of purchase order. The vaccines should be delivered at the State Vaccine Store, Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services complex and the District Vaccine Stores in Cuddalore, Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Madurai, Sivaganga, Tirunelveli, Vellore, Salem and Coimbatore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/global-tender-floated-for-5-crore-doses/article34569700.ece
16 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Minister calls for judicious use of medical oxygen||Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian on Saturday said the government was reiterating judicious use of medical oxygen. Considering the present crisis, doctors must use medical oxygen prudently based on the requirement for each patient, he said after inspecting the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital, Coimbatore, along with Food Minister R. Sakkarapani on Saturday. “ESI Hospital, with 830 beds, has been functioning efficiently in the first wave and second wave. Around 17,000 people recovered from COVID-19 from the hospital, registering a very low death ratio,” he said. According to the Minister, the hospital is having a single supplier for medical oxygen which is stored in a single plant. The hospital administration has sought for the allocation of one more supplier and establishment for another storage plant. The District Collector had been tasked to process the request at the earliest, he said. The Minister said the hospital was following prone positioning for patients with oxygen saturation level of 89-90 in case of emergency. The method could improve the oxygen level to 94-95 and other hospitals could follow it, he said. Mr. Subramanian said the Food Minister, who was assigned by the Chief Minister to oversee COVID-19 containment works in Coimbatore district, had been visiting hospitals for the last four days and sending reports to the Health Department based on their requirements. The two Ministers visited the COVID-19 Care Centre at the Codissia Trade Fair Complex and the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH). They inaugurated a new oxygen concentrator at CMCH which can generate 200 litres of oxygen per minute from the ambient air. The machine could cater to the oxygen requirement of about 30 beds, according to the hospital administration. Review meeting Mr. Subramanian later chaired a review meeting at the Collectorate which was attended by Mr. Sakkarapani, Forest Minister K. Ramachandran, the Collector, MLAs, MPs and senior officials from various departments including Health, Revenue and Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-calls-for-judicious-use-of-medical-oxygen/article34569742.ece
16 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Rain wreaks havoc in tribal settlement||When heavy rain started to lash Aliyar near Pollachi on Friday evening, young couple Suresh and Sangeetha from Chinnarpathi tribal settlement prepared for a tough journey. Along with other families, the couple carried their one-and-a-half-year-old daughter Pournika and embarked on a trek through the jungle to an alternative dwelling which had been home to their ancestors for years – the caves. “The dwellings made of bamboo, tarpaulin and tin sheets barely withstand heavy rain and wind. Elderly people anticipated a heavy spell at night and the majority of them sought shelter in the caves before heavy rain and gale hit the settlement. They returned to the settlement early on Saturday, only to find completely damaged dwellings,” said V.S. Paramasivam, Coimbatore district president of Tamil Nadu Tribal Association. Mr. Paramasivam was one of the outsiders who reached out to the families on Saturday morning. Located around two km from Aliyar and around 70 km. off Coimbatore, Chinnarpathi on the banks of the river Chinnar comes under the limit of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Of the 43 families in the settlement, dwellings of eight families were completely damaged in the rain and gale. Other dwellings were partially damaged. “Chinnarpathi and several other tribal settlements in ATR face the same plight every year. In August 2019, dwellings of 24 families from Nagaroothu settlement were damaged in a flash flood and a two-and-a-half-year-old child was washed away. Though the then Valparai MLA assured to arrange proper housing for the families, the promise was never kept. We appeal to the new government to take war footing measures to improve the lives of the tribal families,” Mr. Paramasivam said. Pollachi forest range officer V. Pugalendhi said that 24 persons, whose dwellings were damaged, were shifted to a nearby marriage hall on Saturday. Valparai MLA Amul Kandasamy visited the settlement on Saturday. According to the district administration, Valparai taluk witnessed heavy rain on Friday evening as 63 mm of rainfall was recorded as of Saturday morning. Pollachi received about 17 mm of rainfall. Many localities within Coimbatore Corporation limits also witnessed moderate to heavy rain on Friday night, which led to inundation of a few low lying areas. Coimbatore Airport received 8.2 mm of rainfall, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University 9 mm and Coimbatore South saw 10 mm of rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-wreaks-havoc-in-tribal-settlement/article34569992.ece
16 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||New restrictions come into force in Coimbatore||With the State government introducing new restrictions since Saturday morning, essential trades stopped business by 10 a.m. The police had barricaded entry into several roads in Coimbatore city. Retail outlets and roadside vendors shut shop, complying with the restrictions. President of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, C. Balasubramanian, said the retailers had abided by the new restrictions as they had realised the gravity of the situation. The wholesale grocery dealers on RG Street closed down by 10 a.m. As timing got reduced, the crowd only increased, said a trader. These were essential commodities and when timing was reduced, there were several challenges, said the wholesale trader. Wholesale and retail vegetable shops at TK market had poor customer walk in as it was raining and also business hours were reduced. Customers usually come only by 8 a.m. and the market will close by 10 a.m. “There is a lot of confusion among the traders.

Industries in Coimbatore continued to operate on Saturday and there were no major challenges for workers who came to work, said sources. Industries to close down Some of the industrial associations in Coimbatore, including the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, have appealed to their members to stop production from Monday voluntarily for the lockdown period. The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations, however, decided that its members will continue production. “Only about 10 % member units are operating. We do not want to stop them,” said J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises. In Tiruppur, garment exporting units had also decided to voluntarily stop production. Those who had workers staying on the premises and if they had orders and raw material stocks might continue to operate. Those manufacturing for the domestic market had also stopped production, said Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association.

When Collector K. Senthil Raj, MP M.K.Kanimozhi and Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan participated in an event organised at Shanmuga Sigamani Nagar in Kovilpatti on Saturday, N. Ridhana, 12, of Rajiv Nagar near Paandavarmangalam, a class VIII student, donated her savings of Rs. 1,970 towards Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund. The reason she gave for donating the money left everyone speechless. “I used to give my savings to my dad whenever my family faced unexpected expenses. I thought that my savings would save my father from the heart ailment he was suffering from. But he succumbed to the ailment. So, I decided to donate my savings to the CM’s Relief Fund as it can be used to save the fathers of a few more children like me,” Ridhana said. Ridhana’s father Nagaraj, 42, was working with a Bengaluru-based company as a manager and was under treatment for a while. “When we could not meet the huge medical bills, he withdrew a portion of money from his provident fund. When we were discussing about it, my daughter, who happened to hear it, said she would give her entire savings to meet the medical expenses. She used to give money from her savings to her poor schoolmates to meet their needs. After helping her friends and my husband from her savings of Rs. 8,540, she had Rs. 1,970 with her when my husband passed away. On seeing the traumatised children undergoing treatment for COVID-19 on television, she decided to donate her savings to CM’s relief fund,” said her mother, N. Amutha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/girl-donates-money-saved-for-fathers-treatment/article34570074.ece

The war room, which is set up on the Collectorate premises, was inspected by Finance Minister P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan and Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy on Friday. The war room is run by officials from the police, revenue and health departments. Different duties The war room has these main components - grievance redressal cell; a team to monitor social media; a team for triaging COVID-19 positive patients; home isolation monitoring team; a team for updating bed availability in hospitals; and a team to monitor the availability of oxygen support in hospitals. The grievance redressal team addresses the general complaints received from the public. The social media team tracks the COVID-19 queries and calls that are reported at the official Twitter handle of the 104 helpline - @104_GoTN. When COVID-19 positive patients call the war room, a team of doctors undertake triaging over phone and guide them about the level of care and type of institution from where they should get treatment. A team of 15 nurses in two shifts call and track patients who are under home isolation. S. Chandru, District Training Team Medical Officer, said they receive the list of patients who are under home isolation and call them every day to check their status. “Many symptomatic patients opt for home isolation without even consulting the doctor. So we advise them to consult a doctor depending upon their symptoms,” he said. In many cases, patients under home isolation also tend to leave home and roam in public places. “If we come to know about such persons, we will alert the Health Inspector and police officials concerned,” he added. D. Murali, District Project Officer with the Joint Director of Health department, who heads the team to check on availability of beds, said almost all beds in private and government hospitals in Madurai are occupied. “But we get details on availability of beds even before they are updated on the government website,” he added.

16 May 2021||Soma BasuMADURAI,TAMIL NADU||The job is overwhelming as bodies keep coming||In the last 15 years of their working in Madurai’s cremation grounds, many undertakers can’t remember cremating more than five to eight bodies a day. But in the last three weeks, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed them. A team of dozen workers have been doing 24-hour shift on alternate days at the city’s biggest crematorium in Thathaneri. “Three weeks ago, there were 15-20 bodies a day. Now, it is more than 50, as each ambulance brings three bodies,” says A. Venkatesh, 44, one of the registrars. By the time the bodies reach the crematorium, the scene gets visceral. There is a crowd of people, mostly kin, grieving - some silently, some loudly. “We are exhausted, but try not to get upset. This time round it is lot many people. I want this to end soon,” Mr. Venkatesh says. His reticent colleague E. Babu says he derives his sense of calm from the thought that he is doing a job that others dread. But he fears that the task of cremating these many bodies may affect their mental health. Only two family members are allowed into the crematorium. The face of the deceased is uncovered for those who wish to have a last look. Howls of anguish rise and mingle with chanting of slokas. “Those left behind are unable to control their emotions, many are out of focus and we have to handle them gently,” says Mr. Venkatesh. The two electric chambers at Thathaneri work simultaneously. Had it not been for the good Samaritans, the crematorium workers would have found it extremely difficult to dispose of the bodies. Social worker S. Manikandan, who helps in the last rites of abandoned elders, was the first to donate a carton of PPE suits, masks, gloves and sanitisers for the crematorium staff when the COVID deaths began to spike. “I was reading about what’s happening in other cities and felt the need to keep the crematorium workers safe,” he says. With help from sponsors, he has so far donated more than 2,000 PPE kits that are used not only by the COVID-duty staff but also the mourners. The Corporation should take care of the health of the crematorium staff but they are often forgotten and sidelined. The workers earn not more than Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 a month and cannot afford a PPE kit for daily use with their income. But they are doing much more than what is required of their job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-job-is-overwhelming-as-bodies-keep-coming/article34570080.ece

They make trips to the homes of patients to to take them to either Covid Care Centres (CCC) in the city, or to Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. “As per the referral slip given to patients from nearby primary healthcare centres, we take them to CCC or Tiruchi GH,” she said. Five to seven patients are taken on a trip from a locality to ensure that they reach their destination by the end of day. Contrary to popular belief, Mahalakshmi says it is easier to transport patients who need immediate medical attention compared to those with mild symptoms “Patients who need to be rushed to GH usually remain quiet. It is not the case with others.” A representative of ‘108’ ambulances in Tiruchi says that compared to last year, the fleet has been strengthened this year. “We had only five vehicles last year. This time, we have 12, of which four has been allotted to the city for COVID-19 care.

16 May 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Collector urges private firms to sponsor oxygen concentrators||The district administration, which is struggling to get medical-grade oxygen, has successfully persuaded a good number of private firms to sponsor oxygen concentrators to save the lives of the COVID-19 patients under treatment. Since a few thousand patients are under treatment in government and medical college hospitals with oxygen support, Collector V. Vishnu visited a few defunct plants here and assured them of all support to resume oxygen generation. Since the exercise was taking considerable time, Mr. Vishnu persuaded a few private companies to sponsor oxygen concentrators to save the patients and keep them alive until proper oxygen supply was restored. As the TVS Group sponsored 100 oxygen concentrators worth Rs. 50 lakh, Mr. Vishnu rushed some of these machines to the Koodankulam Government Hospital where COVID-19 patients have been admitted. He sent the remaining machines to other COVID Care Centres in rural Tirunelveli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-urges-private-firms-to-sponsor-oxygen-concentrators/article34570072.ece

16 May 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown hits mango farmers in Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur||Lockdown has hit mango farmers of Rajapalayam and Srivilliputtur Taluks hard. There were no takers for their produce at a make-shift mango auction market in Rajapalayam on Wednesday. The farmers have appealed to Virudhunagar district administration to exempt mango trading from lockdown rules. President of Tamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam N.A. Ramachandra Raja said the district administration shifted the auction market to New Bus Stand to prevent crowding and ensure social distancing. However, when farmers from several villages in the two taluks took their produce to the market, there were not many takers as traders from Kerala and Madurai could not come due to the lockdown. “Mango is cultivated in at least 10,000 hectares in Virudhunagar district and predominantly in the two taluks of Rajapalayam and Srivilliputtur. The peak yield of fruits is summer and it goes upto July,’ Mr. Ramachandra Raja said. In the absence of traders from Kerala and Madurai, locals tried to buy Balamani, Sappatta, Kilimookku and Panchavarnam at rock bottom prices. “While the average price for a kg of mango was around Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 last year, the traders quoted Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 a kg this season. Not wanting to sell the produce at such a huge loss, the farmers took the fruits home,” he said. At least 250 tonnes of mangoes could not be sold. The farmers had to spend at least Rs. 40 per kg as production cost towards fertilizer, pesticide and wages for workers and the current trend would hit them hard, he added. He wanted the government to permit traders from Kerala, which was a big market for mangoes from Rajapalayam and Madurai, to visit the auction market. The administration could also make efforts to sell the fruits through e-market to protect the interests of farmers. “Even the High Court had asked the State government to buy agricultural products during such tough days to protect the farmers,” Mr. Ramachandra Raja said. The farmers also wanted a mango pulp factory. A senior agriculture official said the daily average sale during auctioning was 80 tonnes. “If farmers brought the fruits everyday, it would have fetched them good price. But, since they plucked the fruits after a gap of two days and came with unusually higher quantity, the prices dropped drastically due to lack of demand.” Farmers from Watrap were getting a good price as they managed to take their fruits to Madurai, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-hits-mango-farmers-in-rajapalayam-srivilliputtur/article34570068.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Civic body closes down Gandhi Market||Tiruchi Corporation has closed down Gandhi Market with immediate effect. Both retail and wholesale operations will be conducted on West Boulevard Road, the civic body announced on Saturday. The move, aimed at checking spread of COVID-19, comes after a month-long deadlock over shifting of retail operations of the market to G. Corner on Tiruchi-Chennai Highway. The Corporation had made various arrangements at the ground for transaction of business at night. As per the decision conveyed to representatives of various associations, traders can utilise West Boulevard Road from Kamaraj Arch to Vellamandi corner to conduct operations. While wholesale trading will take place at night, retailers will be allowed to operate between 6 a.m and 10 a.m. The arrangements will come into effect on Sunday night and they will be in force until further orders. Sources told The Hindu that the solution to the deadlock was found when a group of leaders of Gandhi Market met Minister for Municipal Administration K. N. Nehru on Saturday. After listening to their grievances, Mr. Nehru reportedly explained the importance of shifting the operations due to unabated surge in COVID-19 cases in Tiruchi and other parts of the State. He told them that all facilities would be created on West Boulevard Road and asked civic officials to take steps to ensure trouble-free trading on the stretch. Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that there was no option but to shift all operations of Gandhi Market with immediate effect. In spite of the warning, a large number of shoppers thronged the market on Saturday too. Hence, if the market was allowed to function, it would be difficult to enforce social distancing norms and the venue could become a hotspot for spread of the virus. Since all shops and business establishments were closed on West Boulevard Road due to total lockdown, there would be no space crunch for sale of vegetables and fruits. Drinking water and toilet facilities would be established wherever required, he added. Welcoming the new arrangements, CPI Tiruchi unit secretary V. Suresh said the new place allotted for trading was not too far from Gandhi Market. Since it was an open place, it might reduce the chances of spreading the virus. The district administration and Corporation should decentralise retail trading to prevent crowding at one place. At least six retail markets should be established for the time being. The same formula adopted during the first wave of COVID-19 could be adopted to decentralise retail trading, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-closes-down-gandhi-market/article34570103.ece

16 May 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Education society takes up relief works for COVID-19 patients||NGOs across the country are doing their bit to help people face the epidemic in various ways. And, Bidar-based Allama Iqbal Education Society is one of them, taking up certain relief works. The society that runs schools and colleges under the banner of Shaheen Group of Institutions, has set up a COVID-19 helpline and call centre. The group has opened two free COVID Care Centres that has 400 beds for non-symptomatic cases and patients with mild and moderate symptoms. It is providing free food to COVID-19-affected families, apart from running two ambulances and hearse vans in Bidar and surrounding areas. “During the first wave, we converted our colleges into COVID Care Centres. Then, we diversified our relief activities in phases,’’ Abdul Quadeer, secretary of the society, told The Hindu . The portal, bidarcovidhelpline.com, is attached to the call centre. It includes information on services such as online doctor consultation, ambulance service, information about bed availability, oxygen supply, food and registration for vaccination. Food and oxygen concentrators can be ordered on the website. The number of doctors attached to Shaheen Hospital has been increased to provide treatment and consultation. NRI doctors who are alumni of the Shaheen Group of Institutions have been roped in to provide online consultation. As many as 1,700 families of COVID-19 patients are being provided free food daily. “During the first wave, we were providing food from our college hostel. Then, we realised that we needed a bigger facility and put up a larger, modern kitchen,’’ says Mr. Quadeer. The Shaheen kitchen produces large quantities of breakfast items, including Idli Vada, bread and a meal pack that contains rice, roti, dal and curds.

16 May 2021||Bengaluru Bureau,KARNATAKA||Oxygen: Hospitals on edge||While trains carrying precious life-saving cargo are arriving in Karnataka, hospitals continue to struggle to meet the demand for oxygen. Over the past few days, the civic body has been fielding SOS calls from several hospitals in the city desperate for oxygen. At St. John’s Late Friday night, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) sent six tonnes of oxygen to St. John’s Hospital, which had over the past 10 days been stretched for oxygen supply. On Thursday, the hospital had 1,085 patients, but less than a day’s stock of oxygen. “We were desperate for oxygen supply on Friday night,” said a source. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that several hospitals have been sending out SOS messages on oxygen shortage. “We identified the issue in this case [St. John’s Hospital] and sorted it out by sending an oxygen tanker,” he said. According to Mr. Gupta, many other hospitals in the city are not in a position to store oxygen for more than four days. As a result, hospitals are being forced to mobilise all their contacts to ensure that patients do not suffer. Many hospitals regularly face stressful moments waiting for refills with only two or three hours of oxygen supply left, said H.M. Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA). Last week, another hospital in north Bengaluru almost ran out of oxygen supply and got a refill when they had only one hour of supply left. Smaller hospitals Mr. Prasanna said that small and medium scale hospitals, which are dependent on oxygen cylinders or liquid oxygen, are struggling. “There has been an eight-fold increase in demand for oxygen, but our regular suppliers are able to meet only 30% of our requirement,” he said. According to data provided by the State War Room, the consumption of oxygen on Friday was 828.45 MT across Karnataka. Bengaluru accounted for 285.43 MT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/oxygen-hospitals-on-edge/article34569647.ece
16 May 2021||Bengaluru/Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Shortage of drug for ‘black fungus’||While Karnataka is witnessing an increasing number of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases as a post-COVID-19 complication, there are complaints that medicines needed to treat the problem are hard to come by. While Bengaluru has seen close to 75 cases of black fungus over the last fortnight in various hospitals, six have emerged in Mysuru’s government hospital and one suspected case in Belagavi. The most commonly prescribed medicine for mucormycosis, Liposomal Amphotericin B, is in short supply in Karnataka. Trader and activist Sajjan Raj Mehta said there were nearly 20 patients in urgent need of the critical antifungal drug at the two healthcare facilities run by Jain International Trade Organisation in the city. “Last week, we procured 50 vials of an alternate antifungal drug from Hyderabad, which has also run out. One of my relatives is suffering from mucormycosis and needs to be administered this drug immediately. Any delay will worsen the situation. The government must immediately ensure this drug is available,” he said. Deputy Chief Minister Dr. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, heading the COVID-19 Task Force, conceded there was a shortage of the drug in Karnataka. “At present, we estimate about 400 cases per week. Based on this, we will write to the Union government to provide 20,000 vials as early as possible,” he said. In Mysuru, where two confirmed cases of the rare fungal infection had been reported at the State-run K.R. Hospital, doctors said the patients are being treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B, and added that the drug was not commonly available since the infection is rare. But, if more number of COVID-19 patients or those recovered from the infection contract mucormycosis, it will become tough to help them. “If the numbers go up, it becomes difficult to meet the demand since we do not have enough stock,” said Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj. He told The Hindu that the matter had been brought to the notice of competent authorities. Sources in the office of the Drug Controller in Bengaluru said Amphotericin ‘plain’ variant (not Liposomal Amphotericin B) was available in the open market. However, when one of the major drug distribution agencies was contacted, the response was: “None of the drugs are in stock.” A doctor in a private hospital said, “Drugs used in the treatment of rare fungal infections are expensive and are not commonly available. The government hospitals could be using drugs available in their stocks. The manufacture of such life-saving drugs will be ramped up in the light of more cases of mucormycosis.”  At present, we estimate about 400 cases per week. Based on this, we will write to the Union government to provide 20,000 vials as early as possible Dr. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Deputy Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shortage-of-drug-for-black-fungus/article34569643.ece
16 May 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||WFH woes: Techies wander in search of better connectivity||Hundreds of techies, who returned to their native places following the pandemic, are working from home amidst repeated call drops, dip in upload speed, and patchy network. While some roam around their homes holding laptops high up in search of better net connectivity, many are forced to shift to nearby cities to access high-speed broadband. Native places Following the increase in COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru, many employees returned to their native places as companies declared work-from-home. Those in cities can get broadband services offered by BSNL and private players. However, those in rural areas are dependent on cellular services. The towers installed by service providers remain mute due to disruption in power supply. The battery backup is insufficient to fulfil the need. “We have to constantly walk around the place to get hassle-free connectivity. Whenever we are on calls with clients or seniors in the office, calls drop. With hardly 1Mbps or 2Mbps speed, we cannot work and send files. The repeated disturbances have hampered our work,” said Shashank Subbaiah, who works for a financial holding company, from Kagodlu, about 10 kilometres from Madikeri in Kodagu district. He complained to the Deputy Commissioner and other officers, but services did not improve. Now, during his working hours, he reaches a homestay about five kilometres from his place and works there accessing a broadband Internet facility. Trouble with police “Because of the lockdown restrictions, travelling to my new workplace has become difficult. I have to convince policemen on the way,” he said. His cousin Ashik Aiyanna also works from home in the village. She sits outside her house with her laptop, as there is zero connectivity inside. A few employees, native of villages in Hassan taluk, are staying in Hassan as paying guests just for Internet connectivity. J. Shankar, who works from a farmhouse in Sagar taluk of Shivamogga, also faces a similar problem. He goes to Sagar when he faces network issues. “These days, Internet is essential for online classes, many surveys conducted by the government, and even to register for vaccination. If the government does not improve power supply and ensure proper Internet facility, it would be difficult to deliver many services to the needy,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/wfh-woes-techies-wander-in-search-of-better-connectivity/article34569660.ece
16 May 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Service providers face hurdles||The service providers are facing the heat with the increase in demand for quality Internet services. BSNL added 1,400 new broadband connections in Hassan town since the lockdown last year. Many private service providers are competing with the BSNL. However, none of them have improved services in rural areas. C. Nagesha, deputy general manager of BSNL in Hassan, told The Hindu that the BSNL was looking for franchisees in rural areas, who could invest in optical line terminals (OLTs) and provide services. “We have six franchisers in Hassan town. But there is poor response to take up franchisee in rural areas. They are also worried because if the customers terminate their subscription soon after the lockdown and return to big cities, they would lose revenue,” the officer said. As a result, customers in rural areas have to depend on cellular network. The private operators have a strong network with sufficient number of towers in urban localities, but not in rural areas. BSNL with better network infrastructure facilities faces difficulty to provide good service because of problems with power supply. “Rural areas do not get power supply for many hours in a day. Our batteries in the towers can provide backup only for a few hours,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/service-providers-face-hurdles/article34569659.ece
16 May 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||‘State government has not provided safety equipment for ASHAs’||The Karnataka State United Asha Workers’ Association has alleged that the State government did not provide safety equipment for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), who have been engaged in countering the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas. In a press release, association president Somashekhar Yadagiri and secretary D. Nagalakshmi, on Friday, said over 1,000 workers had been infected as they were forced to work without safety equipment. The workers had to visit infected people and check their oxygen level regularly. “The officers send them to houses of infected people with an oximeter. In many places, the workers were not provided with basic gloves, masks, and sanitisers. It is like sending soldiers to war without weapons,” the association said. During the second wave of the pandemic, nine ASHAs had died of the infection. Besides that, in each district, 20 to 40 if them had been infected. The government should pay a compensation of Rs. 25,000 each to the infected workers and the State government should pay an additional Rs. 5,000 monthly for the workers, the association demanded.

16 May 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Girls’ hostel of Taralabalu Mutt is now a COVID Care Centre||Taralabalu Mutt of Sirigere has converted the Taralabalu Girls’ Hostel in Davangere into a COVID Care Centre and on Saturday G.M. Siddeshwar, MP and former Union Minister, inaugurated it. Speaking to presspersons after the inauguration, Mr. Siddeshwar said that considering the surge in COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic, COVID Care Centres were being set up at various places in the district. When contacted, Shivamurthy Shivacharya Swami immediately consented to convert the hostel located on the Davangere-Shiramagondanahalli route into one such centre, he said. Mr. Siddeshwar said that the seer had not only provided the hostel for setting up the centre but also promised all necessary help in this regard. “Thirty rooms of the hostel have been converted into the centre now and each room has three beds taking the total number of beds available to 90,” he said. He said that the centre would have the best ambience with hot water, good quality food, and other amenities. He said that those under home isolation with only one bathroom and toilet should shift to COVID Care Centres as their stay at home would put the other family members at risk, he said. He said that this apart, other private hostels, BCM hostels, and marriage halls will also be converted into COVID Care Centres depending on the need. Mr. Siddeshwar said that a family trust set up in memory of his parents would set up two oxygen plants at Davangere and Jagalur. The 10 kl oxygen plant sanctioned by the Union government to be set up at a cost of Rs. 84 lakh would be commissioned in 20 days. Talks were also being held with Union Bank and Souharda Bank for procurement of oxygen concentrators, he said. S.A Ravindranath, MLA, said that while the government was making every effort to check the spread, citizens had a equal responsibility of following the lockdown guidelines and to cooperate.

It might be recalled that the degree examinations of first, third, and fifth semesters of the university were postponed following the second wave of the pandemic. As per the circular issued on May 7, the university has decided to begin online classes for even semesters (second, fourth, and sixth) and it has also announced the academic calendar, date for the beginning of the next academic year. Condemning the university’s move, students of the University from Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag, and Uttara Kannada took part in the online protest organised by AIDSO recently and demanded that the university should not begin classes for the next semesters without clarifying its stand on the examinations of the previous semesters. The protesting students said that there was lot of confusion with regard to the degree examinations, as the lockdown had been announced before the conduct of the examinations. They said that when the examinations of the previous semesters were not conducted and no decision had been taken yet on whether the examinations would be conducted or they would be promoted to next semesters, beginning online classes for the next semesters would only further add to the confusion. Some of the students said during the online protest that it would put them in dilemma about whether they should study for the previous semester’s examination or attend the classes for the next semester. The students sent mass emails to the Vice-Chancellor of the university and the Higher Education Minister seeking fulfilment of their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kuds-move-to-start-classes-for-even-semesters-slammed/article34569718.ece

Mr. Reddy said that the free meal service was started on a call given by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to its cadre to reach out to people affected with COVID in whatever way they could. Meals would continue till lockdown is lifted in the State. The Congress MP said that people coming from all over the State and also neighbouring States did not have access to food as the food joints are closed due to the lockdown. “The government has not come to the help of people in distress even during the first phase of lockdown last year and I do not expect it to do so now,” he said. He alleged that Youth Congress workers reaching out to the needy in these turbulent times were being harassed by the police instead of extending cooperation. “The government is worried that its failures are being exposed by the Congress and that is the reason for the ‘witch-hunt’”, he sid. The Telangana Task Force committee on COVID was formed recently but consists of all the yes men of the government rather than experts from medical, research, technology and management fields, who can draw a good strategy on supply of vaccines and medicines, and suggest methods for implementation of their ideas for faster relief on shortage of oxygen and beds, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/free-meal-service/article34569649.ece

Talking to reporters, Mr. D’Souza said the Central and the State governments should focus on vaccination, which was the important part of breaking the chain of transmission of COVID-19. The State Congress has decided to donate Rs. 100 crore towards the cost of procuring vaccine. Mr. D’Souza said it was sad that some BJP leaders of the State were commenting against High Court and Supreme Court judges, who were guiding the governments in COVID-19 management. “By doing so, the BJP has lost the faith of people,” he said. It was strange to see the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on issues concerning COVID-19 control, he said. While favouring complete lockdown as the number of COVID-19 positive cases was increasing in the State, Mr. D’Souza said the State government has failed in earnestly addressing concerns regarding shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir, and beds. The Governor should intervene at the earliest and dismiss the government for its mismanagement of COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/provide-vaccine-for-all-at-the-earliest-dsouza/article34569715.ece
16 May 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Call to relax cut-off age for post of constables||Many callers to Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar, during his live interaction on local radio channel Sarang FM on Saturday, demanded relaxation in the cut-off age for the post of police constables in light of delay in issuance of notification for the post because of lockdown. Shashi, a local caller, said he wanted to serve in the police force and he wanted to apply in April when the notification was normally issued. “With the delay in issuance of the notification in light of lockdown, I have crossed the cut-off age (of 24) and hence am disqualified. I want the department to relax the cut-off age,” he said. Making the same demand, another caller from Tumakuru said the State government has relaxed the cut-off age for the post of sub=inspector. Two more callers made the same demand. Mr. Kumar said recruitment was being done by the Karnataka State Police at a greater pace and this process has been affected following restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Relaxation of cut off age is a policy decision. I will convey your feelings to our senior officers,” he said. When a caller questioned the rationale of keeping temples and other places of worship closed and allowing liquor shops to sell over the counter between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., Mr. Kumar said it was decision of the government and they were just enforcing it. “People should understand that government needs revenue to provide free treatment and also run welfare schemes. Excise tax forms a major part of the revenue,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/call-to-relax-cut-off-age-for-post-of-constables/article34569719.ece

Superintendent of Mysuru Central jail Divyashree said the infection had been noticed among new admissions and patients returning from hospitals after treatment of other ailments. Hence, the jail authorities have now created a separate quarantine facility, where new admissions and patients returning from hospitals will be kept till RTPCR test shows negative. “Only if they test negative, we will send them to barracks,” she said.

Mysuru jail has about 800 inmates, including over 500 convicts. While undertrials will have to be released on interim bails, the convicts will be released on parole for two months as per the guidelines. “We released 22 on Friday and the process of releasing more is underway,” Ms. Divyashree said, adding that the jail authorities will be releasing all the 66 inmates, who had been released last year in the first phase. To a question, she said all the inmates, who had been released last year in the first week of April 2020, had returned by the first week of June 2020, the time fixed for their surrender on conclusion of the parole. While all the 66 inmates, who had been released last year, will be released in the coming days, some more will be released in the second phase. The district-level committees comprising senior judges and police officials, besides the jail superintendent will draw up a list of more eligible inmates, which will be sent to the police officials of districts from where the inmates hail.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘MLAs want to take control of civic functions’||Former councillors and civic experts are up in arms over the Karnataka government’s proposal to divest the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) of health management, pointing out that it goes against the spirit of the 74th amendment of the Constitution. Questions have been raised about the timing of the decision. Former Opposition Leader M. Shivaraju accused the State government of reducing the powers of the local body. “With the pandemic in full force, health management should be decentralised. A step in this direction was taken with the constitution of Ward Decentralised Triage and Emergency Response (DETER) Committee for COVID-19 management. But the government’s latest proposal only shows that it wants to have complete control over everything,” he said. The government has mooted the idea of handing over health management to a parastatal, the Bengaluru Health Directorate, which will be constituted under the Department of Health and Family Welfare. The move comes close on the heels of another parastatal being constituted for solid waste management. “Parastatals are not held accountable to the people, creating governance issues in the city. The State executive is continuously encroaching upon civic functions in the city,” said N.S. Mukunda of Bengaluru Praja Vedike. He pointed out that in the absence of an elected body, the MLAs seem to be chipping away at the functions of the corporation. V. Ravichandar, former member of BBMP Restructuring Committee, said contrary to popularly held notions, the quality of administration and equitability of access increases only through decentralisation and not through central command. “Mumbai has beaten the second wave of COVID-19 through the civic body and ward level decentralisation. After a long civic movement of over two decades, we now have ward committees, which will be rendered toothless if the corporation is stripped of all its obligatory functions,” he said. Mathew Idiculla, an advocate of urban issues, said, “This has been a trend in the city starting with formation of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) in 1964, taking away water, also an obligatory function, from the civic body. But that was before the 74th amendment.”  Parastatals are not held accountable to the people. The State executive is continuously encroaching upon civic functions in the city N.S.

They chased the dogs away. A few hours later, her body was discovered. “The woman, estimated to be around 60 years, was very frail and weak. She was a homeless person. She was probably sleeping near an under-construction building. She is yet to be identified,” said a senior police official. “The dogs seem to have bitten her at multiple places, killed her and eaten some parts of the body.” There are garbage mounds in vacant sites nearby, which attract dogs. Police suspect that they may have been starving due to the lockdown, pushing them to aggressive behaviour. Dr. Parviz Ahmed Piran, CEO, Vet Society for Animal Welfare and Rural Development, and a former Joint Director, Animal Husbandry in BBMP, said dogs are pushed to such aggressive behaviour only when facing starvation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stray-dogs-suspected-of-killing-homeless-woman/article34569640.ece

A committee will look into the technicalities and submit a report when the task force meets next. “Healthcare in the city has been found wanting during the pandemic. We propose to build a 100-bed hi-tech hospital in every Assembly segment and a super-speciality hospital for every four Assembly segments. There are many agencies carrying out public health functions in the city. The new directorate will bring them all under one umbrella,” saidMr. Narayan. The proposal to divest the BBMP of public health, an obligatory function of local self-governments under the 74th amendment of the Constitution, has drawn the ire of several citizen groups. It was only recently that the State government announced its intention to decentralise the fight against the pandemic and empower wards, on the lines of the Kerala and Mumbai models. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said it was not for him to speak about the proposal, as he was not at the task force meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bbmp-may-be-relieved-of-health-duties/article34569636.ece

16 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Chellanam continues to reel under heavy rain, flooding||Nearly 250 people from over 60 families have been shifted to four relief camps in the coastal village of Chellanam as flooding caused houses and compound walls to collapse and hampered rescue operations as the Fort Kochi-Cherthala road went under water. Figures from the district administration stated that the first camp to be opened at St. Xavier’s Public School, Kandakkadavu had 148 people from 45 families, while the St. Mary’s High School camp had provided shelter to 39 people from 14 families in Chellanam. At the same time, two camps at Chinmaya Vidyalaya (quarantine centre) and SDPY Central School, Kalathara, Palluruthy, had sheltered 42 people from 12 families. The people have been shifted to the camps from the Kannamali area of Chellanam panchayat. The coastal village continued to reel under heavy rains, high waves, and flooding on Saturday. Residents said the situation had eased a little on Saturday morning. But the high tide invaded the shores much before the expected time of 2 p.m., said Father Dani Anthony, a Catholic priest who runs a charitable institution in the village. A dozen houses were fully or partially flooded in Kandakkadavu, and more than a score of houses were under threat in Maruvakkad and Bazaar areas where the seawall had collapsed, said Joseph Arakkal of Chellanam-Kochi Janakiya Vedhi. K.J. Maxi, MLA, said the situation was grim. He visited most of the areas on Saturday afternoon and made sure that food and drinking water reached camps and homes. He said rescue operations were being coordinated by the district authority, and he was aware of actions being taken to lessen the hardship of the people. Asin George from Kandakkadavu said that his house was located on a higher plain but waters had reached the courtyard even as those residing at a lower level had taken refuge on their terraces and roofs along with the elderly. The fear of COVID-19 was keeping people from going to rescue camps, he added. P.A. Charles, a resident of South Chellanam, said Maruvakkad and Chalakkadavu, and areas north of those places were the worst-affected. He said the area where he lived, Malikapparambu, close to the Chellanam mini fishing harbour, was not experiencing flooding directly from the sea but drains and canals were flooded and water was flowing up to the residential areas along them. The fresh bout of flooding claimed its first victim on Friday evening when V.V. Antony Valiyaparambil fell into the floodwaters and was carried away while trying to put up barriers as waters rushed into his residential premises. Navy support Three diving teams from Southern Naval Command (SNC) and a Quick Reaction Team from INS Dronacharya swung into action on Saturday to provide assistance to the flood-hit villages of Malaghapady, Companypadi, and Maruvakkad in Chellanam panchayat. They braved harsh weather conditions to undertake rescue and relief, provide food and water, and shift people trapped in houses to the relief camp at St. Mary’s High School, said a Navy release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chellanam-continues-to-reel-under-heavy-rain-flooding/article34569838.ece
16 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rain batters Ernakulam||Even as the lull in rainfall since Saturday morning in Ernakulam district lessened water levels in flooded areas, a 100-horsepower pump from Aroor was deployed in severely-flooded areas and in Mullassery Canal that overflowed its banks, to pump out water. The high-power pump was initially deployed at Ambedkar Colony and Judges’ Avenue which were severely inundated. It was then put to use in Mullassery Canal to pump water into the backwaters, said Mayor M. Anilkumar, who visited many of the flood-hit areas on Saturday. District Collector S. Suhas took initiative in arranging the high-capacity pump from Aroor that he had placed the order for when he was Collector of Alappuzha. It can pump out up to 10 lakh litres of water an hour. Smaller pumps were deployed in many other low-lying areas. Mr. Anilkumar attributed the surge in water level in the city during the past couple of days to intense rainfall and high tide. He was accompanied by Mr. Suhas, T.J. Vinod, MLA, standing committee chairpersons Sunitha Dixon and P.R. Renish, division councillors, and engineers of the civic body. The Mayor said a 24-hour control room manned by engineers and health inspectors had been readied to avert flooding, especially in view of the pandemic situation. A total of 279 men, 273 women, and 101 children are in relief camps in the district. In the meantime, a food distribution initiative of the civic agency was inaugurated by P. Rajeev, MLA-designate. Nanma Foundation, an NGO founded by P. Vijayan, Inspector General of Police, also organised a food distribution programme to provide food to workers from other States and street dwellers at Kadavanthra and Panampilly Nagar and also to deserving people at Udaya Colony and Kammattipadam. Residents complain People living in the vicinity of the proposed metro station at Thripunithura sought a revisit of the social-impact-assessment report of the Kochi metro’s Thripunithura extension, for what they termed as unusual flooding of the area that was once a wetland. Power outage Power outage was reported in many areas in the morning, as KSEB personnel mended broken powerlines and a few posts which got uprooted in Friday’s intense wind and rainfall and trees that fell on the lines. The water level in reservoirs which was nearing the floodwater level due to heavy downpour since Thursday marginally declined. Sources in the Fire and Rescue Services Department said a fisherman, Antappan of Kollam, in a country boat was reported missing after it overturned near Goshree bridge on Saturday morning. Police sources said no major untoward incident following inclement weather was reported in the city and Ernakulam Rural.

The average monthly generation increased to 139 tonnes per day in April from 75 tonnes in March. As on May 10, the corresponding figure was 203 tonnes per day. “Peak generation of about 250 tonnes per day was reported on May 10. The earlier peak in the year 2020 was in the range of 180 to 220 tonnes per day,” as per the estimates by the CPCB. Proper segregation Despite the spike in the number of patients, there was no proportional growth in the quantity of COVID-related biomedical waste generated owing to the proper segregation of waste. Unlike last year, hospitals and isolation wards were not mixing food waste with COVID-waste according to a feedback from the Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facilities across the country, it said. Of the estimated total of average 203 tonnes per day of waste in May, Kerala accounted for an average 23.71 tonnes per day. Gujarat recorded a daily generation of 21.98 tonnes followed by Maharashtra (19.02 tonnes) and Delhi (18.79 tonnes).

Peethambaran removing Razaq Moulavi as general secretary of the party citing indiscipline. Soon after the Assembly elections, Mr. Peethambaran made a statement that smacked of a soft stance towards Mani C. Kappan, who left the party and the LDF to contest and win the Pala Assembly seat. He asked the party to ask itself if it was right to cause the exit of Mr. Kappan from the front ahead of the polls. Mr. Moulavi criticised the statement terming it as Mr. Peethambaran’s ‘personal opinion’ and invited a ‘show cause’ notice against him. Talking to The Hindu , Mr. Peethambaran said Mr. Moulavi had not responded to the show cause notice, which resulted in his removal from the post. Response mailed But Mr. Moulavi said he had mailed a detailed response and sent the same by registered post as well. “It surprises me that such a senior leader should take action even before going through my response,” Mr. Moulavi said. Meanwhile, party sources said there is more to the removal than meets the eye. “Mr. Moulavi is a close associate of P.P. Saseendran, who is vying for the sole ministerial berth allocated to the party with Thomas K. Thomas, MLA-elect from Kuttanad, who enjoys the backing of Mr. Peethambaran. There is also a move being made by Mr. Saseendran to get P.C. Chacko, new entrant to the party, elected as State president,” said a leader. While a final decision on ministerial berth will only be taken on May 18, at the meeting of State office-bearers and central executive working committee members in the presence of Praful Patel, MP, many believe that Mr. Thomas has a good chance of landing ministership this time around.

A native of Bharathannur in Thiruvananthapuram, he succumbed to lung cancer in the early hours of Saturday at the MVR Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Kozhikode. Nandu was hugely popular on social media through his messages telling cancer patients never to lose heart. He was diagnosed with cancer on an April 1 three years ago. Nandu had just begun involving in his family’s catering business after completing BBA when the biopsy report came in. Though he was initially taken aback, Nandu decided to fight it out. What began as a swelling on his left leg turned out to be bone cancer, said a media report on him published some time ago. Nandu began collecting information about cancer from doctors and other sources. What he later wrote on Facebook was liked by over a lakh-and-a-half people - “I have cancer. I will not treat this as a terrible disease. Will treat it as common cold.” Despite many people advising against publicising his health condition, Nandu kept on talking about it. Even after starting radiation therapy at the Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, the pain in left leg became unbearable and it had to be amputated. Nandu began regularly posting on social media when he was taking rest at home after treatment. Starts Athijeevanam He connected with many people who survived cancer and others who were battling the disease. Thus began the collective titled ‘Athijeevanam’, which helps cancer patients across the State. He used to get around a dozen calls a day. In the meantime, his songs started attracting lakhs of viewers on YouTube.  ‘Cancer challenge’ Most of videos went viral. When ‘10-year-challenge’ became popular on social media, he had come with a ‘cancer challenge’. His pictures before and after treatment were shared. Many people took up the challenge. When reports on his death came in, many took to the social media to offer condolences. They include filmmaker Arun Gopy and lyricist Rajeev Alumkal.

A circular, issued by Mar Theodosius Mar Thoma Metropolitan, head of the Thiruvalla-headquartered Church, has directed all congregations to open emergency treatment centres for COVID-19 patients in consultation with the respective vicars, administrative councils and executive committees. It further suggests constitution of volunteer groups in each of the parishes, which will prepare a list of people under treatment and in quarantine to ensure medical support and food supply. “These groups should also work towards ensuring the funeral of the people dying of the pandemic. It will be ideal if they could take care of the patients who are elderly and live in solitude,” read the circular. The functioning of each of these groups, comprising healthcare experts, will be coordinated by the office-bearers of the Mar Thoma Yuvajana Sakhyam. They are also required to coordinate with hospitals and other institutions of the Church for availing ambulances. To ensure adequate stock of medical kit for each of the congregations, the Metropolitan also suggested that economically sound parishes and individuals make generous contributions. “To the parishes that are economically backward, medical kits should be delivered free of cost by the episcopa of the diocese concerned,” he added. The circular further calls for formulation of helplines comprising expert medical professionals under the respective diocesan bishops, which will coordinate the functioning of the volunteer groups, besides offering directions to the group members in cases of emergency. Confirming the move, Fr. K.G. Joseph, Church secretary, said the programme aimed to turn the parishes as a point of contact between healthcare officials and marginalised communities. As per estimates, the Mar Thoma Church has over 1,000 congregations under it in Kerala alone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mar-thoma-church-to-help-covid-19-patients/article34569580.ece

The test positivity rate (TPR) on Saturday stood at 26.65%. The slight decline in daily case numbers over the past three days, with the State on a lockdown and the TPR appearing to stabilise around 28%, has prompted many to speculate whether the State has scaled the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. While it may be too early to assume so, the fact that the State’s active case pool and hospital admissions are continuing to rise is a cause for concern.  Active case pool The State’s active case pool, which had 4,42,194 patients on Friday, rose to 4,45,334 on Saturday. The number of COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals across the State is 37,067, with 3,974 persons newly admitted on Saturday. A total of 3,622 persons are occupying ICUs in public and private hospitals across the State, while 1,465 COVID patients are on ventilator support. Meanwhile, the State reported 29,442 recoveries on Saturday. At present, a total of 9,94,204 persons are undergoing home or institutional isolation. On Saturday, the State reported 96 deaths, taking the cumulative COVID-19 fatalities since the pandemic began to 6,339. However, these are deaths that occurred over the past few days. The State’s cumulative case burden since the pandemic began, now stands at 21,18, 263 cases. Ernakulam continues to have the highest number of active cases with 69,835. However, Thiruvananthapuram, with 45,290 active cases, has the highest number of hospitalisations at 5,580.

16 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Focus on One Health approach: Gurukkal||Kerala State Higher Education Council vice chairperson P.M. Rajan Gurukkal has urged universities to align their academic programmes with the One Health approach. The multi-sectoral concept, which has gained traction in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of other zoonotic diseases to global health, involves a scientific study of human-animal-environmental interactions. Immense significance The approach came into public discourse after its presentation in the Tripartite Zoonoses Guide (TZG) that was jointly developed by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2019. Prof. Gurukkal finds immense significance for the notion at a time when Kerala is going through a grim COVID-19 scenario with the State government enforcing a lockdown to rein in the pandemic. A few years ago, the State had battled a Nipah virus outbreak whose origin was traced to infected fruit bats in Kozhikode. Student orientation The academician also felt that universities and research institutions ought to orient their graduates to human-animal-environmental interactions and consequences harming one another. Powerful drivers like climate change, population growth, land diversion, deforestation, and environmental alterations lead to volatility among humans, animals, and microbes. This predicament could generate a zoonoses vector ecology, he cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/focus-on-one-health-approach-gurukkal/article34569854.ece

Workers at the crematoriums in the city say they have never seen such a demand for funerals in the past. “For several months, I have been staying away from my parents. It is tough to live in PPE kits. But we have no other option to manage the crisis” says Mr. Sibil. In Kochi In recent days, the Kochi Corporation has had to handle a maximum of 19 bodies a day at the eight crematoriums under the civic body. “It was on Monday that we had the highest number after the second wave,” says T.K. Ashraf, chairman of the health standing committee. “But we could manage the situation as the cremation was held at various units,” he adds. The Corporation has stepped up arrangements to avoid any delay in the conduct of the funeral rites. “We do not have gas furnaces in these eight facilities. The bodies were cremated using wood,” says Mr. Ashraf. Despite the increase in pandemic deaths, the crematoriums in Kochi city have not yet faced any major stress. “We are managing with the available facilities,” pointed out M. Anilkumar, Mayor. Siyad Kokker, president of the mahal committee at the Central Juma Masjid, said: “After the pandemic situation took a turn for the worse, at least two bodies are buried daily at the burial ground of the Central Juma Masjid. However, the mahal committees are not facing any stress as we have at least 12 mosques within the city limits having burial grounds.” Additional measures The alarming rise in daily deaths during the COVID-19 second wave has prompted the Thiruvananthapuram district administration to avert a potential crisis by roping in crematoriums run by community organisations and directing public crematoriums to be open round the clock.  In the past 10 days alone, the district had reported 167 deaths due to COVID-19. On May 11, District Collector Navjot Khosa directed public crematoriums in the district to be open 24 hours.  Most deaths in capital With 1,166 deaths till Wednesday, Thiruvananthapuram also tops the COVID-19 death toll among Kerala districts. But the district is still far from a crisis situation, say crematorium operators. Santhikavadam at Thycaud, the lone facility run by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, handles approximately 30-32 bodies daily. “Nearly 99% of the cremations held here now are of COVID-19 deaths,” says S.S. Sujith, charge officer of the crematorium. Non-COVID deaths are redirected to private cremation grounds. In the last week of April, the crematorium added two gas furnaces to complement its two electric furnaces and four units which use wood. Given the increase in cremations, arrangements have been made with Mokshakavadam, the crematorium run by the SNDP Yogam at Muttathara, and the cremation facility of the Vellala community at Thycaud.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/testing-time-for-crematoriums-in-state/article34570065.ece

Subbarayudu succumbed to COVID late on Friday night, while being shifted from a private hospital in the city to the Super Speciality Hospital for an ICU bed. He was 58 and is survived by wife, two daughters and a son. Subbarayudu, who was instrumental in the operation of South India’s first Kisan Rail from Anantapur to Delhi last year, was overseeing the transport of 4.5 tonnes of mangoes to Delhi via Doodh Duronto Express earlier this week. He was also a COVID Nodal Officer and monitored flying squads on private hospitals. He had complained of fever on Tuesday, but did not suspect it to be COVID and attributed it to work pressure. While he had no other symptoms, his health deteriorated on Friday morning all of a sudden and was admitted to a private hospital in the city. When his oxygen saturation level dropped to 60%, he was taken to the Super Speciality Hospital for an ICU bed. But by the time he was brought there, he was declared dead. Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy mourned the death of Subbarayudu and said he was a reliable officer who did his best to help farmers in the district.

16 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kin shying way from funerals even in case of natural deaths||The sharp spike of in the number of deaths due to coronavirus during the second wave of the pandemic is causing a fear psychosis among people of Chittoor district. The fear of contracting the infection is so palpable that the relatives and family members are shying away from the funerals of the people who die of natural causes, or other ailments. Data available with the officials suggest that 172 people died of the virus in the district in the last one month (from April 13 to May 13). The virus has claimed 1,068 lives so far, the highest among all districts in the State. The district has reported 52,804 infections in the last one month. However, sources say that the counts will be more than the official figures. Unclaimed bodies More than 2,000 casualties took place in the district hospital alone during the second wave. “During the last one year, our men cremated 136 unclaimed bodies in a forest location on the Chittoor outskirts. We are getting about 10 bodies daily, of which five are being claimed by the family members at best,” says K. Chinnaiah, Sanitary Inspector of Chittoor Municipal Corporation. In Madanapalle, all the five burial grounds are getting a steady flow of bodies. “We have information that the number of bodies of COVID patients going up. Those come either from hospitals or individual houses remains a dozen. This is in addition to the deaths due to other ailments and old age,” says S. Swathi, whose NGO Dhathree Foundation is extending COVID relief to families in and around Madanapalle. A police officer in Chittoor says that conducting the last rites of COVID patients has become too costly. “If a COVID patient dies in a hospital, the cost of performing the last rites—from receiving the body to completion of funeral—costs around Rs. 50,000. Private vehicles that were charging a few thousands for shifting the body for a distance of 40 kms are now demanding somewhere between Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 20,000. The grave diggers have also jacked up their charges, citing the risk of infection. That’s why the poor and lower middle class people are preferring not to claim the bodies,” he explains. A 75-year-old woman died of natural causes in Puttur rural area a few days ago. “We had a harrowing time to arrange a freezer box. We ended paying triple the normal charge. The grave diggers demanded four times what they used charge earlier. We performed the final rites at our fields,” says the son of the deceased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kin-shying-way-from-funerals-even-in-case-of-natural-deaths/article34570108.ece
16 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fear of lone jumbo grips villagers near Puttur||A full-grown male elephant, which got separated from the three-member “bachelor’s group” last month, has been creating a flutter, raiding mango orchards and vegetable plantations in several villages alongside the Chennai National Highway in Narayanavanam mandal, 80 km from here. According to information, the lone elephant, which is currently on the prowl between Govindappa Naidu Kandriga village and the waterfalls at Kailasanatha Kona, is frequenting the mango orchards. From Friday night till early hours of Saturday, the pachyderm had a free run in the fields, and reportedly tried to attack a farmer, who luckily escaped. The villagers say the presence of a wild elephant was a strange in Narayanavanam mandal as the terrain’s poor forest cover would not support the fodder for the animal. They said that after a three-member herd of wild elephants from Tamil Nadu marched its way to the plain areas four months ago, the forest officials had not initiated any concrete steps to drive away the animals back into their original habitat in Tamil Nadu. They said that except for temporarily driving away the animals into the hillocks with poor vegetation, the forest personnel had not found a permanent solution to the menace. “Due to the ongoinsg COVID lockdown, the movement of public is considerably thin in the area. Once the lockdown is over, the presence of the lone elephant would surely turn into a bigger problem,” a forest watcher said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fear-of-lone-jumbo-grips-villagers-near-puttur/article34570115.ece

16 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three held, red sanders logs seized||The Andhra Pradesh State Anti-Red Sanders Smuggling Task Force personnel on Saturday nabbed three youth and seized two red sanders logs, two cars and a motorcycle at Anjaneyapuram forest check-post between Renigunta and Railway Kodur. According to the task force officials, a combing party was conducting checks at the forest ghat section, when they reportedly spotted a motorbike-borne youth acting as a pilot, trailed by two cars proceeding towards Renigunta. When the task force personnel tried to intercept the vehicles, the accused tried to flee from the check-post but were overpowered, and three youth were nabbed. Two red sanders logs were seized from one of the cars. The accused were identified as K.V. Karthik of Renigunta mandal, M. Sasikumar of Papanaidupeta in Yerpedu mandal, and Challa Balaji of Gudimallam villag. The trio allegedly confessed to the police that they worked for a couple of red sanders smuggling operatives in Chittoor district, by transporting the logs to Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-held-red-sanders-logs-seized/article34569624.ece
16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pandemic hits construction of new Secretariat in Hyd.||The coronavirus pandemic has had its impact on the ongoing construction of the new integrated Secretariat complex. A section of the labour force engaged in the construction works contracted COVID and was quarantined while another chunk of workers left the work place amid fears of surge in the number of cases in the second wave, which was felt since March this year. Less than 200 working As against 1,000 workers engaged in the works on a daily basis, less than 200 are working at present, thus slowing down the entire construction process. “Works have been slowed down since the onset of the second wave of COVID. Even those engaged now are working under fear of contracting the virus,” a senior official said adding steps were taken to administer the first dose of the vaccine to those engaged in the works. According to officials, more than 100 workers were immobilised because of the virus while several others left the work place citing domestic and other problems. As a result, labour intensive brick work and other components of the construction suffered a setback while there was also shortage of fabricators, carpenters and others that would be engaged in centring works. Razing last July Razing of the old Secretariat started in July last year and completed by October and the possession of the more than 25-acre sprawling site had been handed over to construction major Shapoorji Pallonji group, which won the contract for constructing the integrated complex in November. Completion of ground levelling and commencement of basement work took some time and the main works commenced early this year with accommodation and other facilities for workers arranged at the work site itself. Deadline The contractor was given a deadline of one year from the day of handing over the site in November third week for the completion of construction of the integrated complex. Given the uncertainty prevailing over the situation coming back to normalcy, there is all likelihood of works not getting completed before the deadline. According to the designs approved by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the seven-storey integrated Secretariat complex with close to 7 lakh sq. ft area would be spread over an area of 600 ft x 300 ft building coverage amounting to 9.7% of the 25.5 acre land. The ground works related to the basement had been completed to date and now, works on basement slab had commenced on Friday. “It will take roughly about 30 hours to complete 20% of the basement slab of the new Secretariat complex,” the official told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-hits-construction-of-new-secretariat-in-hyderabad/article34569577.ece

16 May 2021||Mangaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cyclone hits Karnataka coastal areas||Cyclone Tauktae hit the Karnataka coast on Friday night bringing in heavy rain with gusty winds that caused massive sea erosion, damaged some houses, and inundated residential localities. The cyclone however, did not cause extensive damage as predicted by the administration. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi received over 100 mm average rainfall since Friday midnight even as it continued to pour beyond Saturday evening. Several houses were damaged on account of landslip in Monkeystand, Padil, Bajal, Kavubail, Pragathinagara, and surrounding areas in Mangaluru. Mayor Premanand Shetty visited these localities and asked officials to assess damage. The Uchchila Kudru (river island), surrounded by Talapady and Uchchila rivulets on three sides and Mangaluru-Shoranur Railway line on one side, was flooded with water entering several houses in the locality. Local youth joined hands with the revenue authorities to shift affected residents to safer places. The administration was unable to cut open the sand dunes at Batpady Beach to let out water from rivulets as the raging Arabian Sea came to the level of rivulets, said Yakub Batpady. Extensive erosion was witnessed around Someshwara while the Hindu Rudrabhoomi land was washed away besides hundreds of coconut trees being uprooted. Ullal stretch too witnessed raging waves and erosion. Kulai, Surathkal, Mukka, and Sasihithlu beach stretches north of Mangaluru too witnessed erosion even as the waves consumed major portion of the Sasihithlu-Munda beach, the international surfing venue and damaged structures. Waves reached up to 4.2m height across the coast even as fishermen did not venture out while those who had gone to fishing were sent back by the Indian Coast Guard and Coastal Security Personnel ahead of the cyclone hitting the coast. Though the Dakshina Kannada district administration had removed the weekend curfew aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19, people found it difficult to buy the essentials before 9 a.m. amid the pounding rain. India Meteorological Department has said coastal Karnataka and adjoining Ghat districts would continue to receive moderate to heavy rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places on Saturday and Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cyclone-hits-karnataka-coastal-areas/article34569581.ece

16 May 2021||NELLORE/ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Prakasam adds 1,305 new infections, five deaths||As the coronavirus spread continues unabated in Nellore and Prakasam districts, 16 persons succumbed to COVID-19 and nearly 2,300 persons contracted the infection in a span of 24 hours. The number of active cases rose to a high of 36,468, including 18,540 in Prakasam district. The toll rose to 1,404 in the region as 11 patients in SPSR Nellore district and 5 in Praksam district died due to COVID. So far, 703 patients in SPSR Nellore district and 701 patients in Prakasam district had lost the battle against the disease. The overall coronavirus case tally crossed the 1.91 lakh-mark as 1,305 persons in Prakasam district and 985 persons in SPSR Nellore district tested positive for the disease, according to a health bulletin released by the State government on Saturday night. The number of fresh cases continued to outnumber recoveries by about 900 as only 1,396 patients, including 894 in SPSR Nellore district, recovered from the infection. Committee constituted COVID-19 Nodal Officer at Government General Hospital(Nellore) M. Narendra maintained that there was no shortage of oxygen. A committee had been constituted to constantly monitor oxygen supply and avoid wastage as about 1,000 patients were provided with oxygen therapy at any given point of time. Of the 17,928 active cases in Nellore, over 2,300 patients were being treated at GGH and other notified private hospitals, while 1,100 patients were taken care of at COVID-19 Care Centres set up across the district. Others were in home quarantine. In Prakasam’s Ongole, patients undergoing treatment at the GGH had a tough time as one technician shuttled among three COVID isolation wards to monitor supply of oxygen to 1,000-plus patients. ‘More nodal officers needed’ Right to Information Association State Working president G.Balakrishna demanded appointment of two more nodal officers to constantly monitor the condition of patients at the GGH. He said the government should step up supply of Remdesivir injection to stabilise health condition of critical patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/prakasam-adds-1305-new-infections-five-deaths/article34569626.ece
16 May 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Impressive show by SEZ in spite of pandemic||The building material Special Economic Zone in Prakasam district has logged an impressive performance in the just-concluded fiscal, successfully adapting itself to the new normal during the COVID-19 pandemic times. The SEZ exported processed natural stone material and artificial stone material worth Rs. 653 crore during 2020-21 against Rs. 446 crore the previous year, thanks to the rise in global demand for the products, sources in the APIIC said. ‘Policies hindering growth’ On the other hand, the import of capital goods during the period came down by 46% to Rs. 46 crore. The import of raw material for processing went up from Rs. 60 crore to Rs. 82 crore during the period. Artificial stone material accounted for the lion’s share of exports to the U.S. from the SEZ (53.7%) as the overseas players exhibited declining interest for natural stone material in the wake of uncertainty. The State government’s policies relating to royalty, dead rent, and galloping price of diesel were adversely affecting the growth of the sector, the sources said. The captains of industry and trade could not fully tap the export market for granite varieties, which included the world-famous black galaxy granite in and around Chimakurthy, due to acute labour shortage. The sector mainly depends upon the over one lakh strong migrant labourers from States such as Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. A majority of the workers have not returned despite improvement in the health situation after the first wave of COVID-19 subsided. The processing units catering to the domestic market are running only up to 50% of the production capacity now with the limited workforce. The second wave of COVID-19 threatens to disrupt the processing of granite for domestic consumption once again as the available workers long to return to their native places. “The migrant workers are longing to get back to their native place, fearing that the situation may worsen further in the wake of partial curfew,” Y. Koteswara Rao, a granite cutting and polishing unit owner, tells The Hindu at his unit at Pernamitta. “Our top priority is to get all workers vaccinated against the virus to execute the export orders as per schedule,” says M. Shivaram of the Jyothi Granite Exports, a leading player at the SEZ. Quarrying activity has slowed down in the wake of workers in and around Chimakurthy testing positive, according to M.A. Azeem of Shaheen Granites. The granite barons, who route their exports through the Krishnapatnam port, are also facing shortage of vessels. They want the authorities to make available vaccines to all workers above the age of 18 to break the chain of the fast-spreading mutant virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/impressive-show-by-sez-in-spite-of-pandemic/article34570117.ece
16 May 2021||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over 10,000 patients in home isolation in Srikakulam district||More than 10,000 COVID-19 patients have been in home isolation in Srikakulam district due to inadequate infrastructure in the government hospitals. Many patients of rural areas have been forced to stay in home isolation as they were unable to bear medical expenditure in private hospitals. According to the government data, 10,859 patients are in home isolation and 1,820 were admitted to hospitals and 828 have been put under observation in the COVID Care Centres. With the report of 695 new infections, the total number of active cases surged to 14,257 in the district. District Collector J. Nivas directed the officials to take up door-to-door fever survey in all the 38 mandals since many people were unable to come for tests in spite of having COVID symptoms. Meanwhile, people thronged vaccination centres in the district. However, a majority of them were forced to return due to lack of sufficient vaccine at the centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/over-10000-patients-in-home-isolation-in-srikakulam-district/article34570125.ece
16 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Heavy rain, strong winds lash parts of Kerala||Torrential rainfall and strong winds lashed Kerala districts on Saturday also under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae, causing extensive damage to crops and buildings and forcing district administrations to relocate more people to relief camps. As of Saturday, 2,094 people from 543 families had been evacuated to 71 camps opened in the State this month, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. Two people from Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts lost their lives in the rain havoc in the past two days. During the two days, the State recorded an average rainfall of 145.5 mm, while Kochi and Peermade stations recorded above 200 mm in a 24-hour period, Mr. Vijayan said, citing IMD data. Severe sea erosion persists in all the nine coastal districts, triggering a crisis. Seawalls cannot be viewed as the ultimate solution to sea erosion, the Chief Minister noted, stressing the importance of 'Punargeham,' the government project to resettle people residing within 50 metres of the tide zone. In Kozhikode district, 125 families were relocated from the coastal areas on Saturday. A majority of the evacuees moved to the homes of relatives. In Ernakulam district, nearly 250 people from over 60 families were shifted to four relief camps at Chellanam. Two more relief camps were opened at Thrikkunnapuzha and Arattuppuzha in Alappuzha district. Sea erosion is severe in the coastal stretches of Cherthala, Ambalappuzha, and Karthikappally taluks. The Irrigation Department opened the Thottappally 'pozhi' mouth to drain floodwaters from Kuttanad into the sea. The shutters of the Thanneermukkom bund also have been opened. In Thiruvananthapuram district, 1,128 people from 293 families were relocated to relief camps. The district also reported 11 houses as destroyed and 228 houses damaged in the rain havoc. As many as 144 houses have collapsed either partially or fully during the summer rains this year in Pathanamthitta. Of this, at least 30 houses were damaged in the past two days. The district also reported crop damage in 248 hectares. Low-lying areas of Kottayam municipality and adjoining villages of Kumarakom, Aymanaam and Arpookkara have been inundated by runoff water from the high ranges. Water level up in rivers Water levels have risen in the Meenachil, Pampa and Manimalayar rivers, although they are well within the danger mark. Several families were evacuated to safer locations in Kannur and Kasaragod districts also. Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has scrambled to repair overhead lines and poles damaged in the strong winds in several districts. With Cyclone Tauktae moving further north over the Arabian Sea, rainfall is likely to decrease over Kerala by Sunday, although most districts are likely to receive isolated heavy rainfall. Ernakulam, Idukki and Malappuram are on orange alert for isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall. The remaining 11 districts are on yellow alert for isolated heavy rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/heavy-rain-strong-winds-lash-parts-of-kerala/article34569587.ece
16 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala moves into total shutdown from tomorrow||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram districts will enter a highly restrictive “triple lockdown” phase midnight on May 17 to curb the rise in COVID-19 infections. The rest of the State would move into lockdown mode at the same time, he said. Mr. Vijayan said the triple lockdown entailed a three-fold clampdown on life, mobility, socialising, production, and retail business. The police would close all entry and exit points into the districts. There would be only one route for ingress and express. The government has suspended public transport and banned inessential travel. Autorickshaws and taxis would remain off the road. Citizens could hail them only in the event of a medical emergency or to travel to and from airports or railway stations. Passengers should carry proof of the reason for travel. People who assemble indoors or outdoors, violate the mask mandate, break physical distance rule or venture out of their homes without valid reason would risk prosecution and a hefty fine. No social gathering was allowed. The police have divided triple lockdown regions into zones for focused enforcement of the pandemic code. A senior officer would head each zone. Beat officers, patrol vans, motorbike squads, plainclothes officers, elected local body functionaries, civil defence volunteers and members of the neighbourhood watch would help the officer at the village and municipal ward level to ensure that people remained indoors and had help at hand in an emergency. Ward level committees Ward level committees would ensure that community kitchen and fair price hotels catered to families under lockdown. When pressed, Mr. Vijayan said there was no restriction on hotels and restaurants delivering food home. The government would issue a detailed order later. Agents should deliver milk and newspapers before 6 a.m. He said essential services had some leeway in timings. Medical stores and fuel bunks could open for business as usual. The government has banned all other retail trade. Bakery and provision stores could open on alternate days. Banks could open for business from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. Cooperative banks could open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Monday and Thursday. Air and rail travel was allowed. Government offices would remain closed. Domestic workers, home nurses and manual labourers should download an online pass on their mobile phone to travel to work. The government has allowed construction activity. The government would review the lockdown on May 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-moves-into-total-shutdown-from-tomorrow/article34569585.ece
16 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Take up patients’ cause with KCR’||APCC president S. Sailajanath on Saturday criticised Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for “not taking up with his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao the issue of denial of entry to ambulances at the A.P.-Telangana border.” In a statement, Dr. Sailajanath said that while COVID-19 patients were being stopped at the border and denied admission to hospitals in Hyderabad, the Chief Minister did not think it necessary to sort out the issue by taking it up with Mr. Rao. He demanded that the government set up temporary 1,000-bed hospitals in places such as Vijayawada, Rajamahendravaram, Visakhapatnam, Guntur, Tirupati, Kurnool and Anantapur, and prevent death of COVID-19 patients at the border. Mr. Sailajanath said the government should leave everything else aside and completely focus on ramping up the facilities for proper treatment of people who had contracted the virus. Financial help “A large sections of people are selling their properties to meet the COVID-19 treatment expenses,” the Congress leader said, and asked the government to release an immediate financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 to the kin of those who had tested positive and bear the treatment expenses of people who were undergoing treatment in private hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/take-up-patients-cause-with-kcr/article34570118.ece
16 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State’s growth rate may turn negative, cautions Yanamala||Former Finance Minister and TDP polit bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Saturday expressed serious concern over what he called ‘retrogressive policies of the YSRCP government which are pushing the State into a deep economic crisis’. In a statement, he said the growth rate in the State had dipped to an alarming 0.3% during 2021-22 due to the incoherent policies being implemented. “The Jagan government has caused far greater damage to the State’s economy than the COVID-19,” he alleged. He said last year, during the first wave of the pandemic, the growth rate nosedived to 4.3% mainly because of the severe impact of the lockdown, which had only added to the financial woes of the State already reeling under a financial crisis. “But the situation is even more precarious now and the State may witness a negative growth during the second wave,” he cautioned. Mr. Ramakrishnudu accused the government of neglecting the industry and ignoring the manufacturing sector. “The prevailing climate in the State is not industry-friendly, with the ruling party MPs and leaders issuing threats to the managements of companies. There is no attempt to attract investments,” he charged, adding that the unemployment rate, which had reached 10%, might soon climb to 20%. The TDP leader said development had come to a standstill, contributing to the problem of unemployment. Migrant workers had no work and were on the verge of starvation and productivity was at its lowest, signs that the State might soon slip into a negative growth mode. Accusing the government of projecting false figures in the proposed 2021-22 Budget in an attempt to protect its image, he said it would not help in any way to set right the State’s economy. He said excessive loans, revenue deficit and financial mismanagement were the only ‘achievements’ of the YSRCP government in the last two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-growth-rate-may-turn-negative-cautions-yanamala/article34570120.ece

16 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bodies arriving at Vizag crematorium contradict official death count||Chavulamadum, the century-old main crematorium located beside the St. Joseph College for Women in the heart of the city, nowadays wears a different look from what it was just two months ago or before the city was hit by the second wave of COVID-19. The road leading to the crematorium is lined up with 15 to 20 ambulances during any part of the day, which suggests that they are all carrying bodies that are awaiting the final rites. Inside, there are four or five altars where the funeral pyres used to be lit. But now, almost the entire open land, apart from the altars, is covered with thick ash left from burning pyres. “The demand is so high that we have to light the pyres in open spaces,” says a worker at the crematorium. As per the workers, in the last two days they have cremated about 259 bodies, which indicates that bodies are piling up at Chavulamadum in the pandemic second wave, though there is no official confirmation of it. Local residents complain On the other hand, the residents of Gnanapuram, where the crematorium is located, are up in arms against the GVMC and have been suggesting the distribution of bodies to other crematoria citing smoke and fine ash pollution resulting from the burning of bodies beyond its capacity. “Though we did not count the bodies, we saw a huge rush of ambulances in the last two days. In fact, over the past 15 to 20 days we have been witnessing the burning of at least 60 to 70 bodies in the traditional way and at least 10 in the electric crematorium,” says K. Purnima, the Corporator of Ward 44 comprising Gnanapuram. When asked whether the death count is being underplayed, as the official figure averages 9-11 deaths per day, the Health Department counters it by saying that the COVID-related deaths could be around 20 and it may add up to 30 with non-COVID deaths. However, a senior GVMC official has confirmed that the capacity of the crematorium is about 15 bodies per day, but it rarely exceeded 10 on normal days, before the pandemic. “So if normal deaths were 10 before the COVID-19, how can the number shoot up to 70 or 80, if people are not dying in the pandemic?” questions Joseph Betha, a senior advocate. Different tests According to a senior KGH doctor, a COVID-19 death is recorded only if an RT-PCR test was conducted and the patient was certified as positive. But currently in many hospitals, including private ones, COVID-19 patients are being diagnosed through the rapid antigen test or an HRCT scan. Death of such patients is not recorded under COVID death and hence the big difference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bodies-arriving-at-vizag-crematorium-contradict-official-death-count/article34570112.ece

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Amarnath said that Mr. Naidu should come out with some advice and suggestions to the State government, but not create panic among people with his statements. He accused Mr. Naidu of not taking up the issue of stopping ambulances of the State with Telangana Chief Minister K.

16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||NTPC proves Maharatna in deed, gets best care for COVID-hit staff||At a time when even the affluent sections are finding it difficult to get the best healthcare facilities and hankering for super speciality hospital beds amid the COVID-19 pandemic, public sector power major NTPC is throwing its weight behind its severely-infected employees by providing the best possible treatment. The simple fact that the Maharatna company has airlifted a dozen of its coronavirus-hit employees, including a couple of dependants, from across the country to Hyderabad and other places during the past one month and admitted them in corporate hospitals for better treatment indicates its commitment to the welfare of its workforce. “It needs more than the best HR (human resource) policy to support the staff battling the dreaded virus. The company has spent about Rs. 1.75 crore on the airlifting of a dozen employees or their dependants, besides meeting the hefty hospital bills for their super speciality treatment. It also needs dedicated teamwork and liaising to get things done”, a senior officer involved in the exercise told The Hindu, requesting anonymity. Admitting that getting hospital beds in the critical-care hospitals during the surge in COVID-19 cases was tough, not only for individuals but also for major companies such as NTPC, the authorities stated that even arranging the air-ambulance to airlift the critically-ill patients was a huge task since only a handful of agencies were providing the service. ‘People before PLF’ “NTPC has always believed in putting its people before PLF (plant load factor of its power generating stations). We have been working on a war-footing during the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 to ensure the best of medical help and facilities reach each of our needy employees. Providing air-ambulance is an extension of facilities we have arranged for the critical patients and it has saved several lives,” says M.S.D. Bhattamishra, Executive Director (HR), Corporate Office. The NTPC has airlifted five COVID patients from Patna, Ranchi, Delhi and Indore to Hyderabad, and others to Delhi and Kolkata. Of the five patients brought to Hyderabad, two have been discharged already while two others are still undergoing treatment and one succumbed to the infection. Financial assistance The company authorities said in the event of permanent disablement or death of an employee while in service, the beneficiary family is entitled to monthly payment equivalent to 50% of employee’s last drawn salary (basic pay, dearness allowance and special pay) in addition to the financial assistance with voluntary contribution of employees, now enhanced to Rs. 38 lakh keeping in view the prevailing COVID situation. Of it, 50% is paid as upfront payment to the family of the deceased employee and with the balance 50%, annuity is purchased for deferred payment to the family.  Providing air-ambulance is an extension of facilities we have arranged for the critical patients, and it has saved several lives. M.S.D.

16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Early Bird’ fetches civic bodies Rs. 101 cr.||The ‘Early Bird’ scheme of the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department where 5% discount is available for property owners paying the tax for the current financial year before the month-end has earned Rs. 101 crore so far. Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana said on Saturday that the property tax revenue was accrued from 129 municipalities and 12 municipal corporations. While the scheme was originally scheduled to end by April-end, the government has decided to extend the offer by a month considering the prevailing COVID situation across the State. ‘Best in Warangal’ There are about 14.05 lakh properties across the 141 corporations and municipalities in TS eligible for the ‘Early Bird’ offer and about 2.29 lakh property owners or about 22% of them had benefited by the scheme by about Rs. 5.1 crore. The response was the best from Warangal Municipal Corporation where 28,767 citizens made use of the scheme and had paid Rs. 12.16 crore in total. It is followed by Nizampet where Rs. 6.84 crore was collected, Karimnagar Rs. 4.92 crore, Nizamabad Rs. 4.44 crore and Dundigal municipality Rs. 3.60 crore. The director has urged the other property owners to make use of the scheme considering that there are 15 more days for the rebate scheme to end. In a communication with the commissioners of the urban local bodies concerned, Mr. Satyanarayana has directed them to bring about more awareness about the scheme to the citizens making use of various communication methods so that more are benefited from it. He pointed out that the property tax payments can be paid through the QR code and demand notices from this year would be having this scan mark providing another and easier method of digital payments without the need for citizens to reach out to the citizen service centres of the municipality concerned. This can be done through a mobile phone and payments can be made through credit or debit cards, internet banking, Google Pay, Phone Pay and the like. The payment receipts too could be obtained online. Payments through WhatsApp too has been facilitated this year with a special number - 90002 53342 allotted for the same. Mr. Satyanrayana said along with property tax, trade licence renewal, building layout permission, and birth/death certificates too could be obtained through WhatsApp. It would be available in both English and Telugu. Those interested can type ‘hi’, select the language desired in the option given, type the PIN number or door number option, choose the municipal body concerned, select the PIN or door number option and enter the same. Once the option is chosen and the number, if clicked, the payment options would show up, following which payment can be made. Already this option got 5.63 lakh hits, he added.

16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A task force set up to handle airlifted patients||Implementing decisions when it matters most is more daunting than the task of taking decisions itself, particularly when it is a major public sector undertaking such as NTPC. While the decision to airlift its COVID-affected and seriously-ill employees from a smaller hospital, whether in-house or outside, to a super speciality hospital elsewhere is bold, making arrangements for airlifting, treatment, monitoring the treatment, taking care of attendants in a place faraway from the patient’s (employee) place of work needs an extra mile of effort. Explaining the teamwork behind the airlifting of seriously-ill COVID patients and following-up their treatment, Executive Director (Southern Region) C.V. Anand told The Hindu that they have formed a task force working 24×7 in Hyderabad to handle such critically-ill cases in coordination with the Corporate Office in Delhi, who are in constant interaction over a dedicated WhatsApp group. “After getting the requisition to airlift a seriously-ill patient for admission in a corporate hospital for better treatment, our team places the request for admission with corporate hospitals along with the condition of the patient and pursues it constantly. So far, we have been able to accommodate the patients here in a couple of days after getting the request. The Corporate Office handles the airlifting aspect,” says Mr. Anand. He stated that they were also taking care of the attendants of the patients shifted here by providing them accommodation in the company guest house and other logistics during their stay as they are required here for admission and any quick decision-making with regard to the patient’s treatment. The corporate medical wing of the company would keep a tab on the treatment by being in touch with the doctors attending the patient, he explained.  Industrial oxygen The curtailed or complete stoppage of industrial oxygen supply to its power plants in the Southern Region has been affecting the work although they have been able to manage so far. “We have placed a formal request with the State government, a couple of days back, to restore oxygen supply at least partially so that the main activity of the company is not hampered,” Mr. Anand said adding that they were also in virtual touch with the workforce constantly to keep them in the positive frame of mind amid grim situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-task-force-set-up-to-handle-airlifted-patients/article34570017.ece

She lost her husband G Ravishankar on Thursday after battling COVID-19 for more than five days at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal. He worked in the same hospital.

16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt. releases guidelines for control of Black Fungus||Telangana Health department has issued ‘Urgent precautionary measures to prevent Mucormycosis during COVID’ to all private hospitals in the State on Saturday. The Black Fungus (Mucormycosis) was a rare infection. However, it is increasingly being detected among post-COVID patients, including in Telangana. Detailed guidelines on preventing Mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients, and an eight-point SOP on maintenance of humidifiers were issued by Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao, noting the importance of preventive measures. “Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after fungal spores are inhaled from the air,” according to an advisory developed by National Task Force for COVID-19 and experts. In the guidelines issued to prevent Mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients, Dr. Srinivasa Rao suggested — 1) Better control of the sugar levels during COVID with or without steroids; 2) Judicious use of steroids observing correct timing, correct dose and correct duration; 3) Judicious use of antibiotics or antifungals; 4) To use clean, sterile water for humidifiers during the oxygen therapy. Pointing out that Mucormycosis is often reported due to poor maintenance of humidifiers, he has also issued SOP for strict adherence. He has directed private hospitals to always use distilled or sterile water, never use unboiled tap water or mineral water, fill up to about 10 mm below the maximum fill line, check the water level twice daily and top it up as necessary. “Once a week (for the same patient) and in between patients, all the components of the humidifier should be soaked in a mild antiseptic solution for 30 minutes, rinsed with clean water and dried in air. Medical superintendents of all private hospitals shall ensure strict implementation of above guidelines,” the Director Public Health directed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-releases-guidelines-for-control-of-black-fungus/article34570018.ece

He said that 77 personnel of Rachakonda Commissionerate have donated plasma to the needy. “While the convalescent plasma therapy is widely prescribed by doctors for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients, there is a huge demand for plasma. Of the requests received from the public to the Covid control Room, 70% of them pertain to plasma requirement,” he said. Rachakonda police are trying to reach out to whomever possible, the huge demand can be met only if the donors come forward, he said. Due to apprehensions with respect to plasma donation or due to lack of a proper platform to connect, many potential donors are losing the chance to save the lives of many people, Mr Bhagwat said. He launched the webpage https://donateplasma.rksc.in developed in association with Rachakonda Security Council. The donors can register themselves and those who require plasma also can register their request via link. The needy can call Rachakonda Covid Control room at 9490617234 and fill in the request form, uploading the documents, and obtain the cylinder for a limited period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/praana-vayu-website-launched/article34570031.ece
16 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS trying to isolate Eatala Rajender?||The TRS has launched a visible campaign to wean away the grass roots level leaders and workers of the party from former Minister Eatala Rajender in his home turf. The person running the show is Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar, who began it all in Karimnagar on Friday by summoning the municipal and agricultural market committee chairmen and other elected representatives of Huzurabad and Jammikunta mandals of Huzurabad Assembly constituency represented by Mr. Rajender. The Minister extracted an assurance from all of them that the interests of the party and loyalty to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao were paramount to them. Mr. Rajender is a six time MLA, initially from Kamalapur, and then from Huzurabad where he enjoyed complete sway over voters. With considerable support base in every village of the constituency, he earned a reputation as a mass leader since his debut in Assembly from Kamalapur in 2004. In fact, he steam rolled to become an MLA dislodging a powerful Minister of then Telugu Desam government Muddasani Damodar Reddy. It was a cakewalk for him in all subsequent elections following delimitation of constituencies and the segment renamed Huzurabad. The TRS leadership apparently felt it was no mean task to bring to its side the vast network of Mr. Rajender after his removal from Cabinet which led to his confrontation with the party. By giving a free hand to Mr. Kamalakar whose very induction in Cabinet was seen as an attempt to keep a check on Mr. Rajender, the party started its attempt to isolate Mr. Rajender from the cadre pending an end to speculation whether he would resign or not from the party. Sources said the party was keen that Mr. Rajender resign on his own but the latter waited for the leadership to take action against him, something that happened with Rajya Sabha member D. Srinivas, who continued in TRS despite strained relationship. They added that Mr. Rajender might not hazard resignation at this stage because the party will deploy its full strength to defeat him in polls with ample time on hand as they were likely to be delayed like the recent postponement of elections of Legislative Council in view of CoOVID. In the meantime, the party could strengthen its position. Mr. Kamalakar continued his consultations with party leaders from the constituency in Karimnagar on Saturday also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-trying-to-isolate-eatala-rajender/article34570048.ece

16 May 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||No COVID case in this village||Can any village be immune to the corona pandemic ravaging the world across? Yes, is the answer, if we go by what medical officers and public representatives say! Basvapur is a village located in Jagadevpur mandal of Siddipet district. It has a population of about 1,200 with about 375 houses. This village has created a record of not registering a single COVID case. Most of the village is dependent on agriculture, including paddy, fruits and vegetables. A large quantity of vegetables produced in this village goes to the Boinpally market in the city. However, farmers go out of the village only in rare occasions. Traders buy vegetables and fruits directly from the fields so that there is no need to enter the village. Also, villagers here follow all COVID norms, do not crowd at any place and listen to the suggestions of officials and public representatives. “We had created an awareness among people right from the time COVID hit the State last year. No one leaves his or her house without a mask. Roads and drains are cleaned frequently. Only five to six persons go outside for jobs or work. The remaining stay put, which is one of the main reasons for arresting cases, in addition to following regular protocols,” said A. Indrasena Reddy, Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society (PACS) chairman and husband of sarpanch A. Mamatha, who is active in coordinating village activities. He added that very rarely, people from outside come to the village. “Sanitisation gets top priority in our village,” said panchayat secretary G. Prashanth. Aasha worker K. Latha and Anganwadi teacher Swathi have been visiting every house and monitoring the health of people frequently. About 300 villagers who crossed 45 years were already vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-covid-case-in-this-village/article34570045.ece

16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||With dip in cases, beds free up in city hospitals||Around 12.30 p.m. on Saturday, the display board outside the COVID-19 ward at Lok Nayak Hospital flashed 240 vacant ICU beds and around 746 vacant oxygen-supported beds of a total of 1,750 beds in the hospital. With the dip in daily cases in the national capital, the crowds outside the hospital have reduced now. While ambulances and patients in private cars kept coming to the hospital every few minutes, families of those already admitted said that the admission process had not been difficult this week. Laxmi, a resident of Najafgarh, got her 60-year-old mother admitted to the hospital five days ago. Ensuring facilities “My mother’s oxygen saturation had dropped to 50 and we had to rush her to the hospital. Thankfully, the scenario was not as bad as what we were hearing till a couple of weeks back. We could admit her to the hospital easily. The hospital is ensuring that we get to do video calls and even if we want to drop a few things for her, facilities have been made to give it at the designated counters. While most of the times we return at night, at times, we stay back as the tents here are well-managed with coolers, etc.,” said Ms. Laxmi. Brij Bhushan, an East Delhi resident who had to admit his 13-year-old niece at the hospital said, “The situation is no longer dire as earlier. The display board itself is the biggest proof of that. There are so many vacant beds now. Even when we got our niece to the hospital, the process was completed quite smoothly.” With rows of vacant ambulances outside Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, drivers said that the situation had improved immensely as compared to a couple of weeks ago when they were on a 24-hour duty due to the high demand. Rajveer Singh, an ambulance driver waiting outside the hospital said, “The scenario is much better now. These days, we only get 3-4 calls on a given day. When the oxygen crisis happened in the city, we were on duty for 24 hours and the pressure was immense. The rush was so bad that it was difficult to get the patients admitted. However, things have improved a lot now and patients get admitted quite easily.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-dip-in-cases-beds-free-up-in-city-hospitals/article34569797.ece

The figures of those infected and deaths are being hidden. Today, the villages of the State have become the strongholds of corona. There is a huge shortage of doctors and health workers in the hospitals and people are not getting proper treatment,” she said at a press conference. Ms. Selja said corona-related medicines and oxygen are being black-marketed in the State. “Black marketing of medicines used in the treatment of black fungus disease has also started from the last one week. While the corona epidemic in Haryana is continuously increasing, the vaccination campaign is going on at a very slow pace,” she said. Chief Minister Manohar Lal said the Central and State governments are strenuously working towards controlling the pandemic and delivering their best. “This is the time to forget all differences and make a united effort,” he said, urging social organisations and political parties to fight together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/covid-19-response-bungled-in-haryana-alleges-congress/article34569817.ece

The State Capital has accounted for 24% of the total active cases in Rajasthan. The administration is likely to intensify the restrictions in Jaipur with the demarcation of containment zones, expansion of testing activities and making a rigorous contract tracing after identifying the positive cases. Free medicine kits will also be distributed in the residential areas of the district. The active cases in Jaipur crossed 45,500 on Saturday, while the total number in the State stood at 2.08 lakh. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said here that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision for audit of installation and operation of ventilators provided by the Centre was a “step in the right direction”. “Full investigation should be taken up to find out how the defective ventilators were supplied to the States,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. He said the reports had revealed that the Central government-owned HLL Lifecare Limited had purchased 59,000 ventilators from about 10 companies, many of which did not have any experience of manufacturing these machines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/revised-plan-for-jaipur-after-defective-ventilators-report/article34569813.ece

16 May 2021||Nandigram (W.B.),||Dhankhar hits out at Mamata over Nandigram violence||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday visited some camps in Purba Medinipur district where people allegedly affected by post-poll violence in Nandigram have taken shelter and questioned the “silence” of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the cries of children and women rendered homeless by the “TMC workers” there. Mr. Dhankhar met violence-affected people who have taken shelter at camps in Kendemari, Bankim More, Chilagram, Nandigram Bazar and Town Club here. The camps are managed by Suvendu Adhikari and his BJP supporters. The TMC chief had termed the incident of firing by the Central forces in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi in which four persons were killed as “genocide” but she is “silent over the situation in Nandigram”, Mr. Dhankhar said. “You described the Sitalkuchi incident as cold-blooded murder and genocide. Have you heard the cries and screams of the children and women in Nandigram, where lakhs of people are homeless? We feel bad to see the situation of West Bengal. India has never seen such a situation previously. The State is virtually sitting on a volcano,” he said. People at the camps claimed to have fled their homes in Nandigram after the poll results were out on May 2. They also alleged that their houses were “ransacked by the TMC goons”. ‘Pay attention here’ “The CM should understand the plight of people. She should also give attention to the post-poll violent situation here and elsewhere,” the Governor said. The Trinamool Congress on Saturday hit out at the Governor, saying he is not being taken seriously by the political parties in the State any more due to his conduct to work in favour of one political party, even putting to the backburner the all important fight against Coronavirus. TMC MP Sougata Roy said instead of being on the side of people to create COVID awareness, “he is working to deflect attention from the fight against the pandemic”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dhankhar-hits-out-at-mamata-over-nandigram-violence/article34569812.ece
16 May 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Raigad braces for Cyclone Tauktae||With the cyclonic storm Tauktae intensifying and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a warning for people living along the coast of Raigad district, Nidhi Choudhary, District Collector, interacted with the public through Facebook live on Saturday. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed authorities in coastal districts to remain alert and to take all necessary precautions. Ms. Choudhary said, “The cyclone is expected to make landfall on Gujarat coast but will pass via Raigad, affecting coastal areas in the district. We have started pre-monsoon work, besides structural audits and taken precautionary steps at hospitals. Damaged and weak trees are being trimmed. Generators and oxygen backup for 48 hours have been provided at ICUs of all hospitals. Our past experience with Cyclone Nisarga will be helpful.” Last year’s cyclone had inflicted heavy damage on the infrastructure of the Energy Department. “From Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited, we have deployed teams at various places, especially COVID-19 hospitals and oxygen generating plants. Cyclone curfew and cooperation from people will play key roles like last year,” she said.  Expect heavy rain: IMD The storm is likely to intensify further into a “very severe cyclonic storm” by late Saturday night, and strong winds and heavy rainfall are expected at isolated places on Monday over north Konkan, including Mumbai, according to the IMD. With storms and heavy rainfall expected to strike Raigad over the next two days, Ms. Choudhary appealed to the people of the district to shift to safety. She said government officials will shift those who do not have an RCC constructed house. Those in home quarantine without a secure structure will be shifted in accordance with COVDI-19 norms. There are 65 villages along the sea coast and 128 on the creek coast, with a total population of 3 lakh. Ms. Choudhary also warned people against venturing out to take photos and videos or swim in the floodwaters. People have been advised to be prepared with primary health kits, battery backup for mobile phones, kerosene lamps, batteries, gas lamps, stoves, and matchboxes. The District Collector also asked people to store enough food for the next three days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/raigad-braces-for-cyclone-tauktae/article34569773.ece

16 May 2021||GAZA/JERUSALEM,||Violence rocks Gaza, Israel and West Bank||Israeli planes renewed air strikes in Gaza early on Saturday and Hamas militants responded by firing rockets into Israel as their battle entered a fifth night and U.S. and Arab diplomats sought an end to the violence. Palestinian medics said at least four people were killed in one of several air strikes in northern Gaza. Residents said Israeli naval boats fired shells from the Mediterranean though none may have hit the strip. The Palestinian Religious Affairs Ministry said Israeli planes destroyed a mosque. A military spokesman said the Army was checking the report. Sirens sounded in two major southern Israeli cities warning of incoming fire from Gaza. Hamas claimed responsibility for launching rockets. With no sign of an end to the fighting, casualties spread further afield, with Palestinians reporting 11 killed in the occupied West Bank amid clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces. At least 132 people have been killed in Gaza since Monday, including 32 children and 21 women, and 950 others wounded, Palestinian medical officials said. Among eight dead in Israel were a soldier patrolling the Gaza border and six civilians, including two children, Israeli authorities said. Ahead of a session of the UN Security Council on Sunday to discuss the situation, Biden administration envoy Hady Amr, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israel and Palestinian Affairs, flew in on Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Israel said the aim was “to reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm.” Israel launched attacks on Friday to destroy what it said were several kilometres of tunnels, launch sites and weapons manufacturing warehouses used by the militants in an effort to halt the rocket attacks. Across central and southern Israel, from small towns bordering Gaza to metropolitan Tel Aviv and southern Beersheba, people have adjusted to sirens wailing, radio and TV broadcast interruptions and the beeps of cellphones bearing red alerts that send them rushing for cover.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/violence-rocks-gaza-israel-and-west-bank/article34569503.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Mars landing gives China’s space programme a leg-up||China landed a spacecraft on Mars carrying its first Mars rover in a big boost to its space ambitions, the country’s space agency said on Saturday. China had in July last year launched its first Mars mission, called Tianwen-1, meaning Questions to Heaven, carrying a lander and rover. Tianwen-1 had been in orbit since February, and on Saturday, a lander descended successfully on to the surface of the red planet carrying a rover named Zhurong, named after a god of fire for a planet known in Chinese as the planet of fire. Only the Soviet Union and the U.S. had previously carried out a successful landing on Mars. China’s official media described “nine minutes of terror” during the descent — the hardest part of the mission. The descent “was extremely complicated with no ground control, and had to be performed by the spacecraft autonomously,” Geng Yan, an official at the China National Space Administration (CNSA) Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center, was quoted as saying by state media. “Each step had only one chance, and the actions were closely linked. If there had been any flaw, the landing would have failed,” he said. The rover will provide “first-hand materials for research on the planet’s space environment, surface topography, and soil structure”, the CNSA said. China’s leadership sees the space programme as an important part of China’s ambitions to close the technological gulf with the U.S. President Xi Jinping on Saturday described the Mars landing as “an important step in China’s interstellar exploration” and said it had “left a Chinese mark on Mars for the first time” and was “another landmark progress in China’s space industry development”. China had previously tried to launch a Mars orbiter along with Russia in 2011, but that failed to enter orbit. This attempt, on its own, hit the target. China’s Mars mission, along with lunar mission and space station, is key to its space programme. In 2019, the fourth lunar probe, Chang’e-4, carried out the world’s first landing on the far side of the moon. The Mars mission was launched the following year. China is also investing heavily in its manned space programme, as plans accelerate for its first space station, set to be functional by the end of next year and only the second space station after the International Space Station. Last month, a Long March-5B Y2 rocket carried out the first of three components for the space station, called the Tianhe or Heavenly Harmony module. Thomas Zurbuchen, of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, congratulated China. “Together with the global science community,” he said, “I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity’s understanding of the Red Planet.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mars-landing-gives-chinas-space-programme-a-leg-up/article34569511.ece

Ms. Tanden has two tasks ahead of her — launch a review of the U.S. Digital Service, and plan contingencies that could result from the Supreme Court’s consideration of Republican lawsuits seeking to annul the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Tanden, 50, is currently the president and CEO of a progressive think-tank, Center for American Progress (CAP). “Neera’s intellect, tenacity, and political savvy will be an asset to the Biden administration,” CAP founder and director John Podesta said. He said the White House has made remarkable progress combating numerous once-in-a-generation challenges — from vaccinating millions of Americans to delivering real economic relief from the coronavirus pandemic, and from strengthening the Affordable Care Act to tackling climate change. “Many of these bold policy solutions, which have bipartisan support from voters, were developed and led by Neera at CAP over many years. The administration’s efforts will be magnified with Neera Tanden on the team,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/neera-tanden-appointed-white-house-senior-adviser/article34569505.ece
16 May 2021||Tehran,||Iran heavyweights Larijani, Raisi bid for presidential race||Two Iranian political heavyweights, ultra-conservative Ebrahim Raisi and moderate conservative Ali Larijani, on Saturday launched what may be the main battle in next month’s presidential election. Hopefuls have been registering ahead of June 18 polls to select a successor to moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term. First to throw down the gauntlet on Saturday was Mr. Larijani, a long-time parliament speaker and now adviser to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, submitting his name at the Interior Ministry early on the final day of registration. Then it was the turn of judiciary chief and one-time presidential hopeful Mr. Raisi, who was Mr. Rouhani’s leading rival in 2017 elections, to announce his own candidacy. While several other hopefuls have thrown their hats into the ring, “the main clash will be between Mr. Raisi and Mr. Larijani,” Masoud Bastani, a Tehran-based journalist said. “The first represents the ultraconservative faction and part of traditional conservatives ... and the second the traditional conservatives and moderates, and by proxy, reformists,” he added. Since registration to run in the election began on Tuesday, more than 300 hopefuls have submitted bids to stand, according to the Interior Ministry. Others who registered on Saturday included secretary of the Expediency Council and ex-commander of Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Rezai, Iran’s ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, and Rouhani’s first Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri. All the hopefuls will be vetted by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council, which will publish a list of approved candidates by May 27, after which campaigning begins. Mr. Larijani threw the first jab at Mr. Raisi, in a press conference. “The economy is neither a garrison nor a court that would be managed with shouts and orders,” he told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-heavyweights-larijani-raisi-bid-for-presidential-race/article34569509.ece
16 May 2021||Beijing,||China nixes bids to climb Everest over virus fears||China has canceled attempts to climb Mount Everest from its side of the world’s highest peak because of fears of importing COVID-19 cases from neighboring Nepal, state media reported. The closure was confirmed in a notice on Friday from China’s General Administration of Sport, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The move reflects the abundance of caution China has taken in dealing with the pandemic. While China has mostly curbed domestic transmission of the coronavirus, Nepal is experiencing a surge with record numbers of new infections and deaths. China had issued permits to 38 people, all Chinese citizens, to climb the 8,849-meter high mountain this spring. Nepal has given permission to 408 people.

16 May 2021||Beijing,||Two tornadoes strike China, killing at least 12||Two tornadoes that struck central and eastern China killed at least 12 people and injured more than 400, authorities said Saturday. Violent winds of more than 260 km per hour blasted the central city of Wuhan on Friday night. Eight people died and more than 280 were injured there, authorities said, adding that around 30 homes had collapsed. Vehicles were crushed by falling objects, trees uprooted, buildings partially destroyed and electricity pylons felled, leaving more than 26,000 homes without power. The gale damaged two construction cranes, one of which toppled onto the site below, causing significant damage. In Suzhou, near Shanghai, another tornado with winds of more than 200 km per hour wreaked havoc. Four people were killed and one remains missing, according to local authorities. Images shared on social media showed a black whirlwind which left a trail of destruction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/two-tornadoes-strike-china-killing-at-least-12/article34569512.ece

16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST Council to convene on May 28||The Goods and Services Tax Council will meet for the first time in more than seven-and-a-half months, on May 28, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Saturday, setting the stage for the Centre and States to take up several pending as well as pressing issues relating to the indirect tax amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from the possible inclusion of petroleum products under the GST regime to ease the tax burden that has pushed retail fuel prices to record levels, the Council is also expected to take up States’ concerns on GST levies on critical COVID-19 supplies, including the 5% GST on vaccines. The Council, which is expected to meet every quarter, had last met in early October. While States had been urging a meeting of the Council over the past couple of months, the Centre had said it would be better to wait for the Assembly elections, including in large States like Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, to conclude. With the elections out of the way and new governments taking charge this month, the GST Council has been convened. The Finance Minister’s office tweeted that she would chair the 43rd GST Council meeting via video conferencing at 11 a.m. in New Delhi on May 28. “The meeting will be attended by Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, besides Finance Ministers of States & UTs and senior officers from Union Government & States,” her office posted on Twitter. Compensation shortfalls States are also expected to seek a discussion on the plans for meeting the GST compensation shortfalls that may arise this year too, as second-wave lockdowns dent economic activity afresh, as well as the estimated Rs. 63,000 crore due to them for last year’s compensation. After a fractious debate, the Centre had last year met Rs. 1.1 lakh crore of the compensation shortfall through special market borrowings that it lent to the States. While GST collections for 2021-22 began with a record Rs. 1.41 lakh crore in April, most economists anticipate a moderation in revenue as more States impose curbs. “Fresh lockdowns have disrupted businesses again and this may result in lower tax collections in the coming months,” Brickwork Ratings said in a note last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gst-council-to-convene-on-may-28/article34569488.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Great Restructuring’ is the new turning point: L&T Infotech||Having bagged large deals in the last few quarters, L&T Infotech CEO & MD Sanjay Jalona says the nature of the deal pipeline is changing as customers are increasingly looking at digital interventions in a pandemic-hit marketplace that requires them to embrace ‘restructuring’. Edited excerpts:  What is the current market reality? In the last 100 years, the world has witnessed three major economic turning points. The first one was the Great Depression of 1929, then came the Great Recession of 2007, and we believe what we are going through right now is the ‘Great Restructuring.’ We call it the ‘Great Restructuring’ because every aspect of our life and work is going through a change. The way we interact, collaborate, learn, deliver and expect value is changed forever. It is going to have a profound impact on the future of work, workplace, and workforce. The ‘Great Restructuring’ is comprehensive, because no industry, no company, and no country is isolated. Everyone must adapt or cede their position. How are you positioned to explore this opportunity? Looking at the convergence of market trends and capabilities, we feel cloud and data products are two key areas that present huge opportunities for industry players. Accordingly, we have created two separate units to cater to these opportunities and these units will be the critical growth engines for us in the next 3 to 5 years. Additionally, we see four themes emerging as top priorities of customers: enhanced empathy (by improving loyalty models), improved productivity (through a more distributed mechanism), building resilience (by saving money to fund new operating models) and increased agility (by speeding up time-to-market). Our consulting-led initiative (The Grit Alliance) is helping us harness the opportunities that these dominant themes present. What is your strategy for big-ticket deal wins? L&T Infotech (LTI) closed FY21 with a record net new TCV (total contract value) for large deals. In Q4, we won two large deals. One, a vendor consolidation engagement in the insurance space that came with a net TCV of $21 million over five years. The other deal involves one of the world’s largest Islamic banks where we would be transforming its core banking functions with Temenos, a BFSI software firm based in Switzerland. This is a two-year deal worth $45 million. We have a mature ‘advisor relations’ function and partner with leading third-party advisers across the globe. Are global customers comfortable with the rising portion of offshore? We are certainly witnessing a perimeter expansion in what can be delivered remotely, with current models being challenged and expanded. Also, automation of work is resulting in smaller units and shorter cycles. Innovative tools and platforms developed during last year are making this shift possible and making customers more comfortable. For instance, LTI launched Canvas, our vision of the future of software engineering. It curates a comprehensive tech stack enabling multi-disciplinary teams of all levels, wherever they are, to work together on projects in a remote or hybrid environment. What is LTI’s market outlook for FY22? Tech spending across sectors is looking quite strong. Our industry-leading growth during the last few years, high exit velocity in Q4, large deals announced in the last few quarters, current pipeline, and incredible conversations with customers because of the ‘restructuring’ opportunity, positions us well for the next phase. With our focus on transformational offerings across all verticals and the opportunity to create value with Data, ERP and Cloud solutions, we expect to continue to be the growth leader next year and beyond. Do you expect any systemic change around outsourcing under the Biden administration? Early indications are positive, and we believe the administration will take the necessary steps to ensure that American enterprises remain competitive. We will continue to work with governments in the U.S. and India and support measures that ensure healthy relations between the two nations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/great-restructuring-is-the-new-turning-point-lt-infotech/article34569484.ece

The All India Motor Transport Congress, which is the top body of the transporters in the country, had called on the State government to waive such a condition. The State government, in its revised guidelines issued on Saturday, said that the truck drivers “may be allowed to enter in the State only after checking the temperature and any other symptoms as well as status of each person on Aarogya Setu”. “With persistent follow-ups at the highest level we are successful in getting revised guidelines regarding mandatory requirement of negative RT-PCR test for drivers in Maharashtra,” Bal Malkit Singh, Chairman of the Core Committee, AIMTC, said in a statement. Earlier in the day, AIMTC got instructions from the Chief Secretary’s office issued to the field officials to release the vehicles immediately, he said, adding this was done promptly and the vehicles were released.

16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Power usage rose 19% in first fortnight of May||Power consumption in the country grew by about 19% in the first fortnight of May to 51.67 billion units (BU) over the same period last year, showing recovery in industrial and commercial demand of electricity, according to power ministry data. Power consumption in the first fortnight of May 2020 was 43.55 BU. The power consumption in the entire month of May last year was 102.08 BU. During the first fortnight of May (from May 1 to 14), peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched the highest level of 168.78 GW (on May 6, 2021) and recorded growth of more than 15% over 146.54 GW (peak met) recorded in the same period in 2020 (on May 13, 2020). The power consumption in April grew almost 40% to 118.08 BU. Power consumption in April 2020 had dropped to 84.55 BU from 110.11 BU a year earlier, after most economic activity was halted following the imposition of the national COVID-19 lockdown in the last week of March 2020. The power consumption had also declined in May 2020 to 102.08 BU, from 120.02 BU in May 2019. Similarly, peak power demand met or the highest power supply in a day also slumped to 132.73 GW in April 2020 from 176.81 GW in the same month in 2019, reflecting the impact of the lockdown on activities. The fewer economic activities also resulted in a fall of peak power demand in May 2020 to 166.22 GW from 182.53 GW in May 2019. “Energy is derived demand, and with onset of summer and the productive pre-monsoon cycle of the Indian economy, an uptick is always expected,” said Davinder Sandhu, Advisor Primus Partners. “Both energy demand and supply have risen by 25-40% over March-May 2021, with thermal PLFs (plant load factor or capacity utilisation) rising to 75% and more, after many quarters. This is aided by the opening of the economy in Q1 (January-March 2021), with rising economic output as well as sharp uptick in exports,” added Mr. Sandhu, who is also a former Advisor at the World Bank. ‘Second wave impact’ The second wave of lockdowns will certainly impact economic activity, and in turn, energy demand. The larger than usual increase in part is attributed to lower base, and as well as to the pent up demand being executed now, he added. After a gap of six months, power consumption had recorded a 4.6% year-on-year growth in September 2020 and 11.6 % in October 2020. In November 2020, the power consumption growth slowed to 3.12%, mainly due to the early onset of winter. In December 2020, power consumption grew by 4.5% while it was up 4.4 % in January 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/power-usage-rose-19-in-first-fortnight-of-may/article34569492.ece

16 May 2021||Geneva,||‘Athletes need a decision on Tokyo’||Roger Federer said on Friday that athletes need a firm decision on whether the Tokyo Olympics are going ahead, with the tennis star saying he was in two minds over the Games. An Olympics singles gold medal is the only major honour missing from the Swiss great’s collection —but the 39-year-old said he would understand if the Games were called off. The pandemic-postponed 2020 Olympics are due to open on July 23. “It’s difficult,” Federer told Switzerland’s Leman Bleu television. “We’re not hearing much. That makes me think the Games will happen, even if I’ve heard that lots of people in Tokyo are against the Games.” “Honestly I don’t know what to think,” said Federer. “I would love to play in the Olympics, win a medal for Switzerland, that would make me so proud. “But if that doesn’t happen due to the situation, I would be the first to understand. But I think what the athletes need is a decision: is it happening or isn’t it? “At the moment, we have the impression that it will. We know it’s a fluid situation. And also you can also decide as an athlete if you want to go. If you feel there’s a lot of resistance, maybe it’s better not to go. I don’t know.” Federer vaccinated Federer is playing in the Geneva Open tournament next week, his second event since coming back from more than a year off with knee problems. Rafael Nadal admitted on Tuesday that he had not yet decided whether he would participate in Tokyo, giving himself more time to decide according to “circumstances”. On Monday, Serena Williams said she was undecided about going to the Olympics, while Japanese stars Naomi Osaka and Kei Nishikori have both raised concerns.

16 May 2021||Kochi,||Competitions are a must: Vimal||Despite the long lockdown and many restrictions, young badminton star Pavithra Naveen managed to train the whole of last year, putting in nearly three sessions every day. She was entering a new age-group and her coach Antony K. Jacob convinced her to work harder. “But I didn't play a single tournament for a whole year. It was my first under-17 year and I was really fit, so it was very disappointing,” said the 16-year-old, the Kerala women's singles champion, in a chat with The Hindu . Small goals “During tournaments, we can focus more since we have a target. Nowadays, we are practising without goals as there are no tournaments. It was a bit hard for me because I kept setting small goals for myself frequently.” Pavithra is perhaps luckier than many others in the country as many children could not even train and had only online sessions during the lockdown. That could be really shattering for the juniors, feels former international U. Vimal Kumar. Youngsters suffering “The youngsters are suffering. Just like education, sport has been completely destroyed in the last one-and-a-half years because of COVID-19,” the former national coach said from Bengaluru. “Definitely, more than the established people, this has been a very hard time for youngsters. COVID-19 has destroyed them, basically it destroys your soul.” So, competitions are a must, feels Vimal. “They have to compete, whatever one may say, sportspersons need competitions. The earlier they start, at whatever level, it's good for them,” said the former national champion. “I'm talking about the smaller level, conduct a small event at the district level, whether it is badminton or tennis, it's not for ranking or anything, it is just to keep the activities on. “That's why some of the other top nations always have their domestic activities. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that in our country. “||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/competitions-are-a-must-vimal/article34569456.ece

So disappointed.” Sthalekar also felt the time has come for a player’ association for the Indian women’s team. “As a past player the ACA (Australian Cricketers’ Association) have reached out daily to see how we are and provided all kinds of services.

This announcement came after opening batsman Cameron Bancroft hinted that there had to be wider knowledge about ball-tampering during the ‘Sandpaper Gate’ incident in 2018 in the Cape Town Test between Australia and South Africa than just the trio of Steve Smith, David Warner and the opener himself. “CA has maintained all along that if anyone is in possession of new information in regards to the Cape Town Test of 2018, they should come forward and present it. The investigation conducted at the time was detailed and comprehensive. Since then, no one has presented new information to CA that casts doubt on the investigation’s findings,” ESPNcricinfo quoted CA spokesperson as saying. Caught on camera In March 2018, Bancroft was caught on camera trying to change the condition of the ball using sandpaper in a Test match against South Africa in Cape Town. The incident later went on to be labelled as the ‘Sandpaper Gate’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ca-open-to-reinvestigating-sandpaper-gate/article34569458.ece
16 May 2021||KOLKATA,||Lifters to leave for Tashkent on May 18||Promising lifter Jeremy Lalrinnunga was relieved that the suspense surrounding international flight tickets was over and he could now take part in the World junior championships to be held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, from May 21 to 31. After days of uncertainty, the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) managed to get visas and flight tickets for two lifters — Jeremy (67kg) and Achinta Sheuli (73kg) — on Saturday. The two will board the flight to Tashkent on May 18 morning, informed IWLF secretary Sahdev Yadav. Jeremy was delighted. “Finally the uncertainty is over and good to know that we are going," Jeremy told The Hindu . Jeremy, who could not give his best in the Asian championships at the same venue last month due to knee pain, was eager to do better. “This is an important event prior to the Olympics. The knee pain is still there, I have to perform well while dealing with it,” said Jeremy. Coaches Pramod Sharma and Vijai Rohilla will accompany the lifters in the absence of chief coach Vijay Sharma, who is in the USA along with Mirabai Chanu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lifters-to-leave-for-tashkent-on-may-18/article34569471.ece

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Lives in the second wave||A week ago, Meena lost her job the sixth time. “It’s the second wave, Meena. You may not be knowing how many people are dying each day. But trust me, most of the infection is being carried by maids. Better, you just take off for a couple of weeks,” her employer said. Meena’s son stopped going to the school long ago, and after her husband had to give up the rented autorickshaw, he had been unemployed for more than eight months. A maid’s job is one of the least paid, and Meena tried to compensate by serving as many houses as possible. Her mask was stained with repeated use, and though entry into apartments was barred for those without a proper mask, residents rarely offered one. When her mother passed away in the village, Meena could not go for the last rites as she was afraid of losing her job. For a few months, households had been refusing her one by one, and a week ago, the last bit of her earnings was gone. She walked home, trying to suppress a cough, lost in thoughts of hunger. Hungry and homeless In the same slum, Bhavani was a well-known face. He was in his 50s and was homeless. His clothes were tattered and the daily meals would not come from the local teashop as it closed for the second time now. Bhavani would sit on the footpath near the five-point signal in the afternoon sun and gaze at the busy crowd. But he has never begged, not even when hungry and cold during the lockdown last year. Bhavani had a knack for searching the corporation dustbin for reusables and had recently discovered a multi-coloured mask which he deemed suitable for his frail mother who was homeless just like him. Bhavani and his mother had not eaten since morning. With a blank stare, both of them stood on the pavement as the sun set. Tarun was usually posted near this signal. It has been his duty as a traffic constable for years. “What should I control when there is no traffic,” Tarun smiled. His smile was soon replaced by the terrifying thought that his duty was coming to an end. That meant he had to go back to his family. Two rooms held four people, including Tarun and his ailing father. It has become regular to hear about deaths in the neighbourhood. Always being posted on the open streets for duty, Tarun spent sleepless nights on the balcony, feeling like a criminal responsible for carrying and spreading the virus. He had not hugged his five-year-old son in days. Walking past this tired traffic constable was Ratan, who had returned that morning from Mumbai, spending triple the train fare to escape an imminent lockdown. He had forfeited his job, savings, dignity and shelter after being forced to leave his job for the second time in a year. Throughout his tiring journey back home, he got used to the looks of disgust and hate, nearly convinced that he was the source of the pandemic. With two sisters in school, a brother in college and elderly parents, Ratan did not understand what was more concerning: how to obtain the vaccinations to keep them safe or how to get some cash to help them survive. Ratan’s sister Neha awaits her board exams in the suburbs. She is yet grasping the “new normal” of online classes, courtesy a smartphone provided by a local NGO. As her mind wanders off to the open playgrounds, tiffin boxes and classroom bells, Neha struggles with bandwidth. Classes barely move beyond “Am I audible?” A few blocks away, in a posh apartment of the city, Parameshwar was alone. He did not feel like having his dinner or even “Zooming” to have the usual talk with his children in the U.S. He was breathless and in pain; he knew this would happen. He has been concealing his symptoms for days now with a fear that he had to leave his room, his bed, his only company. He sat on the balcony gazing at the moonlit sky, and the last thing he remembered was the smile of his newborn granddaughter, whom he could never touch in-person. Dreaded history People like Meena, Bhavani, Tarun, Ratan and Parameshwar are real and not some estimated percentages in a COVID-19 database. They live amid us. These faces and stories which are re-emerging with the second wave, remind us of the dreaded history a year ago. They are all trying to stay positive, fight back the pandemic and live through adversities in their own way. Be it the fear of losing jobs, or not being able to meet the family, or the painful loneliness among riches, or not able to get vaccinated, or being labelled as the “virus-spreader” or staying perpetually hungry or just struggling for survival, anxiety is all pervading in every sphere of our life. Let us take a step back and think, what could have happened if domestic helps were not labelled for spreading illness; homeless and stateless people were provided some protection; frontline workers received psychological support; migrant workers had means of restoring respect and social security; and individuals had hands of ‘love and support’ even in their last moments. What could have happened if as a society we all cared and worked for their mental well-being?

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||When fossils come alive||Close your eyes and imagine a dinosaur. Did you think of a tall, sinewy, sharp-fanged creature? How did this image pop up in your head considering that dinosaurs lived millions of years before the first modern humans appeared? Of course, there’s Jurassic Park , but the actual credit goes to the discipline of paleoart, or paleo illustration, which helps create the most realistic depictions of long-extinct animals. In the early 19th century, artists mingled science with fantasy to recreate dinosaurs for popular imagination, usually showing them in apocalyptic forests with an erupting volcano in the background. American paleoartist Doug Henderson, who was credited as a “dinosaur specialist” in the film Jurassic Park , says dinosaurs were part of popular culture when he was a child in the 50s. “There were books and movies that made deep impressions on me — illustrations by Charles Knight and Zdeněk Burian — and one movie in particular, King Kong , made in 1933.” The septuagenarian starts with a simple doodle and the ideas get refined eventually into fully developed outlines, with all the image’s components orchestrated into a workable composition. Prehistoric life was more than just dinosaurs. Even before plants and life on land evolved, creatures thrived in marine environments and now their fossils tell those stories. In 2019, while studying the fossils of a worm, Facivermis, that lived 500 million years ago, researcher Richard Howard noted that the creature didn’t have lower limbs, and that it may be a missing link in evolution. Now, this mere imprint on a rock needed flesh, skin, and colours. “ Facivermis looks so strange and alien because there’s nothing like it living today,” says Franz Anthony, a professional paleoartist from Indonesia. “To illustrate this creature, Howard and I looked at other marine animals for inspiration, and we agreed that it might have resembled modern featherduster worms, even if they’re not closely related!” Paleoart is a complex art form. The reconstruction of an extinct animal involves vast research, only the beginning of which is examining the fossil. Scientists cover much ground here, and their detailed research papers give most of the details needed for reconstruction. David Hone, a palaeontologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, explains how paleoart has advanced over the decades. “In the 70s and 80s, you would see drawings where everything lived in a rainforest. But in the last few years, there’s been a real intensity to the art form. Artists try to recreate what trees there were or depict how hot the location was in summer. Would there be snow in winter? Would it be deep snow? What was the daylight like?” Moon in paleoart Paleoartists also analyse the geological time period the animal lived in, to recreate its habitat as truly as possible. Dr. Hone talks of how Julius T. Csotonyi, a paleoartist in Canada, even paid close attention to the moon in his paleoart. “About 80 to 90 million years ago, the moon was closer to Earth and would have looked bigger. And some of those really big craters that we look at weren’t there, because we know they’re more recent. He did a painting of the moon with a dinosaur in front of it, where he took out the craters and made the stars brighter. Not just because you didn’t have light pollution. But again, 100 million years ago, we were in a different position in the galaxy. It makes quite a difference — what stars you see, and how bright they are.” Ancient and modern It is also important to know the closest relatives of the creature in the evolutionary tree. Artists compare the fossil with modern animals that may have had similarities in anatomy and behaviour. However, one can never be sure what a prehistoric creature really looked like. When American paleoartist Emily Willoughby finished painting the Anchiornis huxleyi , a small dinosaur from China, she thought it was a perfect reconstruction. “But a week later, a new study came to light that described in fantastic detail the coloration that this animal’s feathers would have had. I had painted it brown and black but the study showed that it was black and white with a red crest like a woodpecker. I painstakingly repainted the animal to reflect the new findings.” She says that paleoartists have to come to terms with the fact that everything they draw may become outdated or inaccurate at some point. More fossils are being discovered today than ever before, and palaeontologists have realised that good art helps their work reach a wider audience. Mark Paul Witton, a vertebrate palaeontologist and paleoartist from the U.K., says that paleoart is scientifically informed art. “At its most fundamental level, paleoart is not reconstructing extinct creatures as they were, it is reconstructing our ideas about them. This is what we thought about that creature when this art was constructed. We can never be 100% confident about our illustrations. We are visualising hypotheses, not recreating the creatures themselves.”  Paleoart is not reconstructing extinct creatures as they were, it is reconstructing our ideas about them.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Old flames||What is it about cookery shows that draws us to them? We don’t get to eat the food, and often we are so mesmerised by the razzmatazz that we don’t actually follow the process of cooking. But food programmes — hosted by trained chefs, villagers, writers, homemakers, and so on — have us all hooked. Why? I think I’ve found the answer — it’s the sight of a fire burning bright that draws us. Where there’s food, there’s fire, at least in some form. Fire figures prominently in a book I have been reading — Michael Pollan’s Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation . The cover is rather attractive — it shows a nicely browned sausage. I could imagine it sizzling over a crackling fire. And I could even get the aroma of a somewhat burnt sausage. Pollan writes about people’s fascination with watching food being cooked. “I would watch, rapt, when my mother conjured her most magical dishes, like the tightly wrapped package of fried chicken Kiev that, when cut open with a sharp knife, liberated a pool of melted butter and an aromatic gust of herbs. But watching an everyday pan of eggs get scrambled was nearly as riveting a spectacle, as a slimy yellow goop suddenly leapt into the form of savoury gold nuggets.” What he doesn’t add — but I happily imagine — are the merry flames of fire leaping up as his mother holds the pan away from the stove to ensure that the eggs don’t coagulate in the heat. Bo-bo’s achievement The book, lent to me by a friend, is an eminently readable work on all that goes into food. The section on fire is particularly illuminating. Human beings, Pollan writes, were eating raw food till an accident happened in a Chinese home, as described by the 19th century essayist Charles Lamb in ‘A Dissertation upon Roast Pig’. This is the story of a young man named Bo-bo — “the dimwitted son of a swineherd named Ho-ti.” Ho-ti had gone out in search of mast for his pigs when Bo-bo, who apparently liked to play with fire, accidentally burnt down the house. Along with it, a litter of piglets got charred. Bo-bo liked the aroma, and when he tasted the burnt skin of a pig, he quite liked it. His father found it irresistible too, but father and son decided not to let their neighbours know about it lest they disapproved of the use of fire on living beings. But soon strange stories started going around: “It was observed that Ho-ti’s cottage was burnt down more frequently than ever.” Tribal brotherhood Applying the heat of fire to food, Pollan tells us, transforms it in several ways, “some of them chemical, others physical — but all with the same result; making more energy available to the creatures that eat it. Exposure to heat ‘denatures’ proteins — unfolding the origami structures in such a way as to expose more surface to the action of our digestive enzymes.” In plant foods, fire “gelatinises” starches, the first step in breaking them down into simple sugars. Heat turns many foods which are toxic if eaten raw — cassava, for instance — tasty and more nutritious. But there is more to fire than just the role it plays in cooking. It also brings people together. Pollan writes: “‘The culinary act from the start is a project,’ according to Catherine Perles, the French archaeologist. ‘Cooking ends individual self-sufficiency.’ For starters, it demands collaboration, if only to keep your fire from dying out. The fire itself draws people close together, and introduces the unprecedented social and political complexity of the shared meal, which demands an unprecedented degree of self-control; patience while the meat is cooking and cooperation when it is ready to be divided.” I second that. I think the best potatoes I have ever eaten were at a late friend’s farmhouse long years ago. We got a fire blazing and then roasted potatoes pierced on tongs over it. Once they were tender, we dabbed some butter on them, and a pinch of salt and pepper. The potato skin was hot and crisp, the inside deliciously oozy. We sat by the fire and felt a sense of tribal brotherhood. I didn’t know then — but I do now, thanks to Pollan — that it was the fire which did it.  There is more to fire than just the role it plays in cooking. It also brings people together||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/old-flames/article34569403.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Going, gone, Goa||On May 1, India’s smallest State crested a milestone: a record 54 people died from COVID-19. Social media erupted with anger about how the number of casualties in Goa was higher than in entire countries such as Tanzania, Vietnam, and Taiwan. On its front page, the iconic oHeraldo newspaper — once the last Portuguese daily in Asia — headlined another shocking fact: on that day, the tiny territory moved past China in cumulative infections. At that point, Goa’s positivity rate had reached 50%, one of the highest in the world. It has stayed in that range, even as mortality figures continue to climb. On May 11, an astonishing 75 people died from the virus, at which point it was discovered that dozens were succumbing every night due to interrupted oxygen supply in the main Covid hospital at the Goa Medical College (GMC). That revelation triggered vicious internecine sniping between the Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and his health minister Vishwajit Rane. Earlier this week, Sawant made a show of being “probably the first CM in the country to visit a COVID-19 ward” at the GMC, where he announced, “we have 100% oxygen. The problem will be resolved in a day.” But the situation remained unchanged, and Rane went to the extent of demanding “a High Court-monitored inquiry” into his own portfolio, “to find out why so many are dying”. All this back and forth has occurred in just the first few days of an astonishingly lax State-wide curfew that followed a threadbare four-day lockdown in which hotels, bars and restaurants stayed open. On the lockdown’s first day, Sawant himself inaugurated a bridge in the midst of a dense crowd of supporters. Parallel universes Exactly these kinds of cavalier antics have come to characterise the distinctly schizophrenic pandemic atmosphere in Goa. On the one hand, the healthcare infrastructure is stretched to breaking point. On the other, hordes of escapees from worse-off locations keep pouring in. It is as if two parallel universes co-exist: one is pandemic-stricken, the other is partying like it’s 2019. This grotesque dichotomy has played out — until the second wave slowed things somewhat — every evening in front of my home, next to Miramar beach in the pocket-sized capital of Panaji. Like all our neighbours, my family carefully masks up for our strictly socially-distanced breather on the sands, where we invariably encounter droves of tourists streaming out from the luxury hotel next door, refusing to follow safety protocols. They turn belligerent when requested to do so. Their collective attitude is perfectly clear: rules don’t apply in Goa; we can do what we want. The always-simmering discordance between locals and bhaille — the derisive Konkani term for “outsiders” — has turned bitter during the pandemic. One illustrative exchange recently played out on singer Chrystal Farrell’s Facebook timeline, when she posted “a humble request” to all Goa helpline services: “Guys I know you have Goa’s best interest at heart but please refrain from allowing posts from people who want to come and hang around. Once things get better, we will welcome everybody with open arms. Till then show some sensitivity, and encourage them to stay in their own states, and let us heal in ours.” Who really cares? That appeal ignited fraught debate on who genuinely has Goa’s interests at heart. Veteran travel professional John Buckenham complained, “We get the really badly behaved ones that refuse to follow instructions and throw their weight around.” Farrell added, “Don’t get me started on locals offering accommodation and transport, when the rest of the State is pleading for the government to close borders.” Then, the journalist Nigel Britto commented about “neo-Goans and other settlers who can and will just leave, if things get really bad. [I don’t] think they’re actually concerned about Goa and Goans.” Britto broke an unwritten rule by speaking out about the anxieties that plague long-term residents and natives of Goa. The facts are stark: Goans today represent less than 50% of the permanent population, and the pandemic has greatly accelerated this imbalance. There is immense concern about an unstoppable tsunami of disaffected urbanites decamping en masse from other cities and living out newly-minted Goa dreams. “Immediately after the 2020 national lockdown was lifted, we started receiving a lot of enquiries from buyers looking to settle in Goa,” says Denzil Xavier, president of the Goa Association of Realtors. The demand has been unrelenting, he says, “especially from high-net-worth individuals looking to get away from the crisis in their hometowns”. “This rising demand for a piece of paradise will only translate into higher land prices, and could put land and home ownership permanently beyond the reach of the average Goan.” The pressure on limited resources has extended to every aspect of life during the pandemic. On May 1, the Goa Association of Resident Doctors issued an uncharacteristically dramatic public letter stating, “Even in these times, VIP culture is still very much prevalent. [Doctors] who are managing more than 30 new patients at a time are told to see ‘VIP’ patients and get them admitted fast, even if many times they don’t require admission. The other critical patients who have been waiting for 2-3 hours then fight with us.” An anonymous but widely circulated WhatsApp message claimed that several such incidents involved “outsiders” who used political connections to “throw their weight around.” “When we moved [from New Delhi to the river island of Corjuem] in 1998, our neighbours were initially mystified,” says Orijit Sen, the pioneering graphic novelist. “Back then there were no particular negative connotations to being ‘Delhi people’, as there are now. Bernard, the seller, even told us he was happy that people from outside were buying his house because new people bring new ideas, and Goa needed new ideas. But he also urged us to always maintain siesta hours, because he wanted outsiders to respect the Goan way of life. Bernard was a wise man!” For Sen, the emergence of a new Goa evokes mixed feelings. “While the depredations of the past decade — with successive waves of newcomers investing larger sums of money — are well known, there are quieter and better changes also happening. Many people moving here value community life, are sensitive to ecological concerns, have creative skills, and are interested in contributing to Goa. But it’s a delicate balance that can turn exploitative, ugly and commercialised in a short time.” Heta Pandit, chairperson of Goa Heritage Action Group, came to Goa in the early 90s during the communal riots in Mumbai, “which is not unlike how people now are coming for respite from the pandemic or from the congestion and oppression of city life. Some writers, artists and performers are coming because Goa is conducive to creativity. Goa is a refuge for many reasons,” she says. I asked Pandit whether Goa is being irrevocably changed, and she shared this anecdote: “I was in a car with a Goan friend and someone from Mumbai. My Goan friend was talking about how things happen at their own pace in Goa and how that needs to be respected. The Bombay friend laughed and said, ‘They’ll have to learn to change. They’ll have to learn to do things our way.’ I think that illustrates the attitude that some people come with,” says Pandit. Norma Alvares moved to Goa from Mumbai in 1977 with her husband Claude. “There was absolutely no concept of outsiders nor were there hordes of people looking for a second home. Goa was considered quite a backward place, from where people were trying to go elsewhere for jobs.” From that vantage, Alvares has witnessed the spectacular rise of the former backwater into one of the richest corners of South Asia. “When we came, it was because we were interested in rural development work,” says Alvares. “Today’s neo-Goans are simply looking for sanity, a place away from the madness of the cities. They are looking for a better life.” Alvares says she sees many newcomers start off on the wrong foot. “The first thing they do is build a big wall around their property, insulate themselves from the village. This is absolutely the worst way to get integrated. In cities, each is for himself but village life is the opposite. All ceremonies and customs, from festivals to marriages, mean the involvement of neighbours. The villagers are your larger family, be they of your faith or another.” Slice of heaven But there are parallel, and welcome, phenomena at play as well. New entrants are very active in environmental issues, as they have bought their slice of heaven and now want to protect further damage to their investment, as Alvares says. “They also appear to have the time to attend meetings and speak up on social media. This must be appreciated. I recently spoke at an event organised to save Assagao in North Goa, and all the attendees were ‘outsiders’ with only a handful of Goans. It hit home hard.” In fact, if there is a ground zero for the explosive growth of new settlers, it is Assagao, which is now uncomfortably reminiscent of an extension of New Delhi, with its uneasy mix of cosmopolitanism, cliquishness and unlimited cash. In this ghetto of gentrification, some of the country’s best restaurants shelter in old Goan houses, including the superb Edible Archives, described by food writer Vikram Doctor (himself a new migrant to Goa) as “a model for how a restaurant can also be a catalyst for awareness on environmental issues, sustainability and preservation of local food traditions.” Edible Archives is the creation of the scholarly and thoughtful duo, chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar and Shalini Krishnan. Krishnan gave me an interesting insight: “People are often not sure if I’m a Goan, so I see things from both sides, and definitely see a change in perception when people think I’m from here versus when they know I’m not. I’d say it’s quite a strong feeling. But I also think it is easier here for a large variety of people to learn to fit in and feel at home in a relatively short time than in many other places I’ve lived.” Who belongs to Goa? Who does Goa belong to? These fundamental questions now hang over the social imagination and collective mindscape of residents like permanently massed monsoon clouds. The brilliant Panaji-based architect Raya Shankhwalker, whose sensitive, minimalist work is popular with wealthy would-be migrants, says, “The problem is that we are a very small population with a distinct lifestyle and culture, different from other parts of the country. The current pace of influx is very rapid, and it’s not always the case that the new people who are moving in really understand, or want to understand, the underlying ethos.” The problem, says Shankhwalker, is when a large number of people move in for the love of the place but not necessarily to be a part of its people.” Waves of migration This existential conundrum isn’t exclusive to Goa, but it does strike home viscerally hard in a territory where the collective cultural identity has been partly defined by waves of migration for at least 200 years. Since Britain temporarily occupied the territory at the cusp of the 19th century, waves of locals have cascaded out of their ancestral land to become “subaltern elites” (the term was coined by historian Cristiana Bastos) in the British and Portuguese empires and later, a swathe of post-colonial nations from Macau to Mozambique. Today, the Prime Minister of Portugal is a Goan, and so is the attorney general of the U.K. Can there be any place for nativism in a place like this? “The motivation of new arrivals in Goa is primarily to escape the misery of their own hometowns, to get away from the miasma that urban India has become,” says Rajan Parrikar, one of the staunchest defenders of Goa’s cultural ethos. By contrast, “Goans migrate only for professional or financial reasons, and Goa remains ‘home’ in every sense regardless of their physical location. I think this is a crucial difference.” Parrikar says, “This was not the compact Goans made with India. In the Opinion Poll of 1967 [in which the prospect of merger with Maharashtra was defeated], Goans spoke clearly on this matter. We wanted our identity, our way of life, and the character of our land protected, and not be washed away in the Indian tidal wave. This transformation is fundamentally illegal and undemocratic since it runs counter to the wishes of the host populace. Is there a State or community in India that would welcome liquidation of its identity and a takeover by people from without? No group of humans likes to be overtaken overnight by another. That is just the way we are wired.” The writer-photographer-columnist is the co-founder/ curator of Goa Arts and Literature Festival.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||A sense of disillusionment||The book opens with an unputdownable 42-page introduction that delves into the root of fear and despair among Muslims who have embraced the country as theirs but are polarised because of the identity they bear. The shock and shame of communal riots, orchestrated mass violence and lynchings that served political agendas and led to societal divisions during the past decades hits you, as journalist Ghazala Wahab lays bare instances from her life. Balanced narrative   She meticulously balances her narrative because she wishes to build a bridge of conversation. While she addresses fellow Muslims asking them to embrace modernity and be an integral part of positive change, she also alerts non-Muslim Indians about their perception of Muslims based on prejudice and hearsay, not facts. Self-examining her own community members, she admits it never struck her how an average Muslim struggles to stay alive because she looked at things from her position of privilege. As she researched, she found equal opportunity and justice are only concepts and that law- making and law-enforcing agencies act in contradiction to vilify and stigmatise Muslims. It is a vicious cycle, writes Ghazala, because the post-partition Muslims have remained an irrelevant votebank and sought security in their ghettos perpetuated by illiteracy, poverty and unemployment. The mullahs and clergy have easily taken them under their religious fold to exploit them. The general backwardness of the community has fed into a sense of loss of identity and unmet aspirations for Muslim youth, men and women. Personal experience In the mid-80s, Ghazala’s father shifted from their ancestral home in a middle class mohalla to an upscale Hindu-majority neighbourhood in Agra. His successful business and hobnobbing with the powerful, gave him the comfort of keeping his family under a security net. But that was till Agra was engulfed in violence post-kar seva after BJP leader L.K. Advani rolled out his rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodha in October, 1990, and was subsequently arrested. As sporadic violence spread across north India, Ghazala’s family wondered where they would be more secure — in their new neighbourhood or in a Muslim majority insulated mohalla. Ghazala’s father called his brothers to safety and her mohalla uncles requested them to move back to the old Muslim locality. Ultimately everybody stayed where they were as fury was unleashed on their community everywhere. A young collegian then, Ghazala, her parents and three siblings were at home when an angry mob led by a neighbour shouted slogans, smashed windows, pelted stones and damaged their car. Desperate phone calls for help went unanswered. When Ghazala’s father went to the police station to enquire about the adult males who were forcibly picked up from the mohalla during search operations, senior officials known to him avoided him. Those he thought had accepted him treated him as nothing more than a Muslim when it came to communal division. For Ghazala’s father it was not about being a victim but it was more about the humiliation, a betrayal of belief. Turning point Her family survived the riots but it left a scar. Her parents chose to go silent and it irked Ghazala that a victim should feel ashamed. She saw the same resignation and defeatist attitude when the Babri Masjid was razed. It unnerved her because she sensed it was a turning point not just for her family but for most Indian Muslims. “Civility was the first casualty, replaced by communal prejudice and demonstrative religion,” she writes. Many members in her extended family began to draw comfort from religious conservatism. She talks about a cousin who started wearing a headscarf and told her she was more comfortable with her Muslim friends as they didn’t have to pretend with one another, whereas to her Hindu friends she was a validation of their liberal outlook. The conversation disturbed Ghazala as she never perceived two distinct identities in herself — a Muslim and an Indian. The issue was complex and so were several disparate questions. Ghazala leans on poignant narration about the average Muslim being confused and scared through examples of those who have hidden their identity and reverted to Hinduism under perceived coercion. “They could never participate as equal partners in the country's development. Only 2.6 per cent of Muslims are in senior-level jobs and a small number have achieved a reasonable upward mobility,” she writes. On a positive note, Ghazala says Muslim society is changing. The protests against CAA/NRC in December 2019, she feels, has given rise to an assertive community even though her 1990 experience returned to haunt her in February 2020 when her paternal aunt’s family panicked as a mob reached their northeast Delhi colony. Anger and helplessness resurfaced when her aunt called her for help and her uncle refused to escape or abandon his life’s savings. The sense of fear doesn’t leave, she says.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||She’s leaving home||Jhumpa Lahiri can be credited with having birthed the diaspora novel. In the years since Interpreter of Maladies , her collection of stories about Indian-Americans trying to find their ‘roots’, won the Pulitzer in 2000, the theme of migration and dislocation has almost become a magic formula for success, with writers exploring it from every conceivable angle and readers lapping it up. Lahiri’s own subsequent novels — The Namesake , The Lowland — expanded on the theme, to considerable acclaim. We, the inhabitants of a shifting world, will, of course, find much to identify with in characters representing a class of in-between people who have made good in their new lives abroad but are still haunted by thoughts of home. At the same time, don’t such pinpricks of the mind seem precious when one thinks of the kind of migration that results in battered bodies washing up on foreign shores? Cuts like a knife Lahiri is thoroughly self-aware, as proved by her minutely thought-through writings. As such, she has resisted the tag of the ‘immigrant novel’ while struggling to bring more rarefied nuances to the concept. She moved to Italy from the U.S. to discover and recreate herself in another language. Her 2016 memoir, In Other Words , documents the transition. The pain and liberation of the transformative process is brought out there in a quote from Ovid’s Metamorphosis, where the nymph Daphne, pursued by Apollo, changes into a laurel tree, and Apollo, placing his hand on its trunk, can feel “the breast still trembling under the new bark”. The relentless onward movement of life cuts like a knife, with the past still throbbing like an unhealed wound beneath the new skin. Yet the progression is undeniably exhilarating. Dualities like this form the warp and weft of Whereabouts , whose first-person narrator dwells in contradictions. The unnamed protagonist is an attractive middle-aged academic living in Italy — one can detect shades of Lahiri (who is the director of the creative writing programme at Princeton University) in her. Quite contrary But what is more important is that she is not Lahiri — the adopted persona helps Lahiri get rid of that unbearable solipsism which marked In Other Words. Interestingly, the narrator is constantly observing her own different selves — that of a single woman addicted to solitude but not averse to having affairs, a tired teacher, a “terrible” daughter, a solicitous friend, a “survivor”. For the first time in Lahiri, we have a central character who is able to gaze at her splintered self and sometimes laugh at what she sees. This is an improvement from her earlier works of unrelenting dourness and it makes Whereabouts a mature, unapologetic novel, which makes no attempt to please. The narrator is not a likeable person, unlike, say, The Namesake ’s kind Ashima. She is peevish, judgemental, given to self-flagellation, and Lahiri leaves it at that. The woman traces her intertwined desire for solitude and company to her mother but doesn’t pity herself. The filial relationship, or its vestiges rather, is the most fully defined sketch in this impressionistic novel. Lahiri, the unparalleled interpreter of the “private morphology of families,” can be ruthless: here’s the narrator standing before her father’s grave (he died when she was 15) and addressing him: “I don’t forgive you for never having stepped into those arguments, for never protecting me, for having forsaken your role as my defender, all because you felt you were the victim in that tempestuous household.” Walking away Did that “tempestuous household” with the “oppressive mother” make her what she is? She leads a “Spartan life” alone in a flat lined with books, doesn’t own a car, shops frugally. While she is possessive about her books, she is irritated by children. Her constant self-analysis and dogged refusal to make herself acceptable can be darkly funny. For instance, there’s the incident where she cogitates at length about removing a dead, decapitated mouse, which gives her the creeps and “still reminds me of a fig in high summer: the flavor of its red flesh, the warmth in my mouth.” What knits her contrary impulses together is her clinical mind, which can stare undauntedly at the abyss. She might have a prototype in The Lowland ’s Gauri, also an academic, who could leave behind grief, and her only daughter, bolstered by her intellect: “Gauri’s mind had saved her. It had enabled her to stand upright... It had prepared her to walk away.” At the end of Whereabouts , this woman too is walking away. She is on a train to another country surrounded by a boisterous family of passengers who represent the ‘normal’ — they shout, sing together, eat ravenously. To her, they are objects of desire and revulsion, both. Theirs is the life she could have had but chose not to. Like Daphne, she is metamorphosing, choosing a new skin, rejecting possibilities. As the train carries her away to a new life, she might be saying with Elizabeth Bishop: “The art of losing isn’t hard to master;/ so many things seem filled with the intent/ to be lost that their loss is no disaster.”  Whereabouts Jhumpa Lahiri Hamish Hamilton  Rs. 499    The narrator is not a likeable person, unlike, say,The Namesake’s kind Ashima.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Walking on eggshells||One of the first things you notice about Kunal Kohli’s Ramyug (the first episode of which premiered on MX Player recently) is that hardly any actor on display seems to be comfortable with the task at hand. Perhaps it’s because the task itself is ill-defined: with the gym torsos on display and the emphasis on special effects, Ramyug clearly wants to be a vaguely modernised retelling of the Ramayana , a Game of Thrones -flavoured retelling, if you will. But nobody told the writers. The dialogue, therefore, betrays no sign of this modernisation brief — there are no indirect references to the contemporary era, nothing allusive at all, in fact. At its best, Game of Thrones worked because the dialogue was ambitious and tried to establish connections across eras and cultures. In the absence of such ambition, a period drama’s dialogue then has to gun for era-specific authenticity and, of course, strength of characterisation. Sadly for Ramyug , the show fails on both of these counts. Ram (Diganth Manchale) and Sita (Aishwarya Ojha) are either preternaturally calm or frightfully prone to forget their lines, leading to pauses either unnaturally long or not long enough. And Raavan (Kabir Duhan Singh), while he has some fun with his own heads circling around and questioning his moves, is ultimately too much of a caricature to be taken seriously as a Big Bad. The greenscreen-heavy visual effects didn’t do much for me either. If they really are looking to tap into an audience that devoured Game of Thrones , Kohli and Co. will have to do much better than this, I’m afraid. The VFX in the ‘magic’ sequences are still tolerable but the combat visual effects are comical and video-gamey. Which is surprising also because this is not a cheaply made show in general: the scale of production is apparent. Disappointing entry  Ramyug , then, is just another disappointing entry in Bollywood’s mythological genre (which was, let’s not forget, huge once upon a time). Graphic India and Hotstar’s animated show The Legend of Hanuman (which premiered in January 2021) also suffers from subpar graphics and animation — at least five to six years behind international standards, truth be told. Then there was the 2015 TV show Siya Ke Ram , on Star Plus; also caricaturish but at least had the saving grace of veteran actors like Grusha Kapoor and Dalip Tahil in supporting roles. Why has it proven so difficult for Indian creators to match the popularity of Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan and B.R. Chopra’s Mahabharat ? It’s not for a lack of eyeballs, as the re-runs of these shows have proven with their record-breaking statistics. It’s not for a lack of intent either, as several A-list Indian actors and directors have expressed interest in launching big, ambitious, expensive mythological projects of their own. Online trolls The main problem is that when it comes to the Ramayana and the Mahabharata , creators are walking on eggshells. Say the wrong thing, or even the right thing in the wrong way, and you will have FIRs and the state’s full might launched against you, not to mention a very dedicated army of trolls online. This also leads to a scrambled brain, one that cannot decide whether to lean into the philosophical and religious aspects of the texts themselves (this was where Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan reeled in its audiences). The alternative, of course, is to treat the story like a purely visual spectacle — like the Baahubali films did so successfully. In fact, it may well be Prabhas (the star of the Baahubali films) who breaks the run of bad form the mythological genre has been suffering. He’s no great shakes as an actor, to be honest, but he has the charisma and the physique of a true blue action star. His next project, Adipurush , is a Ramayana adaptation: Prabhas plays Rama while Bollywood stars Kriti Sanon and Saif Ali Khan play Sita and Ravana, respectively. As one of the most expensive films to be ever made in the country (the budget is estimated at upwards of Rs. 500 crore), the success or failure of Adipurush could decide Indian creators’ appetite for the mythological genre.  If they really are looking to tap into the audience that devouredGame of Thrones, Kohli and Co. will have to do much better than this||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/walking-on-eggshells/article34569436.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1 On May 16, 1817, the Washington was launched on the Mississippi River, marking the start of a service that runs till this day. The boat was propelled by a high-pressure, horizontally mounted engine turning a single stern paddle wheel. It was the first to have two decks, an upper deck for passengers and one below the main deck for cargo. What type of boat, named after its power source, was this, to which you were probably introduced by Mark Twain? 2 Whistling in a warship has always been strongly discouraged and till 1910 was a punishable offence in the Royal Navy. In the old days all orders were passed by means of a whistle, and so whistling could lead to confusion. There was also a superstition that whistling brought wind, which was not always welcome. The only person who was allowed to whistle was the ship’s cook, who had to do so when preparing dishes. Why was that? 3 This is a type of multi-hulled boat that has parallel hulls. This allows it to be a geometry-stabilised craft, and due to smaller hydrodynamic resistance it requires less power to be propelled. The first versions of these were invented to sail across the Indian Ocean. The name comes from the Tamil words kattu and maram which mean ‘tied’ and ‘trees’, respectively. What type of boat is this? 4 This word comes from the Venetian term for ‘40 days’ and was used in the 14th century to refer to the period for which a ship was required to be isolated before the passengers or crew could go onshore. This was done to stop the spread of the plague during the Black Death. What word is this that is in common use once more due to the pandemic? 5 Ramon Artagaveytia from Uruguay was born in 1840 into a family steeped in the history of the sea. When he was 31 years old, to escape from a fire on the ship America , he jumped into the sea and swam to safety. He was so emotionally scarred that he didn’t set foot on a ship again until 1912, when he decided to head to the U.S. Unfortunately for him, that trip was also his last. On what ship was his last trip? 6 This is a small, narrow boat propelled by a double-bladed paddle. It has a covered spray deck that prevents water from entering the craft. These boats were first used by indigenous hunters who lived within the Arctic circle. The name comes from the word qajaq in Greenlandic. What boat is this that you would now see in rivers in adventure resorts? 7 ‘The Claw’ was an anti-ship weapon designed to lift a rival ship by the prow and then drop it, often causing the vessel to capsize. It was invented to defend the city of Syracuse and was used during the Second Punic War in 214 BC. It was designed and built by a Greek engineer and astronomer. Who is this person who invented ‘The Claw’ and was known for his experiments in his bathtub? 8 A water sled is an unpowered, inflatable boat that’s meant to be towed behind another boat. It consists of a big main tube that riders sit on while keeping their feet on two laterally flanking tubes. The tube is usually yellow in colour and slightly curved. Due to the colour and shape, by what name is the water sled better known, especially at seaside fun resorts? 9 The measurement that ships use for navigation is the nautical mile. The term for one nautical mile per hour is a word we normally use in a totally different context. The term comes from the fact that in the olden days, the speed would be measured by throwing a log into the sea. This was attached to a long rope that had twists at even intervals. What word is this that is used to measure a boat’s speed? 10 This is a type of boat that manoeuvres other boats or ships by either pushing or pulling them using a tow line. These boats, though small, are very powerful and have high torque thanks to their diesel engines. Recently, a flotilla of these boats was responsible for helping the huge tanker that had been stuck in the Suez Canal. What is the name given to these boats because of the action they do? A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/easy-like-sunday-morning/article34569445.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||A film worth listening to||It’s movie night. Grab a bowl of popcorn, turn down the lights, put on your headphones, hit play, close your eyes...and enter the theatre of your mind.... You hear the crashing of waves, water against wood; the strains of a violin rise under and above the sound of the sea, and then, a faint, insistent voice emerges. “Wallace, are you there?” More burbling and lapping, mingling with the orchestral notes toward a crescendo. Despite the sonic drama of the opening, the conversation that follows is typical separation fare: a couple whose words bounce off the un-hearing other. But that’s just background for a complex tale of corporate intrigue featuring a respected doctor struggling with demons from the past, a high-tech heist, and good old blackmail. Wallace Conway — army veteran and community doctor — is compelled by a strange voice channelled through an invisible earpiece (implanted while he was asleep) to perform a series of criminal acts. Otherwise, “The Conductor” says, his family will die. So, Wallace embarks on one task after another, teetering between believing he’s gone crazy and being very afraid for his family’s safety.  Shipworm is a feature-length audio “movie” produced by Two-Up Productions, the American podcasting company that created Limetown (2015), a critically acclaimed drama podcast that mashed up true crime with paranormal mystery, in the tradition of The X-Files . Limetown’s popularity prompted a television show (2019) and a novel that serves as a prequel. Writer Zack Akers brings to Shipworm the same style of psychological thriller that has just enough real-world detail in it to make you go, “Huh, this could actually happen!” The set-up is compelling; the central character is sharply drawn, and the action proceeds at breakneck pace, all unfolding against a rich aural backdrop. By the end of close to two hours, we’ve been through the wringer with Conway, feeling in equal measure hope and anger as we accompany him to the finish line where — possibly — he might be rescued and redeemed. There is plenty of audio drama on the podverse, some serialised in half-hour bursts and others in even shorter chapters. Formats vary from scripts read aloud to full scale dramatisations with sound effects. After all, drama has been a staple of radio entertainment for decades. What makes Shipworm different is its length, which is comparable to the average feature film. This also makes it a more demanding listening experience; you must commit to the duration if you are to really immerse yourself in the story. It is nevertheless possible — but not very satisfying — to listen in bits and pieces. Imagining faces Of course, the experience of listening to a movie demands that you put faces to the voices, imagine the locales and the backgrounds, and fill out the personalities of the actors. Broadway stars Quentin Earl Darrington as Wallace Conway and Miriam Silverman as The Conductor offer convincing performances, but some of the other roles, less so. The plot too has its weaknesses, particularly the somewhat unsatisfying end. But still, it keeps you listening, and wondering, till that point. Given that we are spending so much time staring at the glowing screen, it might not be such a bad idea to give one’s eyes a rest while our ears pick up the slack, and our minds colour in the rest. So grab that popcorn, pull on the eye mask, lean back, and listen. The Shipworm may just get [to] you.  By the end of close to two hours, we’ve been through the wringer with Conway, feeling in equal measure hope and anger as we accompany him to the finish line where he might be rescued and redeemed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-film-worth-listening-to/article34569454.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||The vivacious fighter||I knew she was feeling low — a little unusual for my 83-year-old mother. Her blood pressure had spiked. In our phone conversations, she, however, kept insisting all was well. I decided to drive down and check her out. I noticed that there was swelling on her face and legs. After testing negative for COVID-19, Amma was admitted to the ICU of the hospital where I had taken her. She battled relentlessly in the days that followed — sometimes losing, sometimes bouncing back and very often, hovering in the red zone of high carbon dioxide levels, increased heart rates and low BP. Amusing complaints When I would meet her during the visiting hours or when the doctors would want to brief me, she would amuse me with her complaints about the upma being bland or that she was only being given rice gruel. She told my wife that she did not understand why she was being retained in the hospital when her condition now was not high but low BP! One day, Amma sent word through the ICU staff that she wanted some coconut oil. A wave of relief surged through me because the demand for coconut oil meant that she wanted to get back into her “best appearance” mode — being well groomed was her second nature! In fact, she might have been one of those rarest of rare patients who wore matching clothes even on her way to hospital. Another call, I think, was on the sixth day. The doctor felt her condition had worsened and wanted to know if I would want to have her hooked to a ventilator, if needed. The next day saw her make a remarkable recovery so much so that the doctors appeared surprised. Although weak, she managed to ask me whether it was COVID that afflicted her? Her BP plummeted, somewhat unexpectedly, the next day and this made the doctors shift her back into the ICU. This time she was perhaps too weak to even put up a fight. She died of cardiac arrest on the morning of Vishu (April 14), having lived a full life, pretty much on her own terms. She chose to leave rather than live with what life support systems or hospitals could offer! Being very much ‘in’ life, Amma realised the reach of WhatsApp. Though she started her WhatsApp innings by sending a smiley as condolence to someone, she mastered its nuances so much so that she was adept at sending GIFs and forwards! She might have even made friends in the nice place that she might have gone to! ashokwarrier27@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-vivacious-fighter/article34569386.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Obedience and understanding||“You can force the people to obey; you cannot force them to understand,” goes a Confucius saying. In 2006, we were planning our return to India from the U.S. the following year. As the Indian school curriculum was heavier, my daughter, who was five, required some extra coaching in maths. I was her tutor, and she hated maths, calling it “deadly”. In the late afternoon, after her nap time, she would practise maths. I was keen on making her sit for about an hour-and-a-half, much to her dislike. As this routine continued, one day, even after my repeated calls, she did not come out of her room. I got irritated and my shouts grew louder. Yet there was no response. Sensing something amiss, I checked her room but found it empty. After searching the whole house, I realised that my daughter was missing. Panic-stricken, I immediately called my neighbour. She was kind enough to help me and went around the house searching. She suddenly heard a weak mumbling sound coming from the closet. When we tried to open the door, it refused to, as the lock had jammed. We were convinced that my daughter was behind the closed door. The first thing that struck me was that my little one would be suffocating inside. I hurriedly pushed the intercom buttons to get the community office’s help. A few minutes after my call, the security officer arrived and in a few seconds, he managed to unlock the closet. There, amid a pile of clothes, sat my little one with eyes wide open and confused. As she walked out, the security officer asked her how was her time in the dark closet. She did not respond and quietly came and hid behind me. “Ah! She is just shocked... she will soon get over it,” the officer chuckled and walked away. I profusely thanked my neighbour. All along, there was not a word from my girl. It was as if she had forgotten to speak. I carried her fondly in my arms and asked her, “Why did you not respond to the officer? Where you shocked and scared inside?” “The darkroom was not as scary as maths,” she said. Only then I was pushed to reality. All along, I was making her obey but never could make her realise the importance of maths. priyasri_m_1976@yahoo.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/obedience-and-understanding/article34569392.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Making a train wait||We were a family of five living in the small temple town of Tiruvennainallur, connected to the railhead on the Villupuram-Tiruchi chord line. The railhead six km away can be reached by bus. It was the summer vacation of 1950. Father had planned to take us to our grandfather’s village, another temple town 20 km from Vriddhachalam for the holidays. My grandfather would send a cart to take us from the station to the town. We were all agog with the prospect of a train journey and the fun of seeing the steam loco chugging as it slows down and blows steam. We set off on the bus to catch the train. It was a passenger train at a laughable speed compared with that of the present superfast services. We used to feel that longer the journey the better. As we were nearing the railhead, we found the train had arrived. We missed some fun seeing it roll down the platform and come to a halt. Had the level crossing been open, we would have been dropped a few yards from the platform. We got down from the bus. Father ran with the trunk, mother followed with two bags, and we children hurried as best as we could. On top of it all, the tickets had to be purchased from the counter manned by the stationmaster himself. He was ready with his green flag and could not see us on the other side of the train. He gave the signal. But he did not get the guard’s green signal response and the train did not move. He must have been worried. Fortunately for us, the guard in the last compartment with open guardrail had noticed us and in a warm gesture of goodwill on seeing our plight, delayed his signal, giving us time to get into the train. He knew that if we missed this train, we would have to wait for the next day’s train. The stationmaster acknowledged the guard’s action, ran to the counter to issue the tickets and put us on the coach and flagged the train off. As children not caring for the near miss or the hit, we vied with each other for the window seats while our parents heaved a sigh of relief. Our vacation set off with gusto. Looking back, we hope our parents would have thanked the guard and the stationmaster in their own way.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Setting them free||Three images are central to the story ‘The Crow with a Swollen Throat’: the crow, food, and Carnatic music. All three, as ideas outside the story, are connected to different periods of our historical and social past. While the crow in Hindu philosophy symbolises our ancestors, food and music are associated with ritual and community. Within the story, the three are tied to various phases of the protagonist’s past — both suppressed and revoked — building a narrative of memory and forgetfulness. Ambai’s collection of short stories, A Red-necked Green Bird , explores modernist concerns with its simultaneous rejection and invocation of the past. Psychologically candid, the stories capture the human mind in all its uncertainties. They tread paths of mythology-legend-philosophy (at the personal level as well) even as they have conversations with the present. Life in metros, and all that comes with it — the real estate mafia, loneliness of old age — form the storyline of ‘In the City that Rises From Ashes’. It evokes a past of trade unions, mills, and then charts the emergence of the underworld, malls, five-star hotels, art galleries — all of which erase an entire way of life. Poems of the Dalit poet Narayan Surve, the folk music and dance form, lavani , and the legend of the burning down of Khandavaprastha to build Indraprastha make up rich strands of the story. ‘The Crow’ and ‘In the City’ sum up Ambai’s preoccupations, which range from the mythological to the social, drawing from each other. If the spiritual is part of the new social, then we get that too it in the titular story. Certainly among the best in the collection, this story follows the journey of Vasanthan towards spirituality. At the same time, Ambai builds a rich counter-narrative to spirituality in Mythili’s determination to hold on to the responsibilities of her home and child. Ambai is deeply concerned about women, who are the protagonists of most of her stories. In her works, she has repeatedly sought to rescue them from conventional constructs. In this collection too, we find women in situations and experiences that portray them as they are. Bestowed the authenticity of experience, they are thus set free.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||When the sky poured acid||This novel is about a way of life lived in close proximity to nature that is being systematically destroyed by the demands of ‘development’. It is a polemic which seeks to expose the powerful who thrust their plans upon a people without seeking their opinion. Set in a fictional African village, the story is as close to reality as it gets, with its nuanced peeling of the complexities of human nature. Imbolo Mbue excels in unravelling the dichotomies of existence. Not leaving much to chance, the story starts by presuming its own end: “When the sky began to pour acid and rivers began to turn green, we should have known our land would soon be dead.” The reader comes to expect a plot charting the defeat of a tiny village at the hands of a corporate giant and this is precisely the tale told by Mbue. What is unexpected is the way she depicts individual suffering, which usually gets subsumed in records of mass oppression. Ultimately, the familiar David-and-Goliath tale of tussle between a ruthless oil company and a defiant forest community veers towards a nuanced exploration of self-interest. Capturing the changes wrought in people contaminated by industrial crimes, Mbue delivers compelling vignettes of resistance and compliance, neglect and exposure, litigation and corruption that make the exploited people lose their sense of purpose. Like her award-winning debut novel, Behold the Dreamers, about an African immigrant struggling to become an American citizen, this one too empathises with the legal and constitutional inadequacy of individuals fighting for survival. How Beautiful We Were is an impactful novel which will rekindle hope in the resilience of the human spirit. The writer is an independent researcher and academic.

No organisation that has survived for so long can do so without an astute grasp of India’s socio-political realities, and using that knowledge to evolve and grow. It therefore stands to reason that a study of its recent strategies could yield insights for students of Indian democracy. Social historian Badri Narayan’s Republic of Hindutva: How the Sangh is Reshaping Indian Democracy is meant to be such a study. Taking the BJP’s electoral successes in the 2014 and 2019 elections as a nodal point of analysis, Narayan argues that the RSS has changed, and what we have now is a “new RSS” that, “in a break from its old radical image, does not want to create communal tensions in society.” If it is startling to have the “old” RSS’s radicalism presented merely as a matter of image, Narayan goes a step further and takes at face value the claim of RSS pracharaks that “the blame of communal riots damages their credibility and reputation, which they acquire through hard work”. Curious outcome This casual elision of Hindutva violence is followed by the extraordinary claim that the “new RSS” has bowed to “democratic imperatives — such as equality and justice” and adapted to “the logic generated by democratic values”. Is this perhaps why India is getting tagged as a “partly free” democracy following seven years of RSS-BJP rule? Narayan doesn’t dwell on what Hindutva is, and whether Hindutva values can ever be reconciled with democratic values. The curious outcome of such an approach is that we are left wondering if a Hindu majoritarian project could actually be compatible with democracy, justice and equality. There is no denying the Sangh’s track record of social service or that its mobilisational work at the grassroots level among the most marginalised of OBC, Dalit and Adivasi communities have paid political dividends for the BJP. But does this mean it has changed in character? “People need to see the real RSS instead of its old shadow,” insists Narayan. “Criticism of its organisation-based violence... cannot defeat the RSS, because the outfit has the strength of appropriation and inclusion.” When organisations, or even humans, for that matter, display new patterns of behaviour, the first question facing the social scientist is whether the change reflects an alteration in their nature or is merely a temporary deviation. Republic of Hindutva is marred by a tendency to confuse strategic compromises with some kind of transformation of the soul. Reams of scholarly studies have documented the organic link between communal violence and the electoral success of the BJP. It is, therefore, troubling to find yet another attempt to re-brand the RSS in a manner that foregrounds its political smarts and humanitarian work while seeking to ring-fence it from the reputational damage caused by linkages with sectarian violence. Hindutva empowerment It has become common, especially after 2014, to argue that it is pointless to dwell on the violence of Hindutva politics because it is more inclusive than ‘secular’ politics. There is apparently a new political phenomenon, ‘subaltern Hindutva’, which is all about empowering the subaltern by bringing them into the Hindutva fold. But what is the nature and ontology of Hindutva empowerment? What are the conditions of its being? Can it exist without the staging, or at least the threat, of public violence? Would it be as alluring without the promise, if not a guarantee, of impunity for anti-minority violence? As Amrita Basu notes in her book, Violent Conjunctures in Democratic India (2015), “Using violence can empower groups that otherwise feel powerless. Violence that denigrates and humiliates members of another community can forge subjectivities among its perpetrators.” Narayan is right to scold the secular parties for being dismissive of Hindutva empowerment. But he errs in discounting the role of violence in his study of how a supremacist outfit has been so successful in navigating a democratic polity.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Some fund fundas||Dear Agony Akka,  I am torn in two. I have collected some money to help people suffering from COVID-19 and I am looking for the best agency to which I should donate. In my school and college WhatsApp groups, everyone is telling to give to PM CARES Fund. I had almost decided that, but then I saw one tweet where Virat Kohli and his beautiful wife Anushka Sharma also started a fundraising campaign. Now I don’t know what to do. Nowadays our Prime Minister is looking handsome just like Sage Valmiki but compared to Virushka? No chance. Please help. Who should I give my hard-earned money to? —Ready and Willing   Dear RAW,  Ah! Choices! Choices! I am faced with just such a dilemma each and every time I go to Starbucks. It takes me 10-15 minutes to read the long list of coffees only, and then they ask about sugar varieties and cream and milk and cinnamon and cocoa and my god, my head is spinning. Everything looks good and what should I buy? Since their coffee pricing is roughly the same as monthly rent for 1BHK flat, you want to think hard. Like how you are suffering now. Two wonderful donation options — which to pick? Let’s look at each choice diligently. The best part about PM CARES is that it is a fun fund; it has one hippie vibe to it, a dashing, devil-may-care attitude that I am finding attractive. It is the James Dean of relief funds. Nobody knows where the money comes from, nobody knows where it is going, nobody can ask. Is it a fund? Is it a plane? Maybe the fund is there? Maybe it is not? It is all maya. If, like companies, relief funds can have mission statements, this one’s would go like this. “This is a fund. It has your money. Your money is my money. My money is my money. Money is like hair. Chignon today, gone tomorrow. Swaha.” You see what I mean? This fund has swag, like my nephew says. But now there is Virushka! Also demanding your two paise! And it really does not get more swag than those two, does it? I mean, look at his muscles! Look at her eyes! Look at his muscles again! Never mind, what was I was saying? Ah yes, the darling couple is collecting Rs. 7 crore total amount for Covid relief and you want to contribute. The Virushka fund is not hippie. It is purposeful. The toothsome twosome has put in Rs. 2 crore of their own into it. That can’t be easy. The Vir of the equation is apparently the third richest cricketer in world with net worth of Rs. 900 crore. The Ushka’s net worth is more paltry — some Rs. 300-400 crore. And the two have to make the same tough choices that the bold and the beautiful have to make across India. Whether to take vaccine in Lilavati or Breach Candy? Whether to escape to Maldives or Bali? Private jet or yacht? That is why they are only giving two crores and taking the rest from fans like you. You must feel honoured. If PM CARES has swag value, Virushka fund has brag value. At the next party you attend, sometime in 2025, you can tell people you helped the power puff couple raise money. People will take masked selfies with you. But if you really want to fight Covid, my humble advice is to ignore all this and make video like Amitabh Bachchan. You can recite one Jhansi-ki-rani type of poem and pump your fist. Virus will get very scared. Also, no money involved. —AA   agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/some-fund-fundas/article34569443.ece

South won the opening heart lead with his ace and led a low club to dummy’s queen, West ducking of course. He then ran off five trump tricks and both high diamonds, leaving this position: Declarer led his last spade and West was helpless. Should he discard a heart, dummy would part with a club and take two more tricks with hearts. A club discard by West instead would see a low heart discard from dummy.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Sonar Kella and other forts||The allure of Rajasthan has inspired many to write books on this desert State, which has one of the world’s richest lineage of forts. Where The Forts of Rajasthan carves out its niche is the virtual tour it offers readers during a pandemic complete with photographs and illustrations. Written lucidly, the book recreates the aura of bygone times, tracing the history of the State and its people — bringing to life the Mughals and the Rajputs, the Sultanate and the Marathas and of course the British. Palace intrigues The compelling narrative is of Rajput bravery and also their disunity, which made them seek the Mughal umbrella of security, often entangling themselves with the palace intrigues of the Mughals. According to the authors, Rajasthan’s story goes beyond that of the Rajputs, embracing the Bhils and the Meenas who were brave soldiers and hardy agriculturists. They were said to be the original builders of fortifications at Ranthambore and Amber. The loyalty of Bhil archers to Maharana Pratap, perceived to be the symbol of lifelong resistance against the Mughals, against Akbar is notable. Rajasthan also displays India’s gift of assimilation, with some of the most famous Mughals like Jehangir and Shah Jahan being born of Rajput princesses. The book highlights how this blend of cultures was transmitted to the arts and architecture. The amalgam, according to the authors, came from many sources — invaders crossing the Hindu Kush, Sultanate armies marching to the Deccan, and from trading routes too. Each fort has a tale to tell. The book unravels the history of each fort and the battles it has witnessed, the sieges it has withstood or surrendered to. The stories of Udaipur, Chittorgarh and Kumbhalgarh are fascinating. One cannot step into Chittorgarh without thinking of Padmini, Allauddin Khilji, Akbar’s siege, the legendary battle of Haldighati, Rana Pratap, his mount Chetak, and Jauhar. Chittorgarh has not only been part of folklore, but had also inspired a French composer, Albert Roussel, to write an opera-ballet, Padmavati after a visit to this fort, say the authors. The gigantic fort of Kumbhalgarh is named after Kumbha and is also the birthplace of Rana Pratap. It encompassed entire villages within its walls, providing support services like iron-forging for weaponry, upkeep of horses, cattle-rearing and of course farming. Miniature paintings Ajmer, known mostly for its Dargah, so captivated a former French Prime Minister that he is believed to have expressed a desire to spend his last days here, according to a citation on the wall of the Government Circuit House in Ajmer, from Kingdoms of Yesterday by Sir Arthur Lothian, the then Chief Commissioner of Ajmer. The writers not only narrate the history of the places, they also discuss the various schools of painting which surfaced during those times and are prevalent to this day, like the Bundi school of painting or the more famous Bani Thani, and engineering marvels including underground furnaces, boiler tanks and heating systems. Jaigarh’s foundry was established in 1587, where much of the Mughal battlegear for campaigns in Balkh, Bukhara and Kandahar were made. According to the book, the world’s biggest cannon on wheels is here. It ends with Jaisalmer and Sonar Kella, the golden fortress, which is bound to touch a special chord with Bengalis, many of whom find the State synonymous with Satyajit Ray’s eponymous movie spun around his famous sleuth, Felu da. The immersive experience of Forts of Rajasthan makes it a must-read book.  The reviewer is an independent journalist based in Kolkata.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Testing and the importance of low positivity rate||Early detection and isolation of potentially infectious individuals are the keys to successfully fighting a viral pandemic. The importance of diagnostic testing to facilitate this cannot be overemphasised. A widely deployed and efficient testing strategy can go a long way in limiting the spread of new cases as it significantly reduces the chance of individuals with undetected virus exposure from roaming freely among unexposed individuals. Specialised kits Depending on the type of diagnostic test used, testing can turn out to be expensive in terms of machinery, manpower and other resources especially when these are at a limited supply. COVID-19 testing required specialised testing kits that were not easily available in January 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic in India . Although the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and India had also reported its first case of COVID-19 on the same day, until about the second half of March 2020, India’s COVID-19 testing was largely confined to symptomatic airport travellers and contacts with known sources.  India went into a complete nationwide and staggered lockdown starting March 25, 2020. However, our testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 was still being evolved. A closer look at the different revised testing guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) throughout the period of the pandemic shows the scope of testing got gradually expanded to include different population subgroups only as new incidences of novel coronavirus infection were reported from those groups. Instead of using it as a pre-emptive strategy, our testing strategy appeared to be a game of catch-up with the spread of the virus. Naturally, the virus always outsmarted this testing strategy. A complete lockdown is widely perceived as a tool to expand resources including ramping up testing infrastructure along with other healthcare infrastructure instead of being a solution in itself. However, an analysis of the progression of India’s COVID-19 cases and testing reveals that the growth of testing lagged behind that of cases during the pre-peak phase of both the first and the second wave. The second wave saw daily new cases growing three-to-four times higher than the growth of tests. Vastly underprepared Although the second wave came more than a year from the onset of the first wave, it appears that India’s testing infrastructure remained highly insufficient and vastly underprepared. This becomes obvious when we see that average daily new cases recorded during the second wave grew more than four-fold compared to that during the peak of the first wave, while the daily average testing grew only by 60% during the same time. At the end of the first wave of COVID-19, in early February 2021, India was doing about 63 tests per detected case while the daily testing has decreased to 4.5 tests per each detected case during recent times. Even at the peak of the first wave, India was doing about 11.4 tests per detected case. The average daily test positivity rate was only 8.5% at the peak of the first wave, whereas, the average positivity rate reached 22.8% a few days ago when India was reporting close to 400,000 daily new cases. The WHO, on the other hand, recommends raising daily testing enough to bring the test positivity rates below 5% level. Glaring statistic Yet another glaring statistic points to the serious deficiency of testing during the current wave of this pandemic. India reported a total of 108 lakhs COVID-19 cases with the help of 20.3 crore tests, during the first wave that lasted about 375 days. However, for the second wave so far, in 95 days, India already reported 130 lakh new cases by conducting only 10.6 crore tests. At about 229 tests per 1000 people, India’s testing remains below that of 112 other countries. There has been wide variation in testing across states in India too, ranging from a low of only 76 tests per 1,000 people in Nagaland to 1,314 tests per 1,000 people in Lakshadweep. Among the larger states, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh carried out the lowest number of tests per 1,000 people while Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala and Karnataka did the highest. In recent days, however, several states including Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Arunachal Pradesh have been decreasing their daily new tests even as their test positivity rates are still rising. If the tests are reduced while the cases are still rising, it will manifest in an increased test positivity rate. While the reduced number of reported cases may be inadvertently interpreted as a peak of the present wave, the pandemic will continue unabated whether we detect more cases or not. The downside to this would be an unnecessarily prolonged pandemic straining our healthcare system and the economy even further while putting more lives at risk.  Combined capacity Dr. Balram Bhargava, the chief of ICMR in a press conference on May 11, stated India has a daily capacity of doing 16 lakh RT-PCR tests and 17 lakh Rapid Antigen Tests which indicate a combined capacity of 33 lakh tests per day. Yet, it is unfortunate that India has not done even 20 lakhs of daily testing on any day from the beginning of this pandemic. For a country of 140 crore people, it is grossly inadequate. It is high time India makes use of its full testing capacity and augments this capacity even further to effectively fight this pandemic. The growth of testing should far outpace the growth of the cases in order to be ahead of the epidemic curve rather than chasing it.  (Rijo M. John is Health Economist and Adjunct Professor, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi, Kerala.)   India has a daily capacity of doing 16 lakh RT-PCR tests and 17 lakh Rapid Antigen Tests.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||New skink species from Western Ghats||In September 2019, a group of herpetologists gathered at Anaikatti hills in Coimbatore for the South Asian Reptile Red List Assessment organised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). When Achyuthan Srikanthan from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, suggested an impromptu night visit to a nearby private farm, little did they know they would stumble upon a new species: an Asian gracile skink. Slender and slight Named Subdoluseps nilgiriensis, the reptile has a slender body of just about 7 cm and is sandy brown in colour. Based on genetic studies, the team writes the new species is closely related to Subdoluseps pruthi found in parts of the Eastern Ghats. “The new species was found in a dry deciduous area, showing that even the dry zones of our country are home to unrealised skink diversity. There is an urgent need to change the notion that high biodiversity can be found only in the wet and evergreen forests,” says Aniruddha Datta Roy, corresponding author of the paper recently published in Zootaxa.  He adds that most of the studies in Tamil Nadu are carried out only in the protected areas and focus only on megafauna such as tigers, elephants and other such. “We also need to study the little-known animal groups inside our forests. They are fundamental and indispensable components of our biodiversity,” adds Prof. Roy from the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. Secretive habits Most skinks are diurnal and are usually secretive. Being elusive, not much is known about their natural and evolutionary history. “This species is only the third skink species discovered from mainland India in the last millennium. Such discoveries give us an understanding of how underestimated our reptile species diversity truly is,” adds Prof. Roy. Skinks are non-venomous. They resemble snakes because of the often-inconspicuous limbs and the way they move on land. Such resemblance has led to confusion often resulting in humans killing this harmless creature. “We are yet to study the breeding and feeding habits of this new species. Other skinks are known to feed on insects such as termites, crickets and small spiders, and we assume our new species has a similar diet,” adds Avrajjal Ghosh, one of the authors of the paper.  Subdoluseps nilgiriensis is currently considered a vulnerable species as there are potential threats from seasonal forest fires, housing constructions and brick kiln industries in the area. Rapid urbanisation, which has increased the road networks in the area, has also threatened its small geographical range.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||New approach combines biologics, antibody-drug conjugates||A nanoparticle designed by researchers from University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in the U.S., offers a new, potentialy revolutionary approach to treating diseases. This combines concepts of biologics and antibody–drug conjugates to produce protein–antibody conjugates that can be used for targeted drug delivery, in pancreatic cancer, for example. The team has tested the mechanism in cell lines in the lab. Their research is published recently in the journal Angewandte Chemie.  The new concept, Protein–Antibody Conjugates or PACs, combines two different approaches to drug delivery. One is biologics, where the idea is to target a defective protein in the system by delivering proteins to it. An example of this is the case of insulin treatment. If a person is short of insulin, which is a protein, they are given a shot of this to balance the system. The reason this works is because we need a circulation of insulin outside the cells. “Now, we have 20,000 proteins and when one of these is malfunctioning, we have no way of taking that protein specifically inside the cell. That is a big problem in biologics,” explains Sankaran Thayumanavan, Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts, who led the research. “It will be a gamechanger if we can take the protein inside the cell. So, people have been looking at protein delivery for a while.” Antibody conjugates The other approach is to use antibodies for drug delivery. Antibodies are something the body produces to detect a foreign substance inside the body. “We can develop antibodies to recognise anything that does not belong in our bodies. That includes cancer cells as well. If there is something different on the surface of a cancer cell compared to a healthy cell, you can design the antibody that [recognises it and] selectively goes to the cancer cell,” he explains. Drug molecules can be attached to the antibody, forming drug–antibody conjugates. Protein–antibody conjugates or PACs, developed by the group, which have a protein attached to the antibody, can zero in on, say, pancreatic cancer cells. This could have an impact on so-called incurable diseases. Most drugs work this way: If the protein has a particular shape – bent concave like a cup, for example, the drug is designed to fit into the bent portion, like a key into a lock, so that the protein’s function is inhibited, and it cannot function. But some of the proteins have an open structure, it is difficult to design a drug that can bind to it, because it is so wide. However, using a protein molecule, which is typically large, can solve this problem. Undruggable cases Pancreatic cancer is an example. “There are [types] that are considered undruggable... We know what we should target but we do not know how to design drugs that will bind. But with proteins we know we can design molecules that will bind to the target,” says Prof. Thayumanavan. He compares the PAC to an addressed envelope containing the drug. The antibody plays the role of the address and indicates the cell where the drug should precisely be delivered. Biology involves complexity and this method may well fail if it is not tuneable. “In our lab we are already developing three different polymer platforms, each of which has its own tuneability… the concept is real, and it is important at the molecular level we understand how to tune it,” he says.  The concept is real, and it is important at the molecular level we understand how to tune it.

The lensless cameras have numerous vision applications in sectors including augmented reality, virtual reality, security, smart wearables and robotics where cost, form-factor and weight become major constraints. A spokesperson for IITM said in a release, “IIT Madras and Rice University researchers have developed a deep learning algorithm for producing photo-realistic images from the blurred lensless capture.” While the IITM team was led by Assistant Professor Kaushik Mitra of the Department of Electrical Engineering, the research by Rice University was led by Professor Ashok Veeraraghavan. “Existing algorithms to deblur images based on traditional optimisation schemes yield low-resolution, ‘noisy’ images. Our research team used ‘Deep Learning’ to develop a reconstruction algorithm called FlatNet for lensless cameras resulting in significant improvement”, Dr. Mitra said. “FlatNet was tested on various real and challenging scenarios and was found to be effective in de-blurring images captured by the lensless camera”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/iitm-develops-algorithms-for-lensless-cameras/article34569564.ece

Herbivores, or plant-eaters, are known to have strong jaws with broad, flat back teeth which help them grind and eat tough plant tissues. Some of the early herbivores including plant-eating dinosaurs also had strong jaws. A new study (Nature Communications) has shown that herbivores developed strong jaws after the mass extinctions that happened millions of years ago. They had to eat different kinds of plants and chew harsher materials, so they evolved stronger jaws. The team measured hundreds of fossil jaws and compared their shapes with living animals. They tried to understand the bite force, mechanical advantage and how fast the jaws shut. The researchers note that as plants diversified during the Triassic era (252–201 million years ago) the herbivores also evolved to eat the new kinds of plants. The drying conditions in the Late Triassic, led to many softer plant groups becoming less common, and dry-adapted conifers spreading worldwide. These changes also drove patterns of extinction. The hardy herbivores thrived, as other herbivores died out. Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, who co-led the study explained in a release that this sheds real light on key processes at an ecological level and helps explain why some groups died out and were replaced by others such as the first dinosaurs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/chewing-practice/article34569565.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s||The greatest disservice we can do the nation right now is to call people — all who’ve rallied on the ground and on social media to help their fellow humans — names like superheroes, warriors, and angels. I say this without taking away any of the deep appreciation and gratitude we all feel for them. There is no need for me to list what they have already achieved through their collective endeavours powered by social media and their kindness, moral upstanding, and sense of ethics. My head is bowed. But in the same breath, I also raise my voice in caution. This is not the time to be enamoured by lofty-sounding labels. They are only nomenclature, and hide the reality of the people bearing these titles like their personal crosses.  Great expectations  Calling citizens and frontline workers heroes and warriors puts them on a pedestal and creates divides, sets unreal expectations, and allows for the obfuscation of true responsibility and answerability. It’s divisive because it plays into the myth of ‘someone’ coming to the aid of the people at a time of need, especially in a country like India where our very culture is steeped in legends of strongmen stepping in to save the day. This leads to expectations, but misguided ones, that rely on faith. Moreover, this stops people from posing relevant questions to the responsible authorities. And the authorities are always the first to celebrate such dedicated, helpful workers and citizens. It’s a lovely way to deflect public scrutiny or direct questioning into their own shortcomings. Remember the flowers showered from choppers for hospital and nursing staff even as the same people were crying out for essential PPE kits last year? When we designate someone as more-than-human, a curious thing happens. We focus solely on their achievements and attribute to them powers that we believe they have and we don’t. This simple psychological move is dangerous because once it is established, we deny ourselves the possibility of seeing beyond their so-called strengths. Once we name a garbage-collector a ‘hero’ or a ‘frontline warrior’, it becomes easier to ignore the fact that they are working without protective gloves or have little or no access to education or healthcare. When it comes to private individuals, calling people heroes and warriors helps institutionalise a similar blind spot for their real concerns and needs at both the governmental and public levels.  Shifting the focus  Beyond this, there is a longer and more lasting aftermath of pedestal-ing the genuine efforts being made by frontline workers and private citizens alike. It creates a culture of seeking comfort and inspiration, of positive psychological reinforcement in the life-affirming instances of small efforts made by powerless individuals. Like many of you, I found some twisted catharsis while listening teary eyed to the story of an older gentleman afflicted by COVID-19 who gave up his hospital bed for a younger patient. That was when I caught myself giving in to the lullaby of the hero narrative. Why did he have to even make that choice? And what does his sacrifice — for it was nothing short of one — mean in the larger context of the state of the nation today. Contrast this with the questions now being asked about why British and American taxpayers’ money should come to India, a country that built a giant statue worth £330 million while allegedly receiving £1.1 billion in aid the same year? A country that has $2.8 billion to lavish on architectural refurbishment but needs individuals and corporates to donate to an opaque, private fund championed by the Prime Minister, which has shown no accountability to the people who filled its coffers?  Where are the ‘leaders’?  At such a time, naming victims warriors, or making heroes of those who are risking their mental and physical health just to be useful, is to completely ignore the root causes that exposed them to this dismal situation in the first place. I worship the power of collective, collaborative, and community effort. But not blindly. I always ask if it is required in the first place, and why? I pay my deepest tributes to those who are doing their best, but refuse to pressurise them more by relying on them or even holding them up as inspiration after having expressly voted responsible representatives into positions of power. Through the systems of Representative Democracy, we gave them authority over our lives. Why must we also give them a free pass by celebrating the efforts of common people who were given no choice, and certainly no leadership duties? This is not the time to create heroes and warriors out of morally upstanding frontline workers, private citizens, and those with internet access. Respect them, love them, and join them in the good fight if you can. Contribute your money as you see fit. Volunteer where you will. But never let the spotlight shift from the faces of those who abdicated their public duties.   The writer is a fashion and social commentator.    When we designate someone as more-than-human, a curious thing happens. We focus solely on their achievements and attribute to them powers that we believe they have and we don’t||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/indias/article34569745.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Plate of the art||Neon signs and mah-jongg tiles, surreal three-eyed birds, and foxes wielding movie cameras. You’ll spot these and more on four art plates designed by fashion designer Suket Dhir, Pakistani-American contemporary artist Anila Agha, architect and illustrator Sahiba Madan, and mural artist INSANE 51 respectively. The designers have brought their unique perspectives to ‘A Memory of the Future’, a series of artworks to be showcased at the hybrid Art Basel Hong Kong 2021. Marriott Bonvoy, the travel programme of hotel chain Marriott International, is spearheading the project to spotlight the country as an arts and culture destination. It is being done in collaboration with The Plated Project, a charitable organisation that works with artists to create limited-edition plates (proceeds of sales are used for charity). “[Art Basel] Hong Kong is working on promoting traditions, specifically Cantonese Opera [which involves music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics and acting],” says Dhir, adding that his clothes and prints feature a huge element of art because “they have a narrative and a story to tell”. Dhir’s plate, titledCantonese Opera, features a warrior on a horse with a bionic leg, surrounded by different wild animals, each documenting the scene. A squirrel holds a boom mike, a panther operates the spotlight. “I was thinking about playfulness, and experiencing life through these creatures who are our co-inhabitants on the planet. The concept was ‘A Memory of the Future’, so the idea was to do a sort of coming together of the past and the future — looking at a beautiful world where animals and humans coexist,” he says. Explaining how he watched a lot of theatre to research the traditional art form, he says, “The warrior is a quintessential role, but usually played by a man in Cantonese Opera. Here, I’ve given the role to a woman. That’s also looking at how the future is, how [traditional] roles are now kind of dissolving; there aren’t men’s roles or women’s roles, but people’s roles.”  A Memory of the Future will be available to view at Art Basel VIP Online Preview from May 19 to 21, after which it will be open to the public. Madan’s plate focusses on mah-jongg tiles, while Agha’s is on handmade stencils, and INSANE 51’s, titledNeon Signs, reflects the city at night. Approx $250-$300 for a set of four plates.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Mastering lockdowns||Last year, when the lockdown was announced, we all felt that emotion of being trapped. Outside of a timeout for being an unruly kid, nobody had ever asked us to be confined to a single space for an extended period. Sure, there are other confinements, such as cubicle corporate life (but at least you get paid there) and long-haul flights in economy. Thankfully, I have no idea how mortals eke that one out. So we banged plates, lit lamps, made Dalgona coffee and sourdough dosas , all in a bid to release the resulting stress. I don’t know if it really helped anyone; it certainly flooded my timeline with a lot of cheap imitation patriotism and ugly-looking edibles. This year, however, when the lockdown was imposed in phases, last year’s episode almost served like a vaccine and, in spite of how this time around it is much grimmer, we are handling it many shades better. Even the Americans didn’t go hogging toilet paper the second time around, so clearly it was us humans as a species which was evolving. Here are a few things we now take for granted that last year were a chore.   Cleaning the house: Today we attack house cleaning like trained marines on a mission — which areas to attack first, how long to spend where. In fact, we even juggle other activities on the side. We have truly become home cleaning ninjas and Urban Clap or similar services can hire us should they run short on staff.      Home plants: Last year I killed sourdough starters and hardy plants that had genetically strengthened themselves over millennia to withstand a holocaust. This year, many people are nurturing delicate and rare plants that blossom maybe once a decade, all this in their store rooms or make-shift ghar-ka-mandir -cum-orangeries. Not me, this is one skill that evades me but still. The money plants seem happy.      Ordering online: Someone once said something about moving Earth if given the right space and a long enough pole. Well, today we can proudly state, give us a truck large enough and we’ll home deliver a swimming pool this weekend! Merely a reflection of just how comfortable we have become with committing to something without ever having seen/tried it but, hey, in the land of arranged marriages this should have always come easy.      Showers: This time 2020, I was still a slave to routine. Brush twice a day, shower (at least) once, meal timings, and all that. Then it showed us how time has been a human construct all along — or rather the endless nights I found myself up at 3 a.m. eating cheese puffs and butterscotch ice cream with peanut butter while binging a show showed me that. This year I feel more liberated as everything stands relegated in importance to more relevant things, like my feelings. And no, I don’t mean Insta-feelings which get made into a reel. I am talking about the kind that nature imbued us with. Well, I have shed the notions of daily scrubs and change of clothing, and donned instead this feeling of oneness with nature. I am finally the king of my jungle. Well, it certainly smells and looks like one.      Food: As if we ever needed an excuse to order in. But two things have made this more commonplace — major improvements in the quality of food and packaging, and the fact that the idea of ordering in (directly from them) to help restaurants survive is a real one. Never before has ordering a decadent pizza or burger ever amounted to charity. Now, it does. So, as the Priest told that kid in that weird Shyamalan movie where aliens mastered interstellar travel but couldn’t grapple with doors or a splash of water, “Swing away!”  This column is for anyone who gives an existential toss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mastering-lockdowns/article34569746.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccinating a population of 940 million||The story so far: Many States have announced their intention to import COVID-19 vaccines through a global bidding process, and several tenders inviting Expression of Interest have been issued, including by Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and also by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for Mumbai. Is the onus on States to procure vaccines? The Centre is currently pursuing a ‘Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy’, under which it has left vaccination of people in the 18-44 years age group to the States from May 1. State governments have to call for vaccine bids in an open market in the case of international imports and buy a limited domestic supply at prices fixed by the manufacturer. Vaccine makers in the country are required to provide 50% of their production to the Centre to meet the needs of the 45-plus priority age group, besides 25% to the States, and leave the rest open for purchase by the private sector. The strategy was submitted in the Supreme Court by the Centre in thesuo motucase as a step taken in an effort to incentivise and grow vaccine manufacturing. Earlier, the Drugs Controller General of India issued guidance on April 15 stipulating the conditions for the import of vaccines for restricted use in emergency situations. What is the state of vaccine availability? For the 18-plus age group, India has a population of about 940 million, and Census-based projections put the 18-44 age group at over 591 million. This makes up a total requirement of about 1.9 billion (or 190 crore) vaccine doses, at two doses each. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on May 12 that India’s domestic vaccine production in May is likely to be 8 crore doses and about 9 crore doses in June. Considering that over 18 crore doses have been administered as of May 15, of which around 14 crore are only the first dose, there is a requirement of 172 crore doses more to cover the target population. NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul has said that overall, 216 crore doses of vaccines could be available in India between August and December 2021. But this optimistic estimate includes 130 crore doses of Covishield (75 crore) and Covaxin (55 crore), and 15.6 crore doses of Sputnik V, while the rest — Bio E sub-unit, Zydus Cadila DNA, SII-Novavax, BB Nasal and Gennova mRNA — represent vaccine candidates in trials. In addition, Dr. Paul said Indian authorities were actively encouraging Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson to apply for emergency use authorisation (EUA) for their vaccines. Pfizer had applied for EUA in India but withdrew it in February this year as the regulatory authority sought additional information on its vaccine. For those not eligible for free immunisation and others who go to a private provider, prices range from Rs. 600 to Rs. 1,200 a dose for the two available vaccines, besides any hospital charges. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has announced a price of Rs. 995.40 per dose for the new entrant, the imported Sputnik V vaccine. The rule for private hospitals receiving vaccines from the government, which capped the price at Rs. 250 a dose, has been discontinued. Why do States need to import? While the States will continue to get vaccines under the Central quota for those above 45 years, they must prepare for beneficiaries in the 18-44 years age group using their own resources; private hospitals will sell to the better-off sections, mainly in urban areas, using imports. States are allowed to order only an approved number of domestically manufactured doses for the 18-44 years group, on a pro-rata basis fixed by the Central government based on a population estimate. Imports, therefore, come into play to meet the demand early. Pressure for vaccines continues to mount on governments amid the wildfire spread of the infection, with the country seeing around 400,000 cases and almost 4,000 deaths a day. This has led to several decisions that the Centre claims will improve availability. These include direct import of vaccines by States and private entities for immediate use, promoting wider domestic manufacture of Covaxin, and, if intellectual property restrictions are relaxed, domestic manufacture of foreign vaccines, which experts say will take time. At the same time, there is a demand for a free, central vaccine procurement programme to cover every citizen. Leaders from 12 political parties, including four Chief Ministers, asked the Centre to procure vaccines, domestic and international, for universal immunisation. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had recently appealed to the Prime Minister for speedy import of approved vaccines and help to set up franchised production units in India, for which her State would provide land and all support. How do vaccine imports work? In the Centre’s scheme, an “incentivised” market will increase the number of manufacturers, and thus, the availability of vaccines, although the counter view is that the decentralised, unregulated procurement system will push up costs due to weak bargaining power, and with global shortages, only pave the way for profiteering. Imports have to meet the norms stipulated by the Centre. As per the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) guidance of April 15, which is based on the recommendations of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC), foreign-produced vaccines granted emergency approval for restricted use by specified regulators such as the United States’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe, United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, or which are listed in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Emergency Use Listing, may be granted emergency approval in India. After approval, these vaccines must be subjected to a bridging clinical trial in place of a local clinical trial, as per the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019. Also, the first 100 beneficiaries must be assessed for safety outcomes for seven days, before a vaccine is rolled out as part of the vaccination programme. To speed up the availability of more vaccines, the CDSCO will process applications for restricted use in three days and registration and import formalities will be completed in three days thereafter. Every batch of a vaccine would have to be tested and released at the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, says the order. Have States issued tenders under the new plan? A number of States have constituted committees to finalise import modalities and many official tenders have been published. Uttarakhand said it would import 2 million doses of Sputnik V over two months. The Uttar Pradesh tender for 40 million doses, which closes on May 21, specifies that the “goods supplied must be as per the guidelines of the ICMR”. The State seeks six to eight million doses every month, starting seven days from the issue of the purchase order, and requires the bidder to have an import licence and import registration certificate as well as the necessary transport cold chain infrastructure. U.P. Medical Supplies Corporation, the importer, has specified a vaccine storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C in nine warehouses. Tamil Nadu has issued a tender for 50 million doses of vaccines to be delivered progressively in 90 days from the date of order, with the bid closing on June 5. Odisha has invited bids for 38 million doses, with online bids closing on May 28. Karnataka has announced that it will procure 20 million doses, while Andhra Pradesh has identified 20.4 million people for coverage in the 18-44 years group.  The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in Mumbai has floated a tender for 10 million doses from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, their Indian partners, wholesalers of manufacturers or authorised distributors of manufacturers, but barred applicants from “countries sharing borders with India”. This condition, in effect, rules out China’s two-dose Sinopharm vaccine that was approved by the WHO earlier this month. Moreover, the responsibility to maintain the cold chain and supply the vaccine at the main storage facility, any hospital or vaccination centre, is that of the applicant. In addition, taking into account the very low storage temperatures required for some vaccines such as Pfizer (-80°C and -60°C up to expiration date but refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C up to 120 hours), the tender says the responsibility to maintain such infrastructure up to the vaccination point would be that of the bidder. The Mumbai civic body currently has 20 hospitals and 240 vaccination centres. Given the complexities, States feel it is the Centre that should negotiate prices, set terms and get vaccines delivered to them from international and domestic companies, to meet the challenge of universal coverage and get the country back on its feet.  NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul has said that 216 crore doses of vaccines could be available in India between August and December 2021.

16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal announces oxygen concentrator banks for patients||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said both COVID cases as well as the positivity rate were declining steadily across the city but reiterated that citizens should not let their guard down. He also announced that the Delhi government was setting up oxygen concentrator banks (OCB) to provide oxygen concentrators to patients recovering either under home isolation or who might need oxygen post-recovery. “Today, even lesser cases of COVID have been recorded in Delhi. In the past 24 hours, 6,500 cases have come up. Yesterday [Friday], we had 8,500 cases. In the last 24 hours, the infection rate has declined even further to 11% while it was 12% yesterday. The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily however, we are not going to become negligent in any way,” he said in a video message. “From today, we are going to begin another important service — Oxygen Concentrator Banks. It has been often observed that whenever a person gets infected with the virus, their oxygen levels drop. It is imperative that COVID patients get timely oxygen. For such patients, we have created the oxygen concentrator bank (OCB) and have set up 200 oxygen concentrators in each bank in every revenue district of Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Delivery in two hours If patients under home isolation require oxygen, he said, the Delhi government’s team will ensure the oxygen concentrator reaches their home within two hours. A technician will also accompany the team who will explain to the family members how to use the oxygen concentrator. Patients who are not enrolled under the home isolation can call 1031 and avail of the facility. An Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) to manage COVID on a real-time basis in the city is also being established, Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that the government was in the process of procuring the Sputnik V COVID vaccines for Delhi’s citizens. “We have contacted Dr. Reddy’s company for the Sputnik vaccine, we have written to them but have not received a complete response as to how many vaccines they can provide. We have asked for 67 lakh Covishield doses and asked them how much and when they can provide us the vaccines,” he also said. Also, several people in recovery too are advised to take oxygen at home for a few days. For such people too, oxygen concentrators will be provided from the OCBs, he said. “Our doctors will stay in touch with all those who are being given oxygen concentrators. If the need arises to send them to a hospital, it will be taken care of and when they recover, the oxygen concentrators will be taken back from them, sanitised, and given to another patient for use. OLA Foundation and Give India are helping us deliver oxygen concentrators to every house. We are very grateful for their support. We can overcome this enormous epidemic only if we are together. This is not possible if we are alone,” he also said. Meanwhile, the ICCC, which will collate real-time data regarding hospitals, ICU beds, availability of oxygen and vaccines is being launched for what “efficient decision-making” related to the pandemic. COVID information The data, he said, will be made available to government officers through an application and will be inclusive of information of private hospitals as well as COVID care centres. “A variety of COVID-related data across the city will be collected on a real-time basis. What I mean by real-time basis is that it will capture whatever is happening at this point in time. This will be made more robust as and when we collect more and more data,” he said.

16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||The hurdles in accessing foreign COVID-19 aid||The story so far: As India ran out of critical supplies for managing the severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic — from medical oxygen to medicines, hospital beds and even vaccines — the Centre unveiled gradual measures over the past month to ease the imports of some items. Import duties and taxes were cut in some cases, while a new system was introduced for allowing foreign donors to route emergency relief to the pandemic’s frontline victims. However, there are some serious hiccups. What steps have been taken to facilitate imports of relief supplies? On April 24, the Finance Ministry announced it was dropping the basic customs duty on import of COVID-19 vaccines, and the basic customs duty as well as health cess on imports of medical grade oxygen and other equipment related to providing oxygen to patients, till July 31. Prior to this, the customs duty on the much-prescribed drug for India’s COVID-19 patients, Remdesivir, and its active pharmaceutical ingredients had been waived. On April 30, the government dropped the import duties on diagnostic kits till October 31 to help ramp up testing efforts and allowed individuals to import oxygen concentrators for personal use through courier from e-commerce portals or global vendors. The customs department was told to clear them as ‘gifts’ till July 31. Have all critical COVID-19 imports been made temporarily tax-free? No. Though customs duties have been slashed, such imports still attract the Goods and Services Tax (GST), specifically termed the Integrated GST (IGST). For hospitals, corporates or domestic entities that import such goods, 12% GST is payable on oxygen concentrators and related equipment, the same rate that is payable on domestic purchases. Vaccines attract a 5% GST. Imports of oxygen concentrators for personal use were taxed at 28%, but the government reduced this rate to 12% on May 1. So, even as special protocols have been put in place by the Shipping Ministry to ensure that vessels with COVID-19 relief material are unloaded on a priority basis and paperwork and cargo clearances are processed expeditiously by Customs and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, GST payments are mandatory for the material to be released. Several shipments sent by foreign donors, including groups of NRIs, or procured online by resident Indians from abroad, were held up due to a lack of awareness of this. G. Bansal, who, with his IIT alumni friends in London, sourced 40-odd oxygen concentrators locally and couriered them to Delhi when the city was facing daily shortages of medical oxygen, said they had to raise more funds subsequently to facilitate the GST payments to get them released. “The money wasn’t the issue, but this ended up delaying the use of those concentrators by at least three days,” he said, adding that for subsequent relief efforts, he and his friends were factoring in the GST costs as well, which would dent the quantities of relief material they send. The same tax implications arise for all Indian entities trying to import such material, be it a domestic corporate or an NGO that raises funds to import such goods. Has something been done to reduce the GST burden? Yes, but there are problems. On May 3, the Finance Ministry granted a conditional ‘ad-hoc’ GST exemption for imports of all COVID-19 relief material, including vaccines, medical oxygen and Remdesivir vials, et al, till June 30. This was in response to representations from charitable organisations, corporates and entities outside India seeking exemption from paying IGST on the import of COVID-19 relief material, said the Ministry. To avail of this IGST exemption, the material has to be “received free of cost for free distribution anywhere in India for COVID relief”. But domestic companies or charities importing these items by purchasing them, even if for free distribution in the country, cannot avail of this tax break. Moreover, entities that wish to import relief material for free distribution need a prior certification from State governments. So, global donors and their intended recipients for the donations would need to register with individual States where they wish to route relief material. Can any entity use this system to tie up with a global donor? No entity in India is allowed to receive foreign aid or cash donations unless they have an approval to do so under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). No exemption from the FCRA has been granted in the system laid out by the Finance Ministry. Moreover, FCRA-approved entities and NGOs need to have the same stated objective as the intended use of funds being donated. New rules introduced last September required such NGOs to open a bank account for receiving foreign funds at the State Bank of India’s Parliament Street branch by April 1. Many have struggled to do this, with a petition in the Delhi High Court stating that only 16% of NGOs have managed to open an account. But there is an even bigger challenge — an NGO receiving foreign funds or material can no longer transfer foreign aid to any other person, which would make it difficult to pass on the relief material to patients or smaller NGOs or groups working on the ground. What next? Nasscom has urged the Prime Minister to temporarily relax the FCRA norms, stressing that many countries and global firms are keen to help India. “However, the amended provisions of the FCRA 2020 are proving to be a deterrent. Given the humanitarian crisis, we would request the government to grant a temporary waiver to the FCRA Act and the 2020 amendments,” said Nasscom.

16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Jabs for 45 plus: AAP says fresh stock of doses has arrived in Delhi||Fresh stock of COVID vaccination doses, including 1,73,760 doses of Covishield, arrived in the Capital on Saturday for those above 45 years of age and healthcare/frontline workers, AAP senior leader and MLA Atishi said while presenting the vaccination bulletin through a video address on Saturday. According to Ms. Atishi, for 45-plus and healthcare/frontline workers Covaxin doses are in stock for 3 days and Covishield for 6 days. She added that Covaxin stock for the 18-44 category is over and the stock of Covishield doses is available for 8 days. “Yesterday [May 14], no vaccines were administered on account of Id. Hence, the total doses administered remains at 43,72,747 doses. Out of them, a total of 10,08,620 people has received both their shots and are fully vaccinated,” she said. “For those above 45 years and healthcare/frontline workers, the total doses of Covishield we have received have now increased to 31,02,450, and for Covaxin the total doses received are now at 13,91,800,” she added. For this category, she said, Delhi has received a total of 44,94,250 doses. Next instalment Ms. Atishi said she was hopeful that the next instalment of Covaxin will arrive for this segment from the central government soon. For those in the 18-44 age group, she said, the Delhi government received about 8,17,690 doses of which 1.5 lakh doses were of Covaxin and nearly 6,67,690 of Covishield. The Covishield’s stock for this category, she said, was left for about the next 8 days. “Like always, we are hoping that the Centre will supply a sufficient stock of vaccines at the earliest to Delhi, post resolving the constraints of vaccine supply. Fortunately, the COVID cases have been declining. However, it does not mean that the cases cannot increase now, or an impending third wave may not arrive in Delhi,” she said. “We are aware of the fact that Delhi has been one of the most severely affected states in the pandemic and is still grappling with the virus. It is my humble appeal to the Centre to supply sufficient vaccines, especially for those in the 18-44 age group,” she also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jabs-for-45-plus-aap-says-fresh-stock-of-doses-has-arrived-in-city/article34569769.ece
16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Riots: court denies bail pleas of ex-AAP councillor Tahir Hussain||A court here on Saturday dismissed the bail applications of former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in connection with two north-east Delhi riots cases. The court said that Mr. Hussain did not use his hands and fists but rioters as “human weapons” who on his instigation could have killed anybody, and denied him relief citing the gravity of the offence and his influence in the locality. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav passed the order on the bail applications filed by Mr. Hussain in connection with two cases of gunshot injuries sustained by two men during the widespread riots in the city’s north-east area in February last year. “It is prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” the ASJ said. ‘Rioters used his house’ “Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from the fact that his building became the hub for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst riots since Partition in Delhi,” the court remarked. The cases were registered on separate complaints filed by one Ajay Kumar Jha and Prince Bansal who claimed that they sustained injuries after a riotous mob, from the terrace of Hussain’s house, fired upon them on February 25. Dismissing the pleas, the judge stated that Mr. Hussain permitted his house to be used by rioters to play havoc upon the persons of other community. He said that there is enough material on record to presume that Mr. Hussain was “very well present” at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/riots-court-denies-bail-pleas-of-ex-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain/article34569759.ece
16 May 2021||New Delhi,||Over Rs. 1K cr. given to civic bodies: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday said the Delhi government had issued assistance of Rs. 1,051 crore for the Capital’s three municipal bodies so that the salaries of employees such as medical staff, doctors and nurses confronting the COVID pandemic on the frontlines could be paid. Mr. Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, alleged the civic bodies had not been able to disburse salaries so far due to “incompetence and corruption”. North body Mayor Jai Prakash questioned the two-month delay in the disbursal of funds, which were to be issued by the Delhi government for the first financial quarter. “To cope and emerge from this pandemic, Delhi government has issued assistance of Rs. 1,051 crore for civic bodies in such a manner that they can effectively disburse salaries to employees who have not been able to receive it until now. We hope that civic bodies’ leadership will guarantee this assistance is not used for any other activities but used only to pay salaries of employees involved in COVID-19 duty,” he also said. According to Mr. Sisodia, the total financial assistance earmarked for the civic bodies was Rs. 1,051 crores out of which Rs. 366.9 crore would be given to the East body,. Rs. 432.8 crores to the North and Rs. 251.6 crores to the South. Mr. Prakash said the three corporations were continuously writing letters to the Delhi Chief Minister and the L-G for their first quarter fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-rs-1k-cr-given-to-civic-bodies-sisodia/article34569761.ece

16 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Shopkeepers advised to follow odd-even in Shahdara||To prevent the exodus of migrants and also to enforce lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus — Shahdara district advised odd-even to shopkeepers in its markets, and they agreed. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahdara) R. Sathiyasundaram said there are three main markets in the district, including Geeta Colony, Gandhi Nagar, and the main Shahdara market where they advised the shopkeepers to open in accordance with the odd-even rule. “We asked adjacent shops to open on alternate days. Shops with even address to open on even days and shops with odd address to open on odd days. These are shops selling essentials like vegetables, groceries and dairy products. We advised them and they agreed,” he said. Another measure taken by the district is to ask vegetable street vendors to not stand close to each other as they do in the mandis in several places in Shahdara. “This serves two purposes — they adhere to lockdown guidelines on not gathering and those in residential areas also do not have to travel to mandis,” Mr. Sathiyasundaram said, adding that in an area like Shahdara with cramped lanes, people also crowd outside shops and odd-even would reduce that. “It's better not to prosecute and close such vendors which may lead to exodus due to no earning. Instead advise them to spread out, do their business and follow covid appropriate behaviour,”, he added. Talking about enforcing lockdown, Mr. Sathiyasundaram said officials on the ground keep a stricter check during peak hours as opposed to all day. The police said officials will check for lockdown violations during 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and then from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sharing data of violations in the last two weeks, Shahdara police said 2,460 persons have been challaned for not wearing masks from May 1 to May 14 and 910 people have been challaned for violating social distancing norms. More challans were made in the second week as opposed to first week as more efforts were made to enforce lockdown, the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shopkeepers-advised-to-follow-odd-even-in-shahdara/article34569765.ece
16 May 2021||May 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients||The story so far: Hospitals across the country have started to report a number of cases of mucormycosis, an invasive fungal infection affecting patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19. In common parlance, it also goes by the name ‘black fungus’, a direct reference to the blackening that is characteristic of the disease. What is mucormycosis? Mucormycosis is an aggressive and invasive fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. It can affect various organs but is currently manifesting as an invasive rhino-orbito-cerebral disease, crawling through the sinus and working its way to the brain, affecting the ear, nose, throat, and mouth. While it is not contagious, it can cause a lot of damage internally and can be fatal if not detected early. While mucormycosis is an old disease, what is perhaps new and concerning is the sudden increase in the invasive form of the sinus variant, which involves the orbit, and at times the brain, leading to blindness, stroke or death, according to Dr. Mohan Kameswaran, Chief Surgeon and Director at the Madras ENT Research Foundation, Chennai. How prevalent is the disease? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S., calls it a serious but rare disease. Without population-based estimates, it is difficult to determine the exact incidence and prevalence of mucormycosis in the Indian population, but a computational model-based method by Arunaloke Chakrabarti et al., in ajournal, estimated a prevalence of 0.14 cases per 1000 individuals in India. While the infection is being reported from many States, Maharashtra Health Minister, Rajesh Tope, told mediapersons recently that there could be over 2,000 such cases in the State as of now, and predicted that the figure may go up as the number of COVID-19 cases escalates. Dr. Ram Gopalakrishnan, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, added that while no studies exist on the current prevalence, the infection remained a possibility for one in 10,000 persons who recovered from COVID-19. What causes the disease? Diabetes mellitus is the most common underlying cause, followed by haematological malignancies and solid-organ transplants, according to acomparative studyof several papers on the incidence of mucormycosis in India, published in a recent issue ofMicroorganisms.Diabetes mellitus was reported in 54% to 76% of cases, according to a report. What seems to be triggering mucormycosis in patients post COVID-19 is, Dr. Kameswaran said, “an indiscriminate use of a high dose of steroids in COVID-19 patients, sometimes even in minimally symptomatic patients”. This leads to spikes in the sugar level among diabetics, which, in turn, renders them vulnerable. Dr. V. Mohan, senior diabetologist, Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, said steroids in some COVID-19 patients might be a life-saver, and therefore, they become a double-edged sword. Rational use of steroids is necessary, and constant monitoring of sugar levels and resorting to insulin use to control these levels if required, is essential, he added. Dr. Kameswaran said the use of monoclonal agents like Tocilizumab may be a factor, too. He added that while the fungi are present in the environment, the use of nasal prongs and other devices for oxygen delivery and possible breach of sterile conditions can possibly lead to cross-infection and hospital-acquired infection. “The question of COVID- 19 infection itself predisposing to invasive fungal disease would need further studies but cannot be ruled out at this stage,” he added. Does the disease cause any distinct symptoms? Dr. Nisar Sonam Poonam, associate consultant at the Department of Orbit and Occuloplasty at Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, said the signs to watch out for are a stuffy nose, bloody, blackish, or brown discharge from the nose, blackish discolouration of the skin, swelling or numbness around the cheek, one-sided facial pain, toothache or jaw pain, drooping of the eyelids or eyelid swelling, double vision, redness of eyes, and sudden decrease in vision. The main line of treatment is an anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B, which is given over an extended period of time under the strict observation of a physician. Surgery to remove the fungus growth might also be warranted.  How can mucormycosis be prevented? Following appropriate treatment protocols as recommended by the World Health Organization for COVID-19, including rational use of steroids and monoclonal antibodies only when they can help a patient, is important, said Dr. Kameswaran. It is important to keep blood sugar levels under control and ensure that appropriate calibration of oral drugs or insulin is done from time to time, stressed Dr.Mohan. Further, recognising the symptoms and seeking treatment early if there are two or three symptoms at a time is key. Like most illnesses, if detected early, mucormycosis can be cured.  While diabetes mellitus is the most common underlying cause, mucormycosis is also being triggered in patients who have recovered from COVID-19, due to 'indiscriminate use of a high dose of steroids'||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mucormycosis-in-covid-19-patients/article34569497.ece

Entailing an expenditure of Rs. 250 crores, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri demanded that the Lieutenant Governor intervene to ensure that beneficiaries received free rations under the scheme, which were yet to be distributed by the Delhi government. It was “shameful”, they stated, that the Delhi government’s Food and Civil Supplies Department was stating that the free rations were being provided by the Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-took-credit-for-centres-free-ration-scheme/article34569768.ece
