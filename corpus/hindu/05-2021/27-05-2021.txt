27 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR / Kolkata,||Cyclone Yaas makes landfall in Balasore, triggers heavy damage||The ‘Very Severe Cyclonic Storm’ Yaas that made landfall south of Balasore in Odisha on Wednesday tore into the border regions of West Bengal and Odisha and weakened into a cyclonic storm, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake on the eastern coast. Five persons were killed — four in Odisha and one in West Bengal. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said one crore people had been affected, and about 15 lakh people had been evacuated. National Disaster Response Force and Army personnel joined the rescue and relief operations. In Odisha, 128 villages in Balasore and Bhadrak districts were inundated following seawater ingress. The cyclone caused extensive damage to power transmission lines in coastal areas. Hundreds of thatched houses were ravaged. Yaas battered the tree cover while passing through Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts. Thousands of big trees were uprooted. According to the India Meteorological Department, the storm crossed the north Odisha coast about 20 km south of Balasore between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. with estimated wind speeds of 130-140 kmph. The cyclone hit the coast with far less intensity than what was predicted. By afternoon, the cyclonic storm had moved away from Balasore and had entered Mayurbhanj district, triggering heavy rain. The system is expected to enter Jharkhand as a cyclone. 6.5 lakh evacuated In Odisha, the coastal districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur and northern Mayurbhanj district were affected. The State had evacuated about 6.5 lakh people, including 1.52 lakh in Balasore, 1.2 lakh in Bhadrak and 1 lakh in Mayurbhanj district. Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena said the damage was being assessed. Collectors of Balasore and Keonjhar had confirmed two deaths, he said. As predicted by the IMD, tidal surge was observed above 4 m in Balasore and Bhadrak. “Inundation was reported in the Dhamra area of Bhadrak district and Bahanaga, Remuna, Baliapal and Balasore town of Balasore district. People had cut roads at several places to discharge water. The embankments would be repaired soon,” said Mr. Jena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cyclone-yaas-makes-landfall-in-balasore-triggers-heavy-damage/article34653724.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||WhatsApp approaches Delhi HC to challenge new IT rules||Instant messaging app WhatsApp has approached the Delhi High Court challenging the Central government’s new Information Technology Rules, 2021, which include a requirement for social media platforms to compulsorily enable “the identification of the first originator of the information” in India upon government or court order. The Facebook-owned company argued that this provision forces it “to break end-to-end encryption on its messaging service, as well as the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech of the hundreds of millions of citizens using WhatsApp to communicate privately and securely”. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, was notified on February 25 this year amidst concerns raised by various experts over its impact on privacy, freedom of expression and security of users online. While this is the first major tech company to challenge the new IT rules, the Delhi HC is already seized of petitions by several news portals, such as The Wire , The News Minute , Quint Digital Media Limited and the Foundation for Independent Journalism, over its attempt to regulate digital news media. The petitions claimed that the new rules seek to regulate online news portals by imposing a vaguely worded “Code of Ethics”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/whatsapp-approaches-delhi-hc-to-challenge-new-it-rules/article34653726.ece

27 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. plans to open sectors without diluting restrictions||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the government is weighing which sectors can be opened without upsetting the State’s COVID-19 protocol. When pressed, Mr. Vijayan said it was early to predict the end of lockdown. “We have few more days to decide,” he said here on Wednesday. The State’s priority was to retard the pace of the pandemic. A tangible reduction in the disease transmission rate was a positive indication. However, hospital admissions remained worryingly high. ICU beds and ventilators were still in high demand, Mr. Vijayan said. He said coir mills could open for production. Stores selling fertilizers and pesticides could do business on a week day. Fishing harbours and landing centres had started functioning. CM’s online meet The Chief Minister had chaired an online meeting of department heads. The meeting decided to expedite the processing of official files. It would soon set a limit on how many officials should examine a file and how long they could hold on to it. Mr. Vijayan said the government would adopt a drastically new approach to file processing to avoid creating more red tape. The Chief Secretary would finalise the new protocol. He said the bureaucracy should guard against leaking of information on files to vested interest. It should ensure the sanctity of classified and secret files. Administrators should only entertain requests for information that come via the RTI route. Reporting of vacancies  The government would review the reporting of retirement and promotion vacancies to the Public Service Commission (PSC). It would soon declare entitlement to prompt government service an inalienable right. At least 50% of Secretariat employees should report for duty from May 31, given the Assembly session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-plans-to-open-sectors-without-diluting-restrictions/article34653856.ece

27 May 2021||NELLORE,||Central teams complete first phase study on herbal preparation||Teams constituted by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), New Delhi, on Wednesday completed the field level retrospective studies on the herbal preparation made by ayurvedic practitioner B. Anandaiah, which claimed to have provided a cure for COVID-19. The team members collected data from 570 persons and uploaded the results of the first phase of the study in the CCRAS proforma. They also made samples of the preparation for further examination by the CCCRAS. On getting clearance from the higher-ups, they would start further studies on the preparation including toxicology, animal and clinical studies in stages, sources said. Under normal conditions, the various studies would take at least one year’s time. Now they were trying to hasten the studies to complete in about six to eight weeks as the disease rapidly spread during the second phase, the sources added. Tight security Meanwhile, Nellore Rural police tightened the security at Krishnapatnam and prevented outsiders, who came by bicycles, by walk and other modes of transport, from entering the village expecting a favourable verdict on a petition filed in Andhra Pradesh High Court pleading for resumption of the distribution of the herbal preparation. Only those with Aadhaar cards were allowed to move in and out of the village. TDP’s demand Telugu Desam Party Polit Bureau member Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy demanded that Mr. Anandiah be freed by the police. At the behest of the YSR Congress Party, the herbal preparation was being prepared clandestinely in SPSR Nellore district for use by the VIPs who are seeking it, he alleged. In Ongole, Jana Chaitanya Vedike President V. Lakshman Reddy demanded that the herbal preparation not be allowed before approval by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The mad rush for the herbal preparation turned out to be a super spreader of coronavirus infection akin to Kumbh Mela, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/central-team-studies-herbal-preparation-for-covid-19/article34653680.ece

The incident took place during the vaccination drive at a primary health centre in Barhni block. Ramsurat Varun, a resident of Audahi Kala village, said he received Covishield on April 1. However, he was given a shot of Covaxin on May 14 during his second dose. “They did not check anything. The ASHA [worker] was standing elsewhere,” he told reporters. Mr. Varun said he is now afraid of possible side-effects. While 18 persons were from his village, two others were from another. Radhe Shyam Shukla, 61, another villager administered the two vaccines, said though he did not face any side-effects, he was anxious for many days. “It is an act of negligence. It should not have happened. But now many days have passed [since May 14], nothing adverse has happened. We appear to be healthy,” he told The Hindu when asked if he would want the administration to monitor him. A probe is being carried out. Chief Medical Officer, Siddharthnagar, Sandeep Chaudhary said a clarification was being sought from officials on the ground and action would be taken accordingly. “It is a lapse because there is no guideline by the Government of India that a cocktail [of vaccines] be administered,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/major-lapse-in-giving-vaccines-in-up-village/article34653716.ece

27 May 2021||Bengaluru,||NCLT orders liquidation of Devas||The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered the liquidation of Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. while declaring that the company was not only incorporated in a fraudulent manner to carry out unlawful purposes but also its management continued to resort to fraudulent activities in relation to its 2005 controversial contract to get bandwidth from Antrix Corporation, the Indian Space Research Organisation’s commercial arm. The NCLT has directed the Official Liquidator (OL) to take expeditious steps to liquidate the company in order to prevent it from perpetuating its fraudulent activities and abusing the process of law in enforcing the award passed in 2015 by the arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and submit a report by July 7. “The incorporation of Devas itself was with fraudulent motive and unlawful object to collude and connive with the then officials of Antrix and to misuse/abuse process of law, to bring money to India and divert it under dubious methods to foreign countries,” the Bengaluru Bench of the NCLT said in its verdict delivered on May 25. A Bench comprising Rajeshwara Rao Vittanala (Member-Judicial) and Ashutosh Chandra (Member-Technical) delivered the verdict while allowing a company petition filed by Antrix on January 19, 2021, after obtaining sanction from the Central government to liquidate Devas. The NCLT found that “Devas failed to show any cogent reason as why it should not be wound up and to keep its name on the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Karnataka. The only reason apparent on record, by perusal of various pleading raised in the instant petition is that it wants to prosecute enforcement of award in question, in the name of the company in the courts.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nclt-orders-liquidation-of-devas/article34653628.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Experts seek to dispel vaccine fears||Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), when antibodies to an infection can sometimes aggravate infection or trigger a respiratory disease, is something that vaccine developers must watch out for. However, there is no scientific case that such ADE may actually trigger newer virus variants, say experts. The controversy was triggered by a much-shared article in the last few days, that claimed the French 2008 Nobel Laureate, Luc Montaigner, 89, to have said vaccination in a pandemic was lethal and there was an association between rising vaccinations and death rates. While it emerged that he did not explicitly say so, he did say that vaccinations were an “enormous mistake” as they were creating “the variants”. The interview is in French and a translation is available on the website of the RAIR Foundation, which describes itself as an “activist grassroots” organisation “to combat threats from Islamic supremacists, radical leftists and their allies”. In an excerpt from the interview, Dr. Montaigner, who in 2008 was co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), says, “It is the antibodies produced by the virus that enable an infection to become stronger. It’s what we call Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE), which means antibodies favour a certain infection.” Gagandeep Kang, microbiologist at Christian Medical Centre, Vellore, in a series of tweets on Wednesday, laid out why Dr. Montaigner’s assertions were incorrect. Vaccination was a method to teach the immune system to trigger the antibodies and specialised immune-system cells in case of a future infection by an actual virus. There were both neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies produced. ADE was identified as a “potential problem” in vaccine development, Dr. Kang said, adding an example of it was in the case of infection with dengue virus. There were four types of dengue virus and an infection or vaccination against one could trigger enhanced disease if someone were subsequently infected with a type to which there were not enough neutralising antibodies produced. “All (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines were being evaluated to see that they made high amounts of neutralising antibodies. And they are,” said Dr. Kang. However, it was important to continue studying long-term protection and immune response in vaccine breakthrough cases (infection after vaccination) to understand what was happening with immunity and safety. But so far there wasn’t any (concerning) signal, she added. In an earlier interview with The Hindu , Vineeta Bal, immunologist and professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune had said that neutralising antibodies were “good antibodies” but that didn’t make non-neutralising ones automatically bad until proven. “Their utility may be limited. Some antibodies on binding to their targets lead to ADE [Antibody Dependent Enhancement of viral infection] and they can be labelled as ‘dangerous’ or ‘bad’ in your parlance. But in an immune individual amongst a large number of antibodies, such ADE causing antibodies are pretty much impossible to identify,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-seek-to-dispel-vaccine-fears/article34653663.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM pays tribute to frontline workers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would change the planet with events in future to be remembered as either pre- or post-COVID. He grieved with all those who were suffering in the pandemic and had lost close relations to the disease, he noted. Mr. Modi, who was delivering the keynote address on the occasion of “Vesak Global Celebrations” on Buddha Purnima, pointed out that the pandemic had impacted every nation. There had been many developments that strengthened the country’s strategy to fight it. “Most importantly, we have the vaccine which is absolutely important to save lives and defeat the pandemic,” he stated. The emergence of the vaccines within a year of COVID-19 outbreak showed the power of human determination and tenacity, he asserted. “India is proud of its scientists for developing vaccines,” he observed, saluting healthcare and frontline workers for risking their lives to save others. With the Prime Ministers of Nepal and Sri Lanka and the secretary-general of the International Buddhist Confederation in attendance at the virtual event, Mr. Modi gave a call for all those who believed in humanity to come together and defeat terrorism and radicalisation. “The life of Gautama Buddha was about peace, harmony and co-existence. There are still forces whose existence depend on spreading hate, terror and mindless violence. Such forces do not believe in liberal democratic principles,” he said. Climate change Referring to climate change, he said the “reckless lifestyle of the present generation is threatening future generations”. “Our planet should not remain wounded,” he said. Buddha’s emphasis was on a way of life where respect for mother Nature was paramount, he said, highlighting that India is among the few large economies to be on track to achieve their Paris targets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-pays-tribute-to-frontline-workers/article34653667.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers hold nationwide protests, reiterate demands||Nationwide demonstrations were held on Wednesday, with farmers burning effigies of the Modi government and hoisting black flags on their rooftops and vehicles to mark six months of their sit-in at the Delhi borders seeking the withdrawal of the three farms laws. The demonstrations were held in response to a call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of hundreds of farmer unions, to observe May 26 as a “Black Day”. Twelve Opposition parties had on Sunday issued a statement in support of the call. Though Haryana and Punjab witnessed spirited demonstrations across almost all districts, there were reports of protests held in several parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. Farmers and locals marked the “Black Day” in different ways in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir and various places in Tripura and Assam in large numbers, said the SKM. In Punjab, farmers affiliated to various outfits staged sit-ins at almost all the toll plazas on the highways. They squatted on roads and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendera Modi. The protest sites at Delhi’s borders saw the numbers swell, with hundreds of farmers joining the protest. The demonstrators hoisted black flags on their tents, trolleys, cars, tractors and temporary structures at the Singhu border. Led by All-India Kisan Sabha national president Ashok Dhawale, several leaders of the outfit held “Black Day” demonstrations in New Delhi. Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads his own faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Punjab, said creating awareness about the farmers’ issues was the biggest achievement of the movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-hold-nationwide-protests-reiterate-demands/article34653622.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Amid second wave, Modi completes 7 years as PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi completes seven years in the top job of the country this week amid what he himself has termed a “once-in-a-century pandemic”. In the midst of the deadly second wave of COVID-19, his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite investing much political capital, lost to the Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal Assembly election. This, many have conflated, was a comment on the handling of the pandemic in its second avatar, especially in the later phases of polling. Will the seven-year itch, that scourge of office and other partnerships, affect Mr. Modi as it did his predecessors, from Indira Gandhi in 1973-74 to Manmohan Singh in 2011 onwards? Or will his dream run at the hustings continue? According to political scientist Ashwani Kumar of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, the pandemic is no less than a “tsunami”, disrupting existing models of governance and living, centred on health resources. “Though I hesitate to predict, the future of the ruling BJP government hinges on how quickly and effectively it addresses the issue of mass vaccination of people, especially [those] belonging to marginalised and poorer sections of society. The pandemic has threatened to test the march of the BJP from an ideological movement, then party and now the government,” he said, speaking to The Hindu . The Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh in February-March next year, he added, “promises to become a referendum on the BJP”. “The pandemic has exposed the widening gaps between the government and the party, denting the party’s reputation as a social service organisation and carrier of social capital. In short, the government needs to unveil an Indian variant of national reconstruction — a people-centric Marshall plan to modernise, upgrade well-being infrastructure in the various States, revamp the architecture of federal governance and extend the arch of individual liberties in times of existential crisis. And most important, perhaps urgently, the nation needs a healing touch, reaching out to grieving families and individuals, no matter how poor or rich, how isolated or well-connected they are. This is where the future of the national BJP government resides, at least in the immediate future,” he said. Focus on healthcare Badri Narayan, the author of a biography of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram ( Kanshi Ram: Leader of the Dalits) and a new book on the RSS titled Republic of Hindutva: How the Sangh is Reshaping Indian Democracy, said Mr. Modi’s previous appeal on governance issues should be pivoted on healthcare rather than roads and flyovers now. “This pandemic is a kind of a stop sign for the development politics that was engendered by neo-liberalism of the 1990s onwards of both the Congress and the BJP. Now, to live, to access healthcare is more important than a road or a flyover, people are looking at healthcare in situ, rather than other things,” he pointed out. He also pointed to the nature of the disease and how it had affected everyday interactions in society, the need for social distancing, the way palliative care had been taken out of the hands of relatives, to even how we grieve a death together, leading to a massive amount of “social fragmentation”. “The conceptual framework of what it means for a government to be with the people has changed and this has to reflect in the way governments react,” he stated. Reconstruction, not in the traditional sense in the aftermath of a natural disaster, but in a different conceptual framework is what the pandemic-ravaged country requires — a big ask for any government, with the first test being in March when Uttar Pradesh will go to the polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-second-wave-modi-completes-7-years-as-pm/article34653646.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Jaishankar, UN chief discuss ramping up supply of jabs||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s U.S. visit began in New York where he met United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The discussions included the subject of ramping up the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines, including a World Trade Organisation (WTO) initiative sponsored by India and South Africa to waive intellectual property protection for vaccines and other related products, according to a statement released by India’s U.N. mission. They also discussed climate change, including the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. They “agreed that greater ambitions required more resources and greater commitment from the developed world,” the statement said. Mr Jaishankar highlighted India’s priorities for its Presidency of the Security Council (August 2021) — this included a discussion of events on maritime security and on technology and peacekeeping. Afghanistan — and protecting the gains of the last two decades — was discussed at the meeting as was countering radicalisation and terrorism in the region, according to the official statement from the Indian side. The two leaders also discussed the situation in Myanmar, the statement noted. Peace efforts “He [Mr. Jaishankar] underlined our strong development partnership with Africa, Small States and Small Island Developing States. The Secretary-General conveyed his appreciation for the consistent role played by Indian peacekeepers in support of international peace and security. Their response in aiding the people of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo following the volcanic eruption was recognized.” Mr. Jaishankar also conveyed India’s support for Mr. Guterres’s candidature for re-election for a second term as Secretary-General.   The Hindu reported last week that Mr. Jaishankar would discuss the procurement of vaccines with Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson officials. Pfizer declined to comment on the specifics of the discussions as they were confidential and ongoing but a spokesperson of the company told The Hindu that Pfizer was “committed to continuing our engagement with the government of India towards making our vaccine available for use in the country.” Moderna and Johnson & Johnson declined to respond despite multiple attempts to reach out to their representatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-un-chief-discuss-ramping-up-supply-of-jabs/article34653669.ece
27 May 2021||new Delhi,||Choksi captured in Dominica||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi, who had recently fled from Antigua and Barbuda, was captured in neighbouring Dominica after an Interpol Yellow Notice was issued against him, the local media reported on Wednesday. The police in Dominica captured Choksi on Tuesday night (local time) after an Interpol Yellow Notice was issued by Antigua and Barbuda. Choksi had been living in Antigua and Barbuda since 2018 after taking the citizenship, Antigua News Room reported. The Yellow Notice is issued by the Interpol to track missing persons. Efforts are on to hand him over to the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda, the local media reports stated. Choksi, who is wanted in a Rs. 13,500-crore loan fraud in Punjab National Bank, was last seen going for dinner in his car in Antigua and Barbuda on Sunday. His staff had reported him missing after his car was found. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal had confirmed that Choksi had been missing since Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/choksi-captured-in-dominica/article34653635.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Bid by WhatsApp to stop new norms from coming into effect’||WhatsApp's last-moment challenge to the new intermediary guidelines was an “unfortunate attempt” to prevent them from coming into effect, the Centre said on Wednesday. The established judicial dictum is that no fundamental right, including the Right to Privacy, is absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions, it said. “The requirements in the Intermediary Guidelines pertaining to the first originator of information are an example of such a reasonable restriction,” said the government reacting to a legal complaint filed by WhatsApp against the new IT rules. It, however, stressed that it respected the right to privacy and had no intention of violating it while seeking details on originators of certain messages. WhatsApp, however, has said a government that chooses to mandate traceability is effectively mandating a new form of mass surveillance. “To comply, messaging services would have to keep giant databases of every message you send, or add a permanent identity stamp — like a fingerprint — to private messages with friends, family, colleagues, doctors, and businesses.” IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that while the government was committed to ensuring the right to privacy of all citizens, it was also responsible for maintaining law and order and ensuring national security. “None of the measures proposed by India will impact the normal functioning of WhatsApp in any manner whatsoever, and for the common users, there will be no impact,” he added.  ‘Breaking guarantees’ WhatsApp has said that traceability requires private messaging services like WhatsApp to keep track of who-said-what and who-shared-what for billions of messages sent every day. It requires messaging services to store information that can be used to ascertain the content of people’s messages, thereby breaking the very guarantees that end-to-end encryption provides. “In order to trace even one message, services would have to trace every message,” it said in an FAQ.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bid-by-whatsapp-to-stop-new-norms-from-coming-into-effect/article34653653.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||IMA demands action against Ramdev||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his help to stop the misinformation campaign on COVID-19 vaccination and demanding action against Baba Ramdev for his alleged remarks on allopathy and allopathic doctors. “Misinformation campaign on vaccination by Patanjali owner Ramdev should be stopped. In a recent video he claimed that 10,000 doctors and several people have died despite taking both doses of vaccine. Action under sedition charges should be taken against him,” the two-page letter said. The letter issued on Wednesday noted that India has lost over 1,000 doctors so far during the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also couldn’t take their vaccine for various reasons. Now deceitfully attributing that several people have died in spite of two doses of vaccination, is a deliberate move to stall the efforts of vaccination to reach our masses and it needs to be curtailed immediately,” said IMA president Dr.J.A. Jayalal. “IMA respects, acknowledges and compliments all systems of medicine especially our Indian system of Ayurvedic Medicine, as each system is helping our people differently. We are not against any medicine promoted by the Ministry and are happy to share in most of our public health treatment centres the drugs promoted by the AYUSH Ministry. We opposed certain drugs promoted without the approval of the Ministry as a curative drug.” Those who propagate fear of vaccination should be booked immediately, the IMA has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ima-demands-action-against-ramdev/article34653661.ece

27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Subodh Kumar Jaiswal takes charge as CBI chief||Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, a 1985-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, took charge as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Director on Wednesday. Mr. Jaiswal brings along a unique mix of experience in the field of spycraft, investigation and administrative supervision. A “balanced” person: this is how many in the police services describe him. ‘Fresh ideas’ The Maharashtra cadre officer has served the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) for 10 years. He was also on deputation with the elite Special Protection Group (SPG) for six years. “However, he has never served in the CBI before. In many ways, this will benefit the agency in terms of fresh ideas. The previous chief, Rishi Kumar Shukla, also did not have any prior stint with the CBI,” said an official. In July 2018, Mr. Jaiswal was appointed the Mumbai Police Commissioner. He became the Maharashtra Director-General of Police (DGP) in March 2019. During his tenure as the DGP, the Elgar Parishad and Bhima Koregaon cases were probed. The two cases were transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Mr. Jaiswal had some differences with the State Home Department’s approach towards the transfer and posting of police officers. He had also warned police officers against lobbying for desirable postings. The IPS officer then sought a “no objection” from the State government to secure a Central deputation, which was immediately approved. He took over as the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) chief on January 8, 2021, following which he was empanelled as one of the candidates for selection as Director, CBI. Earlier stints During his earlier stints with the Maharashtra Police, Mr. Jaiswal was a part of the probe into the infamous Telgi stamp paper scam case, which was later transferred to the CBI. He also worked with the State’s Anti-Terrorism Squad during the investigation into the 2006 Malegaon blasts case. Mr. Jaiswal has been awarded the President Police Medal for Distinguished Services in 2009, Indian Police Medal for Meritorious Services in 2001 and the Internal Security Medal (Central government).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/subodh-kumar-jaiswal-takes-charge-as-cbi-chief/article34653634.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Major lapse in giving vaccines in U.P. village||While he said the 20 people administered the wrong vaccine shots did not face any problems, he was monitoring them. “They are healthy,” he said. Scientists at the Oxford Vaccine Group, United Kingdom, have been studying if mixing the Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses could confer longer-lasting immunity, better protection against emerging variants or allow hospitals to switch jabs if stocks were scarce. Though the study is ongoing since February, the BBC this month reported preliminary findings that said of one in 10 volunteers given two AstraZeneca jabs four weeks apart reported feverishness — but if they received one AstraZeneca jab and one Pfizer, in any order, the proportion rose to about 34%. The Oxford group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, is also testing combinations of the Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine, sold as Covishield, and Covaxin are made differently. The former contains a piece of the coronavirus DNA wrapped in a kind of virus, that’s known to trigger an infection in chimpanzees but not in people. Covaxin is an inactivated whole virion vaccine. However, their purpose is the same, which is to stimulate the immune system into producing a targeted response that will protect against disease from a future coronavirus infection. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been reported to trigger rare cases of blood clot and lowering of blood platelets in some people, but similar specific associations haven’t been reported in the case of Covaxin, though the number of Covaxin doses administered in India are about 10% of the Covishield jabs. Both vaccines are known to trigger mild side effects in the days immediately following vaccination. During phase-3 trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the United Kingdom, some participants were accidentally given half the intended dose due to a manufacturing error. This led to differing interpretations of the vaccine’s efficacy, with the subset of those getting differing doses actually appearing to be better protected than those who got two full doses. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the case was an abominable example of negligence by the BJP government and demanded that the affected persons be monitored by doctors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/major-lapse-in-giving-vaccines-in-up-village/article34653636.ece

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||WhatsApp approaches Delhi High Court||The High Court has sought a response from the Centre on the pleas. WhatsApp, in its plea, has contended that the new IT Rules violate the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It highlighted the landmark judgment of the Supreme Court in the K.S. Puttaswamy case, where it held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution. More recently, the Supreme Court affirmed that the right to privacy included the right to anonymity, it argued. “Requiring intermediaries ‘to enable the identification of the first originator of the information’ in India on end-to-end encrypted messaging services constitutes a dangerous invasion of privacy,” WhatsApp said. “This would require Petitioner [WhatsApp] to build the ability to identify the first originator of every communication sent in India on its platform, as there is no way to predict which message will be the subject of such an order seeking first originator information,” it said. This eliminates the right of the hundreds of millions of Indian citizens using WhatsApp to maintain the privacy of their messages, which is antithetical to end-to-end encryption and the core privacy principles underlying it, the plea argued. It further said enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India results in significant harm, including “breaking end-to-end encryption and chilling lawful speech”. The new IT Rules also violate the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, WhatsApp argued as “privacy is inextricably intertwined with the right to freedom of speech and expression because it protects people from retaliation for expressing unpopular, but lawful, views”. “With end-to-end encryption, users feel safe to communicate freely,” WhatsApp said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/whatsapp-approaches-delhi-high-court/article34653638.ece

In a letter dated May 26, the Ministry sought confirmation and details, including contact details of the chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer, “ASAP and preferably today itself”, from all significant social media intermediaries (SSMIs). The Union government, on February 25, notified the ‘The Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021’, giving the SSMIs three months for compliance. “As you, including your parent company or any other subsidiary, provide a variety of services in India some of which falls within the definition of SSMIs ... Accordingly, as part of ascertaining the compliance to these Rules, you are requested to provide the following information …” the Ministry said in the letter.  “The Government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act. Please confirm and share your response ASAP and preferably today itself,” the letter stated.  Over the past two months, various industry bodies have written to the government seeking up to a one-year compliance window in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

27 May 2021||MUMBAI,||Tejpal case: court says some facts create doubt||While recently acquitting former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal in a 2013 sexual harassment and rape case filed by a junior colleague, the Mapusa District and Sessions Court in Goa said, “There are many facts that have come on record, which create a doubt on the truthfulness of the victim.” Special judge Kshama Joshi said, “The allegations made by the prosecutrix [victim] cannot be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. There is no medical evidence on record on account of delay in lodgment of FIR and as the prosecutrix had refused to go for medical examination.” ‘Benefit of doubt’ Mr. Tejpal was acquitted on May 21. However, the physical copy of the 527-page judgment was given to the defence and prosecution on May 25. The judgment reads, “Upon considering the entire evidence on record, the benefit of doubt is given to the accused as there is no corroborative evidence supporting the allegations made by the prosecutrix. Her deposition also shows improvement, material contradictions, omissions and change of versions, which does not inspire confidence. Hence, the prosecutrix has failed to discharge the burden of proving guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and thus [the accused] is acquitted.” Pointing out several lapses by the investigating officer (IO), the court said, “A duty is cast on the IO to conduct a fair investigation in the matter to bring out the truth. The IO has collected the CCTV footage of the ground, first and second floor but the footage of the first floor cannot be found for the perusal of the court, which is a material lapse by the IO. The IO has committed omissions and commissions while conducting the investigation in the case and has done no investigation on crucial and vital aspects of the present case.” Mr. Tejpal was accused of raping his colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel. He was arrested on November 30, 2013, by the Goa Crime Branch and granted bail on July 1, 2014, by the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tejpal-case-court-says-some-facts-create-doubt/article34653654.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Practice of detachment||In all his writings comprising the commentaries on the Prastanatraya texts, works such as Viveka Chudamani, and stotras in praise of the deities, Adi Sankara highlights the most important truth about jnana and bhakti as a sure route to release from samsara, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. In the fifteenth chapter of the Gita, the Lord directly proclaims that the secret doctrine He has taught Arjuna will enable one to fulfil his duties in life and become wise to gain liberation. Adi Sankara says that the wonderful aspects of the cycle of samsara whose origin or end is not known, is explained imaginatively in this chapter as the Aswatha or peepal tree. The entire universe is imagined as a tree with roots on the top and the branches and leaves flowing downwards to the earth. The name Aswatha is symbolic of the ephemeral nature of creation and existence that is also paradoxically endless. None can even try to fathom the reality behind all this wonderful creation. When there is no certainty about it, will it not be wise to remain detached from all involvements with family, desires and enjoyments through senses, etc? During Rama avatar, Rama is shown to succumb to the pangs of separation when Sita is missed from the hermitage. Lakshmana's advice about renunciation in this context is most valuable to all. Desire, attachment and enjoyment are fleeting experiences of this world that have to be kept at a distance. We have to understand that all objects, places and people we meet and come into contact with are temporary associations and have to be relinquished at some point of time. We cannot claim possession over any thing in this world. But the atma within is eternal and undying, and not bound by all these worldly changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/practice-of-detachment/article34653657.ece

According to C. Balasubramanian, president of the Chamber, the plan is to appoint about 50 nurses for nearly three months at the two hospitals. PSG Hospitals will provide food and accommodation to the nurses free of cost. They will be given transport, too, to the workplaces. With a surge in COVID-19 cases here, there is a need for more nurses and sanitary workers at the two hospitals. Since, appointment of nurses will have to be done by the government and that is a long process, the organisations came forward to select and recruit nurses on a temporary basis. The plan is to get qualified nurses from other cities, too. Those interested can write tonursinghelpcbe@gmail. comor contact 98422 21400. The Chamber and the Association also plan to appoint nearly 30 sanitary workers on a temporary basis and install mobile toilets at the two hospitals, he added.

27 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Fraudsters use demand for essential drugs as bait for online cheating||With increasing cases of COVID-19 and Mucormycosis reported the demand for certain drugs, fraudsters are looking for gullible victims. People, who pose as dealers of drugs like Remdesivir and Liposomal Amphotericin B, are the new entrants into online cheating. The fraudsters engage in chats or calls over WhatsApp and convince the buyer that they are dealers of certain essential drugs. Though they assure the buyer of delivering the drug after paying full or advance payment, their numbers will be ‘out of reach’ once they receive the payment. One of such dealers The Hindu interacted with over WhatsApp quoted Rs. 7,900 for a vial of Liposomal Amphotericin B. For 24 vials, the dealer quoted Rs. 1.89 lakh, 50 % which was asked to be paid to an account number as advance. Later the rate was reduced to Rs. 5,880 per vial. Though the dealer, who claimed to be from Chennai, used the name of a local pharmacy as the company name, the bank account number given to make the payment belonged to a bank at North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal. Asked whether direct payment was possible and to collect the drug in person, the dealer declined to reply and continued to demand online payment. The dealer also shared a photo of his ‘delivery man’ to convince further. However, a search of the photo using Google Lens showed it was used by a newspaper for a report on online trading last year. “I fell for the fraud as the person I interacted with posed as a dealer of Cipla and sent me an account number which had Cipla as account holder’s name. The person also listed his phone number as the customer care number of the pharmaceutical company,” says R. Raveendran of the Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore. Believing that the account number belonged to the real company, Mr. Raveendran made an online payment of Rs. 10,000, after which he had no response from the dealer. “When I informed the bank about the cheating, I was told that only the account number and the IFSC code of the branch are run through the system during the processing of the payment and the account holder’s name is not matched with the account number. The fraudster had misused the name of the pharmaceutical company,” he says. Mr. Raveendran has sent a complaint to Cipla mentioning that its name was being misused for cheating. C. Sangu, Additional Superintendent of Police in-charge of the Cyber crime station, Coimbatore, said that the public should be careful about such scams. According to him, the cyber crime station was yet to receive any complaint regarding cheating on the pretext of delivering essential drugs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fraudsters-use-demand-for-essential-drugs-as-bait-for-online-cheating/article34653837.ece
27 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown hits activities at MSMEs||Total lockdown has led to work from home option catching on in IT, ITES and even a number of corporate companies. However, for the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in the manufacturing sector, all activities have come to a standstill. According to K.V. Karthik, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, there is less than 5 % administration work at MSMEs in the manufacturing sector. If there is no revenue generating activity, there is no income. Hence, there is nothing much that can be done by the staff from home. Work from home option cannot apply to manufacturing units, he said. R. Ramamoorthy, former president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said that it is not possible for small and micro units to take up any work if the industries are shutdown. Now, with the units remaining idle, there is no income. But, they have to pay wages to workers and industries. Hence, the central government should extend moratorium for repayment of loans and interest, he said. The government should also add oxygen beds at the Covid Care Centre at CODISSIA Trade Fair complex so that more people who need oxygen support can be treated. This will help reduce the deaths, he said. At Tiruppur, the exporting and domestic knitwear units say that men and machines are essential for any significant activity to go on. There can be a few office work that can be done from home. However, these will be taken up only when the garments are produced. “We are working for multiple seasons in the western markets. It is a design driven industry and the western markets are dynamic. So, the units have to get operational at the earliest,” said Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-hits-activities-at-msmes/article34654078.ece

27 May 2021||Karaikudi,TAMIL NADU||Reintroduce lottery tickets to revive economy, says MP||The State government could reintroduce sale of lottery tickets, which was banned in 2003, said Congress MP Karti Chidambaram . Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, he contended that sale of lottery tickets would generate revenue and provide employment opportunities. For the State, which badly needed finances and was overburdened with mounting debts, the proposal would be a real solution. According to him, lottery tickets were illegally sold in many parts of Tamil Nadu and media reported that police seized banned lottery tickets. Hence, the government itself could sell lottery tickets, which would help phenomenally in reviving the economy and usher in a robust growth. With the revenue generated through sale of lottery tickets, the government could undertake development works, lay state-of-the-art roads and construct bridges, upgrade public health systems and bring about a good change in the education system, Mr. Karti said and added that the proposal could invite criticism, but he was confident of revival of the economy. On reports about shortage of COVID-19 vaccines, the MP blamed it on the Union government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had unilaterally decided to export six crore vials when there was a huge demand for the vaccine domestically. The Centre neither discussed with opposition parties on such crucial issues, nor listened to the officials, he charged. On BJP leader H. Raja’s demand to hand over temple administration to private individuals, Mr Karti said that it was not the time to discuss it. The focus should be on fighting COVID-19. However, he said that Mr. Raja's comments need not be taken too seriously and added that the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department should continue to handle the temple administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reintroduce-lottery-tickets-to-revive-economy-says-mp/article34653874.ece

Within few minutes, Sub-Inspector of Teppakulam police station Sundarapandian sent an autorickshaw to his house. The auto-driver was given a permit letter so that he faced no hurdle on the way to hospital and back home. “I had faith in the city police and they met my expectations,” Mr. Ramadoss said.

27 May 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Not sure if we can take over private school’||School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi on Wednesday said it was doubtful whether the State government could take over the Chennai-based private school, where a teacher had allegedly sexually harassed some students. Responding to a query in this regard on Wednesday, the Minister said the demand was made based on documents from 1969, which claim that land had been given to the school administration for running a pothu palli (public school) during former Chief Minister Kamaraj’s regime. Since the school comes under the control of the Central Board of Secondary Education, questions such as whether a CBSE school could be taken under the wing of the State government or not were yet to be clarified. Further steps could be initiated only after the query was answered, he added. Mr. Poyyamozhi said the department was engaged in a discussion on how to evaluate the marks required by a student to get Plus One admissions into a group of their preference, since all Class X students had been declared pass. When asked about the demand for regularisation of services of part-time teaching staff, the Minister said the demand would be considered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-sure-if-we-can-take-over-private-school/article34653806.ece

27 May 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers await announcement on release of water from Mettur dam||Delta farmers, who reaped a rich harvest of kuruvai crop last year, expect the State government to announce or at least indicate the possible date of opening of the shutters of Stanley Reservoir for release of water for irrigation in view of sufficient storage. Last year, they took up cultivation of kuruvai crop with confidence after a gap of nearly nine years since the then State government made an official announcement during the third week of May that the shutters of Mettur Dam would be lifted on the scheduled date of June 12. The timely announcement resulted in increase in kuruvai crop cultivation area by around 33,000 acres, pushing the total area brought under the short-term crop to around 3.25 lakh acres in delta districts of Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai. This year, though sufficient storage in the dam has been supplemented with widespread showers in delta districts, the delay in announcing the date of water release has virtually put the spokes on the preparation of the fields for kuruvai cultivation. “The storage level has infused confidence in us, but the reluctance on the part of the government in deciding the date of opening of shutters as well as the worrisome situation cropping up due to the second wave of COVID-19 is forcing us to do a rethink,” says V.Sankaran of Thirukattupalli. Normally, farmers of the village take up kuruvai cultivation trusting heavily the groundwater potential. Meanwhile, G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, a progressive farmer, has urged the government to make the announcement with regard to the date of opening of Mettur dam at least two weeks in advance to enable proper planning of cultivation. Expressing a similar view, Sundara Vimalanathan of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association says delta farmers are dejected as Chief Minister M.K.Stalin did not mention even a word about the opening of Mettur dam for irrigation during his recent visit to Tiruchi district. “The State government should not hesitate to lift the shutters on the customary date since the meteorological department has predicted normal southwest monsoon in catchment areas in the upstream of the Cauvery,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-await-announcement-on-release-of-water-from-mettur-dam/article34654215.ece

Since the permissible level of the reservoir is 71 feet, the PWD has issued the first flood warning. With copious rainfall experienced along the western ghats over the past month, the dam had been getting inflow from the Mullaperiyar reservoir. Farmers in five districts - Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram - are happy about the steady rise in the Vaigai dam as they depended on the water for irrigation. The farmers have appealed to the government to release water by June 4. “If we get an assurance to this effect, we can start preliminary work,” Arulprakasam, a farmer in Melur in Madurai district, said. The PWD officials, however, said that they have recommended for release and it was for the government to take the final decision on the date of water release from the Vaigai dam. The officials also said that they have given adequate caution to the people residing close to the riverbed as the discharge may be heavy in the next two to three days. Heavy wind In Ramanathapuram district, Pamban and Rameswaram witnessed heavy winds since late Tuesday night.

27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Good response from 18-44 age group to vaccine drive||The response to vaccination camps organised for people between 18 to 44 years of age by Truchi Corporation has been overwhelming. At least 1,000 people are being vaccinated daily, senior officials said. The campaign, which began on Tuesday, recorded 1,250 inoculations on a single day and is being carried out in Kalaiarangam and Devar Hall and the four corporation zonal offices at Ariyamangalam, K.

27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Aavin holds on to sales numbers as private dairies take a hit||While the State-owned Aavin has managed to maintain its average sale of milk, many private dairies in Tiruchi have reported a dip in sales. While the total lockdown has been in force since May 10, sale of milk by Aavin and private dairies remained unaffected until the third week of May, as tea and coffee stalls continued to serve customers.. The sales began to take a hit only after all the stalls were strictly ordered to close so as to prevent customers crowding in front of them. According to industry sources, about 10% of the milk produced is supplied to tea and coffee stalls. While a section of tea stall owners prefers to buy Aavin milk, others buy milk produced by private dairies. The private diaries now report zero sales on account of closure of tea stalls for the last 10 days. Since the supply chain has largely been disrupted due to the total lockdown, private dairy firms also find it difficult to sell milk procured from farmers. Closure of hostels and restrictions on conducting marriages is also said to have affected sales. “Barring supply to households, all other sale points have been closed. It is a tough time for dairy firms that do not infrastructure to produce value-added products. Hence, most of the small dairy firms have reduced milk procurement from farmers,” said a private milk operator in Tiruchi. However, according to sources, Aavin has managed to achieve the daily sales target through its retail outlets and agents. But sale of ghee, ice cream, butter, buttermilk and curd has been hit. A senior official of Tiruchi District Milk Producers Union (Aavin) told The Hindu that while there was some strain in post-procurement management, sale of milk had not come down. “On an average, we sell 1.20 lakh litres of milk in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur daily. We manage to achieve the target and we ensure uninterrupted supply of milk to the people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aavin-holds-on-to-sales-numbers-as-private-dairies-take-a-hit/article34654203.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||K. Abishekapuram most affected||K. Abhisekapuram continues to report more COVID-19 cases than the other three zones in Tiruchi. According to data available with health authorities, 1,100 patients tested positive for the virus in Tiruchi district on Tuesday. Of them, Tiruchi city accounted for 691 fresh cases. Rural areas of the district reported 343. Out of 691 cases in the city, K. Abhisekapuram accounted for 254 followed by Srirangam with 180. While Golden Rock zone reported 167 cases, Ariyamangalam registered 90. The trend has been almost the same in Tiruchi city over the last 10 days. The average daily case count in K. Abhisekapuram zone hovers around 250. Srirangam zone follows with around 175. Ariyamangalam zone continues to be the least affected among the four zones with around 100 patients testing positive a day. Cases have been reported in most of the residential colonies and areas, including Kumaran Nagar, State Bank Colony, Puthur, Srinivasa Nagar, Ramalinga Nagar, Lawsons Road, Thillai Nagar, Anna Nagar and Woraiyur, in K.Abishekapuram. Location of many hospitals, including Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in the zone, where a large number of COVID-19 patients are admitted for treatment, is said to be the main reason. At least 400 to 500 patients, who have tested positive, visit the Government Hospital at Puthur every day along with their relatives either for consultation or admission. It is alleged that many of the mild and asymptomatic patients and those under home isolation visit pharmacies and restaurants to buy food and medicine. The same situation prevails near private hospitals too. “There should be special focus to check the spread of the virus in and around hospital areas. All residential colonies should be sanitised daily in K. Abhisekapuram zone. More sanitary workers should be employed in all vulnerable areas,” says N. Jamaludeen, a consumer activist in Thennur. According to Collector S. Sivarasu, uncontrolled movement of patients and their relatives to restaurants and other areas in the zone will be monitored. Hospitals have been asked not to entertain relatives of patients in the wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/k-abishekapuram-most-affected/article34654201.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Ensuring dignity in death for patients||A Good Samaritan in Tiruchi city has single-handedly cremated nearly 100 bodies of patients who died of COVID-19 in the last month. R. Sam, a resident of Subramaniapuram, used to cremate unidentified and unclaimed bodies prior to the pandemic. He took to burying bodies of those who died of COVID-19 as many had no next-of-kin to bury them. Mr. Sam, better known as ‘Human Rights’ Sam, had seen many unidentified bodies not getting a dignified cremation. Moved by it, he took it upon himself to do it, prior to the pandemic. He befriended authorities at the police stations located around Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, and officials at the GH, who would permit him to take unclaimed bodies. “We announce the information of a person's death in local newspapers, put up posters on buses, auto rickshaws etc. We will give it a period of three days to see if anyone will come to claim the body. After three days, we take the body for cremation,” he says. “Many people, especially from rural parts of the district, still shun COVID-19 patients. Even family members of those who tested positive are ill-treated and asked not to return to the village," he rues. He cremates COVID-19 victims at the electric crematorium in Oyamari, while others are cremated the traditional way with dung cakes and firewood. “The problem arises for suspected COVID-19 cases who have all symptoms but a negative RT-PCR report. For those bodies, we usually call up a doctor and consult. We tell them the patient's case history if we can access it, and the doctor advises the best way.” Mr. Sam now has at least 60 volunteers who work with him to handle calls and requests. “We also mobilise funds, provide information on blood donors, bed availability for COVID-19 patients in hospitals and provide food for home-quarantined patients,” he says. Asked if his family is supportive of his work, he laughs. “They are against it, but do not stop me nowadays. That doesn't mean they did not try.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensuring-dignity-in-death-for-patients/article34654213.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||BHELSIA urges CM to form panel to analyse problems of MSME||The BHEL Small Scale Industries Association (BHELSIA) has requested Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to form a high-level committee to analyse problems faced by MSME sector in the State and facilitate its revival. As one of the biggest MSME clusters in Tamil Nadu, BHELSIA is prepared to take the lead and study issues relating to the sector in consultation with other associations and submit a viable proposal, its president Rajappa Rajkumar said. Units such as the Tiruchi engineering cluster have started turning into non performing assets from 2016 due to economic recession that bagen in 2012. The two waves of the pandemic have caused further damaged to MSME units, which are facing a total disaster. Promoters and employees are finding it difficult to meet their day-to-day requirements. Since the MSME sector is considered to be the backbone of the country’s economy because of the employment opportunities it generates next only to the agriculture sector, the association intends to seek an appointment with him to convey the problems being faced by the units in Tiruchi engineering cluster, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar has said in a letter to the Chief Minister. The total installed manufacturing capacity of about 450 small and micro industries is around seven lakhs metric tons per annum for fabricated and machining components. The cluster provides direct employment to 40,000 people and indirect employment to an equal number of them, the letter points out. “Having been in existence for the past 50 years, the MSME engineering units have given Tiruchi a global identity as one of the best fabrication hubs in South Asia. Apart from domestic customers, these units supply components to foreign customers also. Tiruchi MSME engineering cluster manufactures the maximum number of wind mill towers in India,” it adds. The MSME engineering units of Tiruchi have handed over 525 oxygen cylinders to the district administration and hospitals in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bhelsia-urges-cm-to-form-panel-to-analyse-problems-of-msme/article34654218.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Anticipation in the air over defence corridor project in Tamil Nadu||Citing the progress of the Defence Corridor Project in Uttar Pradesh, industry watchers here believe the new State Government will leave no stone unturned for early fructification of the Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor. Covering the five nodal cities of Chennai, Hosur, Salem, Coimbatore, and Tiruchi, the TNDIC launched in 2019 has attracted investment proposals worth Rs. 3,123 cr. from the ordnance factory boards, defence public sector undertakings, and private sector projects. Industry associations have evinced interest in playing active role along with the government for timely fulfilment of the requirements. “A momentum has been created by the Tamil Nadu government for fructification of the project, and through active involvement of industry associations, the fulfilment of procedure could be expedited,” Rajappa Rajkumar, president of BHEL Small Industries Association said. According to official sources, the TNDIC was factored in while evolving the Industrial Policy 2021, that targets attracting investments worth Rs. 10 lakh crore and create employment opportunities for 20 lakh people till 2025 in the State. According to industry representatives, land banks have to be created in the nodal cities in Tamil Nadu for attracting investors to establish their manufacturing facilities. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) started the process to allot land to 17 companies for setting up their manufacturing units earlier this year. The UPEIDA has already created substantial land banks in Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Aligarh for the project. In Tamil Nadu, timely investments for the project will hinge on the early creation of land banks where the State has to establish basic infrastructure like internal approach roads, drainage systems, water, electricity, street lights and storm water drainage system. The State also has to identify the right entity for establishing the Common Facilitation Centre, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anticipation-in-the-air-over-defence-corridor-project-in-tamil-nadu/article34654219.ece

27 May 2021||TIRUCHI/THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Black Day observed against farm laws||Members of various farmers organisations, trade unions and political parties hoisted black flags atop their homes and staged protests in the central districts on Wednesday to express solidarity with those agitating against the three farm laws in New Delhi and to press the Union government to repeal the legislation. The protest was staged in response to the call given by Samyukt Kisan Morcha to observe May 26 as Black Day, marking six months of farmers’ protests in New Delhi. At Mannargudi, P.R. Pandian, president, Coordination Committee of Tamil Nadu All Farmers’ Associations, staged a demonstration after hoisting a black flag atop his house. “Lakhs of farmers are risking their lives to stage the protest against the farm laws, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been stubborn in refusing to hold talks with them. The Centre should come forward to repeal the three laws,” Mr. Pandian demanded and welcomed Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s reported assurance that a resolution would be adopted in the Assembly against the three laws. Cadre of CPI, CPI(M) and members of various other organisations such as AITUC, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, AICCTU, CITU, AIDWA, Tamil Maanila Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam and other organisations hoisted black flags atop their houses and fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Tiruchi and other districts in the central region. The Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association organised a similar demonstration in Valapuram hamlet, near Kumbakonam. In Tiruchi, a group of farmers, led by P. Ayyakannu, president, Desiya Thennidiya Nadigal Innaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, staged a protest by squatting on the road on the Karur-Bypass Road. They raised slogans urging the Centre to repeal the laws and ensure remunerative prices for produce. Members of AITUC, CPI and CPI(M), who hoisted black flags at various places, also condemned the “anti-labour and anti-farmer policies” of the BJP government. They wanted the Centre to withdraw the anti-labour laws, halt privatisation of PSUs, ensure free COVID-19 vaccination for all and provide monthly assistance of Rs. 7,500 and foodgrains for labourers who lost their jobs during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/black-day-observed-against-farm-laws/article34654057.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||500 more oxygen-supported beds for Tirunelveli hospital||Anticipating the third wave of COVID-19, the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, having 940 oxygen-supported beds, out of 1,600 beds in total, is all set to add 500 more beds with this life-supporting facility, Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian has said. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday after visiting the facilities created for anti-COVID-19 operations in various parts of the district, Mr. Subramanian said that the government was taking steps to prepare for the ‘third wave.’ The Minister, who visited the Government Hospital at Koodankulam, said a gynaecology ward would be established there. Since demand for upgrading the hospital at Valliyoor as District Government Headquarters Hospital as it is strategically located on the four-lane National Highway is growing, Mr. Subramanian, along with Assembly Speaker M. Appavu, visited it on the invitation of the latter. “The Speaker has appealed us for the upgrading of the hospital with more facilities and establishment of Office Joint Director of Public Health at Valliyoor as the doctors have to go all the way to Tenkasi for any official work. He also showed us 400 acres of land (maeikkaal poramboke land) close to the hospital, required for expansion of the hospital and the establishment of the Joint Director’s Office. Hence, we’ll take this issue with the Chief Minister and get the permission at the earliest,” Mr. Subramanian said. When he visited the triaging centre at Gandhimathi School near Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, the Minister was much impressed with the facilities there. “Collector Vishnu has done an excellent job for screening the COVID-19 suspects by creating a triaging centre, which can also be used as COVID Care Centre as oxygen facility has been installed. The COVID Control Room created at the Collectorate for monitoring patients round-the-clock and ensuring the right medical treatment for them based on the online information they receive from the triaging centre is amazing,” Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister also appreciated Mr. Vishnu for making efforts to get more than 100 oxygen concentrators by persuading private sponsors for saving the patients undergoing treatment in the COVID Care Centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/500-more-oxygen-supported-beds-for-tirunelveli-hospital/article34653881.ece
27 May 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine production is being explored: Minister||The State government, which is grappling with a shortage of vaccines, is actively exploring possibilities of starting production from the Integrated Vaccine Complex in Chengalpattu by clearing procedural and legal hurdles, if any, Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian said. After inspecting various places in the district on Wednesday to ascertain anti-COVID-19 operations, Mr. Subramanian said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, after inspecting the complex in Chengalpattu recently to explore the possibility of starting vaccine production there, had written to the Prime Minister, seeking his intervention to put into use the unused installation on over 100 acres. The Chief Minister was studying the procedural and legal hurdles, if any, to be cleared for ensuring early vaccine production from the facility, he said. If the Centre gives its nod, it will be a giant leap in the production of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for Tamil Nadu, he said. He said vaccination, the focal point in the fight against COVID-19, should go up further, particularly in the rural areas, to make the ongoing exercise more effective and meaningful. On the ongoing vaccination drive, Mr. Subramanian said 2.53 lakh people, including 2,800 in Tirunelveli, had taken the jabs on May 25 alone. He also said the intensified lockdown, a bitter medicine, would yield better results in stopping the spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-production-is-being-explored-minister/article34654071.ece

27 May 2021||Tiruvannamalai,TAMIL NADU||A shelter for children of COVID-positive parents||A few days ago, the mother of two children, aged 10 and 11, from Tiruvannamalai was in a fix after she tested COVID-19 positive and was admitted to hospital. Being a single mother, she was clueless about where to send her children. Luckily, a government official sent them to the Children Shelter Home for COVID-19 emergency in the district. To help provide a permanent home for children who have either become orphaned due to COVID-19 or to provide temporary shelter for those whose parents have been admitted in hospitals after testing positive, the District Child Protection Unit, along with ChildLine, has started two homes in buildings run by Terre Des Homme CORE, an NGO. While the one for girls is at Perumpakkam Road in Tiruvannamalai, the one for boys is located at Thandrampet in the district. The children are first produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and then taken to the homes. “The two kids were shocked when they came in. However, we made them speak to their mother and she convinced them it was safe. We have psychologists and counsellors who speak to the children and make them feel at home. We have facilities to house them in a separate room till the RT-PCR test is taken and till the results come. Once they test negative, they will mingle with the other kids,” said A.B. Sharmila, joint director of the NGO. She said there was an indoor and outdoor play area for the children. “If the children do not have smartphones, we make them interact with their parents through video call. If some relatives approach us to take them home, after appealing to the CWC, we verify their credentials and send them along,” said Chezhian Ramu, director of the NGO. As of now, only the two brothers were brought to the shelter and they went back after their mother was discharged from the hospital. “Apart from this, children who have been orphaned due to COVID-19 can also be provided permanent shelter here,” he said. The District Child Protection Unit, Tiruvannamalai, has created awareness in villages of the homes. “We have already placed banners in hospitals and PHCs. We have gathered details about COVID-19 deaths in the district and our staff are checking if any child has been orphaned,” said S. Selvi, DCPO, Tiruvannamalai.  Ms. Sharmila said similar homes had been opened in Vellore district by them. (Childline operates a toll free helpline - 1098 - for children in distress across the country.)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-shelter-for-children-of-covid-positive-parents/article34653810.ece
27 May 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||‘More sightings sign of rise in striped hyena population’||An increase in the frequency of sightings of the elusive Indian striped hyena ( Hyaena hyaena ) in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) raises hope among conservationists and forest department officials that the species is re-establishing itself in the region. The species, whose numbers declined substantially over the last few decades, used to be seen even in the upper Nilgiris till the 1950s. In the book, Whispers from the Wild , noted conservation biologist Priya Davidar, recalls the calls of a striped hyena near her house in Church Hill in Udhagamandalam during those times. The numbers dropped since then, said B. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam. A reason for the decline in the Sigur plateau is that in the 1980s and 90s, people reared cattle in pens. After the carnivores preyed on their cattle, the farmers would poison whatever remained of the carcasses of cattle. Other carnivores that came to prey on cattle, and other wildlife such as the striped hyenas and vulture also died after eating the poisoned remains, he explained. Mr. Ramakrishnan believed that there might be around 30 individuals in the Sigur plateau with the numbers steadily increasing each year. Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone) L.C.S. Srikanth said striped hyenas usually lived alone, and were extremely difficult to spot due to their reclusive nature. He said that though studies had yet to be done to ascertain the population of the species, individuals had recently been spotted in forest ranges in the MTR buffer zone. “Camera trap images from 2012 to 2020 reveal that the striped hyena population is very restricted to the North Eastern Slope (NES) and Segur forest ranges,” he said. Field Director of MTR, K.K. Kaushal said more sightings could be a sign of the population increasing. “This could be due to a number of factors, including better protection of carnivores such as tigers, which in turn would mean more food availability for species such as vultures and hyenas that scavenge on tiger kills,” said Mr. Kaushal. Elimination of illegal tourism and lack of disturbance in the buffer zone could also be contributing to the species expanding to newer areas, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-sightings-sign-of-rise-in-striped-hyena-population/article34653836.ece

27 May 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||A tale of two sides of a road||It is a tale of two sides of a road. Borders don’t matter for people, and this has been proven in the case of Thirukkanur, a suburb of Puducherry sandwiched between the Union Territory and Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. The Puducherry-Villupuram arterial road is divided by Thirukkanur in Puducherry on one side and Sithalampattu in Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu on the other. The village presents an interesting scenario in the current context of lockdown. Shops and business establishments in the Puducherry limits are allowed to do business during current lockdown till noon while the other side of the road, falling under Sithalampattu village in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu, presents a forlorn look as Tamil Nadu is observing a total lockdown till May 31. So it is not surprising to see people from Tamil Nadu walk over to the other side and purchase their requirements as they do have the facility in their State limits. Though the Villupuram police have sealed the inter-state border with Puducherry, movement of people has not completely stopped. “Though movement of vehicles has been regulated to a great extent, except those relating to emergencies, people are making an exception to go out to the other side making use of the six-hour window in the Puducherry region.” “Though the intense lockdown in Tamil Nadu is aimed at curbing unnecessary movement, people have been walking over to the other side, defeating the purpose,” a police officer in Villupuram said. The Puducherry-Villupuram Road is divided according to the territorial limits of the two States. “It is feared that with Puducherry adopting a partial lockdown as against Tamil Nadu, the influx of people from the district to the other side for shopping could result in a spike in COVID-19 cases,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tale-of-two-sides-of-a-road/article34654051.ece

27 May 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Drug of choice to treat black fungus yet to reach districts||The State government has asked government hospitals at the district and taluk levels to treat mucormycosis or black fungus. Officials, however, are hard pressed to implement the orders as the scheduled drugs are yet to arrive in the districts and taluks. “The State government promised us in early May that doses of Amphotericin B, the drug of choice, will be allocated to districts based on the number of cases. But till Tuesday, we have not received the drugs,” said a Health Department officer in Belagavi district. Vijayapura Deputy Commissioner P. Sunil Kumar said in Vijayapura that doctors in government and private hospitals have started treatment with alternative drugs as the government is yet to ship the prescribed drug for black fungus. There are 12 cases in Vijayapura and seven in Belagavi. There have been two deaths in Belagavi, while there has been no death due to black fungus in Vijayapura. The State government, as per an order issued on May 23, allowed black fungus treatment in district and taluk hospitals, wherever treatment was possible. Earlier, it was allowed only in select hospitals. However, the government decided to issue Posaconazol in place of Amphotericin B. Hospital-wise allocation, based on admission of black fungus cases, started as per orders issued on May 24. Another officer, who is a member of the district COVID task force, said that non-allocation may be due to scarcity of Amphotericin B at the national level. “We have been told that it is equally useful, but the allocation order does not say anything about efficacy of the drug,’’ said a Health Department officer. “While Amphotericin B is scarce, Posaconazol is sufficiently available,’’ the officer pointed out. As of May 25, hospitals in North Karnataka districts have received 310 doses, in proportion to the number of patients they are treating. Doctors, however, differ. Madhav Prabhu, senior physician who has been treating COVID-19 patients since the first wave, said Amphotericin B will be his first choice as Posaconazol is not found to be equally efficacious, as per internationally accepted treatment protocols. Vasu H.V., physician and coordinator of the Karnataka C0VID Volunteer Network, said that claims over Posaconazol being able to treat black fungus as a substitute drug are partly true, though Posaconazole is a weaker drug compared to Amphotericin B. Meanwhile, Belagavi-based Shree Anand Life Sciences has obtained licence to manufacture Amphotericin B. The State government has accorded requisite permits to the factory to produce the anti-fungal drug, said a release from the company. “The factory is expected to start full production and the question of supply will be addressed to a significant extent,’’ Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drug-of-choice-to-treat-black-fungus-yet-to-reach-districts/article34653816.ece

A group of farmers sat in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office and waved black flags. The farmers sat in silence for some minutes and submitted a memorandum urging the government to withdraw the new farm laws before dispersing. Farmers leader Sidagouda Modagi said that the Union government passed the farm laws in haste and in an anti-democratic manner, only to please the corporate lobby. He said that the new farm laws will destroy small farmers who constitute around 80% of the farm community. He also asked the Prime Minister to initiate talks with farmers who were on strike in New Delhi. Similar protests were held by farmers who held placards in Hukkeri, Khanapur, Saundatti, Ramdurg and Bailhongal taluks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/memorandum-submitted/article34653817.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Doreswamy: A fighter till the very end||Two weeks before he passed away, H.S. Doreswamy had sent in his hand-written weekly column Noorara Nota , to Nyaya Patha , a Kannada weekly. It was a sharp analysis of the results of the five States Assembly polls. That sums up how Mr. Doreswamy, the Gandhian freedom fighter, worked till the very end. A man who never rested on his laurels, he continued to see a role for himself in public life and fought for “freedom”, as he continuously redefined it. He saw it in his fight for civil liberties, land rights, environmental justice, freedom of expression or against corruption and communalism. He never contested elections or held posts, but remained a citizen-activist till the last. “Gandhiji wanted the Congress to abjure political power and remain a social movement, convert itself into a permanent opposition party against misrule by any party or government,” he wrote in his column in April 2018. Mr. Doreswamy followed that path. He spared none and was critical of all governments about what he saw as “anti-people policies”. He was one of the most vocal public intellectuals of the State, whom historian Ramachandra Guha describes as “conscience of the State”. In recent years, he was a trenchant critique of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He took the lead in the recent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests and farmers’ agitation against farm laws, drawing the ire of the ruling regime. In March 2020, BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal questioned his credentials as a freedom fighter, dubbed him “anti-national” and a “Pakistani agent”. But the centenarian did not flinch or change his stance. He often called the mass movement against the incumbent regime a “second freedom struggle”. Mr. Doreswamy was particularly active in the State’s public life over the last one decade, starting with the satyagraha he held to stop dumping Bengaluru’s garbage in Mandur in 2013. He later led the State government’s initiative to mainstream left-wing extremists, where he worked with the late editor-activist Gauri Lankesh, who often described Mr. Doreswamy as “rockstar taata ”. Sirimane Nagaraj, one of those who joined the mainstream through this initiative in 2014, said after their release from prison, he tasked them to take up a struggle that affected the poor and when they chose land rights and housing, Mr. Doreswamy led the struggle from the front for several years. The murder of Gauri Lankesh in 2017 hit Mr. Doreswamy hard. He was a rallying point for the State’s civil society in demanding that the culprits be brought to book. He chaired the Gauri Memorial Trust and worked to revive her weekly tabloid, in which he was a columnist till he died. “We appear to be moving into the age of Nathuram Godse, where writers and activists are assassinated for their views,” he told The Hindu in 2019, advocating a rediscovery of Mahatma Gandhi. The Mahatma, he said, was all the more relevant today, in an age of post-truth, unprecedented violence and suppression of dissent. Never one to lose hope, he always retained optimism and belief in democratic protests and struggle on the street. “Anyone in Karnataka fighting for people and their rights knew that the door of his house in Jayanagar was always open for them. The big man would walk with you in the hot sun and to any place to inspire the movement,” said activist Srinivasa Alavilli.

At the time of discharge, COVID-19 patients who have recovered will be tested for any fungal infection and will also be subjected to an MRI scan if necessary. Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the decision was taken after a meeting with medical experts on Wednesday. “All district hospitals have been instructed to have a dedicated post COVID-19 ward. After one week of discharge, recovered patients should get themselves tested at the hospital or can also opt for tele-consultation. If symptoms are found they will be called to hospitals for further diagnosis,” he said. As per the preliminary report, Dr. Sudhakar said that the infection is reported in small hospitals, taluk hospitals, and those under home isolation in some cases. The Health Minister also said that it has been found that administering steroids in the first week of treatment of COVID-19 is one of the main causes of black fungus infection. Steroids should be prescribed only from the second week. “There are about 95 cases of black fungus which are being treated at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. Of these, 75 patients either uncontrolled diabetes or have been administered steroids during COVID-19 treatment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-discharge-policy-in-karnataka/article34653775.ece
27 May 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Speculation of leadership change haunts Karnataka CM again||The speculation of leadership change has again surfaced in BJP in Karnataka with a section of party MLAs expressing displeasure over the functioning style of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. While Tourism Minister C.P. Yogeshwar and MLA Arvind Bellad are in Delhi apparently to air their grievances with the party Central leadership, several party old timers are demanding that the Chief Minister should immediately convene a meeting of the legislature party to discuss the issues related to governance. This time they are insisting that the meeting be attended by party central observers. Party insiders feel that the demand for holding a legislature party meeting could be to set the stage ready for leadership change. “We mainly have three issues. First is that we are not happy with the manner in which the government has handled the COVID-19 situation. The government’s slack response to the pandemic hit people is showing the party and its legislators also in poor light,” an MLA from the BJP told The Hindu . The other issue that has ruffled feathers is the government’s decision to sell 3,677 acres of government land to Jindal company. The third issue, according to them, is the interference of Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra in administration. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders who are camping in Delhi have claimed that their visit has nothing to do with leadership change. But the circumstances under which they have made their visit to the national capital has earned the wrath of the Chief Minister’s camp. Some of the prominent leaders, who have not identified themselves with dissidents group, too maintain that leadership change may be “inevitable” now considering the age of Mr. Yediyurappa, who is 78-year-old. Senior Minister R. Ashok, while replying to a query by mediapersons in Bengaluru on Wednesday, confirmed that a few leaders including ministers were making efforts to effect a leadership change. However, he clarified that, his priorities were different, indicating that he was focusing on COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/speculation-of-leadership-change-haunts-karnataka-cm-again/article34653782.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||An undying Gandhian||Gandhian H.S. Doreswamy, till the very end, insisted that democratic protests have to adopt non-violent means. But, he also had a brush with radical politics for a few years during the Quit India Movement. The freedom fighter, who passed away on Wednesday, recalls in his memoir Nenapina Suruli Teredaga his association with the Quit India Movement, when he helped organise a strike by all major cloth mills in the city - Binny Mills, Minerva Mills and Raja Mills - especially since they were stitching parachute cloth, used by the British in the Air Force during the war. “We used to hurl time bombs into government record rooms and other British targets to hit their war effort. But no one was hurt,” he wrote. He often recounted how his brush with violence made him realise the futility of violence and he remained a Gandhian all his life. His initiation to the fervour of freedom struggle, however, came much earlier when he was an intermediate student in the city. “Then Bombay Mayor and Congress leader K.F. Nariman was arrested on stage and students who had gathered to hear his speech were caned, including me. A student was killed in police firing. This kindled the nationalist spirit in me,” Mr. Doreswamy wrote in his memoir. The only time he met Gandhi in person was in 1936, when he came came to rest in Nandi Hills. Though Mr. Doreswamy later went on to finish graduation in science and began working as a high school teacher, he quit his job and joined the Quit India Movement in 1942, as a 24-year-old. He was jailed for 17 months between December 1942 and May 1944. Post his release from jail, he ran a bookshop in Mysuru and was a key leader in the “Mysore Chalo Movement” demanding formation of a democratic and responsible government post Independence. He also became editor of Poura Vani , a newspaper that was banned by the Mysore government for its forthright editorials during the movement, pushing him to publish and distribute it underground. Interestingly, he published a report on January 17, 1948, that Nathuram Vinayak Godse had come as a guest for a State-level RSS meet and was staying at an RSS leader’s house in the city. Though the RSS continues to dispute this report, Mr. Doreswamy stood by the report he published. Post-Independence, though initially identified with a splinter group within the Indian National Congress, he gradually disassociated himself from the party and in the later years, remained a civic activist identifying himself with all major national and regional social movements. He was also part of movements against his former party Congress, including Jayaprakash Narayan’s Sampoorna Kranti movement in the 1970s and the more recent India Against Corruption in 2010. He was also jailed during the Emergency. “During the Emergency, I wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi saying the British were more magnanimous than her in dealing with political prisoners. I was arrested, but the court let me off, saying as a citizen I was free to write a letter to my Prime Minister, however critical it was,” he recounted to The Hindu in March 2020, lamenting on the incumbent regime’s “suppression of dissent”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/an-undying-gandhian/article34653792.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP ready with new queue system||Allocation of beds under the civic body’s Central Hospital Bed Management System (CHBMS) will soon follow an automated ‘queue system’ based on calls made to the call centre or war rooms by patients. This new system of bed allotment is likely to be implemented in a couple of days, said Arvind Limbavali, Minister for Forests, Kannada and Culture, who is also the nodal minister for war room and call centre management. The Minister held a meeting with COVID-19 war room officials to hammer out the details. In a press release, he stated that under the new system, when a request for a bed is logged into the system, the patient will be given a number automatically. Citizens will be informed of their position in the queue. This is an attempt to stop people from jumping the queue and bring in transparency to the bed allocation system. Once the system is stabilised in Bengaluru, the same will be extended to other parts of Karnataka, the release stated. According to senior BBMP officials, with the COVID-19 cases coming down in Bengaluru, the availability of general, general-oxygenated, and HDU beds have improved. The queue is valid only when there is a waiting list. However, with beds now available, allocation can happen immediately. When the plan had been mooted by Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya, it had been criticised by public health officials and even within the civic body for its failure to account for critically ill patients. At the time, doctors told The Hindu that allocation had to also be done after they assess how critical a patient is and not just on the basis of a token. For patients in need of critical care, a priority/emergency queue system will be in place. After tele-triaging or physical triaging at the Physical Triage Centres, such cases will be pushed by the zones to the ‘superuser’ (central COVID-19 war room) or 108. These patients will be attended to on priority out of the queue system. “While the queue system is automated, the priority queue will be handled manually. The entire system is being tested and will be rolled out in a couple of days,” an official stated. Four-hour window Mr. Limbavali added that several changes have been incorporated in the bed allotment system. Reminder SMSes will be sent to patients, who have been allotted beds, if they do not reach the hospital within four hours of the allotment. The information will be shared with the nodal officer in hospitals. However, the allocation of a time slot had also been criticised, as beds are often occupied after five-six hours, civic officials had told the The Hindu in the past He said that the State war room and the BBMP war rooms will be brought under one umbrella. In preparation of the third wave that experts state would affect children more than others, special wards in government and private hospitals would be established.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-ready-with-new-queue-system/article34653765.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No more sealing of houses||After an attempt to wind tape around the gates of houses where COVID-19 patients were isolating themselves, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suddenly stopped the practice on Wednesday. The South zone’s Chief Engineer told The Hindu that officials have now been directed to stop putting the tapes. “We were instructed by health officials to wind the tapes on the gates, and given around 10 rolls for the six Assembly constituencies in the South zone. However, on Wednesday, we were instructed to stop this practice,” the official said. The BBMP had stopped marking houses with COVID-19 patients after drawing criticism for stigmatising families. The move to resume the practice came as a surprise. A few houses in B.T.M. Layout, 2nd Stage, had tapes wound around the gates. A poster was pasted on the wall that read: ‘14 days Under Quarantine From Date…’ BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta clarified that the civic body had neither sealed nor barricaded any house like it did last year during the first wave. He said that during a recent meeting, the Chief Secretary had directed the BBMP to put distinguishing marks on houses withw COVID-19 positive residents. During a recent interaction with various residents’ welfare associations, Mr. Gupta had stated that stamping a seal on the hands of citizens who test positive was being done in some places. “In some cases, the BBMP can put ribbons to identify houses with COVID-19 positive cases. Several initiatives of this nature can be taken up,” he had said. Despite several attempts, there was no response from BBMP Special Commissioner (Finance) Tulasi Madineni, who is in charge of the South zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-more-sealing-of-houses/article34653767.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 relief for drivers: 3 lakh applications expected||The Transport Department announced that it will accept online applications from drivers seeking COVID-19 relief funds on the Seva Sindhu portal from Thursday. Auto, taxi and maxi cab drivers are eligible for financial assistance of Rs. 3,000, which was announced by the Chief Minister. The department is expecting around 3 lakh drivers to apply online. Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, in a statement, said that the department will directly deposit the money into bank accounts of eligible drivers once they receive the application on Seva Sindhu. Drivers with DLs issued till April 24, 2021, are eligible to apply. The ‘one driver, one vehicle’ policy will be adopted while allocating compensation. Transport Commissioner N. Shivakumar said, “While filing applications, drivers need to provide DL, Aadhaar card, and bank details. Whatever conditions were imposed last time will be applicable this time as well. We are likely to receive more applications as maxi cab drivers are included in the list of beneficiaries.” During the national lockdown in 2020 following the first wave of COVID-19, the department had received 2.45 lakh applications, of which 2.16 lakh drivers received compensation of Rs. 5,000 each. The official said that those who were rejected had either not submitted the required documents or met the criteria. Unions unhappy According to K. Somashekar of Namma Chalakara Trade Union, last year, the government had announced that 7.5 lakh drivers would benefit from the financial aid. “But in the end, not even half received the money due to the various conditions imposed. Drivers who have their own vehicles may benefit, but there are thousands of drivers who do not own the vehicle they drive. They pay rent on a per-day basis to owners,” said Mr. Somashekar. He also pointed out that if two drivers use a single taxi or auto, they would not be eligible. “The government should have simplified the rules by providing compensation to all those who have valid DLs and badges to drive auto, taxi and maxi cabs,” he added.  Last time, not even half received the money due to the various conditions. Drivers who have their own vehicles may benefit, but there are thousands who do not own the vehicle they drive K.

27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Slow start to shifting vaccination sites to schools and colleges||Although it has been over 10 days since the State government announced that vaccination drives will move out of government hospitals and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and instead be held on the premises of schools and colleges, only a few hospitals have done so to date. At the time of announcing the decision, Deputy Chief Minister C. N. Ashwath Narayan had underscored the need to separate people due for their shot from patients visiting the hospital for treatment or testing. A few hospitals, like K.C. General Hospital, have shifted the vaccination site to a nearby school, but a majority have yet to make the transition. Health Commissioner K.V. Thrilok Chandra said that the process has begun. “We are in the processing of figuring the logistics and finding vaccination sites outside health care centres,” he said. Citizens as well as healthcare workers are worried about the risk of cross-infection, which has been reported at vaccination sites in hospitals. Many who are due for their second shot are waiting for more vaccinate sites to be set up outside government hospitals and PHC. Namrata K., a private company employee said, “I need to get my second shot soon, but my family is asking me to wait as the number of cases are high and they do not want me to enter a hospital right now.” Staff at government hospitals, too, are hoping that the government will not delay this shift. “Our hospital also has COVID-19 patients, but a large part of our time and energy is spent on the vaccination process. People who are not able to get vaccinated create a lot of chaos and there are clashes at the hospital. If the vaccination drive is moved out of the hospital, we will be able to treat COVID-19 patients better,” he said. When contacted, officials with the Department of Health and Family Welfare said “We will ask hospitals to contact schools and colleges in their vicinity and conduct vaccination camps there. This will also ensure that nurses and other staff do not have to commute long distances and vaccines can be transported safely from the hospital.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/slow-start-to-shifting-vaccination-sites-to-schools-and-colleges/article34653777.ece
27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court dismisses plea to stop vaccination||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday dismissed, with Rs. 50,000 cost, a PIL petition seeking direction to government to stop COVID-19 vaccination on the ground that both the vaccines were allowed for mass vaccination in violation of the rules and guidelines. The court said that petition was “not in public interest” as the vaccination programme commenced back in January this year and the petition was filed on May 24 making a claim that vaccines were rolled out without proper clinical trials. A Special Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, passed the order on the petition filed by 82-year-old Mathew Thomas, an ex-servicemen, Sriram M.S., and Niswarth Kochar, all residents of Bengaluru.

27 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Elevated metro rail will be an obstacle to Jakkur aerodrome runway: Survey||An Obstacle Limitation Surfaces (OLS) survey conducted by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in April has revealed that the proposed elevated section of metro rail will be an obstacle to the approach funnel of the runway at Jakkur aerodrome of the Government Flying Training School (GFTS) in the city. Also, the survey has disclosed that the elevated stretch of the NH, existing airport boundary wall fencing and some trees are also obstacles to the approach funnel of runway. The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation, apprised of the obstacles, suggested to the State government to either reduce the height of the obstacles surfaces within the permissible limit as per Ministry of Civil Aviation (Height Restriction for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015, or to adopt mitigation measures as suggested/recommended by the AAI by reducing the length of the runway. The DGCA, in its letter dated May 20, 2021, had also told the State government to intimate it if the latter wanted the obstacles to be considered as per the provisions of the Aircrafts (Demolition of obstructions caused by buildings and trees, etc) Rules, 1994. However, the DGCA, claimed that the elevated structure of NH cannot be determined as an illegal and unauthorised structure as the construction of elevated NH was done between 2010 and 2015 when the Jakkur aerodrome was not listed in the notification of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Following DGCA’s communication, the State government has now decided to adopt the mitigation suggested by the AAI to reduce the length of the runway by issuing direction to the director of the GFTS while claiming that it wants both infrastructure projects and general aviation activities at Jakkur flying school to ‘co-exist.’ The hearing has been adjourned till June 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/elevated-metro-rail-will-be-an-obstacle-to-jakkur-aerodrome-runway-survey/article34653780.ece

But for the last 10 days, he refused medicine and food, they said. C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, where Mr. Doreswamy was admitted said he had turned very philosophical. “He kept telling us that he had lived a full life and insisted that his bed be given to a young person.. He questioned why he should get such good treatment. I tried to convince him and tell him we have no shortage of beds,” he said. He added that political activist Ravikrishna Reddy, who visited him when he was in the hospital, would convince him to eat food and take medicines. Mr. Doreswamy was hospitalised on May 6 after he tested positive for COVID-19. He was discharged on May 12 as his condition improved. But, he was brought to the hospital again on May 14 after he faced breathing difficulty. Doctors said his oxygen saturation levels were always normal.

Doreswamy. It was the freedom fighter who took up cudgels on their behalf in 2013 as they fought against the dumping of Bengaluru’s waste there. His involvement forced the then Congress government to give in writing that garbage would no longer be dumped in the village. “We owe our life to him,” said Byresh M.J., who was part of the struggle then and is now a member of the Mandur Gram Panchayat. In an interview with The Hindu in June 2020, Mr. Doreswamy had said: “In 2013, I chanced upon Mandur. I went into the village and realised the city has been dumping garbage in this village for many years and life there had turned terrible. As a Bengalurean, I felt guilty, responsible, and a need to atone for my sin. I sat on a fast and ensured that the dumping of garbage in the village was stopped.” After news of his passing reached the village, a few residents placed his photo at the main circle and offered floral tributes. “We couldn’t do much due to COVID-19 restrictions,” said Mr. Byresh, who added that the gram panchayat would name a prominent location after him. “We will propose to name the new road from Budigere Cross to Kempegowda International Airport after Mr. Doreswamy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mandur-residents-mourn-the-man-who-fought-for-them/article34653793.ece

27 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Demolition of Central Market begins||The more-than-a-decade-old move of Mangaluru City Corporation to demolish and re-construct the Central Market in the heart of the city is heading towards a reality with the civic body commencing demolition of two six-decade-old vegetable and fish market buildings on Wednesday. Armed with an order of the Urban Development Department issued on Tuesday, which permitted demolition, the corporation went about bringing down the buildings to pave way for Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) to re-construct a new modern market building for the civic body under the Smart City Mission. The demolition and re-construction proposal witnessed several ups and downs with the matter even reaching the High Court of Karnataka. It was in 2008-2009 that the then Standing Committee for Town Planning and Improvement of the corporation, headed by K. Naveenchandra, and the city corporation council, led by the then Mayor Ganesh Hosabettu, first proposed to demolish the old buildings to reconstruct a new one. But the corporation put the proposal on hold for paucity of funds. The council, with Harinath as Mayor, gave approval to the proposal on June 29, 2016. The State Level High Powered Steering Committee, headed by the Chief Secretary, approved it on September 22, 2018. Later, the Public Works Department in its report on March 23, 2020 recommended demolition of the buildings stating that they were no more fit for occupancy. Meanwhile, the corporation completely closed down the market on April 7, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. After some traders moved the High Court questioning it, the court on August 10, 2020 directed the city corporation to withdraw its order of closure and re-start the process of demolition and re-construction afresh as per law. Following this, the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada issued an order on August 18, 2020 closing down the market again to prevent the spread of COVID-19. When the traders again moved court, it stayed the Deputy Commissioner’s order while hearing the Writ Petition. The court, while hearing another Writ Petition, ordered the corporation to conduct a deep study on the fitness and capacity of the buildings and submit a report. Later, Enstrutura Consultants Pvt. Ltd., hired by the corporation as a third party agency, in its November 10, 2020 report, submitted that the buildings were not fit for occupancy as they were in poor condition. The report said that the buildings were also not fit for renovation. It recommended their demolition and reconstruction. Again, the city corporation council, in its meetings on December 2, 2020 and on December 31, 2020, resolved to demolish the buildings and reconstruct a new market building.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demolition-of-central-market-begins/article34653828.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by environmentalist Vijay Nishanth. The petitioner had questioned the legality of the decision taken by the Karnataka State Board for Wildlife (KSBWL) in its 15th meeting on January 19, 2021 to reject the proposal to declare Hesarghatta Grasslands comprising of 5,010 acres as ‘Greater Hesarghatta Grasslands Conserve Reserve’. The petitioner has pointed out that the Chief Minister, who is chairperson of the KSBWL, had dropped the proposal to declare Hesarghatta Grasslands as ‘Greater Hesarghatta Grasslands Conservation Reserve’ without considering the opinions and recommendations of other members of the KSBWL, who were experts on the subject. The Chairperson had decided to drop the proposal after S.R. Vishwanath, MLA of Yelahanka constituency, who was a special invitee to the meeting, opposed the proposal for declaration of ‘Greater Hesarghatta Grasslands Conservation Reserve’ while pointing out that it would come in the way of development works in the area as already there is shortage of government land. The petitioner has contended that KSBWL’s Chairperson failed to appreciate the report filed by the Chief Conservator of Forest highlighting that Hesarghatta lakebed and grasslands are an important reservoir of biodiversity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/maintain-status-quo-at-hesarghatta/article34653768.ece

27 May 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||The eponymous hero of Balan Pillai City no more||How a teashop owner’s name came to identify a place that later became a town is the story of Balan Pillai, 96, who died at Mathirapally Varun Nivas in Alappuzha on Wednesday. Balan Pillai City is a town near Nedumkandam in Idukki. Though Balan Pillai had moved to Alappuzha years ago, the name of the place remained. The story of Balan Pillai is connected to Kallar Pattom Colony, the first colony set up by the State in the Idukki high range as part of the Grow More Food Scheme in 1955. Balan Pillai reached Kallar as a settler farmer. Later, he started a teashop-cum-grocery shop in the village. It was at a time when goods were moved from Tamil Nadu on mules and the shop was the only one of its kind there. Many other shops came there later, but the name of the place remained Balan Pillai City. It is now the hub of the Ramakalmedu tourism centre. The new generation may not be familiar with Balan Pillai, but one can gauge his service at a time when settlers came to a new palace braving extreme climate and wild animals. Balan Pillai City now extends to Wards 4, 5, and 6 of Karunapuram grama panchayat. In others’ names too In the high range, there are many places that have derived their names from the first shop owner there. One such person was Umma, famous in her name as Ummakada, who died a few years ago. There are also places such as Labbakada, Achappan Kada, and Appappancity. Then there are place names such as Thopramkudi and Vellayamkudi that derived their names from chieftains of tribal communities who lived there prior to the arrival of the settlers. Balan Pillai City gained popularity after the release of Malayalam film Elsamma Enna Aankutty . The story of the film unfolds in a sleepy village called Balan Pillai City. The film also has some interesting characters such as Balan Pillai, a teashop owner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-eponymous-hero-of-balan-pillai-city-no-more/article34653915.ece

Talking to The Hindu , he said protection walls would be built and temporary measures taken to prevent seawater from entering residential areas. A sum of Rs. 1 crore each had been allotted to seven coastal districts and Rs. 2 crore to Ernakulam, with special focus on Chellanam where the damage was high.

Mr. Augustine said projects for cleaning and protection of streams would be evolved. Drinking water supply would be strengthened. Projects would be taken up to clean rivers and make available quality drinking water. More projects would be taken up to solve the shortage of drinking water during the summer. Quality drinking water for all was his aim, he said. The Minister said he envisaged linking agriculture with irrigation. This would enhance agriculture production and help farmers. New irrigation projects would be taken up to strengthen the farming sector and those projects remaining incomplete would be taken up soon, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/quality-drinking-water-for-all-is-the-aim-roshy/article34654188.ece

27 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Post-COVID afflictions an ordeal for patients||Testing negative for COVID-19 does not signal the end of ordeal for some who continue to report persistent symptoms for weeks or months. Doctors are anticipating that more such instances will be reported over the next few weeks, considering the recent spike in cases. A 30-year-old ASHA worker in Piravom who tested positive around mid-April is yet to recover entirely. A persistent cough and breathlessness meant that she had to get a chest X-ray done recently. “I have been trying to get back to work, but the fatigue makes me want to sit or lie down all the time,” she says. Post-COVID clinics function at all primary health centres on Fridays, and daily at the Ernakulam General Hospital. Doctors at primary health centres say they have mostly been handling cases of fatigue and body aches. Of those arriving at the Ernakulam General Hospital with post-COVID issues, most have pulmonary or cardiac problems, said Dr. Manoj G. Panicker, head of the general medicine department at the hospital. In most cases, hospital admissions are not necessary, but in some instances, patients are known to succumb to heart or lung issues they develop from COVID, he added. Considering the recent surge in COVID cases, more such cases are likely to crop up, Dr. Manoj said. Kidney impairment Dr. Sheela Mathew who heads the department of infectious diseases at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, says back-ache, joint pain, insomnia, and depression are commonly seen. “Rarely, we are also seeing cases of thromboembolism or blood clotting. Impairment of kidney function is seen transiently, though such patients recover quickly,” she said. Myocarditis, in cases where COVID has caused weakening of heart muscles, can lead to cardiac failure. In such cases, a negative COVID test does not matter. The impact will be seen when people return to routine life after COVID,” she added. A 53-year-old in Ernakulam said he experienced persistent fatigue, nausea, and diarrhoea sporadically for around two months after he tested positive earlier this year. He ended up making two visits to private hospitals to manage post-COVID issues, where each time, he had to get tested for COVID again. Some patients might require oxygen at home for up to a month, depending on the severity of damage to the lungs, but over time, they will recover completely, said Dr. Praveen Valsalan, pulmonologist at Aster Medcity. “The most common problem seen in the recovery period is secondary infections, like fungal or bacterial infections,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/post-covid-afflictions-an-ordeal-for-patients/article34653892.ece
27 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||KUFOS postings kick up a row||The appointment to two senior positions in the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (KUFOS) has kicked up a storm, with the Save University Campaign Committee taking up the issue with the Governor. The committee alleged instances of nepotism and malpractice in appointments to the posts of Dean (Fisheries) and Director (Research). It was alleged that the wife of the Vice Chancellor and the Registrar-in-Charge of the University were appointed as Dean (Fisheries) and Director (Research), and a meeting of the governing council of the university, which was chaired by the Vice Chancellor had ratified the appointments. It was further alleged that the selection committee for the two posts were constituted by the Vice Chancellor himself. The committee approached the Governor, who is also the Chancellor of the university, with a prayer to initiate action against those responsible for the appointments and to nullify them. Dismissing the allegations as baseless, Vice Chancellor K. Riji John said the candidates who were selected were adequately qualified. Corrigendum The university had invited applications for five posts, including those of the Director (Extension) and Directors of two schools. A corrigendum was issued stopping the recruitment of school directors, as they were elevated to the post of Dean in the ordinance promulgated in February 2021. Recruitment to the post of Director (Extension) was put on hold following delay in getting the nomination of an interview board member from ICAR as required by the university statute. The interview for the post will be conducted shortly, the Vice Chancellor said. The other posts were advertised in two major Malayalam dailies and an English daily, and the notifications were publicised on the university website. Varsity statute The last date for submitting applications was extended by 10 days following the publication of the corrigendum. Only one candidate each turned up for the posts of Dean (Fisheries) and Director (Research). They were interviewed by the panel constituted for the purpose. The statute stipulates that the Vice Chancellor shall constitute the interview panel, and it was followed in both the cases, he added. Being the wife of the Vice Chancellor and the Registrar-in-Charge of the university need not be considered as a disqualification for the candidates, who had excellent track records. “While I kept myself out of the interview panel for the post of Dean [Fisheries] for which my wife had appeared as a candidate, I was part of the interview board for the post of Director [Research], and there is nothing improper in the proceedings,” the Vice Chancellor said.

Rajeeve has said a statutory redressal mechanism to settle issues related to industries and a recruitment board for appointments to State public sector undertakings are among the areas the Industries Department will work on immediately. He told The Hindu on Tuesday that the first Cabinet meeting of the new government had already taken a decision on establishing a statutory redressal mechanism, and that a report was expected to be ready within a month. The second Pinarayi Vijayan government was keen to woo investments and generate substantial number of jobs over the next five years, he said. One of the focus areas of the department over the coming five years will be to bring Kerala to the top of the list of States in the country in terms of ease of doing business. Efforts to improve the climate for investment was tied to the government’s efforts to generate jobs, he said. At present, Kerala stands 18th among States in terms of ease of doing business. The investment atmosphere in the State is expected to undergo positive changes, and all hindrances that hold up investments will be removed, as the government is keen to see that investments are not held up because of any procedural delays. Mr. Rajeeve said the second Pinarayi government also wanted to focus on agricultural enterprises. Agripreneurship would need to be encouraged in a State that has a rich array of resources. Besides, Mr. Rajeeve said that micro, small and medium enterprises, needed to be given a boost especially in the backdrop of the COVID-19 spread. He said MSMEs had taken a hard beating owing to the pandemic, and that the government was aware of the hard times the industries were going though. The new government also earmarked several major projects as flagship ventures of the State. These include the Kochi-Coimbatore industrial corridor project and the petrochemicals complex coming up on the Ambalamugal campus, close to Fertilizers and Chemicals, Travancore. The government was also gearing up to launch works on HNL, which had been taken over by the State government, the Minister said. Besides industries, Mr. Rajeeve has also been given charge of cashew and coir industries. Besides, he will look after the plantations sector. The shift is expected to give a big boost to the ailing sector.

The commission had asked the stakeholders to submit their feedback on the concept note on or before June 6. “The UGC’s document is not a pandemic-induced contingent solution, but a package in connection with the implementation of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which assigns blended learning an important role claiming that it would provide more flexibility and choice to the learners for developing 21st century skills,” pointed out Rajan Gurukkal P.M., Vice Chairman of the council. “NEP 2020 has the agenda to reduce face-to-face teaching load and the cost,” he said.

27 May 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Cashew factories find lockdown a hard nut to crack||Cashew factories, both in public and private sectors, are bracing for huge losses as the pandemic-induced lockdown has resulted in huge volumes of unprocessed nut piling up and most of the stock are ready for grading after shelling and peeling. Some relief has come with the authorities giving permission to resume operations strictly adhering to COVID protocol. Critical time Since restrictions to contain the second wave of the pandemic hit the industry at a very critical time, many units are finding it difficult to complete processing and shift the stock to godowns. While the government-run factories under the Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation and Capex currently have tonnes of unprocessed material, many of the private processors too face the same problem. Permission sought “We have approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for the permission to complete processing and transporting the stock. We needed to activate the sector at the earliest and so that both public and private units can function,” said KSCDC chairman S.Jaymohan. However, the private the sector is not too hopeful of getting permission as many units are located in local bodies currently under triple lockdown. “Though cashew is a perishable good and we are an export-oriented industry, most of the factories are not functioning because of the lockdown. We have factories and labourers in containment zones and the local body authorities will not allow us to function,” says Nizamudeen I., president, Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters. According to the processors, continuing rains also pose a major challenge as chances are high for moisture damage and mold infestation. Time limit “We faced a similar situation during the earlier lockdown as well. But this time we thought we can reopen after seven days and complete the processing. There is a time limit for holding the stock midway into processing and even a single day can make a difference,” says a processor. For the past several months, the sector has been striving hard to come out of the pandemic blues. Though most of the units now have the RCN required for the season, they have been finding it hard to ship the orders due to the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cashew-factories-find-lockdown-a-hard-nut-to-crack/article34654189.ece

27 May 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Vasavan says Kerala Bank will be strengthened||Modernisation of the State’s cooperative sector, strengthening of Kerala Bank, and formulation of innovative loan schemes for farmers and working class are the priorities of V.N. Vasavan, the newly appointed Minister for Cooperation and Registration. In an interaction here on Saturday, Mr. Vasavan said the inflow of capital in the form of Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits would prove to be a game-changer for Kerala Bank. “Funds with local self-government institutions and the salaries of its employees are being handled by the State Bank of India. Discussions will be initiated to see if these operations could be shifted to Kerala Bank,” he said.  The possibility of extending the operations of cooperative banks to newer sectors will be explored in compliance with the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India. “More importantly, procedures for taking loans will be simplified for the benefit of the common people. The possibility of bringing all cooperative banks in a single loop will be discussed, besides a possible migration to the core banking system,” added Mr. Vasavan. Holding that the State’s primary sector is heavily dependent on cooperative banking, Mr. Vasavan vowed to protect the sector at all costs. He urged the Union government not to take control of the cooperative banks by introducing unnecessary regulations. “The State has already conveyed its objections toward the implementation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act). The government cannot accept the people losing their shelter in the name of property attachments,” noted Mr. Vasavan. Document writers Mr. Vasavan said an online registration system in the Registration Department would be introduced by protecting document writers. “There are lakhs of document writers in the State. We will initiate talks in various fields to protect their interests when an online registration system is implemented. At the same time, complaints about the department will be examined and a more efficient functioning will be ensured,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vasavan-says-kerala-bank-will-be-strengthened/article34654186.ece
27 May 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Knanaya Catholics can marry from other dioceses: court||In a significant development, an additional subcourt in Kottayam recently passed a decree of permanent prohibitory injunction against terminating the membership of any member of the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam for marrying a Catholic from any other diocese. Considering the petitions filed by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samiti and a few others, Judge S. Sudheesh Kumar ruled that “by entering into the sacrament of marriage with another Catholic from any other diocese, a member of the Archeparchy of Kottayam will not forfeit his or her membership in the Archeparchy of Kottayam.” Observing that the alleged practice of endogamy was in violation of the right to marriage enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, the court noted that the forfeiture of membership for violating endogamy amounted to violation of right guaranteed under Article 25. The court further directed the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Kottayam Archeparchy to provide its members who wished to marry Catholics from any other diocese equal rights and facilities through the parish priests for the sacrament of marriage by way of decree of mandatory injunction. The sect was also asked to readmit members along with their spouses and children whose membership was terminated for marrying a Catholic if the former members are qualified in all other respects on receipt of proper application.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/knanaya-catholics-can-marry-from-other-dioceses-court/article34654194.ece

27 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Thousands in State express solidarity with farmers’ stir||It has been six months since farmers from various States started their protest against the Central government’s new farm laws on the outskirts of Delhi. Farmers across the country took the opportunity to rekindle the protest, and their kindred spirits in Kerala too joined the nationwide protest in their own way on Wednesday amidst the lockdown. The Dilli Chalo Karshaka Samara Aikyadardya Samithi in the State had organised an online convention to mark the day on Tuesday evening. Inaugurating the convention, Yogendra Yadav, the spokesperson of the farmers’ protest in Delhi, noted that the protest has uplifted the self-esteem of farmers in the country like never before. “More than being a protest against corporatisation of agriculture, it developed as a protest to protect the idea of India, the Republic, the Constitution, democracy and plurality of the country,” Mr. Yadav said, adding that farmers are evolving as the frontline fighters for India’s freedom. Poet K. Satchidanandan said that the farmers’ protest is a new freedom struggle to promote federalism and diversity, besides giving the downtrodden a right to shout out. Writer Khadeeja Mumtaz pointed out that the farmers’ protest represents an India that is not ready to lose. Kaleeshwaram Raj, advocate, said that the farmers’ protest has created a scenario of re-visiting the Indian Constitution from the point of view of villages and that it will positively influence the judiciary in the country. Several leaders and activists such as C.R. Neelakandan, K. Ajitha, Sara Joseph and P. Rajeevan were part of the online convention. The Samithi had called for a ‘Prathishedha Muttam’ in every household on May 26, which was followed by thousands of supporters of the protest. They hoisted green flags in their courtyards and displayed their produce, along with a banner against the farm laws. The social media was abuzz with different kinds of support for the protest, which included songs, dance and poems by artistes. The protests concluded at 6 p.m. with a ‘Prathishedha Pantham’ (torch of protest) which was lit in every household. Political parties too observed Wednesday as a ‘black day’ and organised protests in different parts of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thousands-in-state-express-solidarity-with-farmers-stir/article34653907.ece
27 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Coastal road connecting Kozhikode, Kochi mooted||The State government is considering an ambitious proposal to develop a coastal road connecting Kozhikode and Kochi for the benefit of people of north Kerala and Central Travancore. The proposal, mooted by K.V. Shamsudheen , member of Loka Kerala Sabha and Chairman of United Arab Emirates-based Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust, has received a positive response from the Chief Minister’s Office. “If this government gives its sanction to construct a bridge connecting Beypore to Kozhikode beach through the existing Kothi Bridge, the distance between the two cities can be reduced by at least 25 km. Now the road between Kozhikode and Kochi covers more than 195 km,” Mr. Shamsudheen said. “The proposed road will join National Highway 66 in Ponnani and touch Chavakkad, Kodungallur, and Vypeen and reach Kochi, ” he said. The easy connectivity of Beypore Port and Kochi Port by road would be to a great extent useful to container traffic, besides, enhancing infrastructure development and economic activity in the coastal region. “This project will benefit the region of Tanur, Tirur, Ponnani, Guruvayur, Nattika, Kodungallur constituencies as well,” Mr. Shamsudheen pointed out. Previously, the National Highway wing of the PWD had prepared a package to implement the proposed 75-km coastal highway project. The proposal is to adopt a total width for the road at 14 metres. Sources said the proposal was to implement an ocean-drive highway beginning from Ponnani, passing through Tirur, Tanur, Parappanangadi, Kadalundi, Chaliyam, Beypore, Marad, Kallai, Kozhikode Beach road and culminating at Vengalam. Thus, the distance between Kochi and Kozhikode will be reduced by nearly 40 km.

According to sources, the Education Department is yet to fix the schedule for the exams. Due to the pandemic situation, students did not go to schools in the last academic year. Though they were supposed to have online classes on VICTERS channel, teachers claim the portions were finished in a hurry. Classes for Plus One began only by November last. The students were promised regular sessions to clear their doubts, but a large majority of schools did not conduct any. K.K. Sreejesh Kumar, general secretary, Kerala Aided Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association (KAHSTA), said on Wednesday that the department’s focus for online classes was mainly on students of Class 10 and 12. “This is problematic because the lessons in Plus One syllabus form the basis of any subject that they may want to pursue for higher studies. Both Plus One and Plus Two marks are added while applying for graduate courses in colleges as well,” he said. The association urged the government to help teachers and students get access to the official orders and circulars of the Education Department through official WhatsApp groups and its website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/confusion-over-conduct-of-plus-one-exams/article34653895.ece

The council dispersed after approving most of the items on agenda without discussion. Some of the items were kept aside for the next meeting. Later, the Museum police registered a case under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020, against BJP councillors who participated in a protest march on the Corporation premises. As per a decision made at the all-party meeting, 20 members, including five councillors from the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), four from the BJP, and three from the United Democratic Front (UDF), in addition to the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, standing committee chairpersons, and party leaders were to take part in the meeting. The rest were to join through an online conference. However, all the BJP councillors arrived for the meeting, with four of them sitting within the council hall and the rest of the 30 sitting with placards in the council lounge. Mayor Arya Rajendran said the council meeting cannot continue amid protocol violations and requested the councillors to join the online meeting. However, the BJP councillors argued that since the Assembly was convened in full strength and the swearing-in ceremony of the LDF government was also organised, the council meeting could be held. LDF councillors argued that there was no facility to conduct COVID-19 tests for all councillors, due to which a partially online meeting was a better option. With the BJP councillors refusing to disperse, the Mayor passed the agenda for the day and ended the meeting.

27 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Social scientist K. Saradamoni dead||Social scientist K. Saradamoni, one of the pioneers in Dalit and gender studies, passed away here on Wednesday. She was 93. Known for one of the earliest historical analyses of caste slavery in Kerala, she had worked as an economist at the Indian Statistical Institute in Delhi from 1961 to 1988. Right from her student days at the Government College for Women and University College in Thiruvananthapuram in the post-Independence period, Ms. Saradamoni displayed her adeptness at field studies and surveys. Later, during her stint in Paris, working on her PhD with French anthropologist Louis Dumont, she came across an old file in the archives on abolition of slavery in Kerala, which kindled in her the idea for her pioneering work Emergence of a slave caste: Pulayas of Kerala in 1980. “It was the first of its kind study on caste slavery, which is still a reference material. It is most important for the wealth of source material, including rare colonial documents. That path-breaking work gave a sense of history and agency for the Dalit community, placing it as part of our renaissance history. It remained somewhat ignored by mainstream historians until Dalit studies opened up in recent decades. In gender studies too, she made a breakthrough with her research on matrilineal system and women’s land rights. Because she had an economics background, she was able to bring in a different dimension to her studies in gender and caste,” says Meera Velayudhan, policy analyst and president, Indian Association for Women’s Studies. In Matriliny Transformed: Family, Law and Ideology in Twentieth Century Travancore , she examined how matriliny offered identity and security to women and how the system changed in Travancore.  Mentor to many She was a mentor to many scholars of gender and Dalit studies across India. One of her recent books, The Scribe Remembered – N.Gopinathan Nair , was a personal one on her late husband N.Gopinathan Nair, founder-editor of Janayugam , the newspaper of the undivided Communist Party. She spent her later years in Thiruvananthapuram and was active in initiatives such as Heritage Walk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/social-scientist-k-saradamoni-dead/article34654197.ece
27 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cong. examines poll debacle||The Congress national leadership has set in motion the process of reorganising the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) in the wake of the 2021 Assembly poll debacle. It entailed ushering in a generational change in the State unit of the party from the grassroots level. In what was perceived as a precursor to impending leadership changes, a panel headed by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan interacted via videoconference with the party’s top leadership in Kerala. A party insider said former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had struck a reflective tone in his interaction with Mr. Chavan. Mr. Chennithala reportedly said he had espoused a strong position against corruption, exposing lack of transparency in agreements the government had inked with foreign firms. However, the scams did not yield the desired political dividend. Voters seemed to have been taken in more by the welfare schemes. Corruption and scams took a back seat against the backdrop of the looming pandemic. The people seemed markedly reluctant to experiment with a new government amid the crippling epidemic. Moreover, the Congress leadership also faced the accusation of failing to present a Chief Ministerial face. The BJP had shifted votes to the LDF to pursue its “Congress-free India” agenda. The BDJS activists cross voted in strength to aid the CPI(M). A party insider said the Congress was starved of funds. The panel will continue its hearings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-examines-poll-debacle/article34653921.ece

To supplement the digital classes on VICTERS, the teachers pressed for school-level platforms to start online classes for enhanced interaction between teachers and students. If online classes for students by their schoolteachers would have to be realised, a mass campaign should be undertaken to ensure availability of mobile phones, the teachers’ organisations said, expressing their support for such an endeavour. Textbook availability Teachers demanded steps to make textbooks available textbooks in schools by June 1, they said. The teachers’ organisations also demanded that vacancies of teachers be filled.

A coordinated effort by the Coast Guard, Coastal Police, and the City police through Tuesday night and the early hours of Wednesday succeeded in rescuing a total of eight fishermen. The deceased was identified as Davidson, a resident of Poonthura in the district. His body was located near Adimalathura by Wednesday noon. The missing men were identified as Joseph of Poonthura and Xavier alias Shabariar of Kottapuram. The mishap occurred while the fishing boats were returning to the harbour. According to the coastal police and the district administration, six boats had met with difficulties on Tuesday night. The deceased, Davidson, and two others were in a boat that capsized. Coast Guard Coast Guard officials said they had managed to rescue six fishermen from three boats after rescue operations started at 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday. While two men were rescued shortly after the search began, four of the men were rescued by 2.30 a.m. after the Coast Guard carried out another search near the narrow harbour mouth. Two other fishermen swam to safety, the police said. The stormy weather and poor visibility made the rescue operations extremely difficult, DCP Vaibhav Saxena said. The Coast Guard operations were led by Commandant V.K. Varghese, Station Commander, Vizhinjam. “There was a heavy swell near the harbour mouth and the sea was very rough,” a Coast Guard official who was part of the rescue operation said. Local fishermen blamed the narrow entrance to the harbour and sand accumulation for the incident. They have raised the matter with Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian and Transport Minister Antony Raju who visited Vizhinjam.

27 May 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Veteran freedom fighter passes away||H.S. Doreswamy, freedom fighter, citizen activist and Karnataka’s noted voice for freedom of expression, passed away on Wednesday in Bengaluru. He was 103. He breathed his last at the Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research after he suffered cardiac arrest. He had recently beaten COVID-19 but was readmitted due to post-COVID-19 complications. “While the primary cause of his death was his heart condition, the precipitating cause was COVID-19,” said Dr. C.N. Manjunath, Director, Jayadeva Institute. Born on April 10, 1918, in Harohalli on the outskirts of Bengaluru, he joined the freedom struggle at a young age and was jailed during the Quit India Movement. He came under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and remained a committed Gandhian till the end. Post Independence, he disassociated himself from the Indian National Congress and was a part of almost all major national and social movements. He was also jailed during the Emergency. He edited a magazine, called Poura Vani , with nationalist aspirations in pre-Independence times. He continued to work as a journalist through his life, writing his last column for the magazine Nyaya Patha two weeks ago. He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism in 2019. In 2018, he was awarded the Basava Puraskara by the Karnataka government. Mr. Doreswamy remained a committed activist till the end, and a vociferous voice against any effort to suppress freedom of expression. He was against communalisation of politics, and one of his last campaigns was against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa condoled the death of Mr. Doreswamy and described him as “a man who lived his life like the conscience of Karnataka”. ‘Inspiration to millions’ Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah tweeted that Mr. Doreswamy was an inspiration to millions for his truth and honesty. “He never hesitated to hit the streets to protest against anything he felt was wrong. His absence will be felt,” he said. Those close to him recalled that during the last few days, Mr. Doreswamy had insisted that his bed be given to a youth. “I have not wasted my time on earth, so I have no regrets going nor am I scared,” he told several of his well-wishers, and reportedly also to the doctors as he was wheeled into the ICU on Wednesday. He was cremated with State honours in the city on Wednesday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veteran-freedom-fighter-passes-away/article34653671.ece

27 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Elderly man killed, woman injured in jumbo attack||An elderly man was killed and a woman was critically injured when a wild elephant attacked them at Bommavaripalle village of G.D. Nellore mandal, 15 km from here, on Wednesday. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor Wildlife East) G.G. Narentheran said that two elephants were on the move towards the west division after leaving the Nagari plains of Karveti Nagaram and Puttur ranges. In this process, the two got separated. While one elephant crossed into the forests near Kanipakam and entered the West division, another was still lingering on the outskirts of Chittoor. An elderly man, Vajravelu (65) was trampled by the elephant, which later attacked a woman farmer (55) a few meters away, before moving closer to the Bengaluru-Tirupati national highway. ‘Condition stable’ Both the injured were rushed to General Hospital at Chittoor. Vajravelu, who suffered multiple fractures, was rushed to SVRR Hospital at Tirupati, where he succumbed to injuries. The woman’s condition at Chittoor hospital was said to be stable. The DFO said that the lone elephant, which attacked the two, was a member of the three-member “bachelor’s group”, which entered Chittoor district from Tamil Nadu forests in early January. While one elephant was electrocuted near Puttur a couple of days ago, the second one crossed into the west division on Tuesday night. The present one on prowl near Chittoor would be driven into the forests, he said. The bachelor’s group had earlier killed a night watchman at a mango orchard near Puttur on May 9, besides injuring four villagers in the Nagari plains in separate incidents. “Due to the presence of the lone elephant, we have arranged tom-tom in the villages on its possible path towards forests, asking people not to venture out at nights, and also to move in groups. We have deployed our field staff to monitor its movement and prevent it from moving into human habitations,” Mr Narentheran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/elderly-man-killed-woman-injured-in-jumbo-attack/article34653674.ece

27 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||State stood by farmers in the last two years, says Kanna Babu||Minister for Agriculture K Kanna Babu has said that the State government has paid Rs. 3,783.25 crore to the farmers in last two years under the YSR free crop insurance scheme. Speaking to the media at party central office here on Wednesday, the Minister said the State government had decided to set up an insurance company on its own to implement free crop insurance scheme and had been implementing the scheme under the guidelines of PM Fasal Bima Yojana till the time the insurance company was set up.. He said the previous government had not paid premium most of the times making farmers suffer and also didn’t process the claims for which premium was paid. He said while the TDP government did not process the insurance claims to farmers in Pulivendula area for not mentioning the date of cropping, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has released Rs. 112 crore for them after coming into power. The Minister criticised TDP leader Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy for claiming that the TDP government had paid Rs. 4,000 crore as insurance and said only Rs. 2,900 crore was paid in four years. The Minister briefed in detail comparing the registrations of the previous government with the present government for insurance and said there is 122% increase at present. Clarifying on reports in a section of media that a farmer received only Rs. 16 as insurance, the Minister said it could have been a technical error and added that 8,000 people received low claims (less than Rs. 100) during the last year of TDP government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-stood-by-farmers-in-the-last-two-years-says-kanna-babu/article34654235.ece
27 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Hyperglycemia poses a challenge in treatment of black fungus’||India has the highest burden of mucor in the world with 140 cases per million population and, hence, the country expects to see a tidal wave of infections in the coming months. The country, also home to the largest number of diabetic patients, second only to China, has to face the challenge of battling the invasive fungal infection, says professor and Head of Department of Neurology, Guntur Medical College, and Government General Hospital, Guntur, N.V. Sundarachary. According to medical studies, 38% of the symptoms have occurred during the treatment of COVID-19 and 62% in the post-treatment period. “A study of pathophysiology for invasive fungus in COVID-19 reveals that immune dysregulation after COVID-19 predisposes to secondary infection. The hyperglycemic state in COVID-19 induces damage to pancreatic cells, resulting in acute diabetes due to high expression of ACE 2 receptors in pancreatic islets. Steroids and immunosuppressants used in the COVID-19 treatment also make it predisposed to invasive fungus,” said Dr. Sundarachary. “Black fungus is eukaryotic and has no flagella, and spreads through spores. While headache is the most common symptom, vision loss due to involvement of optic nerve cannot be ruled out. The infection can cause basal meningitis, cranial neuropathy after intracranial extension. The lesser the size, the more it causes meningitis. Fungal infections are subacute to chronic and indolent unlike bacterial infections, which are acute. All fungi are not ubiquitous as bacteria,” he said. But the good news is that most fungi are not harmful to humans, but most fungi cause infections in immunocompromised individuals. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection involving rhino, sinus, orbital and cerebral tissues. It is is commonly seen in patients in India, and mostly in immunosuppressed patients undergoing cancer treatment. Reasons “The reasons are irrational usage of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes, lymphopenia in COVID-19 and contamination through oxygen humidifiers. While pulmonary mucormycosis is uncommon in COVID-19 patients, aspergillosis is a common commensal,” he said. “Black crusts in nasal cavity, discharge from nasal cavity, swelling and numbness of paranasal sinus areas are the initial symptoms. If it spreads to orbit, proptosis, swelling and redness of orbit and eyelids, visual impairment and ophthalmoplegia are the symptoms,” said Dr. Sundarachary. The neurological symptoms include headache, facial pain, swelling and numbness, double vision, cavernous sinus thrombosis, vision loss, focal cerebral lesions mostly stroke, facial palsy, seizures and altered mental status. Diagnosis is through clinical, radiological features, and confirmation is through staining with KOH and, or histopathological examination. Since it is a medical emergency, early treatment improves survival. However, early surgical excision of necrotic lesions, and antifungal therapy can reduce the risk, he said. “The key message for prevention is use steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 in the right patient at the right time in the right dose for the right duration, and monitor and manage hyperglycemia efficiently,” Dr. Sundarachary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hyperglycemia-poses-a-challenge-in-treatment-of-black-fungus/article34654236.ece

Addressing the media at the party central office here on Wednesday, Mr. Venkatramaiah said that Mr. Naidu and Mr. Lokesh seemed to have lost their mental balance as Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been implementing welfare schemes with missionary zeal. He said that the Chief Minister would be completing two years of governance on May 30, and he had fulfilled 107 out of 129 promises made. While the TDP had published books as party manifesto and ignored it as soon as elections were over, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy considered the party manifesto as sacred and implemented 94.5% of the promises within two years of coming to power.

Critical juncture He said it was not right on their part to give strike call at this critical juncture. He said the government will have no objection to resolve the demands of doctors if they were legitimate. The doctors could again bring them to the notice of government to find a solution. Mr. Rao was responding to the demands of striking doctors when health officials brought the issue to his notice at a meeting to review COVID situation and vaccination on Wednesday. However, it was not right to boycott duties and put public health at stake by agitating time and again without considering the circumstances in vogue. People will not appreciate such a decision in health emergencies like COVID. When officials brought to his notice that the stipends paid to junior doctors in the State was less than what was paid in other States, he enquired about the demands and wanted it to be conceded at the earliest. As promised in the past, Mr. Rao said the senior resident doctors will get a 15 per cent hike in stipends and junior doctors who completed three years of medical education and drafted for COVID duties will also be paid on a par with the former.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-doctors-to-get-15-hike-in-stipend/article34653676.ece
27 May 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Schoolchildren can control hypertension in adults: UoH study||Children can help adults in managing their hypertension, also known as high Blood Pressure (BP), with their direct and indirect positive influence on them, a five-year study by the researchers at the University of Hyderabad revealed. The research of Prof. Meena Hariharan and Sandra Roshni Monteiro of Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad studied this aspect through quasi experiment on 250 schoolchildren from class 6 to class 9 who have an adult hypertensive person in their family, living under the same roof. Was this universally true in case of all children? “Children who measured high on conscientiousness, achievement motivation, perseverance, tenacity, were curious, and trust in their influencing power on the adult were found to be successful as change agents in hypertension management of their adult family members,” said Prof. Meena Hariharan. The researchers used different methods to inform the children about hypertension and these included educational videos with doctors explaining through illustrations and animations. The information covered practical aspects such as the causes, symptoms, role of medication, diet and exercise apart from the dangerous consequences of neglecting the same. This was repeated thrice within a period of 4 weeks. The children were given a monitoring diary to be filled everyday checks on whether the adult hypertensive member in the family was reminded about the medicine, exercise routine, and prescribed diet on that day. The hypertensive adult was contacted at the beginning of the study and their adherence to the medication, diet and exercise were recorded. Apart from this the children were also administered various tests to measure a number of psychosocial parameters related to their personality and behaviour. The children met the researcher once every seven days and submitted their monitoring diary and also interacted with her and shared their experiences. Before terminating the study, the adults were contacted once again and their adherence and BP were measured. Prof. Meena Hariharan said the results clearly indicated the positive role played by the children and the findings showed that the adults showed better efficiency in their regularity in taking medicines, diet and exercise regimen when monitored by children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/schoolchildren-can-control-hypertension-in-adults-uoh-study/article34654154.ece

At an online programme organised on the eve of the 11th anniversary of Manukota incident, speakers said the incident should be recorded for posterity as it was a key episode in the movement that led to formation of Telangana state. TJS president M. Kodandaram said the Telangana Joint Action Committee decided to oppose Jagan Reddy’s visit as it was precisely aimed at diluting the Telangana agitation and the aspirations of millions. He claimed that TRS president K. Chadrasekhar Rao did not object to the visit initially but relented due to the pressures of TRS leaders like Eatala Rajender. The way students fought to prevent the visit is an inspiration for all generations and the incident on May 28 should be observed with the same vigour, he said. Rebel TRS MLA Eatala Rajender said that the incident showcased people’s determination for self-respect and that it could not be suppressed for long.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/manukota-spirit-is-the-need-of-the-hour/article34654230.ece

The decision was taken at a meeting Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian had with stakeholders in the sector on Wednesday. The State government had for the first time extended the ban from 45 days, in force since 1994, to 52 days last year in view of the demand raised by traditional fishers. The Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation (SMTF) and Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi had favoured longer periods of ban on trawling during the monsoon as a measure to conserve marine fish resources. Jackson Pollayil said after the meeting that the SMTF was in favour of a longer period of ban though the Minister felt that the continuing lockdown and restrictions on fishing activities due to COVID-19 had to be considered when the ban was imposed. The Minister is learnt to have said that a longer period of trawling ban may be considered in the future as a step to conserving resources. Boat operators’ demand The All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators, however, said the 52-day ban would come into effect in addition to the days that had been lost due to the pandemic spread. In a recent letter to the Chief Minister, Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal of the Boat Owners’ Association said around 3,000 mechanised boats operated off the coast of Kerala and that another 800 boats from neighbouring States were engaged in fishing in Kerala waters. However, the restrictions being brought on fishing activities related only to the boats setting out from the Kerala coast whereas fishing boats from other States were engaged in fishing freely. The weather warnings and other restrictions were enforced only on the Kerala boats whereas boats from other states operated freely. All boats from other States have been ordered to leave the Kerala shore before June 9. All diesel pumps will be closed along the shore while the pumps operated by Matsyafed will supply the fuel to traditional boats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-to-enforce-52-day-trawl-ban/article34653678.ece

27 May 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ryots vow to wage protracted stir||Defying prohibitory orders, farmers on a call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) staged a black-flag demonstration in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here on Wednesday to mark the six months of struggle against the three farm laws. Leading the protest in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here, All India Kisan Sangharsh coordination committee Prakasam district unit president Ch. Ranga Rao said it was unfortunate that the Union government remained indifferent despite the protracted struggle by farmers. Farmers raised slogans to press for repeal of the “black” laws and for providing a statutory backing to the minimum support price regime as suggested by noted agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan. In Podili, Pradesh Congress Spokesman Sk.Saida criticised the State government for toeing the Centre’s line to phase out power subsidy to farmers. The Congress party would take a lead in mobilising all opposition parties to fight against the “anti-farmer” NDA government at the Centre, he asserted. Similar protests were organised in all the mandals demanding procurement of all crops at MSP at the Rythu Bharosa centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ryots-vow-to-wage-protracted-stir/article34654226.ece
27 May 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shed coronaphobia, say psychologists||Coronaphobia is more dangerous than the viral disease itself. Hence those infected should stop worrying about it in order to win the battle against the disease, according to expert psychologists T.M.Vimala and Shankar. As callers expressed their fears during a telecounselling session ‘Swantana’ held by the Indian Red Cross Society(IRCS) here, psychologists explained that mental stamina is all the more important as it conditions the body to fight against the disease. Dr. Vimala, head of the department of psychology at the Acharya Nagarjuna University(ANU), underscored the importance of maintaining composure during the challenging times. “The recovery rate is very high 99.34%. One must cultivate a positive attitude to post a healthy recovery,” explained Mr. Shankar. Only 0.66% of those who contract the infection lose the battle against the disease in view of complications arising out of other disorders like diabetes, hypertension, heart ailments, kidney disease etc., said Mr. Shankar, who has helped the student community overcome stress. ‘Take healthy diet’ It is natural to feel stressful during the pandemic. People should take a break from watching, reading, or listening to media reports. Instead they could start meditation and do activities they enjoy. It is all the more important to take a healthy diet, according to IRCS District Chairman P. Prakash Babu.

Sivankutty has said. Pravesanotsavam, Mr. Sivankutty told The Hindu , would be held on June 1 in compliance with COVID-19 protocols. A mass campaign would be taken up to attract students to public education sector. Challenges Mr. Sivankutty, who will have to grapple with the challenges of online education such as lack of access, meaningful assessment, and lack of connect with students, said any decision on school education would have to take into account the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. Hence, focus was on the immediate rather than the long-term for now. The Minister expressed concern over the mental and physical well-being of students. Mental health issues “It has come to our notice that children are anxious and moody. Many are not playing or studying; they have not met their friends or interacted with their teachers for long. We will hold discussions on how to address these issues,” he said. Once the COVID-19 wave starts abating to acceptable levels, the State government would seriously consider bringing children back to school, Mr. Sivankutty said. Five years of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission have seen a significant improvement in school infrastructure. Yet, infrastructure alone is not enough, he said. “Attention should be paid to improving academic standards,” he said. Steps have been taken to make available school textbooks in schools on time, though the press is closed down and there are not enough employees. Class XI exams A decision on the conduct of Class XI examinations would be taken after the conduct of the centralised valuation camps for SSLC, higher secondary and vocational higher secondary next month. Blending of digital classes on the KITE VICTERS with online classes by schoolteachers or continual assessment of students would also be considered in due course, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/digital-classes-will-continue-says-kerala-minister/article34653685.ece

27 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State pressing for supply of injections needed for treating black fungus: CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that the government is mounting pressure on the Union government to ensure supply of adequate number of injections required to treat the dreaded black fungus infection among COVID-19 patients. “It is estimated that a patient suffering from black fungus needs about 50 injections per week. The State has so far received only 3,000 injections, and there were indications that another 2,000 are being dispatched,” the Chief Minister said during a virtual review of the Spandana programme on Wednesday. Since the injections were not at all sufficient, the available injections should have to be used carefully, he told the District Collectors and Superintendents of Police. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said a decrease in the number of COVID-19 positive cases over the last few days gave some relief. The number was ranging from 15,000 to 16,000 against 24,000-odd cases recorded last week. However, the situation was still grim, and the Collectors of Chittoor and East Godavari districts needed to be particularly alert, he stated. The Chief Minister ordered that at least 50% of the beds in the private hospitals empanelled under the Aarogyasri be allocated to those availing of the scheme. He instructed the officials to take stringent action against the hospitals exploiting the patients. The Collectors should initiate criminal proceedings against hospitals flouting norms repeatedly. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the daily supply of medical oxygen was 330 tonnes last month. It reached 600 tonnes due to concerted efforts. He insisted that incidents such as the one that was witnessed at Ruia Hospital in Tirupati should not repeat. About 50,000 Remdesivir injections were being supplied to the government hospitals per week and 60,000 to the private hospitals, he said, cautioning those selling them in the black market. As far as the curfew was concerned, the Chief Minister aid if it was not implemented strictly, the Collectors and SPs would be considered as failing in their duty. Vaccination Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said two doses of vaccine were given to 23,69,164 persons and a single dose to 33,11,697 persons. The country required 172 crore doses to administer them to people aged above 18 years. Given the vaccine manufacturing and supply constraints, the State government gave priority to completing the vaccination for people older than 45 years, who were at a relatively high risk of contracting the virus, and then start inoculating the younger population. The Chief Minister said the government ought to implement various welfare and development programmes while grappling with the COVID-19 crisis. Job works Due priority should be attached to the MGNREGS, under which the State was sanctioned 20 crore man-days for the current year. The target to complete the construction of all village secretariats should be achieved by June 30 and Rythu Bharosa Kendras by July 8, he said. In a virtual meeting with the doctors and other healthcare workers, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy thanked them for dedicating themselves to fighting the pandemic at great personal risk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-pressing-for-supply-of-injections-needed-for-treating-black-fungus-cm/article34654243.ece
27 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Good blood sugar level can check black fungus, says expert||LV Prasad Eye Institute, Tadepalli, senior ophthalmologist and oculoplasty specialist Dr. Anasua Ganguly Kapoor has said the risk of contracting mucormycosis can be reduced by properly maintaining blood sugar levels during the COVID infection period and early post-recovery phase. Also, maintaining the hygiene of oxygen masks and humidifiers with utmost care can help patients in keeping the fungus at bay. Vulnerable group In a release on Tuesday, Dr. Kapoor said that mucormycosis (also known as black fungus) was caused by an infection called mucor occurred in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, those undergoing cancer chemotherapy or on long-term steroid therapy. It could occur during the COVID-19 infection period or early post-recovery phase in vulnerable patients due to the use of steroid and oxygen. “ICU admissions with long-term oxygen inhalation may result in a drop in oxygen mask hygiene. If the patient has pre-existing, poorly controlled diabetes, he/she is more at risk of developing mucormycosis,” Dr. Kapoor said. The patients who find symptoms should immediately consult specialised eye surgeons such as oculoplasty specialists or ENT surgeons as early and localised infections could be treated with intravenous and local anti-fungal injections followed by a long course of oral anti-fungal medications. However, extensively spread infections required a surgery in which eyeball removal might be necessary in some cases. Though mucor was present in the oral and respiratory lining of healthy individuals it would not manifest as an infection due to the presence of a healthy and intact immune system, she added. LV Prasad Eye Institute has set up a hotline 1800 200 2211 to create awareness on mucormycosis. It can be reached between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/good-blood-sugar-level-can-check-black-fungus-says-expert/article34653730.ece

27 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bed shortage slowly easing in district||An acute shortage of oxygen-equipped beds that had gripped the district over the past few weeks has eased considerably, Collector V. Vinay Chand said on Wednesday. “Allotment of beds has been streamlined through the real-time managed 104 portal, and at any given time, there are 100-150 beds with oxygen supply available, including a few ICU beds available under the Collector’s quota,” he said. The district administration has already taken over 50% of the beds at all the 68 private COVID-notified hospitals and it has 17 government hospitals including 11 CHCs in the rural area under its control. As of now, over 6,000 beds, including 909 ICU beds, 3,132 oxygenated beds and 1,955 beds without oxygen are under the district collector's control. All these beds are under Aarogyasri and no hospital can deny admission, as a team comprising senior officers such as RDO, DMHO and director of Aarogyasri have visited all private hospitals and have taken physical possession of the beds earmarked for Aarogyasri. The data is fed on a real-time basis into the 104 portal and all one has to do is to call 104 and a bed will be allotted, said Mr. Vinay Chand. Moreover, the district has been seeing an encouraging number of discharges in recent days, which is also a major reason behind the availability of beds. Agreeing that there were issues with allotment of beds till a week ago, the Collector said the situation improved after the beds began to be integrated with the 104 helpline. “I did not receive any phone calls in the last one week requesting for admission to hospital. This is an indication that things are improving. Apart from 6,000-odd beds under the government’s control, the remaining are open for payment, which again is regulated by officials. Allotment of these beds is also done through the 104 portal,” he said. He also said that apart from 909 ICU beds and 3,132 beds with oxygen supply, the remaining 1,955 normal beds can be connected with B-type or D-type oxygen cylinders or concentrators. Capacity augmentation “The district administration will be adding 500 beds at the makeshift hospital being built by Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Right now, 50 beds are ready and by mid-June, the remaining 450 will be ready. All the beds will be connected to gaseous oxygen from the plant and VSP will also provide medicinal support. The district administration will provide manpower. We will use the services of medical students as the government has already approved the use of house surgeons,” the Collector said. This apart, 300 beds at KGH, in the Bhavanagar and Rajendra Prasad wards, have been taken over for COVID treatment and they have started functioning, in addition to the existing CSR block.

27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre needs to allow more vaccine makers: KTR||Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao said the Centre needs to permit more COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to supply given that the demand-supply equation for the shots in the country is “quite bad.” “My personal opinion is the Government of India should reach out and give whatever [support] needed to Pfizer, Moderna, Sinovac and to other vaccine manufacturers in the world who can give us as much supply as possible in the shortest possible time,” he said after inaugurating a 100-bed facility for COVID-patients in the IT hub of the city. ‘Vaccines lying idle’ Suggesting such an approach since Pfizer and Moderna have conveyed that they would prefer dealing with the Centre when some States sought to source vaccines from them, Mr. Rao said, “I am also told there are vaccines lying idle elsewhere in the world, in Canada, Denmark and the United States.” The Minister said this pointing out to how the demand for the vaccine in the country is “quite high [while] the supply is meagre.” “Unfortunately, while we are the vaccine hub of the world, it is unfortunate that we don’t have vaccines for our own people,” he said. Noting that “everything is being governed by the Government of India and I hope the situation will improve,” Mr. Rao said if sufficient vaccine doses are made available to Telangana, the State government has the capability to administer one million doses per day. “We can cover the entire State population in about 45 days,” he said. Earlier, he went round the 100-bed facility, including six bridge ICU beds, under Project Ashray that has been co-anchored by United Way Hyderabad and Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) with support from Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association, American Chamber of Commerce, Telangana Social Impact Group and TIE Hyderabad as well as the Cyberabad Police Commisionerate. The facility is intended for mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. The medical infrastructure, doctors, nurses, medical staff and day to day operations will be taken care by Grace Cancer Foundation. A release said several companies have donated and extended CSR grants while volunteers worked relentlessly to turn the idea into operations in just six days. Once the number of COVID-19 cases decline, the plan is to donate the infrastructure to government and other charity hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-needs-to-allow-more-vaccine-makers-ktr/article34654162.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Medicos to shun COVID emergency duties too||In spite of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s assurance to implement a 15% hike in their stipends, junior and senior resident doctors have decided to go ahead with the boycott of emergency services in government hospitals from Thursday. As a result, both COVID and non-COVID emergency services are likely to be hit as over 3,100 doctors will be on strike. They began boycott of elective duties from Wednesday itself. Health department officials have made arrangements to ensure the services are not affected. Though the State government reached out to them on Wednesday, members of Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) and Telangana Senior Resident Doctors Association (TSRDA) said on that not all of their demands were met. They sought a written assurance that beds at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) would be allotted if any healthcare worker (HCW) or their family members needed COVID-19 hospitalisation. They wanted State government to issue ex-gratia in case of death. The junior doctors and senior resident doctors attend COVID duties at various levels, including in ICUs. The decision not to attend duties during the peak of pandemic second wave has come under criticism from a few sections of the society as well as senior doctors. Charged up members of TJUDA held a press conference in Hyderabad on Wednesday where they gave reasons for boycotting duties in these tough times. They also questioned why politicians checked into corporate hospitals for COVID treatment and also why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao underwent CT Scan at a corporate hospital instead of at the State-run Gandhi Hospital. President of TJUDA-Gandhi Hospital unit, V. Mani Kiran Reddy said that their parents too have co-morbidities such as high blood pressure and high sugar levels and are worried that they might pass on the virus to their family members. “We have boycotted duties at this time since we are alive and can voice our issues. We don’t know if we will be alive tomorrow. We want assurance from the government that they will take care if something were to happen to us,” Dr Mani Kiran said. TJUDA advisory committee member M. Rajeev said that while lockdown has been implemented to save lives of people, they have boycotted duties to save themselves. He added that if they get involved in finding a bed for a family member with COVID, work pressure on their colleagues increases. “A written assurance that bed will be allotted at NIMS will help us focus on work. Our family members ask us what is the use of holding the job if we are not alive,” he said. Asked why they don’t get admitted to government hospitals, Dr Rajeev said doing so at Gandhi Hospital would mean depriving poor patients of beds. “Money has to be paid for treatment at NIMS. The State government can take care of the expenses. We are providing free service and are requesting free treatment,” he said. Till the time of going to press, discussions about boycotting emergency duties was under way as there was some difference of opinion among TJUDA members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/medicos-to-shun-covid-emergency-duties-too/article34654144.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Second wave in State may wane by the end of June||The devastating second wave of COVID-19, which has left a large population in financial and emotional distress, might peter out by the end of June in Telangana. Besides, cases are estimated to drop significantly in one week. This is expected to bring down the number of severe cases, thereby decreasing the load on hospitals. Senior officials of the Health department made these projections at a press conference on Wednesday. They also spoke about post-COVID out-patient services at government hospitals to check on people who suffer from complications after recovery, special vaccination drive for high-risk groups such as fruit and vegetable vendors from May 28 to 30, alternatives to Liposomal Amphotericin-B and other crucial aspects that are troubling people. Pointing out that the State would come out of the second wave by end of June, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that the situation would come under control by May-end. The decline in positivity rate was also mentioned. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said that the cases will drop significantly in the next one week. Stating that 50% of beds in government hospitals were available, Dr Ramesh Reddy said that the beds in Gandhi Hospital and the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences are currently full as critical cases are being treated there. The senior official said that beds in the two hospitals would be available when the critical cases recover and get discharged. Early detection Dr Srinivasa Rao spoke about the State government’s fever survey and COVID Out-Patient (OP) services which is helping in early identification of people with symptoms of COVID. This aids in early isolation, treatment, and recovery. The senior official said that increase in incidence of COVID in rural areas is not witnessed in Telangana unlike in other States as the fever survey was initiated around two weeks ago which helps in early identification and recovery. Over 13 lakh people were screened at 1,518 OP clinics at government health facilities and 2,78,502 people with symptoms were identified. And another 2,41,103 people with symptoms were identified by 33,374 teams who conducted round one of fever survey. Isolation kits were distributed to them. Dr Srinivasa Rao said that over 1.57 lakh people with symptoms were identified in the second round of the survey. Over 1 lakh tests daily The COVID-19 tests which dropped to around 70,000 a day might increase to over 1 lakh again. The Health department conducted 1 lakh to 1.3 lakh tests per day from April 8 to 24. However, the daily testing gradually dipped to around 70,000 thereafter. People have been complaining that the number of tests at government health facilities were limited and that they had to wait for many days to get tested. Citing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s orders that no one should be denied a COVID test, Dr Srinivasa Rao said they will increase the tests to 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh daily in a few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/second-wave-in-state-may-wane-by-the-end-of-june/article34654139.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Use alternative to low-supply anti-fungal drug: DME||Distressed family members of several patients suffering from Mucormycosis or Black Fungus have been running around medical stores and posting SOS calls on Twitter, requesting help with finding 100 or more vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B. Now, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy has said that alternative but equally effective medicines must be prescribed to counter the short supply of Liposomal Amphotericin-B. He added that drug companies will take 15 to 20 days to ramp up production. Prescribing Posaconazole as an alternative, he said, would bring down the anxiety and distress among patients’ attendants who are knocking on all doors to get 100 or more vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B. Posaconazole is being used in other States too, he explained. While the anti-fungal medicine is available at government hospitals, attendants of patients admitted to private hospitals have to get it by submitting online applications. Those are then scrutinised by a committee comprising the DME and government hospitals doctors. Though many applications were approved, most of them were given only 5-6 vials of Amphotericin-B while their requirement was 60 or more vials. No.5 in India According to a tweet by Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Wednesday, 744 patients in Telangana were undergoing treatment as on May 25. This is the fifth highest number of cases among all States. Around 1,889 vials of Amphotericin-B were allotted to the State on Tuesday. Dr Reddy said that while there have received 300 to 400 applications, only a few hundreds of vials of the anti-fungal injection are issued to the State. “Practically, there is no chance to give 120-150-200 vials to everyone. So, use available drugs which are equally effective and available rather than stopping treatment,” the DME said adding that alternatives like Posaconazole injections and tablets are equally effective which are being used in neighbouring States too. Post-COVID care To check if people are developing any health complications such as Mucormycosis after recovering from COVID, the Health department would start Post-COVID Out-Patient clinics at government teaching and other hospitals in a few days. He said that patients who have recovered from severe form of COVID might have long-term complications such as lung fibrosis apart from fungal and bacterial infections. These complications have to be evaluated on time by following up on patients after recovery. Besides, a separate OP is opened at Government ENT Hospital to evaluate people who suspect they have Mucormycosis. Endoscopy and other tests would be conducted. If someone has mild form of the fungal infection, they would be asked to consult again after 2-3 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/use-alternative-to-low-supply-anti-fungal-drug-dme/article34654140.ece
27 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Walking track shrinks lake||The Nacharam Lake has shrunk by an additional 15 acres after the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation filled it to lay a 20-metre-wide walking track stretching to over 3 kilometres over the past four months. The amount of land filled up is bigger than the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the southern side, the width of the land filled up is more than 40 metres, ignoring the natural contours of the lake. “This was laid in three months’ time,” said a GHMC staffer guarding the site which has an attached garden. The natural rock formations inside the lake have been blasted near the weir on the eastern side of the lake, robbing it of its natural beauty that had an eight-foot-high fence running around it protecting from encroachments. A 2013 Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority survey showed that the Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu was spread over 108.3 acres. The areas surrounding the Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu including Indira Nagar and Raghavendra Colony were swamped in September 2017 after a series of upstream lakes got flooded. The Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu is part of the chain of lakes beginning with Safilguda Lake, Mirzalguda Cheruvu, Nacharam Cheruvu that empties into the Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu. The water from the lake then flows on through a series of channels to Nallacheruvu in Peerzadiguda before draining into the Musi River near Nagole. “By filling up the lake with such a wide road which the GHMC is calling walking-cum-cycling track they are annihilating the lake. The lives of people around the lake are being put at risk due to this filling up of the lake,” says environmental activist Lubna Sarwath who has moved the Telangana State Human Rights Commission against the activities of the civic body. “On the southern side, the road has been laid inside the lake dividing it into two allowing more encroachments. A private telecom company has erected poles on the road. These activities are not permitted inside the Full Tank Level (FTL) of any lake,” says Ms. Sarwath. Hyderabad has been affected by a series of localised urban flooding due to encroachments in the FTL of lakes and construction activity on the nalas and water channels. In October of 2020, the southern part of Hyderabad witnessed massive flooding as a series of lakes broke the bunds creating havoc in large swathes of the city. As Hyderabad prepares for another normal monsoon predicted by Indian Meteorological Department, it remains to be seen how the filling up of the Nacharam Pedda Cheruvu affects the surrounding areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/walking-track-shrinks-lake/article34654156.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CSC completes 76% of paddy purchases||The Civil Supplies Corporation (CSC) has purchased from farmers till date over 60.5 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of paddy, making purchase of over 76% of the commodity produced in the rabi. The corporation had spent Rs. 11,414 crore for purchase of the paddy with procurement of 20 LMT still to be completed. With food grain cultivated on 52.76 lakh acres during the season, the total yield was estimated at 1.29 crore MT of which the department targeted purchase of around 80 LMT. The balance close to 50 LMT went towards requirement of seed, quantity required for local and farmers’ own needs and stocks purchased by local millers. Civil Supplies Corporation chairman M. Srinivas Reddy said the corporation is purchasing paddy in line with the targets set and the process is continuing in spite of the threats posed by COVID-19 and restrictions in place on account of the lockdown. The corporation had purchased 60.5 LMT of food grain from 8.82 lakh farmers this season as against the 52.73 LMT purchased during the same period last year, marking an increase of close to 8 LMT. In all, 656 procurement centres in 12 districts including Nizamabad, Nirmal, Mancherial, Kamareddy and Jagtial had been closed as the procurement process had been completed there. The officials concerned had been directed to move the left over gunny bags in these districts to centres operational in other districts to meet their requirements. Mr. Srinivas Reddy directed the officials to blacklist such contractors who fail to arrange vehicles as agreed upon and take steps to further streamline the appointment of contractors in the coming seasons. He lamented that fair price shop dealers are not surrendering the left over gunny bags to the corporation as expected. This could be seen from the fact that as against the target of 30 lakh bags every month, the corporation received 9.44 lakh in March and 7.9 lakh in April. He directed the ration dealers to return the bags in time keeping in view their increased use due to significantly higher yields. He said the corporation is procuring food grain with 17% moisture content in line with the guidelines issued by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/csc-completes-76-of-paddy-purchases/article34654165.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Uncertainty over State Formation Day celebrations||Uncertainty continues over the State Formation Day celebration on June 2 with expectations that it will be on a low key for the second consecutive year. Coming as it is amid the threat posed by the second wave of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the government is yet to discuss on whether or not to organise the celebrations in view of the persisting cases. “No decision has been taken on the issue so far,” was how a senior official responded when contacted by The Hindu . Lockdown decision The government is yet to take a decision on whether to continue the lockdown, whose deadline is ending on May 30, for some more days or whether to relax the restrictions. A section of senior officials appear to be in favour of extension of lockdown for some more days till the completion of phase-wise mass vaccination that is set to start from May 28 for the super spreaders. The Health Department on its part appears to be against giving scope for mass gathering events like the State Formation Day celebrations for some more time till the virus is reined in. In this backdrop, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has convened a meeting of the State Cabinet on Sunday to discuss important issues facing the State, including the COVID-19 situation and ongoing lockdown. Low-key celebrations Officials are hopeful that the meeting would take a call on the lockdown as also the mode in which the State Formation Day should be celebrated. The formation day celebrations were on a low key previous year too with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao paying tributes to the martyrs’ memorial and hoisting the tricolor at Pragati Bhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uncertainty-over-state-formation-day-celebrations/article34654167.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Vaccine slots for 18+ booked in 15 minutes||Vaccination for citizens aged between 18 and 44 years in Telagana started on Wednesday, and those who managed to get their first shot against COVID-19 were indeed lucky as the slots vanished in under 15 minutes. The inoculation drive for this age group is permitted only at Private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (PCVCs). Managements of a few private hospitals were baffled at how fast the slots filled up. “The slots were booked in a few minutes after opening it up on CoWin. We don’t know how that happened,” said the head of a corporate hospital in Hyderabad.

27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Lift lockdown in a phased manner’||The Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) has called for a phase-wise relaxation of lockdown in the State. The more than a century old umbrella body of trade and industry association favoured such a move while highlighting the need to lift the lockdown. “Obviously, lifting of the lockdown is necessary as it helps us to get back on our feet and resume economic activity,” FTCCI president Ramakanth Inani said. In doing so, a phased lifting of lockdown be considered perhaps “indexed to the number of active COVID-19 cases or based on priority of need of the people and financial importance. This can be both in terms of relaxation in timings or activities,” he said in a statement on Tuesday, extending FTCCI’s support to the government to strike a balance. “If a lockdown is a must, it has to be a calibrated one which allows economic pursuits while coming down hard on people who are COVID protocol non-compliant,” he said. Police should announce suitable and mutually convenient timings to allow the employees and vehicles of exempted industries to commute and ply. “We request them to ensure that there should be no indiscriminate seizure of genuine vehicles or people,” he said. Arguing for lifting of the lockdown, the FTCCI president said for the past one year trade and industry have been reeling under the effects of slowdown of the economy. The second wave of the pandemic has worsened the financial health and mental well-being of the people, he said. The statement comes in the backdrop of small and medium enterprises particularly finding it challenging to operate amid the lockdown restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lift-lockdown-in-a-phased-manner/article34654163.ece

27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers mark 6 months of stir with ‘Black Day’||A raging pandemic, extreme weather conditions and “intimidation” from authorities on several occasions had not been able to break the movement, protesting farmers at the Singhu border said as they marked six months of the agitation on Wednesday. Thousands of farmers from the Capital’s neighbouring States had reached the city’s borders in November last year, demanding a complete repeal of the three controversial farm laws brought in by the Centre. Amid sloganeering, hoisting black flags and burning effigies, the protesting farmers maintained that their demands of a repeal of the three laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price, remained the same as on the first day of them reaching the borders of the national capital. Brief ruckus At Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, hundreds of farmers, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, converged into groups as they burnt an effigy of the Centre in protest. A ruckus briefly ensued between protesters and the local police, donning anti-riot gears, who had tried to stop them from burning the effigy at the UP Gate below the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. Amardeep Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district, who has been camping at the Singhu border since the initial days of the agitation said, “Sitting somewhere far away from one’s family is difficult for anyone. To add to it, the government also tried to pressurise us in all sorts of ways. At times they create panic about COVID-19 and at other times, they disrupted water and electricity supplies. They even tried to torture youth by bringing up some “Toolkit” issue. But we have the Almighty’s blessings and we have managed to resist all kinds of threats.” “Trolleys have been modified and harvest season managed without a glitch. People are back to the border in large numbers. This agitation will continue and we will follow whatever our leaders say,” said Mr. Singh. Referring to an instance of police action which took place after people claiming to be locals staged a protest at the Singhu border in January, Gurmeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Moga district said, “Neither the police nor the extreme weather conditions could break us. We are as determined as ever. The protest is on and will continue till our demands are met. We will not accept anything lesser than a complete repeal of the laws.” “This movement is a fight for our identity. Agriculture is our livelihood and if the laws are implemented then we will anyway have to die. We might as well die while fighting for our rights. We will continue the struggle and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to take back the laws,” said Mr. Singh. Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from the Roopnagar district said that the movement will be intensified if the laws are not repealed and groups of youth will be sent to different parts of the country including, election-bound States, to raise awareness. “If the government withdraws the laws then it will be good. If they do not, then groups of youth will be sent to States like Uttar Pradesh to raise more awareness. Ground-level preparations are already under way. The elections which are to take place next year will be an important test for this government,” said Mr. Singh. Further, Mr. Singh added, “Through the agitation we have realised the concept of humanity and how to fight for others. We have seen how all States have participated and supported us. Everyone has now realised that the current government has only spread hate. The youth is also more aware and will not believe any manifesto which is put before them. They have realised the importance of questioning everything. Today [Wednesday] was a special day for us as we observed a “Black Day”. The Delhi police have urged people not to hold gatherings due to the COVID-19 situation and the ongoing lockdown and said it is keeping a tight vigil to deal with any situation at the protest sites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/farmers-mark-6-months-of-stir-with-black-day/article34654124.ece

A senior officer said that Mr. Kumar has stayed numb since the time of arrest. “His family members approached us as they wanted to meet him but they were denied.

He was only given food from the police mess and has been under round-the-clock monitoring. He remains quiet all day and answers only a few questions.  Meanwhile, Ashok Dhankad, father of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar who died after he was allegedly brutally assaulted by other wrestlers inside Chhatrasal Stadium, asked the government to take back awards from Mr. Kumar. “We demand fair probe in the case and strict punishment should be given to him for the offence. No guru [teacher] should do this to his disciple. The government should also take back the awards which were given to him,” said Mr. Dhankad, who is in the Delhi police force. Mr. Dhankad said that his son’s wrestling career started from Pratap School in Kharkhoda and since 2013, he was practising in Chhatrasal Stadium. Stiff competition He had participated in the world championship in Finland and Asian Championship in Taiwan. “Sagar, a former junior national champion, wanted to go to Georgia for practice as he told me that there was stiff competition in the senior category and he needed to prepare, but due to COVID-19, he could not go there. He has 10-12 medals, including, four to five gold medals,” Mr. Dhankad said. Police said they have information that a day before the brawl, there was an argument between Mr. Kumar and Sagar at the stadium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/numb-sushil-kumar-celebrates-birthday-in-lock-up/article34654119.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC grants Rs. 6 lakh to sodomy victim||The Delhi High Court has granted interim compensation of Rs. 6 lakh to a six-year-old boy, who was subjected to sexual assault, abuse and sodomy by his uncle in the victim’s own house. “Since the system cannot turn the clock back nor ‘undo’ the offence, there is little else the court can do other than prosecute the offender and provide to the victim whatever psychological security and sense of empowerment that monetary compensation can give,” Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani rued. The court also set aside the initial compensation of Rs. 50,000 awarded to the boy by a trial court here saying that the sum was low, to say the least. The High Court said that while attempting to quantify the compensation payable to the victim even at the interim stage, the court’s effort should be to offer monetary recompense, to the extent possible, for atonement of the crime. The court noted that the child was subjected to physical and mental trauma and emotional scar was left on his psyche. The prosecution of the accused in the 2020 case is under way and at the stage of recording evidence. The court also noted that the victim belonged to an extremely weak financial background with a mother who works as a housemaid and a bedridden father and the family’s monthly household income is about Rs. 6,000 in which four members are to sustain. Advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing the child, argued that the Additional Sessions Judge has failed to appreciate that even at interim stage the compensation is to be granted to a minor who is victim of sexual abuse to enable him or her and the family to overcome the incident. She said the child needs to be compensated for the damaging effect on the victim’s psyche.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-grants-rs-6-lakh-to-sodomy-victim/article34654117.ece

Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan said that Mumbai has started vaccination centres for pregnant and lactating women without registration, and Delhi should do likewise to boost immunity of such women. “With Delhi running short of vaccines, and CM Arvind [Kejriwal] making no earnest efforts to buy vaccines directly from the Indian/foreign companies on time, it is unlikely that these special category of women would get their vaccine shots any time soon, as there is a severe vaccine crunch now,” Ms. Dhawan said.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh also directed web portal, Indian Kanoon, to block access to the judgment till the next date of hearing on August 20. “Prima facie this court is of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to some interim protection, while the legal issues are pending adjudication by this court,” the HC noted. The man, in his plea, stated that he is a professional of Indian-origin but an American citizen by birth. When he travelled in 2009 to India, a case under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was lodged against him. However, he was acquitted by a local court here in April 2011. Thereafter, the man travelled back to the U.S. and pursued law at the University of San Diego School of Law. He then realised that he is facing a huge disadvantage due to the fact that the court judgment was available on a Google search to any potential employer, who wanted to conduct his background verification before employing him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/remove-links-to-verdict-in-drug-case-hc-tells-google/article34654116.ece

27 May 2021||Pune,||‘Centre, State must clarify stance on Maratha quota’||Stating that the Maratha community was growing increasingly restless after the Supreme Court scrapped the Maratha reservation law, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji and an influential community leader, urged both the Central and State government to clarify their stance on the issue and take steps to reassure the community. The Kolhapur royal, who is on a tour of Maharashtra in a bid to find a way of resolving the quota imbroglio, said there was no need for further street agitations on part of the Maratha community in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The time has come for both the State and Central government to stop pointing fingers at each other and instead say what they propose to do for the Maratha community … since the Supreme Court’s unfortunate verdict, the community is growing increasingly restless by the day. I urge the State government to strongly advocate giving a separate quota for the community,” he said in Aurangabad on Wednesday. Mr. Raje further said that he would be meeting Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the BJP’s Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday to discuss the issue. “About 70% of the community is poor and it is high time they were given justice. I am not speaking from the vantage point of my position as a Maratha royal, but as a community member. Also, if the issue of Maratha reservation can be resolved by my resignation, then I am ready,” he said. Appealing to the Maratha community not to agitate on the streets in view of the pandemic, Mr. Raje also exhorted political parties to stop politicising the reservation issue. “It is not right to take to the streets and hold people hostage with protests ... But, if governments prove ineffectual in solving the problems of the Maratha community, they will have no alternative but to resort to desperate measures,” Mr. Raje said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centre-state-must-clarify-stance-on-maratha-quota/article34653854.ece
27 May 2021||Beijing,||U.S. peddling conspiracies, says China||China on Wednesday accused the U.S. of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” as the theory resurfaced that the coronavirus emerged from a Wuhan laboratory, while urging Washington to open its virology facilities to scrutiny. Led by the U.S., pressure is mounting for a new probe into the origins of COVID-19 after a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China, beset by delays and dogged by political baggage, returned inconclusive findings. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has returned to the spotlight after a report in The Wall Street Journal , citing U.S. intelligence, said three laboratory workers there were hospitalised in November 2019 with coronavirus-like symptoms, a month before the pandemic’s first declared case. The newspaper also said researchers had collected samples seven years earlier from a mine in southwestern China, where miners had contracted a mysterious illness from a new, bat-borne coronavirus. Repeating an earlier denial of the report, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, accused the U.S. of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation such as a laboratory leak”. The theory that the killer virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory was originally fuelled by, among others, the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Zhao said it was “disrespectful” to the WHO probe to revive the theory, and risked an “undermining of global solidarity to fight the virus”. Since infecting its first victims in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the pathogen has struck almost every country in the world, killing more than 3.4 million people and eviscerating national economies. “If the U.S. really wants full transparency then it should, like China did, invite WHO experts to visit the U.S. and investigate,” Zhao added. “Open up Fort Detrick military base as early as possible, and all the bio labs the U.S. has around the world,” he said, referring to a U.S. research facility in Maryland. The long-delayed report, by the team of international experts sent to Wuhan and their Chinese counterparts, drew no firm conclusions on the origins of the pandemic. Instead, the WHO-led team said the virus most likely jumped from bats to humans via an intermediate animal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-peddling-conspiracies-says-china/article34653611.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Quad targeting China: Consul General||China’s Consul General in Mumbai said it was “self-contradictory” to ask China to keep supply chains open, amid a current surge in Indian imports of supplies, while at the same time “threatening decoupling” between the Indian and Chinese economies. He also hit out at the India-United States-Japan-Australia grouping, known as the Quad, describing it as “an attempt for containment”. “It is self-contradictory for some Indian media and think tanks to ask China keeping the supply chain open on the one hand, and threaten decoupling with China on the other. Such opportunistic and protective ideas will only add up to the problem,” said Tang Guocai. He was speaking at a seminar on Tuesday on poverty reduction organised by China’s Consulate in Mumbai, along with the South Indian Education Society in Mumbai and the Yunnan International Research Centre, according to remarks published on the consulate’s website. Working together He said organisations and businesses in China were “making every effort supporting India to fight the virus”. “As a matter of fact, China is providing the vast majority of oxygen concentrators and other medical supplies India needs,” Mr. Tang said. “China is the first country to get out of the pandemic and resume development, offering India and the region huge opportunities. We are glad to find the second wave of COVID-19 here is melting down. As two of the world’s largest vaccine producers, China and India have every reason to join hand and work for the final victory against the pandemic in our region and the world.” Since early April, Chinese firms had received orders for more than 60,000 oxygen concentrators from Indian firms, of which around half have been exported, in addition to more than 5,000 ventilators. India has asked China to keep supply chains open to ensure smooth movement of goods after Sichuan Airlines last month announced a 15-day suspension in cargo flights. The airline later said it would resume services. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said earlier this month companies had been encountering difficulties in logistics, but following his April 30 conversation with his counterpart Wang Yi, approvals had been expedited and the logistics chain was flowing. China’s government has criticised India’s recent moves to not include its telecom firms in 5G trials and to place more stringent curbs on FDI coming in from countries that share a border with India, seen widely as being aimed at Beijing. RCEP deal On calls to accelerate decoupling from China, Mr. Tang said “Western ‘Hawkish strategy’ and ‘wolf pack tactics’ will eventually shoot themselves in the foot”, as he drew a contrast between the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal, which India withdrew from, and the Quad, describing RCEP as bringing in “a new wave of multilateralism and free trade”. “The integration and development of East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia are unstoppable,” he said “RCEP has always opened its door to India,” he said. “On the other hand, ‘the group of four’ (Quad) advocates so-called democratic alliance, and targets certain specific country in an attempt for containment.” He said China’s experiences in poverty reduction, particularly its rural revitalisation strategy, offered lessons for India, with the government last year announcing the eradication of absolute poverty. Poverty eradication was premised on the idea that “China does not simply ‘transfuse blood’ to the poor, but to encourage them to work hard and ‘make blood’ themselves”. He also slammed the West for hindering China’s development and said “under the pretext of the so-called democracy and human rights issues, they disrupt the agriculture industry of developing countries”. “For instance, the West has been fabricating the so-called “cotton human rights” issue in Xinjiang, China,” he said referring to allegations of forced labour and human rights abuses in the cotton industry. “In fact, India’s cotton-spinning and agriculture also suffered likewise,” he said. “They are actually trying to create racial divisions politically and stifle the foundation of national rejuvenation economically, so that China and India will remain poor and weak forever.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/quad-targeting-china-consul-general/article34653618.ece
27 May 2021||Minsk,||Defiant Lukashenko defends plane diversion, blasts critics||A defiant President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday defended Belarus’s diversion of a European flight and arrest of a dissident on board, lashing out at critics at home and abroad. In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and Opposition journalist Roman Protasevich arrested on Sunday, Mr. Lukashenko dismissed the international outcry the incident provoked. “I acted lawfully to protect our people,” Mr. Lukashenko said in an address to Parliament, the Belta state-run news agency reported. The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said. “Our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state,” Mr. Lukashenko said. “They have crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality.” Mr. Lukashenko — often dubbed “Europe’s last dictator” — is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 26-year rule of ex-Soviet Belarus. The strongman and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. European leaders are now accusing authorities in Minsk of essentially hijacking the passenger flight, and they agreed this week to cut air links with Belarus and told airliners to avoid the country’s airspace. The Belarusian Opposition has called for further and stronger measures, and the UN Security Council was set to meet behind closed doors later on Wednesday. The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Mr. Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. Belarus has released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair flight, in which the crew was told “you have a bomb on board” and urged to land in Minsk. Mr. Lukashenko denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an “absolute lie”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/defiant-lukashenko-defends-plane-diversion-blasts-critics/article34653613.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Dhaka clears currency swap for Lanka||Bangladesh on Tuesday cleared a $200 million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka, becoming the first South Asian country to extend crucial financial assistance to the island nation this year. Dhaka-based The Daily Star newspaper reported on Wednesday that Bangladesh was extending “a lifeline of sorts to the beleaguered Sri Lankan economy”, offering to top up its depleting foreign reserves. “The board of the Bangladesh Bank has decided in principle to lend $200-250 million from Bangladesh’s reserves to Sri Lanka for three months,” Mohammad Sirajul Islam, a spokesman for the Bangladesh Bank, the country’s central bank, told AFP in Dhaka. With Sri Lanka’s main foreign exchange-earning sectors — tourism, export of garments and tea — badly hit due to the pandemic, the country has been struggling to maintain its reserves in the face of a daunting debt repayment schedule.  Foreign reserves In April 2021, Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves stood at $4.5 billion, about the same amount that the country is due to settle this year in external loan repayments. So far this year, Colombo has obtained financial assistance from China, through a $1.5 billion currency swap arrangement, and a $500 million loan, in addition to the $500 million extended last year. Sri Lanka also inked a $500 million loan-agreement with the EXIM Bank of Korea a fortnight ago. India, which extended a $400 million currency swap facility from the Reserve Bank of India — it was settled in February 2021 after an extension — is yet to respond to Sri Lanka’s year-old request for an additional $1.1 billion currency swap facility. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made the request during a telephone conversation with PM Narendra Modi in May 2020. New Delhi is also yet to approve Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s request for a debt moratorium, which he sought before the pandemic hit the region. Meanwhile, Dhaka clearing the request — discussed during PM Mahinda Rajapaksa’s visit to the capital in March — brings some relief to Colombo, senior officials said, although the decision is yet to be formalised in a bilateral agreement. Despite the pandemic, Bangladesh’s foreign reserves hit a record high in April, crossing the $45 billion mark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/dhaka-clears-currency-swap-for-lanka/article34653619.ece
27 May 2021||Washington,||Los Angeles Mayor may be next U.S. Ambassador to India: report||U.S. President Joe Biden is reportedly preparing to name Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti as the next Ambassador to India. Mr Garcetti is a long-time political ally of the President. News of his imminent nomination was reported by Axios, which had, earlier in May, reported that Mr. Garcetti was being considered for the New Delhi job. Mr. Garcetti, a co-chair for the Biden campaign, was considered for a Cabinet post, according to Axios, but did not make it due to sexual harassment allegations against his former aide Rick Jacobs came to light. Two-term Mayor Mr. Garcetti is now approaching the end (December 2022) of his second term as Mayor of the country’s second largest city, a post he has held since 2013. The U.S.-India relationship enjoys bipartisan support in the U.S. with ties in trade, defence and the COVID-19 response growing across the Trump and Biden administrations. The two countries have also had to navigate their relationship in the context of growing Chinese assertiveness and aggression. The next U.S. Ambassador to India will inherit these issues as well as having to work with India in other forums — such as the Quad. Mr. Biden is expected to send the Senate a number of Ambassadorial nominations next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/los-angeles-mayor-may-be-next-us-ambassador-to-india-report/article34653620.ece

Washington is in the final stages of withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, and a flurry of diplomatic calls between the U.S. and Pakistan in recent days has fuelled speculation the Pentagon is scouting for new bases to use against the Taliban. “We urge neighbouring countries not to allow anyone to do so,” the Taliban said in a statement. “If such a step is taken again, it will be a great and historic mistake and disgrace.” It would “not remain silent in the face of such heinous and provocative acts”, the statement added.

Mr. Blinken landed in Cairo a day after holding talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. In Egypt, he met President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and other top officials. Meeting with American diplomatic staff afterwards, he described Egypt as a “real and effective partner” that helped end the Gaza war and is helping “build something positive.” Mr. Blinken has vowed to “rally international support” to rebuild Gaza while promising to make sure that none of the aid reaches Hamas.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The long shadow of political turmoil in Nepal||Politics in Nepal entered another phase of uncertainty last week. The country’s President, Bidya Devi Bhandari, dissolved the House of Representatives (lower house) late night on Friday, at the suggestion of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli (picture ), in a partisan move that disregarded the Constitution. Fresh elections were announced for between November 12 and 18. Announcing elections was just to ensure that Mr. Oli continues in office and controlling the state machinery, even as Nepal battles a second and deadlier COVID-19 wave. Oli’s opportunistic politics Mr. Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, the first undertaken in the federal republic of Nepal, established under the 2015 Constitution. He led his party, the CPN(UML), to an impressive tally of 121 seats and together with the Maoist Centre’s 53 seats, enjoyed a near absolute majority in the 275-strong House. In May 2018, the two allies merged to cement their alliance and created the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Relations with India saw positive movement. New Delhi was willing to overcome its reservations about Mr. Oli’s anti-Indian nationalist tirades. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Nepal in May 2018, shortly after Mr. Oli’s visit. However, Mr. Oli’s autocratic tendencies soon began to surface. The power sharing arrangement worked out with former Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ started fraying. The original idea that both would take turns at being Prime Minister and run the NCP as co-chairs became irksome for Mr. Oli. While he weaned away the Maoist cabinet members, senior disgruntled UML leaders led by former Prime Ministers, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal, gravitated towards Prachanda. Differences emerged in the open and a growing demand surfaced for honouring the ‘one person one post’ policy. Prachanda was willing to let Mr. Oli continue the full term as Prime Minister, provided he gave up his role as co-chair of the party. Mr. Oli decided otherwise. Mr. Oli needed a distraction and by end 2019, found one in the Kalapani boundary issue. India issued new maps following the division of the State of Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. While 98% of the India-Nepal boundary was demarcated, two areas, Susta and Kalapani, had remained pending. Though the new Indian map did not affect the India-Nepal boundary in any material way, it was an opportunity for Mr. Oli to don his nationalist mantle. He expanded the Kalapani area dispute from one covering approximately 60 square kilometres on Nepal’s northwest tip with Uttarakhand and China by raising the demand for restoring an additional 335 sq. km. The boundaries were fixed in 1816 by the British, and India inherited the areas over which the British had exercised territorial control in 1947. Domestic politics takes over Caught up in the first COVID-19 wave, India kept deferring bilateral talks, perhaps not realising the domestic political pressures on Mr. Oli. In May 2020 when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 75 km road through Kalapani that linked to the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage route, Mr. Oli upped the ante by whipping up nationalist sentiment, getting a new map of Nepal endorsed by the House and adopting a constitutional amendment to sanctify Nepal’s new territory. While this did not alter the situation on the ground, it cramped the prospects of any dialogue with India. It was a short reprieve and Mr. Oli’s political troubles soon returned to haunt him. President Bhandari has been Mr. Oli’s close comrade since she entered active politics after the untimely demise of her husband Madan Bhandari, a charismatic UML leader, in a car accident in 1993. Mr. Oli was her political mentor and backed her elevation as President. She reciprocated by ignoring constitutional propriety and approving dubious ordinances including amending the Constitutional Council Act that enabled Mr. Oli to pack constitutional positions with his loyalists. Amid rumours that Prachanda and Mr. Nepal were planning to move a no-confidence-motion against him after he had studiously ignored the meetings and decisions of party’s Secretariat and the Standing Committee, Mr. Oli got President Bhandari to approve dissolution of the House on December 20, paving the way for elections in April-May. The President’s decision was uniformly criticised as unconstitutional as the NCP enjoyed a near-absolute majority. India decided to steer clear of the mess, calling it an ‘internal matter’ while the Chinese Ambassador continued to actively push for a rapprochement between the NCP factions. A five-judge constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously called for a restoration of the House on February 23 strengthening the Prachanda-Nepal faction but on March 7, delivered a bombshell by overturning the UML-Maoist merger of May 2018, against which an appeal had been pending for two years. Mr. Oli took over the reins of the old CPN(UML), reviving prior structures but now excluding Mr. Nepal and his supporters. Some were served suspension notices. The Nepal faction was reduced to a minority; under the law, a split in the party requires a 40% of both the parliamentary party and the central committee. Prachanda, heading the Maoist Centre with 49 members since four had joined hands with Mr. Oli, needed new allies to wage his battles. Though Mr. Oli had lost majority in the House as Maoist Centre was no longer supporting him, he challenged the Opposition to file a no-confidence-motion, certain that the Maoists, Nepali Congress (NC) and the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) would fail to reach an agreement on a new Prime Minister. He was proven right but overtaken by hubris, he took another gamble. He called for a trust vote on May 10 that he lost as 28 UML dissident members were absent and half the JSP voted against him while the other half abstained. Presidential improprieties The Opposition again failed to present an alternative. In a questionable decision, Mr. Oli was sworn in by President Bhandari on May 14 as Prime Minister under Article 76(3) that permits the leader of the largest party to be sworn in and given 30 days to demonstrate majority. Within a week, Mr. Oli announced that he would not seek another vote of confidence. Without resigning, however, he advised the President to explore other options. Within a day, as rumours gained ground that NC leader Sher Bahadur Deuba had managed to gather support from 149 members, including 49 Maoists, 26 UML dissidents and 12 from the JSP, Mr. Oli rushed to the President and gave her a list of 153 supporters that included all 121 UML and 32 JSP members, including UML dissidents and JSP members who voted against him on May 10. Without bothering to verify, President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections, justifying that the rival claims exceeded the strength of the House. Since 2008 when a new Constituent Assembly was elected to prepare a constitution for a federal republic, Nepal has seen three NC Prime Ministers (G.P. Koirala, Sushil Koirala and Deuba), two Maoist Prime Ministers (Prachanda twice and Baburam Bhattarai), three UML Prime Ministers (Nepal, Khanal and Oli sworn in thrice) and a Chief Justice as caretaker Prime Minister in 2013. None has damaged the Constitution and the political fabric of Nepal as much as Mr. Oli, together with an obliging Ms. Bhandari. Opposition leaders have challenged the House dissolution in the Supreme Court but its outcome is uncertain. Meanwhile a raging COVID-19 puts a question mark on the election. In case an election is held, Mr. Oli will campaign on a nationalist anti-Indian platform. It is clear that political uncertainty will continue. India has traditionally supported constitutionalism and multi-party democracy in Nepal. At this juncture, it needs to remain actively engaged with all the political actors, and equally importantly, avoid being perceived as partisan.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The end of the road for India’s GST?||The 43rd meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is to be held on May 28. Representatives of 31 States and Union Territories are expected to attend. They belong to 16 different political parties. Of the 31 representatives, 17 members are from the ruling BJP or its alliance partners. Ideally, this nugget about political affiliations should not matter in a Council set up to decide indirect taxes. But in today’s India, ‘the economic is political’, to paraphrase the American saying. States are dependent on GST collections for nearly half of their tax revenues. The GST Council was mandated to meet at least once every quarter, but it had not met for two quarters, ostensibly due to the pandemic. Several of the 14 members of the non-BJP group implored the Finance Minister to convene the GST meeting to help them manage their finances but none of the 17 members of the ruling group deemed it necessary. Even the need for a meeting to determine tax revenues for States is evidently a political decision. Spirit of cooperative federalism The representative from West Bengal will attend the meeting against the backdrop of the Centre using investigative agencies to selectively target and incarcerate some of the State’s ministers, soon after their election victory. The Kerala representative will attend the meeting in the knowledge that his predecessor complained bitterly about the Centre reneging on its promise to pay guaranteed GST compensation to the States. The Chhattisgarh representative will attend this meeting aware of how the Centre imposed sudden and stringent policy conditions to grant approval to States for extra borrowing in the middle of the pandemic last year. The Maharashtra minister will attend the meeting with a feeling of betrayal over how the States have been forced to pay a much higher price for COVID-19 vaccines than the Centre. The Punjab Finance Minister will be cognisant of how the Centre legislated new farm laws unilaterally that affected Punjab’s farmers deeply. The Rajasthan representative will be aware of how a sudden lockdown imposed by the Centre with no consultations with the States threw millions of Rajasthani migrant workers in disarray. The Tamil Nadu representative will be wary of the Centre’s duplicity in levying cesses that garner significant revenues for the Centre without sharing them with the States. The Delhi representative will be suspicious of the Centre’s motives after it stealthily passed legislation to strip the elected Delhi government of its governance powers. The list is endless. These are not acts in the spirit of ‘cooperative federalism’. The catchy phrase ‘cooperative federalism’ was introduced into India’s political lexicon to justify the transition to GST in 2017. Sadly, like other catchy phrases such as ‘Minimum government, maximum governance’ and ‘Make in India’, this too has turned out to be hollow. Cooperative federalism has a larger meaning beyond just fiscal federalism. It also entails cooperative political, administrative and governance federalism between the States and the Centre. The Trust Game The GST Council is not an inanimate economic body. It is a compact of trust between the States and the Centre, set in the larger context of India’s polity. Behavioural economists, such as the Nobel Laureate, Daniel Kahneman, have articulated the critical role of the twin attributes of ‘trust’ and ‘trustworthiness’ among heterogeneous participants in an economy. Using a tool called ‘The Trust Game’, they have demonstrated that the motive of ‘altruism’ leads to the most optimal economic outcome for everyone in the group while a motive of ‘spite’ leads to the worst outcome for all. The tragedy of the GST Council is that it is afflicted with spite and forced to function under the prevailing cloud of vendetta politics. The 17 members of the ruling dispensation and the 14 members of the non-BJP dispensation in the GST Council represent exactly one half of India’s population each. However, the non-BJP group contributes a higher share of 60% of overall GST revenues and accounts for 63% of the country’s GDP. With elections to another seven States due next year, these numbers could change dramatically again. If the functioning of the GST Council is subject to the vagaries of elections and consequent vendetta politics, GST will continue to be just a caricature of its initial promise. The 15th Finance Commission report formally acknowledges that GST has been an economic failure that did not deliver on its early promises. GST, as postulated by technocrats, was supposed to be the panacea for India’s throttled economy to deliver enormous economic efficiency gains, improve tax buoyancy and collections, boost GDP growth and usher in greater formalisation of the economy. Three years after its launch and even before COVID-19, GST had failed on all those promises. Problems underpinning GST   Economists and commentators point to the multiple rates structure, high tax slabs and the complexity of tax filings as the problems underpinning India’s GST. These were indeed the initial problems in the way GST was implemented, leading to some of its current woes. But now, GST has a more fundamental problem — the erosion of ‘trust’ and ‘trustworthiness’ between the States and the Centre. Technical fixes such as simplification of GST rates and tax filing systems to restore GST to its initial promise is akin to applying a pain balm to an injury that needs surgery. The States paid a huge price for GST in terms of loss of fiscal autonomy. The promised economic gains are invisible, and India’s federalism has been ruptured. GST in today’s politically acerbic, hate-ridden and divided India is an unviable and unworkable proposition. GST has endured so far primarily because the States were guaranteed a 14% growth in their tax revenues every year, which minimised their risks of this new experiment and compensated for their loss of fiscal sovereignty. This revenue guarantee ends in July 2022. This can lead to a crumbling of the precarious edifice on which GST stands today. In a situation where the States have no taxation powers, their GST revenues are uncertain, the supposed economic benefits seem phantom, and the hypocrisy of ‘cooperative federalism’ looms large, what is the incentive for States to continue in a GST regime? When the Prime Minister can impose a draconian lockdown in a ham-fisted manner without consultation or play favourites with critical oxygen supplies during an emergency, there seems very little motivation for the States to cooperate in a chase for an elusive economic goal by sacrificing their significant economic powers of taxation. Technocratic cheerleaders of GST failed to factor in India’s unique political economy and its ramifications. Striking a balance among diverse interests of India’s numerous parties in a larger political climate of spite and suspicion to arrive at a uniform tax policy for the nation is a near impossibility. Tamil Nadu’s new Finance Minister P.T.R. Thiagarajan and I had warned of these exact issues in an article in 2017 in this newspaper. The tapestry of India’s GST was stitched on a fabric of implicit trust and painted with vibrant economic colours. The fabric is now torn and the colours have faded. The loose thread of guaranteed revenues that holds this together is about to snap. The end of India’s grand GST experiment seems inevitable unless there is a radical shift in the tone and tenor of India’s federal politics, backed by an extension of revenue guarantee for the States for another five years.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The varying power of Hindutva beyond the heartland||The second victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam must be juxtaposed with its failure to win power in West Bengal in the recent Assembly elections to understand the varying potency of Hindutva in States beyond its heartland in the north and the west of India. In Assam, the BJP managed to subsume all identity politics, including Bodo and other tribal variants, and Assamese nationalism, under a Hindutva umbrella; in West Bengal, a surge of Bengali nationalism countered Hindutva paratroopers, cornering them as invading aliens. Opportunistic engagement Hindutva’s engagement with regional politics has been opportunistic, historically. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s politics in Gujarat had a strong dose of provincialism, situated adversarial to what he used to call ‘Delhi Sultanate’. The administrative state at the Centre was portrayed as alien to the nation by Hindutva then; now, its control taken over by Hindutva, the same apparatus is venerated as the sole custodian of the national interest. The Hindu right has allied with all kinds of regional forces to weaken the Congress. This, despite the former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief M.S. Golwalkar’s vision of “one country, one legislature, one executive Centre running the administration throughout the country — an expression of one homogeneous solid nation in Bharat”. State autonomists had it good during the National Democratic Alliance regime led by A.B. Vajpayee — the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Telugu Desam Party, the National Conference, and Trinamool Congress (TMC) sat well with it at various points. A committee appointed by the Vajpayee government to review the working of the Constitution said strong States and a strong Centre could coexist. The Vajpayee government added more languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution; and oversaw the birth of the Bodoland Territorial Council in Assam. Assembly election outcomes In 2014, many observers wondered whether the Hindutva model in Gujarat could be replicated where caste, class and subnational politics were influential. Unlike many other parts of the country, in Gujarat, only one out of 10 people were Muslims; and caste and tribal grievances were overrun by a sedative mix of religious and provincial resentment and supremacism. As it turned out, the BJP under Mr. Modi swept the Hindi belt in 2014 and 2019. The party got more than 230 Lok Sabha seats from the northern and western States, against the halfway mark of 272. This is excluding the seats won by Shiv Sena, then a BJP ally. Hindutva’s success in articulating the bonding and grievances of the collective in terms of religion rather than caste, language, tribe, class or gender appears successful in the Hindi belt. The absence of linguistic sub-nationalism has been an enabling factor. But Hindutva faces a more rigorous test elsewhere as the recent Assembly election outcomes among Assamese, Bengali, Tamil and Malayalam speakers who make up a third of India’s population suggest. It is not that these areas are impenetrable. In 2016, the BJP won Assam; and in 2018, Tripura. In 2019, the BJP crossed the 40% vote share in West Bengal. In 2021, it has become the principal Opposition in Bengal. Turning point When the BJP began to use its parliamentary majority won largely from the heartland States, to undermine State autonomy elsewhere, provincial elites sensed danger. The dismemberment of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 caught many regional parties by surprise though many of them supported the move in Parliament. The TMC and DMK opposed. Within months, however, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra parted ways with the BJP. Provincialism could break the bonding of Hindutva. The Shiv Sena and the BJP had a long ideological partnership. Those who visualise Indian politics as a duel of secularism against Hindutva may not grasp this dynamic of Maharashtra’s ruling coalition, which is held together by two platforms of regional assertion, the Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party. In West Bengal, the anti-incumbency against the two-term TMC government was unmistakable, this year. But, a considerable segment of those voters who said the TMC was corrupt and inefficient voted for it nevertheless because they loathed the BJP. As the BJP raised the pitch, more Bengalis turned against it, and late deciding voters largely turned in favour of the TMC. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the BJP was a factor, despite not being a contender for power. In Kerala, the United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front competed to convince the electorate on who fights the BJP better. Among other factors, the winning LDF scored better on this count. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, which supported the BJP’s Kashmir policy, allied with it and paid a price for doing so. The cultural elites of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal resist Hindutva, though Assam might be a different story. In its present form, Hindutva is incapable of negotiating with the claims of exceptionalism of these States. Friendly gestures of BJP leaders such as speaking in their languages and references to their myths and folklore, have often been counterproductive. In West Bengal, elite mobilisation against the BJP contributed to its defeat. In Assam and Bengal, the Muslims consolidated against the BJP. The determinant factor was Hindu consolidation in Assam, which did not happen in Bengal. Slide of the Congress The BJP’s growth in non-Hindi areas is happening at the cost of the Congress, Odisha and Telangana being examples. In West Bengal, it has replaced the Congress and the Left. Pan-Indian politics of other types are being replaced by Hindutva, while provincial politics remain strong. In fact, while the slide of the Congress continues, regional leaders who seceded from the mothership are thriving — Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh, and now Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. Even K. Chandrashekhar Rao in Telangana can be counted as an ex-Congressman. Here again, Assam is an outlier — Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma decamped from the Congress to join the BJP rather than trying to build any regional politics. Provincialism within the Congress cannot have the same potency as autonomous outfits. In Assam, the Congress tried to appropriate Assamese sentiments but failed. In Karnataka, former Congress Chief Minister Siddaramaiah sought to add Kannada pride as a component of the party’s politics. Tolerance of sub-nationalisms within an overarching Indian nationalism has been the familiar strategy of Congress politics for long. The BJP has appropriated that framework, with additional Hindutva characteristics. What makes Hindutva more effective is its conception of a pan-India enemy alongside a pan-India unifier, both defined in terms of religion. If the West Bengal results, alongside the experiment of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, is proof that provincialism is a bulwark against Hindutva, the Assam result is proof that there is nothing inevitable about it. The BJP customised itself for Assam, carried out local recruitment and built a politics that has endured for two Lok Sabha and two Assembly elections. The BJP’s capacity to adapt to regional particularities, however, remains limited.  varghese.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-varying-power-of-hindutva-beyond-the-heartland/article34653601.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Losing the way with a map||The official boasting about India being a cultural powerhouse rapidly disintegrates when you examine facts. An online resource for arts and culture, Sahapedia, recently ran the budget numbers for the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and the figures are appalling. While allocations for culture have been marginal at best over the last decade, they have declined in the last five years, now standing at a mere 0.07% of the Budget. For 2021-22, the budget for the MoC is just Rs. 2,688 crore, with another Rs. 4 crore accruing from indirect allocations to other ministries. If one were to make a vulgar comparison, one Rafale jet costs Rs. 1,670 crore. So, the annual budget of the MoC — which runs three Akademis, 70-odd museums, three national galleries, several national libraries and archives, cultural institutions of the size of the National School of Drama and Kalakshetra, zonal cultural centres, and more — equals 1.5 Rafales. When the pandemic struck last year, instead of helping beleaguered artists and artisans, the government slashed culture funding by a further 21%. Contrast this to countries like China, Singapore, Australia and the U.K., which increased allocations, besides announcing billion-dollar relief packages. Additionally, the government’s cultural institutions are plagued by vacancies (ranging from 30% to 70%) and lack of trained manpower. This means fund usage has invariably been random and ill-planned. What mapping can do This chaos was attributed, correctly, to the absence of a comprehensive cultural map that would chart geographies, artists, resources and institutions, find the gaps, and ensure optimal fund utilisation. Thus was born, in 2015, the National Mission on Cultural Mapping. But the Mission, created with an outlay of Rs. 3,000 crore, was not officially approved until 2017. In 2018-19 and 2019-20, only Rs. 42.78 crore was allocated, of which Rs. 1.17 crore has been utilised. The exercise was supposed to begin by identifying artists at the block level, but this was abandoned as there was no IT infrastructure, ironic when the government has an app for everything. What can mapping do? At the least, it can create a database that anybody can plug into, thus becoming a resource for the media, researchers and funders. At its best, it can do so much more. It can, for instance, locate a derelict cinema and renovate it as an auditorium in a town where there are none, or create transport and tourism infrastructure around a declining crafts village. When the European Capitals of Culture programme picked Glasgow, the city was rife with crime and poverty. The programme built and renovated its cultural facilities, created a garden festival, and constructed a museum. Today, Glasgow has among the highest per capita culture budgets in Britain. The mission document The possibilities are endless. But what do we find when we study this project’s mission document? After a lot of platitudinous rambling, it finally states that it will identify, collect and record cultural assets and resources. It correlates this to planning and strategising. It mentions a portal and a database listing organisations, spaces, facilities, festivals and events. It also states that this database can be used to preserve culture and provide or ameliorate livelihoods. But beyond this, it descends into la-la land. From a childish SWOT analysis to expecting arts to curb anti-social elements to roping artists into the Swachh Bharat and Namami Gange schemes, the plan loses its way inside a jungle of homilies and acronyms. There’s a Hamari Sanskriti Hamari Pahchan Abhiyan for “cultural awareness”, which suggests an ideological slant. There is a project with an indecipherable title — ‘Design for Desire and Dream’. There is hollow jargon such as “Create holistic thinking in artists to make them job creators rather than job seekers”. From pontification, it hops on to talent hunts, to digital literacy, to training online teachers. Why should a mapping exercise organise competitions or train teachers? Its job is merely to record and collate. This might still be meaningless twaddle, but it becomes harmful when it proceeds to talk of using art to “preserve family values”; of quizzes and contests to “revive tribal traditions”; of a “grading process” for artists in which apparatchiks decide which artist is “good” or “not so good”. And, as always, this government displays its obsession with surveillance and control, proposing yet another Unique Identification Code for every artist/ institution, ostensibly to facilitate schemes. Where does hand-holding stop and meddling begin? That’s the question the MoC must answer. A cultural map could be a vital tool in the bedlam that reigns the space, and the idea cannot be abandoned because many bureaucrats and ministers don’t understand its meaning or scope. Even this blueprint can help unravel the MoC’s budgetary challenges, provided its irrelevancies, absurdities and overreach are removed, and the focus kept on a deeper survey and understanding of the diversity of the cultural base, without caste, communal and regional hierarchies. To be a cultural leader, official India must look at its own face in a clearer mirror. vaishna.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/losing-the-way-with-a-map/article34653609.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Tackling rural economic distress||Several States are under lockdown again. This will have severe implications for the livelihoods of those in the informal sector. There is adequate evidence that migrant workers and the rural poor have been facing great distress over the past one year and the crisis for food and work is only going to intensify further. Hunger and distress A few months ago, the Right to Food campaign and the Centre for Equity Studies published a ‘Hunger Watch’ report which compared the pre-lockdown situation last year to the situation in October 2020 to assess the impact of the nationwide lockdown. The survey involving 4,000 respondents across 11 States exposed the life and livelihood uncertainties of people belonging to low-income categories in the informal sector. In October 2020, 27% of the respondents said that they had no income; 40% respondents said that the nutritional quality of food had become “much worse”; and 46% of the respondents said they had to skip one meal at least once in the day in October 2020. The migrants have again become vulnerable due to the lockdown in different cities. While many have once again headed to their villages, a large population has got stranded in different parts of the country without work. The Stranded Workers Action Network, a group of individuals helping distressed migrant workers since last year, has been reaching out to workers for providing essential help. According to them, 81% of the people whom they reached out to said that work had mostly stopped since April 15, 2021 and 76% of the workers said they are short of food and cash and require immediate support. In this context, there is an urgent need to strengthen the public distribution system (PDS) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The government announced 5 kg free foodgrains for individuals enlisted under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), for May and June 2021. The government should expand PDS coverage immediately and include all eligible households under the schemes. According to an independent study, about 100 million people are excluded from the ration distribution system owing to a dated database based on the 2011 Census. The Centre should also extend the free foodgrains programme to a year instead of limiting it to two months. The economic crisis is likely to last for a long time. It is being reported that India procured record amounts of rice and wheat last year through mandis. The total procurement is way more than the current requirement for PDS. It is thus quite possible to expand the safety net of the NFSA. Inadequate provisions The Centre had allocated Rs. 73,000 crore for 2021-22 for MGNREGS and notified an annual increment of about 4% in wages. Both these provisions are inadequate to match the requirements on the ground. The central allocation for MGNREGS is about Rs. 38,500 crore less than last year’s revised estimate. Of the 7.56 crore households which worked in MGNREGS in 2020-21, even if 1 crore households opt out of the scheme this year, the Centre should still budget for 75-80 days of employment in the year for 6.5 crore families given the current scale of economic distress. By this rationale, at the current rate of Rs. 268/day/person, at least Rs. 1.3 lakh crore will have to be budgeted. The government should also re-consider its decision of a mere 4% increase in MGNREGS wages and hike it by at least 10%. This will mean another Rs. 10,000 crore. Therefore, at least Rs. 1.4 lakh crore will be required to ensure uninterrupted implementation during the year. A large population is facing hunger and a cash crunch. The situation is only becoming more dire as the pandemic continues to rage on. Therefore, the Union government should prioritise food and work for all and start making policy reforms right away.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Naturally, selection||When supply is finite, it is a no-brainer that a burgeoning demand will not be met. Tailoring supply for optimal effect would then be the prudent way ahead, a strategy that the Centre would do well to employ in its COVID-19 vaccination programme. Though the ideal, distant at this stage, is to achieve vaccination of the entire population or enough to create herd immunity, supply considerations will necessarily mean prioritisation of groups for vaccination. While the vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing death or severe disease by and large, the vaccine’s effect on interrupting or reducing transmission is also an important consideration in deployment. Studies have shown an inverse correlation between vaccinations and infections; a study in Tamil Nadu showed that the percentage of people over 60 years infected in the second wave had come down by 7%, even as the numbers in other age groups rose. This age segment was among the early priority groups for vaccination. With the government opening up vaccinations for all adults, it is imperative that some line list of priority be readied, on the basis of vulnerability and societal role. Primary among them are people in the services sector — those whose jobs mandate interactions with multiple people. This would include those in banks, delivery agents, transportation staff, store workers, vendors, lawyers and journalists. As States begin free vaccinations for the 18-plus age group, it will be prudent to draw up a priority list even in the 18-44 age category, as Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have done, for instance. While Kerala seeks to prioritise those with co-morbidities, disabilities and 43 categories of field staff of various departments, Karnataka has included 18 categories of people in its priority list for the 18-plus age group — including bank workers, forest department staff and construction workers. Tamil Nadu has determined a broad list of categories including the disabled, vendors, e-commerce staff, pharmacy and grocery store staff, those in the transportation sector, and school and college teachers, besides mediapersons. The Centre, which has assumed a sutradhar’s role in this entire pandemic, must draw up a list of priority categories that each State can then adapt to its local requirements. While lockdowns, in force in most States, will slow down the pace of transmission and give health-care resources a much-needed break, the way ahead is certainly vaccination — and prioritised vaccination. Once vaccine supply picks up, a more expansive first-come, first-served basis, as in the private sector now, can be adopted. Until then, it is the government’s bounden duty to ensure an equitable coverage among vulnerable groups of people who are most at risk, and carry a higher risk of transmission, because of the sheer number of people they interact with daily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/naturally-selection/article34653591.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Imperious missteps||Lakshadweep, an archipelago of 36 islands totalling 32 square kilometres in the Arabian Sea, has had an idyllic existence as a Union Territory. But no longer, it seems, as the long arm of Delhi is rummaging around the islands these days. Praful K. Patel, a BJP politician from Gujarat, who arrived as Administrator in December, appears determined to upend the landscape and recast the lives of the islanders, around 70,000 of them, all according to his authoritarian imagination. The draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation 2021 gives sweeping powers to the Administrator to take over land and forcibly relocate people, and proposes harsh punishment to those who resist. In other measures, proposed or implemented, the consumption or sale of beef, a part of the food habits of many, could be an offence punishable by seven years in prison; those who have more than two children cannot contest panchayat elections. Anyone could be held in prison without reason up to a year, under a new Goonda Act, in a place that has a very low crime rate. The traditional livelihood of fishing communities has been impeded by mindless regulations that deny them access to coastlines. Their sheds on the coastal areas have been demolished, saying they violated the Coast Guard Act. Dairy farms run by the administration have been shut. Development, as it is coming, is not a promise, but a serious threat to the people of Lakshadweep and the fragile ecosystem. Mr. Patel is no stranger to controversies. In March, the Mumbai police named him as an accused in a case related to the death by suicide of seven-time Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar. Mr. Patel was named in the suicide note. He is the first politician to become the Administrator. In the last five months, he has demonstrated a unique disregard for the people’s concerns and priorities. In the absence of any administrative rationale or public good in these blatantly arbitrary measures, there are fears of other motivations. Commercial interests could be at play, and the land that inhabitants are forced to part with could be transferred to buyers from outside. There could also be ill-advised political plans to change the demography of the islands. People have risen in protest, but far from listening to them, the Administrator seems insistent on his plans. Rajya Sabha Members from Kerala, K.C. Venugopal of the Congress and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) have in separate letters urged the President to recall the Administrator. The rationale for carving out Union Territories as an administrative unit is to protect the unique cultural and historical situations of their inhabitants. The Centre is inverting its responsibility to protect into a licence to interfere. It must recall the Administrator and reassure the islanders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/imperious-missteps/article34653592.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||English terms: Compromise formula||The compromise formula of using both the English and Hindi expressions for designations of Central Ministers has been put into effect although the leader of the D.M.K. Party in Parliament, Mr. K. Manoharan, continued to maintain that his party has not agreed to this. The Lok Sabha Secretariat has amended its earlier order through a “corrigendum” under which the English expression will be used for the Minister’s designations with their Hindi equivalents in Roman script within brackets. The D.M.K. leaders had expressed their reservations on this at the Opposition leaders’ conference yesterday but a fresh effort was made to-day [New Delhi, May 26] to make them agree to it. The Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. Om Mehta, called on the D.M.K. leader, Mr. K. Manoharan at the latter’s residence this morning for this purpose. He took with him the C.P.I. leader, Mr. Indrajit Gupta, who had made the proposal for simultaneous use of both the English and Hindi expressions at the Opposition leaders’ conference. M. Manoharan, however, expressed his inability to accept the compromise formula without consulting the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. He sent a letter to Mr. Karunanidhi through Mr. G. Viswanathan, M.P., who left for Madras this morning seeking his advice on the stand the party should take. The compromise formula, it is stated, also envisages the use of English version in Devanagiri script within brackets along with the Hindi version in the Hindi records of proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/english-terms-compromise-formula/article34653602.ece

Amazon is paying $8.45 billion for MGM, making it the company’s second-largest acquisition after it bought grocer Whole Foods for almost $14 billion in 2017. The deal is the latest in the media industry that’s aimed at boosting streaming services to compete against Netflix and Disney+. AT&T and Discovery announced on May 17 that they would combine media companies, creating a powerhouse that includes HGTV, CNN and HBO. Prime membership Amazon doesn’t say how many people watch its Prime Video service. But more than 200 million have access to it because they’re signed up for its Prime membership, which gives them faster shipping and other perks. Besides Prime Video, Amazon also has a free streaming service called IMDb TV, where Amazon makes money by playing ads during movies and shows. Buying MGM would give Amazon access to more films, shows and famous characters, including Rocky and Pink Panther. Amazon will also get a cable channel: Epix, which MGM owns. Known for its roaring lion logo, MGM is one of the oldest Hollywood studios, founded in 1924 when films were silent. It has a long list of classics in its library, including ‘Singin’ in the Rain.’ More recent productions include reality TV staples ‘Shark Tank’ and ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,’ as well as the upcoming James Bond movie ‘No Time to Die.’ Amazon already has its own studio but has had mixed results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/amazon-to-gain-bond-films-via-845-bn-deal-to-acquire-mgm/article34653590.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘July-Sept. period will be key’||After recommending stringent curbs on economic activity to contain the ‘suffering’ from the pandemic, CII president Uday Kotak earlier this month urged companies to take ‘voluntary measures’ to break the COVID transmission chain by minimising all in-person work. Mr. Kotak, who completes his term at CII’s helm on May 31, said the coming months would require careful calibration to revive the economy. Excerpts:  You have earlier stressed that saving lives was far more important. What do you see as the way forward? We are really caught in a cleft. On the one hand, if you look at all the analysts... most of them are saying that with a reasonable lockdown kind of situation, the total positive COVID cases should come down to about 50,000 per day, by end of June. We are then in a situation where we have the ability to have selective opening up in different parts of the country. But the fact is our internal borders are open. And people can freely move around in any part of the country. And the levels of vaccination are still relatively lower as a percentage of the population. So we are in a catch-22 situation, in which I think each State will have to calibrate carefully in terms of what it needs to do. My view is both States and individuals will be more cautious this time around in opening up than we have been in the last year. At the same time, I do believe that our vaccination progress, we should catch up by somewhere around the end of September. Therefore the real hiatus for us to manage is this period of three months... July, August, September. And those are the calls we need to take carefully for two reasons. If we do the calibration well, we will have a much lower risk of 3.0 [third wave]. Two, we would have vaccinated a lot more people. And we will also have some clarity, how effective the vaccines are at the various levels.  What can the CII do to get a uniform vaccine policy? Frankly, if there is a way by which government can create a joint task force representing both public and private sector, in terms of taking the vaccination strategy forward, I think CII will recommend that strongly. What can be done to support the economy? Expand the fisc; support the weaker segments of society or stressed sectors. And for the pressure it brings on to the government bond market and higher borrowing... expand the balance sheet of the RBI. The other aspect is the financial sector. The ECLGS scheme... they should expand it or think about expanding it. They can look at Rs. 5 lakh crore and let the government give the guarantees to the banks, which can give additional funding to particularly the cyclical category of borrowers who then have a chance of survival. Then you come to the part where the banks feel that they [borrowers] may have a better chance if they gave a little breathing time, which means restructuring. My view is that there is nothing in the RBI guidelines which stops a bank from restructuring a loan, even if it is declared an NPA. The transaction between the borrower and the banker can be in terms of what's right for making it easier for the borrower to sustain itself for paying back the bank. At a time like this, we have to protect India's reputation in the financial sector. And our credibility. We should not have a situation where banks merely extend and protect, but focus more on doing what is right, take the pain on their balance sheet. We must ensure that the shocks are either taken by the state or by the capital cushions in financial institutions. And I feel capital is the oxygen of the banking sector. And we must have enough oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/july-sept-period-will-be-key/article34653583.ece
27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST levy on COVID-19 relief imports challenged||An NCR-based firm that imported oxygen cylinders and regulators and donated them to the Delhi government has challenged the Centre’s exclusion of such imports from the ‘ad hoc’ GST exemption for COVID-19 relief material received from abroad. The Delhi High Court is expected to hear the writ petition against the Finance Ministry, the GST Council and the Delhi government’s Finance Department on Thursday. Oxygen regulators attract an IGST of 5%, while cylinders and the rakes for carrying the regulators for them are liable to 18% IGST. Last week, a bench of the HC had held that the 12% Integrated GST (IGST) levied on oxygen concentrators imported for personal use is ‘unconstitutional’. The Finance Ministry had told the Court that the issue would be placed before the GST Council that meets on Friday. On May 3, the Ministry had exempted imported COVID relief material from IGST levies, provided it was received free and donated to State-approved entities for free distribution. “Several Indian corporates and other entities pitching to help with pandemic relief by importing critical supplies not available locally, at their own cost, are not eligible for this GST relief,” Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at Khaitan & Co. said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gst-levy-on-covid-19-relief-imports-challenged/article34653579.ece

27 May 2021||Chennai,||‘Exempt micro enterprises from GST’||The Consortium of Indian Associations (CIA) has urged the Centre to increase the turnover threshold limit for micro enterprises to facilitate their exemption from the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The second wave has wiped out more than 40% of MSMEs involved in various sectors, said CIA convenor K.E. Raghunathan, adding that the need of the hour was to save micro enterprises from the hassle and help them to survive the present crisis by increasing the turnover threshold limit to Rs. 5 crore for FY22. Secondly, COVID-related materials such as hand sanitisers, masks, medicines, oxygen cylinders, medical treatments and PPE kits must be exempted from all forms of GST, both for input and output, till March 2022, Mr. Raghunathan said. “If the above two requests are not considered, it would amount to killing the goose that lays golden eggs in one stroke,” the CIA convenor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exempt-micro-enterprises-from-gst/article34653585.ece

However, with the Supreme Court allowing the recognition of NPAs, FY21-end numbers may be either similar to or slightly above December-end numbers, it said.

27 May 2021||Geneva,||UEFA reads the riot act to rebels||UEFA has opened disciplinary cases against Super League rebels Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus that could lead to bans from the Champions League. Proceedings are now active for “a potential violation of UEFA’s legal framework,” UEFA said on Tuesday. The European soccer body’s statutes include a section on “prohibited groupings” of clubs or leagues forming without UEFA’s permission or outside its control. The three clubs now being prosecuted by UEFA are the remaining holdouts among 12 founders of the failed Super League project who refused to renounce it. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin warned the clubs last month that “if they say we are a Super League, then they don’t play Champions League, of course.” No timetable UEFA gave no timetable for the expected disciplinary cases against the three which have all qualified on merit for the Champions League next season. Any bans for the clubs — and elevation of other Spanish and Italian teams to replace them — would likely lead to appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and pressure to resolve the cases before next season’s European competitions. The Champions League group-stage draw is on August 26 and matches start on September 14. The nine clubs who settled with UEFA are: AC Milan, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham, plus Champions League finalists Chelsea and Manchester City. Those clubs agreed to UEFA’s terms to forfeit 5% of their prize money from European competitions in the 2022-23 season and pay a combined €15 million as a “gesture of goodwill” to benefit children, youth and grassroots football. For a storied club, a successful season in the Champions League currently earns around €100 million in UEFA prize money. The agreement also saw the nine clubs consent to be fined €100 million if they seek again to play in an unauthorised competition or €50 million if they breach any other commitments to UEFA as part of the settlement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/uefa-reads-the-riot-act-to-rebels/article34653751.ece
27 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||We will work in tandem: Mithali||India women’s Test and ODI captain Mithali Raj says it is time to formulate a shared vision and build a team for the future. The 38-year-old Mithali, who is quarantining with the team in Mumbai before flying out to England next month, said that when you represent the country there is no room for personal likes or egos. “The past is gone by. You cannot go back. I am sure he (Ramesh Powar, head coach, who had issues with Mithali the last time he was the coach) will come up with plans and we together will steer the ship,” Mithali said in a chat with The Hindu . “We will work in tandem and build a very strong team for the future, especially with the World Cup scheduled next year.” Welcome feature Mithali said it was a welcome feature that the England itinerary had all three formats. She will lead the side in the Test and three ODIs before Harmanpreet Kaur takes charge for the three T20Is. “For all the youngsters in the team, and even for someone like me who played a Test match seven years ago, there is no baggage to carry. We have not played the format for such a long time and hence can play with an open mind,” said Mithali. “It is good to see that this Test will be followed by a pink-ball Test in Australia later this year. My personal opinion is that we should have continuity in playing Test matches. “I believe that all three formats can exist together in women’s cricket too and players need to enjoy all of them,” she added. Open mind “We are going with an open mind, will be positive and confident of living up to the expectations. A Test match always challenges a player in many ways and the girls too are really excited. “The conditions keep changing session by session in England and that itself is a big challenge. “We can’t say how good or well-equipped a young player is for these conditions unless she gets the exposure. But, this team has players with plenty of experience by way of ODIs and T20Is,” Mithali added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-will-work-in-tandem-mithali/article34653711.ece
27 May 2021||Chennai,||Vijay Shankar peeved at lack of clarity on his role||The last few days have been excruciating for Vijay Shankar. It has forced him to think the unthinkable — leaving the Tamil Nadu cricket team. Ask the 30-year-old Vijay Shankar, also the Tamil Nadu vice-captain, and the pace-bowling all-rounder is brutally honest about his state of mind. Can’t even analyse He told The Hindu on Wednesday, “I don’t know what my role in the Tamil Nadu team is. I have been batting at various slots. When I look back, I cannot even analyse where I have gone right or wrong.” Explicit in Vijay Shankar’s words is the absence of a clear role definition for him in the team. Vijay Shankar believes his game is best suited for the No. 4 slot but he hardly gets to bat at this position for Tamil Nadu. “I come in at No. 6 or No. 7 in the T20 games and I am not suited for that role.” He then said stingingly, “If your home State does not give you the slot you want, then how can you expect the others to give that to you.” As the Tamil Nadu vice-captain, he can put forward his views but the final decision is that of the captain and the coach. A well-organised batsman with footwork and timing — he has 2,242 First Class runs at a worthy 44.84 — Vijay Shankar is an improving seamer who has upped his speed without forsaking control. He pointed out, “It is not necessary for an all-rounder to come in at No 6 or 7, he can bat No. 4 and still do the job.” It goes without saying that Vijay Shankar has the mind-set of a batsman with innings-building attributes. No. 4 suits him in all formats. “When I was successful for India in the T20Is in New Zealand, I batted up the order,” he said. Still in his plans But then, Tamil Nadu still figures in his plans. “Right now my mind is blank. Yes, my thoughts are still with Tamil Nadu.” Vijay Shankar finds his career at a crossroads. Batting slot is the key.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vijay-shankar-peeved-at-lack-of-clarity-on-his-role/article34653798.ece
27 May 2021||CHENNAI,||It’s a dream to be in the CL final: Berrada||Manchester City is on the brink of unparalleled success. After clinching its third Premier League title in four seasons, City will look to lift its first Champions League crown when it takes on Chelsea in Saturday's final. Omar Berrada, the Chief Football Operations Officer of the City Football Group, calls it a dream. “It’s a dream to be in the Champions League final. It’s been a journey that started with the FA Cup win in 2011 and we have been able to clinch many domestic trophies since. The Champions League brings in the best clubs from the world and gives you that additional element of prestige if you win it,’’ Berrada told select media on Wednesday. “We have worked so hard to get here that I believe we will continue to be in the knockout stages in the years to come because the groundwork has been done to put us in that position. Winning the Champions League will give us prestige, but it’s the long-term effort that has been put in that will ensure we stay successful,” he added.  Berrada stressed on City's long-term vision, which has seen it evolve into a heavyweight and win five of the last 10 Premier League titles. “It's a result of a vision that the ownership had 12 years ago — to develop a strong academy, to develop a specific way of playing football and to bring the right manager for that type of football. We also needed to bring in the right players for that. “It has always been about finding the right squad balance between young players, players who are at their peak and players who can bring more experience. It's not been about investing in superstars, we like to find the right players and with time they become superstars because of the team's success. It’s about ensuring we find players who can adapt to our style of play, believe in our culture and buy into it. We love making investments in players at different age levels, see them blossom and reach their highest potential,“ said Berrada. About the Messi move He remained non-committal about the possibility of Lionel Messi, whose contract with Barcelona runs out soon, moving to City. “If you look at our performance this year, it's not like we need to make significant investments. We might look at signing a striker since (Sergio) Aguero leaves, but right now we are very focused on our squad. When the season ends on Saturday evening, we will look at what we want to do in the transfer window.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-a-dream-to-be-in-the-cl-final-berrada/article34653741.ece
27 May 2021||Paris,||Swiatek confident||Iga Swiatek heads into the French Open trying to become the first player since Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2016 to successfully defend a women’s Grand Slam singles title, with injuries and poor clay form clouding the hopes of several of her chief rivals. More expectation Following her victory in Rome, culminating in a ruthless 46-minute takedown of Karolina Pliskova, Poland’s first Grand Slam singles champion returns to Roland Garros just seven months on with a far greater weight of expectation. Swiatek, who turns 20 next week, was the lowest-ranked woman, then 54th in the world, to win the French Open, shifted from its traditional May-June slot last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like Jelena Ostapenko in 2017, it was her first title at tour level. Unlike the Latvian, who has struggled to reproduce her best tennis regularly, Swiatek appears better equipped to stay at the top. She entered the top 10 for the first time last week, and has cited the consistency of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer as a goal for which she can strive. Proud “I’m really proud of myself that I’m actually starting to be more consistent, because that was my goal from the beginning,” said Swiatek. “I feel right now that I am doing huge progress in that matter. But it was actually a bit frustrating after the French Open, because sometimes you can’t see the result of your work. “Obviously winning a Grand Slam is great, but after that comes rankings, and this year it was different. “I’m really proud that I’m gonna have in my resume that I’m top 10, because I always wanted that. I also want to be consistent. So right now our goal is to keep me in that place and go further.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/swiatek-serene-as-questions-linger-over-french-open-rivals/article34653742.ece
27 May 2021||DUBAI,||Panghal, Varinder and Vikas move into the semifinals||World championships silver medallist Amit Panghal, Varinder Singh, and Vikas Krishan advanced to the semifinals to increase India’s medal count in the Asian boxing championships here on Wednesday. Panghal recorded a hard-fought 3-2 win over Kharkhuu Enkhmandakh of Mongolia in a men’s 52kg quarterfinal match. Panghal bobbed and moved well even as Enkhmandakh landed some head shots. The Indian breached the Mongol’s defence and delivered some well-directed punches to eke out a narrow win and ensure his third successive Asian medal. In the last-four, top seed Panghal will take on Kazakh boxer Saken Bibossinov, whom he beat in the 2019 World championships semifinals. Convincing win Open-guarded southpaw Varinder (60kg) used his excellent footwork and fine combination of jabs and left shots to trounce Samuel Dela Cruz of Philippines 5-0 in a quarterfinal bout. Vikas (69kg) defied an eyebrow bruise to see off hard-punching Iranian Moslem Maghsoudi 4-1. The former Worlds medallist used his counterattacks well to stay ahead of the rough Iranian. Following Shiva Thapa, Sanjeet (91kg) and women boxers Sakshi Chaudhary (54kg), Jasmine (57kg) and Simranjit Kaur (60kg) beat their respective opponents to reach the semifinals on Tuesday night. Sanjeet got the better of Jasur Qurbonov of Tajikistan with a 5-0 verdict. World championships bronze medallist Simranjit defeated Uzbek boxer Raykhona Kodirova 4-1, while Sakshi beat Ruhafzo Haqazarova of Tajikistan 5-0.

27 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gukesh jolts Ganguly||Teenagers called the shots as Grandmaster D. Gukesh jolted Surya Shekhar Ganguly to join International Master R. Raja Rithvik in the lead with three straight victories on the opening day of the AICF World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. On a day when 18-year old GM P. Iniyan punished a winless B. Adhiban, none of the top four seeds played to their seedings. Gukesh, 14, warmed up with wins over Rahul Singhania and C.R.G. Krishna before checkmating Ganguly in a topsy-turvy battle. Rithvik, 17, started the day by nailing GM Vishnu Prasanna. Rithvik went on to beat Singhania and Krishna for a hat-trick of wins.  Adhiban struggled with his time-management in all three games. In the opening round against Aditya Mittal, 14, Adhiban drew by perpetual checks. The pressure from the clock saw him lose to Iniyan. In the third round, Adhiban was down to less than a minute against S.L. Narayanan’s over six minutes when the game ended following a three-fold repetition of moves. In Wednesday’s rounds, S. Nitin, Ganguly and Rahul Srivatshav received a bye, in that order.  Standings (after Day One): 1-2. D. Gukesh, R. Raja Rithvik (3 points); 3-5. P. Iniyan, Aditya Mittal, Saravana Krishna (2.5 each), 6-8. S.P. Sethuraman, S. L. Narayanan, Deep Sengupta (2 each); 9-12. B.Adhiban, Surya Shekhar Ganguly, Rahul Srivatshav, S. Nitin (1 each); 13.

27 May 2021||LONDON,||You will always have racism: Holding||It is impossible to completely wipe off racism from the world, feels fast bowling great Michael Holding, who would “bruise his knee” to the grave if he was still an active player but doesn’t want anyone to take the gesture as “a tick-in-the-box exercise”. Holding was speaking on Sky Sports’ The Cricket Show on the first death anniversary of African-American George Floyd, who died at the hands of a white police office in the Minnesota last year. “You will always have racism, always have racists. Getting rid of racism totally is like saying you are going to get rid of crime totally. It is impossible,” Holding said during a panel discussion that also had former England captain Nasser Hussain and woman international Ebony Rainford-Brent. “The less crime you have in your society, the less racism you have in your society, the better off the world is as we go ahead,” he added. Taking a knee Holding feels that the gesture of “taking a knee” should be organic rather a “tick the box” exercise but he doesn’t believe in telling people what their choices should be. “I am not going to tell people they must take a knee — I am not here to tell people what they need to do. “I don’t want people to take it as a tick-in-the-box exercise. “You must want to support the cause, you must be willing to understand and see that something is wrong and this is the worldwide accepted way of showing support for the cause,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/you-will-always-have-racism-holding/article34653704.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Nicholls wary of Indian spinners||India’s pace attack is on par with New Zealand’s world-class swing operators but the Black Caps batsman Henry Nicholls is more wary of the threat spinners R. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja may pose during the upcoming World Test Championship final. India and New Zealand will fight it out for the inaugural title at Southampton’s Ageas Bowl, one of those rare English tracks known to aid the slow bowlers for a considerable period in Test matches. “India have a very good seam attack and also have the experienced spinners like Ashwin and Jadeja. They have been consistent in all parts of the world (of late) and bring quality (to attack),” said Nicholls. If there are no injury concerns, the Indian pace trio that is expected to be in the playing XI for the clash starting June 18 would be Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami. “Shami, Bumrah and Ishant have proven their quality over the years which is similar to our seamers (Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Neil Wagner) on whom we really pride ourselves on. “So if you are facing that kind of a line-up, it’s an exciting challenge and as a group we are expecting it to be tough but also looking forward to the challenge,” the 29-year-old southpaw, who enjoys a 43-plus average over 37 Test matches, said. His teammate Devon Conway’s strategy of pouring dry kitty litter on the track in order to create rough was backed by Nicholls as they are playing at a “neutral venue” which is known to assist the spinners. “That was something that we experimented in the camp before we came over to UK. You managed to get some more turn and get some practice. So playing at a neutral venue, we need to check what the wickets will be like there. Also the guile of Ashwin and Ravi Jadeja is something that we need to be prepared for,” Nicholls said. Nicholls was a part of the New Zealand team that thrashed India inside three days in two home Tests in early 2020, something that will give it confidence going into the final. “We beat them 2-0 a season back (2019-20). But we know and accept that it’s a different challenge but as a group we take a lot of confidence from that series win against India. Obviously, No. 1 and 2 playing the final is a challenge too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nicholls-wary-of-indian-spinners/article34653707.ece

Sheuli created new National records of 141kg in snatch (old: 140kg, N. Ajith, 2020, National championships, Kolkata), 172kg in clean and jerk (old: 170kg, Sheuli, 2019, Asian junior championships, Pyongyang) and 313kg in total (old: 310kg, Ajith, 2020, National championships, Kolkata). Sheuli’s previous overall personal best was 309kg, achieved in the Asian championships at the same venue last month.

27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Need to improve my conversion rate: Thapa||Young Indian midfielder Anirudh Thapa says he is focussing on improving his goal conversion rate and adapting to different playing circumstances during matches. The 23-year-old is currently training with the Indian football team in Doha ahead of next month’s 2022 FIFA World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup Qualifiers in Qatar. “... I need to improve on a whole lot of aspects. I need to convert more chances. Vision wise, I know I can do better. I need to be adapt to the changing playing circumstances that arise during the match,” he said in a release issued by AIFF. “For example, there may be phases where we need to play direct football during the match. I need to push up front a bit more to help increase the numbers. “But then, it should never be coming at the cost of me leaving a vacant hole in the midfield. I am learning how to balance it. I need to watch my back and go up.” The last time India played Qatar in Qatar, it was a goalless draw. “That was some 18 months back. It’s a different situation right now. But we understand that Qatar are eagerly looking forward to the match. But we know that we will try to do good on the field. We don’t want to be disappointed,” said Thapa. “We are not there to make up the numbers. We are confident in our abilities and we are taking it one match at a time.” Thapa feels as a senior pro in the team with the recent influx of young talent. “My role has changed. There are many young players coming in and challenging everyone. My job is to guide them as to what is expected from them in the national team set-up,” he said. “You just cannot be selfish and just help yourself. You need to think about others too.” Thapa, a former AIFF Academy cadet, said he was focussing on his fitness when he was at home after the international friendlies in March. “The primary aim was to stay fit, and in proper condition so that when the National Team call came I would be in my best physical prowess. “Professor (Luka Radman, fitness coach) has always insisted on building muscle power and strength and I was working relentlessly in the gym. “But then the second wave struck and I was confined to my home for the last two weeks. “From that time onward, I worked mostly on the individual programmes which were sent to me.”  There may be phases where we need to play direct football during the match.

27 May 2021||Tokyo,||Japan’s top daily calls for Games cancellation||Japan’s Asahi Shimbun on Wednesday called for the Tokyo Olympics to be cancelled with the games set to open in less than two months. It is the first of Japan’s major newspapers to make the move and joins some regional newspapers that have recently added to the growing opposition to holding the Olympics. Coming out against the Olympics could be significant since the newspaper, like many in Japan, is a sponsor of the postponed Tokyo Games that are scheduled to open on July 23. Asahi is typically liberal-leaning and often opposes the ruling party led by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. “We cannot think it’s rational to host the Olympics in the city this summer,” the newspaper said in its editorial under a headline that read: “We Demand PM Suga Decide Cancellation." “Distrust and backlash against the reckless national government, Tokyo government and stakeholders in the Olympics are nothing but escalating,” the editorial added. "We demand Prime Minister Suga to calmly evaluate the circumstances and decide the cancellation of the summer event.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/japans-top-daily-calls-for-games-cancellation/article34653698.ece
27 May 2021||Kochi,||Swimmers trying to stay calm||Not again! That’s probably what every swimmer would have felt like when the country came up with the recent lockdown to contain the second wave of the coronavirus.  Swimming was probably the last sport to open last year and now the fear is that swimmers would have to go through that painful cycle all over again. “It’s sort of hopeless right now, I want to come out of it,” said Sanaa Mathew who holds all the women’s backstroke records in Kerala. “I was feeling restless last year, now it has come again.... looks never ending.” Disappointed Sanaa, 15, has moved to the under-18 age-group and she is very disappointed with the competitions she has missed. “In juniors, the years count. I missed my first year in the junior Group-1 and now this is my second year,” said Sanaa, who trains at Kochi’s Regional Sports Centre. The young girl used to run at home during last year’s lockdown and towards the end of the year, she trained in her neighbour’s pool. She was thrilled when she was able to swim again at the RSC from January till April. But now, with the lockdown, it’s back to uncertain days. Shreya Mary Kamal, another young talent, has found a way to stay calm during these stressful times.  “I do yoga and other workouts so I don’t lose my shape. And I don’t think too much; when you think too much you get depressed,” said Shreya, who had a five-gold haul at the last State meet in 2019. A six-month move from Kochi to Bengaluru’s Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence transformed her. “There was a lot of difference in coaching there. And even in swimming, you need to do a workout, go to the gym and all. In Kerala, there’s nothing like that, it’s just swimming. “You can learn more stuff in Bengaluru, it’s such an experience. “So, I’m able to handle the lockdown better this time,” said Shreya, from Hyderabad. But breaststroke swimmer S. Suneesh has managed to train even during the lockdown. “I used to run 20km often, but once or twice a week I used to swim at the TRAC club pool at Karumam near my home,” said Suneesh, from Thiruvananthapuram. “I train alone there.

27 May 2021||Chennai,||Sexual harassment allegations surface, coach denies||A head coach at a private athletics academy here has been accused of sexual harassment by a few of his former trainees through a social media post that appeared on Wednesday. P. Nagarajan was accused of inappropriate behaviour and in February, the father of a junior athlete, complained to C. Latha, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Athletics Association (TNAA), that the coach had misbehaved with his daughter. However, the parent later back-tracked and said that his daughter could train in some other academy. Reacting to the controversy, Nagarajan denied the allegations. Speaking to The Hindu , he said his reputation was being tarnished as he was against the concerned athlete’s romance, which affected her training. “She wanted to get back at me now and hence these unfounded allegations,” Nagarajan said. Meanwhile, Latha assured full support to women athletes who approach the TNAA with their complaints. “We will definitely order an inquiry and if (the coach is) found guilty, we will take strong action which we have not hesitated to take earlier too,” Latha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sexual-harassment-allegations-surface-coach-denies/article34653795.ece

If they get a bit of First Class cricket in and they get that one Test match against Afghanistan, are you better off going into the Ashes series with not a lot or going in with a lot of Tests,” cricket.com.au quoted Ponting as saying. “Ashes series are so physically and mentally draining; you might be better off going in with less. But it doesn’t matter what you’re going in with, it’s about what you do in those big moments, as we saw with the India series,” he added.

27 May 2021||KIAWAH ISLAND,||British Open hopeful of having 75% capacity||Along with the coastal views at Kiawah Island for the PGA Championship, it was the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic that a Major actually sounded like one. A larger gathering could happen on the other side of the Atlantic. The R&A, one of the governing bodies of golf worldwide alongside the United States Golf Association, said on Tuesday it was optimistic that Royal St. George’s could have as much as 75% capacity for the British Open from July 15 to 21. Martin Slumbers, the CEO, also said the capacity for golf's oldest championship could be as low as 25%. So much depends on government regulations, and that won’t be determined until a month before the Open. Big uncertainty “The big uncertainty for us is clarity from the government and health authorities around social distancing, and that will determine what the atmosphere will be like at the Open,” Slumbers said. “We are building the infrastructure as we would normally build, so there’s the big grandstands going around the 18th and around the first, and we’re building them in a way that we can adapt for social distancing depending on what the rules are going to be. “I’m keen to get as many spectators in as possible because I do think that’s what creates the atmosphere, and I think actually it’s what makes the players play just a little bit better,” he added. Watching the PGA Championship from the home of golf, Slumbers said it was clear there was a gap between the U.S. and the UK in terms of restrictions. What he wants to avoid is the chaos that erupted on the 18th hole at Kiawah when Phil Mickelson was swallowed up by the crowd and had to fight his way through to the green. Typical scene That's a typical scene, though far more orderly, at the British Open. Crowds often follow the final group down the fairway toward the green, but at some distance. “We’re very careful on how we move the crowds around, so we will continue to keep the crowds on the side of the 18th until it’s all over and then allow them to move closer to the green,” Slumbers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/british-open-hopeful-of-having-75-capacity/article34653749.ece

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Warriors against wastage||Mahabaleshwar’s farmers harvest strawberries in February. In Himachal Pradesh, apple farmers fill their baskets with glossy red, orange and green globes to be shipped across the country. This year, gripped by the second wave of the pandemic and strict lockdowns, vendors are struggling to reach customers. Wastage is a concern; especially in searing summer months. Vendor GV Murthy in Kondapur, Hyderabad, was forced to dispose of nearly 40 kilograms of tomatoes and 10 kilograms of lady’s fingers in the second week of Telangana lockdowns alone. “Usually I sell produce worth Rs. 8,000 on a good week. But now I am barely making Rs. 2,000. I can’t refrigerate all of this produce and so much is going to waste,” he says. This issue has been on the minds of Bengaluru-based qZense’s team:Rubal Chib, an electronics engineer, and Srishti Batra, a PhD scientist, who met at Entrepreneur First’s first cohort. Srishti has always been fascinated by olfaction, and Rubal combined this interest with an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor to create Q-scan. This handheld device identifies a fruit and then detects if it is edible. It also predicts, using algorithmic data, how much longer a given fruit will stay fresh. Soon, Rubal and Srishti got numerous requests from retailers to bring in Q-scan and Q-log — olfactory loggers for storage — to prevent food loss. Rubal believes that investment into such technology has to happen at the grassroots level. “Retailers and sellers have been early adopters of qZense’s tech on a large scale. Farms use it in clocking harvest times.” QZense is operating largely within metro cities, but their tech has been adopted in Himachal by apple farmers and suppliers, as well as orchards in and around Maharashtra and Bengaluru. “Though the agrarian community has been resilient (during the pandemic), the food value chain needs to be more agile,” AgNext’s CEO Taranjeet Singh Brahma insists, “so the demand for low-cost and real-time AI assessment has been high.” AgNext’s Artificial Intelligence platform Qualix offers instant and on-field chemical, physical and ambient assessments for food safety, security and quality from farm to store. As an example, he points to the frequent problem farmers need to resolve — that of moisture in grains. The quality of grain reduces if the moisture content is too high, whereas if the humidity is too low, it leads to excessive drying. The Punjab-based company is currently testing a low-cost cold storage solution that is in line for a patent. “We can give it to farmers as a corporate social responsibility or as a rental to prevent wastage from the start,” says Taranjeet. Meanwhile, Pune-based Ecozen has been mobilising to leverage green energy for cold storage for the agrarian community, especially during restricted transportation during lockdowns across India. “Lockdowns pushed us to work at a larger scale,” shares Vivek Pandey, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder, adding, “and leasing cold storage became a demand all of a sudden. We ramped up production to adapt.” Despite being so agriculturally diverse, Indian farming is hampered by an antiquated and inefficient supply infrastructure that leads to the wastage of at least 25-30% of fresh produce. “It happens at three points: the farm, inefficient supply-chain management where produce can get damaged during handling or transport, and at the retail level,” says Shobit Gupta, co-founder, and CEO of Superplum, the Silicon Valley-backed startup based out of Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Currently working with 230 farms in over 15 states, Superplum has more than 320 stores in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. “Cold transport plays a big role in our operations. We don’t store much, except in the farms, but our whole transport system is refrigerated, right up to the distribution level. That’s how we ensure freshness and quality,” says Shobhit. Its low-cost Fresherator cold chain transport solution controls high-temperature, humidity and ethylene levels of fresh produce, by automatically adjusting to ideal settings depending on the fruits being carried from point A to point B. “While cherries and strawberries are traditionally the most perishable, mangoes are most difficult to transport because they keep ripening, and we have to manage the process until delivery,” he says.  For companies like Superplum, data science is invaluable; quality supervision, prediction models and using more advanced technology such as IoT is mandatory. Superplum’s cloud-based management system enables shoppers to cross-check lab test reports, the temperature the fruit was transported at as well as farm-level quality parameters. Similarly, analytics tech has been integral to Ecozen. “In Shimla, it is cherry season and they are typically sold off to a middleman,” says Vivek. “But with our cold storage transportation and shelf-life prediction tech, farmers can aggregate good quantities and send directly to a market, making the most out of the produce’s lifetime.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/warriors-against-wastage/article34653567.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A celebration of the everyday||You cannot change the world with a song, but you can resist through a song, exclaims Shadi Zaqtan, a songwriter, singer and composer from the old city of Ramallah, Palestine, in the documentary series Occupied . The five-part series is the only Indian film to be selected for the Athens International Film and Video Festival, and will have its global première on October 24. Directed by Hyderabad-based filmmaker, Pranav Pingle Reddy, Occupied was filmed in 2016-2017. The trailer of Occupied was unveiled by actors Rana Daggubati and Shruti Haasan on May 24. The ongoing crisis in Palestine has once again brought the land and the plight of its people into focus. Pranav looks at Occupied as an attempt to go beyond the news headlines. “What does it mean to live in Palestine? I wanted to look at the daily lives of people,” he says. Celebration of life Each episode focusses on a young artist who uses art — music, calligraphy, poetry, dance and craft — as a form of resistance, as a way of celebrating life within the restrictions, and questions what freedom is all about. “Everyone in Palestine has a story to tell; it is up to you if you want to listen,” says Pranav. Occupied was filmed in sync sound in different locations in Palestine over 35 days by the three-member crew of Pranav, Prithvi Chahal and Arvind Menon, who took on multiple tasks while filming. The 30-year-old recalls what it meant to idealistically embark on the project in his mid-20s. The inherent interest in art and history stemmed from his father and aunt. His father, writer Pingle Ramesh Reddy, and aunt, Anuradha Reddy, have actively engaged in art, history and heritage conservation. Pranav was keen to study in a university that had history to it, and was not just a building. He pursued Masters in Film and Television production at the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, specialising in cinematography, production and direction. “I worked on documentaries that narrated stories of women empowerment, refugee crisis... subjects that moved me,” he says. Signs from the universe “I was keen on exploring stories from the Middle East, particularly Palestine. I didn’t have much money back then and didn’t want to borrow from my family. The universe, however, conspired to make things happen when someone paid me dues for a two-year-old commercial project and another corporate film came up. I pooled in the amount, spoke to like-minded people in Hyderabad such as Mahnoor Yar Khan (who has worked extensively in Palestine as an artiste and drama therapist) to get an idea of what to expect in Palestine.” Mahnoor warned him to go with minimal equipment to not attract too much attention. The instruction was to not take the drone, but Pranav was adamant: “She thought I was crazier than her,” he laughs. He made sure the three-member crew would use smaller cameras, but could not ignore the drone. Art for resistance Pranav says Palestine is an experience, not a mere place to take in the sights. He was moved by the indomitable spirit of the people who endure checkpoints each day as they commute, and try to smile through it all: “They go through a lot — houses being damaged and neighbours providing shelter as long as it takes to rebuild the house, only to be destroyed again. Yet, they carry on.” His team filmed as much as they could, returning with a huge volume of footage, which he says will require three years of editing and post production. In Pranav’s words, Occupied is a celebration of life and hope in Palestine, set against the backdrop of persecution and marginalisation, with a singular belief — in the end, love always wins.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-celebration-of-the-everyday/article34653538.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||17 again||Director Radha Mohan is currently making gentle enquiries about K-Pop to his daughter, who is in Class X and is crazy about Korean pop music. This is not for a future project, but just to stay in touch with the current generation. “Most of my ADs (assistant directors) are just out of college. I learn a lot from their way of thinking,” says Radha Mohan, who debuted in the Tamil film industry in 2004. He is still making films, but the platforms have changed. This Friday, his latest comedy-caper Malaysia to Amnesia will release on Zee 5. Starring Vaibhav, Vani Bhojan, Karunakaran and MS Bhaskar, the film revolves around an entrepreneur taking a flight to meet his girl after lying to his wife. “We knew from the outset that this was going to be an OTT film,” says Radha Mohan, in a telephonic interview, “Usually, after a shot, we look at the monitor thinking about the way it will play out on the big screen. With this film, we kept thinking about how it will look on a mobile screen. We worked on the picture and sound based on this.” Comedy is one of his strong points, he feels. Fans of his evergreen Mozhi (2007) will remember the Prithviraj-Prakashraj and MS Bhaskar portions fondly. “It [comedy] comes naturally to me,” he says, “But I try to lace it with an emotional touch. I have done that in Malaysia to Amnesia as well. Comedy is all about the timing that the actors bring in... I usually give them a bound script so that they can go through and come up with their own improvisations.” Also known for his strong female characters in films like Abhiyum Naanum and Mozhi , Radha Mohan believes that it is most important for directors to stay updated. “When digital filmmaking came into vogue in 2010, I immediately jumped on the bandwagon, making Payanam in that format. The minute a director keeps saying, ‘ Antha kaalam maari varuma’ (there is nothing like the past), it signals his downfall. The mantra is to stay updated with what’s in vogue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/17-again/article34653529.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Vials of hope||Over the course of the pandemic, many family historians have unearthed old albums filled with sepia-tinted photographs that unveil an assortment of personalities and experiences. These photographs cut a swathe through time; like the one of my great-grandfather, a veterinarian in a tie and sola topee examining a cow sometime in the 1930s, in a livestock hospital in a hill station. My search took me to the Pasteur Institute of India (PII), Coonoor, one spring morning in April before lockdown closed the narrow window of travel in Tamil Nadu. An autonomous institute under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, PII stands near Sims Park, reminiscent of the British Raj. Outside its main gate is a statue of Louis Pasteur, the French scientist who developed the principles of vaccination and pasteurisation, holding aloft a replica of the jar containing the spinal cord of a rabbit infected with rabies, which he used to develop a vaccine against the disease. At a time in the 19th Century when viper’s venom and the liver of a mad dog were considered cures for rabies’ fatal symptoms in Europe, Pasteur’s vaccine earned him a place in history and the gratitude of generations to come, when in 1885 it saved the life of young Joseph Meister who had been bitten by a rabid dog. In 1902, Lily Pakenham Walsh, an Englishwoman in India infected with rabies died because she could not get the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) in time. It set in motion a series of fundraisers and events that led to the establishment of the institute in 1907. Set up with Rs. 1 lakh donated to Viceroy Lord Curzon by American philanthropist Henry Phipps, the vaccine manufacturing unit was opened in Coonoor on April 25 as the Pasteur Institute of Southern India. In 1977, it became the autonomous Pasteur Institute of India. The world of labs With a staff strength of 303 and a sprawling campus of 16 acres scattered across the hill with enviable views of tea gardens, PII is presently helmed by veterinarian Dr S Sivakumar. “Initially PII manufactured ARV from inactivated sheep neural tissue. In 2001, it was replaced with in-house developed inactivated, highly purified vero cell-derived ARV. From 1982, the DPT [protects against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus] DT and TT vaccines were manufactured,” says Dr Sivakumar, the Director, as we walk down a winding road to where the state-of-the-art labs, which are under qualification, are located. PII has mice and guinea pigs to test vaccine safety and potency. “There are seven new and two modified GMP facilities equipped with automated and semi-automated equipment established with a budget of Rs. 137.02 crore funded by the Union Government and taken over by PII in 2019,” he adds. “PII can produce 80 to 100 million DPT group of vaccine doses per annum once the facility, equipment and process is validated. The Government has recently approved 30 acres in Coimbatore for PII to set up new BSL-2 and BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level) facilities for the manufacture of viral, bacterial, conjugate and r-DNA vaccines to strengthen the nation’s health and vaccine security,” he says. As we climb back up, the main building with its green-gabled roof and gold topped Baroque domes stands framed by PII’s beautiful garden flush with lilies, bougainvillea, roses and a jacaranda tree. It lends the modern facility an old-fashioned charm. The pioneering research inside its walls inspired many like my great-grandfather to pursue Genetics and work on newer trends in Veterinary Science. “The building, designed by Government architect GTS Harris, now has the Director’s chamber, the library where rare books are housed in glass cabinets, purchase and quality assurance departments and a host of administrative offices. Earlier, it also had the production facility of neural tissue ARV and the quality control division,” says Dr Sivakumar. The building bears the plaque 1906 on its portico and is well preserved with an impressive teak staircase and taciturn portraits of every man and woman who has contributed to PII. In the foyer, also hangs a framed banner of the institute with words from Tennyson’s poem, Ulysses emblazoned on it — To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield — that have inspired its work for over a century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vials-of-hope/article34653571.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Unlocking Loki||“Everyone has been asking ‘when are we going to see Loki’s real power?’,” starts Michael Waldron, as he animatedly dives into the upcoming Loki miniseries, starring Tom Hiddleston. “To have six episodes to explore his power has been so liberating because just from a ‘pure superhero abilities’ perspective, we wanted to explore the awesome stuff he can do, and also dramatically too.” Last we saw the Norse trickster god, he had a giant purple hand wrapped around his neck. The shocking demise of Loki at the hands of the mighty Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War broke the hearts of millions everywhere. What would the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) be without his quick-witted jests and pranks and devilish smile? In 2019, the announcement of Loki , fans already speculated that it would take place in one of the Marvel Universe’s alternate timelines — and they were right. Dissecting and peeling back the layers of the multiverse has been “thrilling” for Waldron, director Kate Herron and the series cast and crew. “It’s a new sandbox, a new corner of the universe to play in. It was certainly a challenge to define the rules of these spaces, the Time Variance Authority and how these branching timelines work. It wasn’t just about going ‘anywhere’ it was about going ‘anywhen’.” In the series, Loki is seen tumbling into the hands of the regulation-body Time Variance Authority, headed by Mobius (played by Owen Wilson). Explaining that “it was a blast” to tip the scales for Loki while making room for his inevitable naughtiness, Waldron says, “It was a chance for our writers’ room to delve into some therapy, if they ever had to go to the DMV (US Department of Motor Vehicles). While we were writing the show, I was in the process of getting a new passport. And you go back to work and go ‘ugh, you’ll never guess the bureaucratic red tape I have had to deal with! But we got excited, too, and were like ‘That’s the TVA!’ so we used that. Taking an organisation that is so soul-crushing by-the-book, so to speak, in their managing of time and dropping the most chaotic character in all of the MCU smack-dab in the middle of that is just amazing juxtaposition.” Waldron, who has worked on projects such as Rick and Morty , and is set to produce MCU’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , has nothing but high praise for Hiddleston and his versatility as an actor and storyteller. It was integral that he pushes Hiddleston’s boundaries. “That’s where the collaboration between writers and actors is such a joy...when you push one another,” he explains, “and my goal from day one was to tell a story of Loki that had never been told before. Now we are starting with this version of Loki at the end of the first Avengers film. So it was our responsibility to not retread old ground. Tom was more than game for that, in fact, he wanted to do that and go deeper into Loki’s shapeshifting identity.” Probably one of the best surprises is Owen Wilson thrown into the mix. So what about Wilson struck a chord with Waldron? “ I love Owen and he is so great in this show; his energy and vibe is so different from Loki’s. They [Owen and Hiddleston] both have natural comedic abilities and they can have a purely dramatic conversation and they could play off one another’s energies and make certain the right moments funny and right moments dramatic. I didn’t even have to set up punchlines to get laughs in this show!” Loki streams on Disney+Hotstar Premium from June 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/unlocking-loki/article34653533.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Front row seats for everyone||In 2020, the celebrated trinity of Carnatic music —Thyagaraja Swamy, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastry — was witness to thundering applause on a stage in Toronto, Canada. Rather, the musicians and actors who played them received the applause.  Trinity , The Madras Players’ rendition of Seetha Ravi’s short stories translated by Prabha Sridevan, retired judge of the Madras High Court, has been on stage since 2018. The 66-year-old theatre group’s creation, which strings together the lives of these three musical stalwarts into a single narrative, marries Carnatic music and live theatre making it an intruiging “Indian musical” to international audiences. The translation of Seetha Ravi’s short stories was first published in 2017, in The Hindu Sunday Magazine , on three consecutive Sundays. It was then picked up by director PC Ramakrishna. After premiering in Chennai in 2018, it travelled to Hyderabad and was later invited to Toronto, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Dallas in 2020. But the pandemic had other plans and the tour was cut short. After having had to cancel their tour of 11 shows in the US, following a successful run in Canada, the crew has now recorded the play for a global audience. Sabhas in Singapore and Australia, apart from the US, had expressed interest, says Ramakrishna. The two hour-long play was filmed on the premises of Kalakshetra with a four-camera (high definition) setup. “I wanted the visual quality of film, including close ups and reactions, but the feel of stage. We used the same set that we had used for the stage,” says the director. Since the performance is heavy on live music, the songs were recorded separately and were mixed in post production. The shots were chosen sequence by sequence at the edit table which took about a month and a half to be completed, says Ramakrishna, adding, “It was important to me that the audience feel that they are still sitting in the front row.” Why does Trinity have a global appeal, despite it being set in the niche world of Carnatic music and South Indian culture? “The [Indian] diaspora brought up in music and dance abroad, appreciates the play because it deals with both music and theatre. Many in the second generation, who are learning music and dance, can now sit with their family and watch the play from wherever they are,” says Ramakrishna. Moreover, the cast — Vijay Siva playing Muthuswami Dikshitar, Gayathri Venkataraghavan as Lalitha (wife of Shyama Sastri) and S Sunder as Thyagaraja — are not unfamiliar names, especially in North America. This is also the time when artistes travel for their individual tours, and also perform in festivals like the Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival. The diaspora is now deprived of such experiences owing to the pandemic and hence the interest in performances like this, even though virtual, has seen a rise. “The original play was 90 minutes. When North America invited us, they said they needed it to be two hours long with the musical content increased. So, I added 30 more minutes across the three sections,” says Ramakrishna.  Working in collaboration with kalakendra.com, Trinity will be launched for public viewing on June 25, 26 and 27.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A camera in the kitchen||Recently released film Bloom has a scene that is reflective of the times we live in. A doorbell rings and a girl rushes to see who it is. “Aye, mask potutu po ,” her aunt says. As she pulls it on and opens the door, a surprise awaits: the boy she has been secretly texting is standing outside. Masked. Though they live in the same street, this is the first time they are seeing each other, after communicating virtually every day, all through lockdown. There’s romance in how they lock eyes. This 35-minute Tamil-English short film based in Chennai gives an insight into the minds of the two leads, showcasing how romance plays out among millennials in the times we live in. Even as we brace to survive the relentless second wave of COVID-19, and yet another lockdown, theatres are shut and big film releases have paused. However, in this space, an encouraging new trend is emerging: a spate of realistic and sensitive, hence powerful, short films set in these unnerving times. And though escapism will always be popular in times like this, it is also cathartic to watch these stories unfold. Since March 2020, directors have started thinking up projects that are easy to execute, keeping in mind pandemic-appropriate behaviour and protocol. Leading Tamil director Sudha Kongara did not just ensure the release of her Suriya-starrer feature film Soorarai Potru on an OTT platform but also did two short films: Ilamai Idho Ido (part of Amazon Prime’s Putham Pudhu Kaalai ) and Thangam (part of Netflix’ Paava Kadhaigal ). “As filmmakers, we have started thinking of more contained, smaller, location-safe subjects,” she says. These are usually between a few minutes to half an hour, have just a few characters and are mostly shot within an apartment space or a street. Established filmmakers including Gautham Menon, Karthik Subbaraj, Venkat Prabhu and Vijay tried their hands in the short film format. Gautham’s Karthik Dial Seytha Enn featuring Simbu and Trisha released in May, kickstarting a bunch of shorts. With Kutty Story , released earlier this year, Tamil cinema acknowledged the short film storytelling format on the big screen. Sometimes, these shorts are also bunched together with a common theme, like Paava Kadhaigal . “It was most exciting as it meant four different voices saying the same kind of story,” says Sudha, who collaborated with Vetri Maaran, Vignesh Shivan and Gautham Menon on the project. The new wave Now young, amateur filmmakers are also riding the wave. Bloom , released on the Madras Talkies YouTube channel last week, is the latest. A love story set during the 2020 pandemic in Chennai, this short attempts to explore two young minds. “There are a lot of things about the phase that were unsettling, but I wanted to document the little joys that life threw at us. I felt that the structure in the love story was similar to what I felt about the pandemic,” says its director Richard Anthony, who has earlier assisted Mani Ratnam in Katru Veliyidai and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam . This 35-minute short features just two actors, Mitra Visvesh and Ashwin Raam, and was shot with limited crew in two apartments. “Most films that represented lockdown felt very claustrophobic. So, my DOP (Niketh Bommi) and I used lenses specifically to show the spaces inside the small house as an expanse, to represent the liberation that the characters felt.” This current spurt in short films for YouTube and other OTT platforms is similar to a wave a decade ago in Tamil cinema; back then, TV show ‘Nalaiya Iyakkunar’ was in the forefront of change. If TV helped showcase them to the world then, it is Internet doing the trick now. And it is a more democratic medium, which means we are likely to see a wider gamut of stories and fresh talent. Many of these short films are released on YouTube channels, so the world is their audience, with feedback being instant. “It was like releasing in a theatre, because we get to reach a wide range of audiences who have free access,” says Bloom creative producer Vivek Ramanujam, “There’s also healthy conversation happening in the comment sections. As a team getting into the industry, it encourages us to create an expanded world with bigger budgets.” With YouTube channels like Madboys, Awesome Machi and Certified Rascals too showcasing strong short films in romance and comedy, the future looks bright. A good start In Kerala, Varsha Vasudev, wrote, directed and produced Malayalam short film Ente Narayanikku . “Making the short was the best decision I took in 2020,” says the 29-year-old, who gave up her career as an engineer to become a filmmaker.  Ente Narayanikku revolves around two characters, Ann and Aravind, quarantined in adjacent flats in an apartment complex during the pandemic. They communicate without seeing each other, calling each other by the names Narayani and Basheer, characters from Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s Mathilukal , which was made into a classic of the same name by auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan. Sooraj Tom, who had already directed two Malayalam features, Pa.Va and Ente Mezhuthiri Athaazangal , [before lockdown] chose to produce his short film, Sarbath , on his own. He spent about Rs. 1 lakh on it. “It was dubbed in five Indian languages as well,” says Sooraj about his short that revolves around a non-resident Malayali, who is on quarantine following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Lockdown shorts captured the essence of what many people were going through. Bangalore-based Harish Gowda’s recent Kannada short Lockdown Phoenix deals with what filmmakers themselves undergo: his protagonist is a filmmaker who gets a big break but has to cancel shoot due to lockdown. “We need to look within ourselves and draw strength,” says Harish, who joined hands with cinematographer Shivakumar to release the film on YouTube channel Signature Studio. When we look at these films two decades from now, they will surely serve as a reminder for the times we lived in.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Kinsman, we have your back||Fire stunts, horse riding scenes and rebellious movement make Madurai Veeran Koothu a herculean performance to pull off. The lesser-known artform, which comes under the umbrella of therukoothu , follows the story of the underdog — an oppressed shoemaker’s son who rose through the ranks, only to be killed — and is performed with fiery wooden spokes. For 30 years, Dharmapuri Ramakrishnan lived and breathed as Madurai Veeran on stages across Tamil Nadu. It has been more than a year since he saw a stage. Earlier, when he did not have a show, he would cook for weddings. That, too, is not an option anymore. As a result of the ongoing pandemic, community-based, folk artistes who perform for weddings, funerals and temple festivals are staring at a seemingly endless period of unemployment. Since most of these forms are physical in nature, making them difficult to translate virtually, artistes are unlikely to be hired for many months to come. These are also communities who also lack resources to pivot online. Across the country, their contemporaries are leading energetic movements to fuel creative crowdfunding campaigns. Anahad’s Together Louder Stronger, an online event on September 26 will feature over 20 artistes — Shaan, Jonita Gandhi, Benny Dayal, When Chai Met Toast to name a few — performing from home to support folk groups. The campaign has already raised Rs. 45 lakhs. Similiarly, Artkhoj and RK Foundations’ All for Folk initiative encourages patrons to book folk artists for online sessions and get-togethers. In Tamil Nadu, artist and activist R Kaleeswaran, who has been working with folk artists for 25 years, says he has personally seen how badly they fared last lockdown. “It is only getting worse. Many artistes have lost their lives to COVID as well,” adds Kaleeswaran, who is founder of Alternative Media Centre, a non-profit organisation in Chennai that works with 50,000 folk artistes. The months of April, May, June and July are especially crucial as everyone, from parai artists to theatre actors, get booked for temple festivals, weddings and community events.“These are the months when they receive income. And it is with this income that they run the next four months,” he says. A vibrant community There are about seven lakh folk artistes across Tamil Nadu. Though there are around 75 groups and associations of artistes, only 38,850 of these performers have been registered with the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 2020, as a special assistance aid, each registered artiste was given Rs. 2,000 by the Tamil Nadu Folk Artistes Welfare Board. But many do not fall under this purview. Last year, with the help of cinema personalities like actors Surya, Samudira Kani, director Karthik Subburaj and many others, Kaleeswaran was able to raise close to Rs. 45 lakhs. Back then and now, the backbone of Kaleeswaran’s team of volunteers has been a group of 200 students from Loyola College who understand the performers’ needs, prepare care packages and distribute funds. This time around, the crew has also partnered with Revamp by Aaval, an initiative by Chennai-based curator Priyanka Ulaganathan who is connecting with contemporary artists, patrons and audiences via social media “In the first lockdown, there was a lot of help pouring in, but this time it’s not the same since no one expected the second wave,“ says Priyanka, who has amplified the campaign by pulling in fellow artists’ works as well. “We decided to give an art print in return for anyone who contributes. This is not a ‘buying’ structure. Patrons can choose whether or not to take a print.” This is their first fundraiser, and they have raised raised Rs. 2 lakhs already, she says. Beyond State lines  While Kaleeshawaran’s project tries to reach performers in all 38 districts of Tamil Nadu, Chennai-based artiste and music producer Tenma, Shreya Nagarajan Singh and gaana singer Muthu, hope to look at Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well, through their Funds For Folk campaign. Another pan-India effort comes from Chennai-based Sumanasa Foundation, that has been crowdfunding since March 2020. To bolster the campaign, the foundation conducted an online performing arts festival — Margazhi Manch, last December. They have distributed Rs. 1.05 crore to over 3,000 artistes representing over 250 art forms. Funds for Folk campaign plans to cater to 1,000 artistes, whom the team has worked with extensively. Tenma says, “The most annoying part is that people always assert their parambariyam (tradition) but when the time comes to really get out there and help, there aren’t many channels.” Hailing from starkly different artistic backgrounds has helped Tenma, Shreya and Muthu to do intersectional work. To that end, there also seems to be a movement among young, contemporary performers who wish to mobilise. Tenma believes this is a by-product of the generation addressing its roots, while on a search for its own identity. After an audit to understand the specific needs, they put together funds, utilities and care packages. “We will do one rollout within the next couple of weeks, and one more in another month. We see this status quo continuing for a while,” adds Shreya. Three days in, they have already raised over Rs. 6 lakhs. “We want to be an informal support system. That’s what this structure lacks,” Shreya says. Kaleeshwaran echoes this sentiment. “We are perhaps one of the few States that have a department dedicated to folk arts in the Government. I wish to see it being active now more than ever.”  The months of April, May, June and July are especially crucial for folk artsites who get booked for temple festivals and community events||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kinsman-we-have-your-back/article34653557.ece

Heading it is New-York based epidemiologist Dr Rajeev Fernando, an alumnus of Don Bosco School, Egmore. “We will start the incentive model in Kovalam, and then move to Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli, where we are arranging for buses to pick up and drop people getting vaccinated. Our aim is to get 100% vaccinations, even in rural areas,” says Dr Fernando, over a phone call. Chiraj’s operations are being funded by the 1992 batch of Don Bosco alumni from across the world. The funds have also enabled setting up of a free 14-bed COVID-19 care facility in collaboration with Arun Hospital, Medavakkam. The school’s Egmore premises is home to a 100-bed COVID-19 care centre, an ‘extension centre’ of the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. “We are in close contact with the Egmore facility, which is supported mostly by the 1991 batch. We direct patients there as and when needed, as we only have the resources to take in people with SpO2 around 90, and no comorbidities.” Recognising that mental health is an important aspect of the pandemic, the NGO has also set up the Devi Project. “We have two Chennai-based psychologists, who provide women with online counselling in Tamil and English. They have reached out to over 100 women so far,” he says. The alumni are now collecting donations to expand their 14-bed facility to a 100-bed camp at a Government school.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Now, login for dabbawalas||Mumbai’s well-loveddabbawalasare back in action. Only this time, instead of delivering home cooked lunches to office goers, their bicycles are loaded with cheeseburgers, tiramisu and frappes. The many lockdowns since March 2020, to combat COVID-19, combined with most people working from home, had left them out of work. A unique lunch box delivery system, the network transports freshly cooked meals from homes to offices in Mumbai, via bicycles and trains. What makes thedabbawalasspecial is the fact that the empty boxes are returned in the afternoon, and despite serving 2,00,000 people with a network of about 5,000, mistakes are rare. Recently, Mumbai-based Impresario Handmade Restaurants launched a collaboration with Mumbai’s dabbawala s, recruiting them as delivery partners to facilitate direct ordering from restaurants. The company has 57 restaurants across 16 cities across the country, including SOCIAL, Smoke House Deli and Salt Water cafe in (a total of 20) Mumbai. In the first week of its pilot project, about 30 dabbawala s were engaged to make between 600 and 1,000 deliveries every day from the group’s restaurants in the Lower Parel, Bandra (West), and BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex) areas. On the phone from Mumbai, Riyaaz Amlani, CEO & MD Impresario Handmade Restaurants says, “Dabbawalasare the original backbone of Mumbai’s food delivery system. The food industry has now come together with the dabbawalas to form a symbiotic partnership to empower and enable each other over the next few months. The association will roll out more phases over the next few months, each employing more dabbawalas .” Ulhas Muke, president, Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, a part of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association, says, “When the first lockdown was introduced, it was the toughest time we’ve ever faced; our members were left with little to no money in their bank accounts. Although there are many restaurants and hotel chains in our city, in the past we’ve only catered to office-goers at their workplace. Now that work from home has become the norm, it’s important to go where the customer is.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-login-for-dabbawalas/article34653559.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Worlds shaped by laughter||According to Japanese mythology, the world was once saved from eternal darkness due to laughter. Amaterasu, the Shinto sun goddess, goes into hiding in a cave after her brother, Susanoo, shames her. Because of this, the world becomes dark and cold. Despite many attempts at persuasion by other gods, she fails to return. Then, Amenouzume, the goddess of dawn, merriment and humour, begins a comical dance. The other kamis (Shinto gods or spirits) laugh uncontrollably. Amaterasu, curious about the laugh, steps out of the cave, restoring the world’s light. French visual artist Anaïs Tondeur’s latest work,When the World was a Laugh, was inspired by this mythology. It is being showcased atContagion, Science Gallery Bengaluru’s online art and science exhibition. The work features a video of fine powder on a thin surface vibrated by laughter played from speakers underneath. The vibrations disturb the powder, causing a change in the landscape. Anaïs attempts to recreate the formation of mountains. “This is what happens on a geologic scale on a much longer timescale,” she says via a video call from France. Her miniature world is literally shaped by laughter. The nine-minute clip has different kinds of laughs including cackles, chortles, snorts, snickers, belly-laughs, a chorus of hysterics and even ‘laughter’ of animals and birds. For this project, Anaïs wanted a collection of laughs from different parts of the world. From France she collected over 30 laughs including those of animals from forests and the countryside. “You can argue if the animals were actually laughing. But it is more of our interpretation,” she says. Due to travel restrictions, she could not complete the task in person and asked people to send her recordings of laughter. She got 70 laughs from other parts of the world, including Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, Durgapur and New Delhi. “We classified this collection according to emotions of colours” — she colour-coded the laughs to make a digital mural — “We also wrote a story from all the laughs we received.” Then, with sound artist Floriane Pochone, Anaïs created a soundscape of laughter. “It was as if we were playing with musical notes but the notes were made of laughter,” she explains, “We are planning to add more laughter.” She also intends to display a physical installation of her work, wherein the audience can record their laughter and see how it changes the topography.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Warriors against wastage||Mahabaleshwar’s farmers harvest strawberries in February. In Himachal Pradesh, apple farmers fill their baskets with glossy red, orange and green globes to be shipped across the country. This year, gripped by the second wave of the pandemic and strict lockdowns, vendors are struggling to reach customers. Wastage is a concern; especially in searing summer months. Vendor GV Murthy in Kondapur, Hyderabad, was forced to dispose of nearly 40 kilograms of tomatoes and 10 kilograms of lady’s fingers in the second week of Telangana lockdowns alone. “Usually I sell produce worth Rs. 8,000 on a good week. But now I am barely making Rs. 2,000. I can’t refrigerate all of this produce and so much is going to waste,” he says. This issue has been on the minds of Bengaluru-based qZense’s team:Rubal Chib, an electronics engineer, and Srishti Batra, a PhD scientist, who met at Entrepreneur First’s first cohort. Srishti has always been fascinated by olfaction, and Rubal combined this interest with an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor to create Q-scan. This handheld device identifies a fruit and then detects if it is edible. It also predicts, using algorithmic data, how much longer a given fruit will stay fresh. Soon, Rubal and Srishti got numerous requests from retailers to bring in Q-scan and Q-log — olfactory loggers for storage — to prevent food loss. Rubal believes that investment into such technology has to happen at the grassroots level. “Retailers and sellers have been early adopters of qZense’s tech on a large scale. Farms use it in clocking harvest times.” QZense is operating largely within metro cities, but their tech has been adopted in Himachal by apple farmers and suppliers, as well as orchards in and around Maharashtra and Bengaluru. “Though the agrarian community has been resilient (during the pandemic), the food value chain needs to be more agile,” AgNext’s CEO Taranjeet Singh Brahma insists, “so the demand for low-cost and real-time AI assessment has been high.” AgNext’s Artificial Intelligence platform Qualix offers instant and on-field chemical, physical and ambient assessments for food safety, security and quality from farm to store. As an example, he points to the frequent problem farmers need to resolve — that of moisture in grains. The quality of grain reduces if the moisture content is too high, whereas if the humidity is too low, it leads to excessive drying. The Punjab-based company is currently testing a low-cost cold storage solution that is in line for a patent. “We can give it to farmers as a corporate social responsibility or as a rental to prevent wastage from the start,” says Taranjeet. Meanwhile, Pune-based Ecozen has been mobilising to leverage green energy for cold storage for the agrarian community, especially during restricted transportation during lockdowns across India. “Lockdowns pushed us to work at a larger scale,” shares Vivek Pandey, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder, adding, “and leasing cold storage became a demand all of a sudden. We ramped up production to adapt.” Despite being so agriculturally diverse, Indian farming is hampered by an antiquated and inefficient supply infrastructure that leads to the wastage of at least 25-30% of fresh produce. “It happens at three points: the farm, inefficient supply-chain management where produce can get damaged during handling or transport, and at the retail level,” says Shobit Gupta, co-founder, and CEO of Superplum, the Silicon Valley-backed startup based out of Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Currently working with 230 farms in over 15 states, Superplum has more than 320 stores in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. “Cold transport plays a big role in our operations. We don’t store much, except in the farms, but our whole transport system is refrigerated, right up to the distribution level. That’s how we ensure freshness and quality,” says Shobhit. Its low-cost Fresherator cold chain transport solution controls high-temperature, humidity and ethylene levels of fresh produce, by automatically adjusting to ideal settings depending on the fruits being carried from point A to point B. “While cherries and strawberries are traditionally the most perishable, mangoes are most difficult to transport because they keep ripening, and we have to manage the process until delivery,” he says.  For companies like Superplum, data science is invaluable; quality supervision, prediction models and using more advanced technology such as IoT is mandatory. Superplum’s cloud-based management system enables shoppers to cross-check lab test reports, the temperature the fruit was transported at as well as farm-level quality parameters. Similarly, analytics tech has been integral to Ecozen. “In Shimla, it is cherry season and they are typically sold off to a middleman,” says Vivek. “But with our cold storage transportation and shelf-life prediction tech, farmers can aggregate good quantities and send directly to a market, making the most out of the produce’s lifetime.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/warriors-against-wastage/article34654092.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A celebration of the everyday||You cannot change the world with a song, but you can resist through a song, exclaims Shadi Zaqtan, a songwriter, singer and composer from the old city of Ramallah, Palestine, in the documentary series Occupied . The five-part series is the only Indian film to be selected for the Athens International Film and Video Festival, and will have its global première on October 24. Directed by Hyderabad-based filmmaker, Pranav Pingle Reddy, Occupied was filmed in 2016-2017. The trailer of Occupied was unveiled by actors Rana Daggubati and Shruti Haasan on May 24. The ongoing crisis in Palestine has once again brought the land and the plight of its people into focus. Pranav looks at Occupied as an attempt to go beyond the news headlines. “What does it mean to live in Palestine? I wanted to look at the daily lives of people,” he says. Celebration of life Each episode focusses on a young artist who uses art — music, calligraphy, poetry, dance and craft — as a form of resistance, as a way of celebrating life within the restrictions, and questions what freedom is all about. “Everyone in Palestine has a story to tell; it is up to you if you want to listen,” says Pranav. Occupied was filmed in sync sound in different locations in Palestine over 35 days by the three-member crew of Pranav, Prithvi Chahal and Arvind Menon, who took on multiple tasks while filming. The 30-year-old recalls what it meant to idealistically embark on the project in his mid-20s. The inherent interest in art and history stemmed from his father and aunt. His father, writer Pingle Ramesh Reddy, and aunt, Anuradha Reddy, have actively engaged in art, history and heritage conservation. Pranav was keen to study in a university that had history to it, and was not just a building. He pursued Masters in Film and Television production at the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, specialising in cinematography, production and direction. “I worked on documentaries that narrated stories of women empowerment, refugee crisis... subjects that moved me,” he says. Signs from the universe “I was keen on exploring stories from the Middle East, particularly Palestine. I didn’t have much money back then and didn’t want to borrow from my family. The universe, however, conspired to make things happen when someone paid me dues for a two-year-old commercial project and another corporate film came up. I pooled in the amount, spoke to like-minded people in Hyderabad such as Mahnoor Yar Khan (who has worked extensively in Palestine as an artiste and drama therapist) to get an idea of what to expect in Palestine.” Mahnoor warned him to go with minimal equipment to not attract too much attention. The instruction was to not take the drone, but Pranav was adamant: “She thought I was crazier than her,” he laughs. He made sure the three-member crew would use smaller cameras, but could not ignore the drone. Art for resistance Pranav says Palestine is an experience, not a mere place to take in the sights. He was moved by the indomitable spirit of the people who endure checkpoints each day as they commute, and try to smile through it all: “They go through a lot — houses being damaged and neighbours providing shelter as long as it takes to rebuild the house, only to be destroyed again. Yet, they carry on.” His team filmed as much as they could, returning with a huge volume of footage, which he says will require three years of editing and post production.

27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Vials of hope||Over the course of the pandemic, many family historians have unearthed old albums filled with sepia-tinted photographs that unveil an assortment of personalities and experiences. These photographs cut a swathe through time; like the one of my great-grandfather, a veterinarian in a tie and sola topee examining a cow sometime in the 1930s, in a livestock hospital in a hill station. My search took me to the Pasteur Institute of India (PII), Coonoor, one spring morning in April before lockdown closed the narrow window of travel in Tamil Nadu. An autonomous institute under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, PII stands near Sims Park, reminiscent of the British Raj. Outside its main gate is a statue of Louis Pasteur, the French scientist who developed the principles of vaccination and pasteurisation, holding aloft a replica of the jar containing the spinal cord of a rabbit infected with rabies, which he used to develop a vaccine against the disease. At a time in the 19th Century when viper’s venom and the liver of a mad dog were considered cures for rabies’ fatal symptoms in Europe, Pasteur’s vaccine earned him a place in history and the gratitude of generations to come, when in 1885 it saved the life of young Joseph Meister who had been bitten by a rabid dog. In 1902, Lily Pakenham Walsh, an Englishwoman in India infected with rabies died because she could not get the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) in time. It set in motion a series of fundraisers and events that led to the establishment of the institute in 1907. Set up with Rs. 1 lakh donated to Viceroy Lord Curzon by American philanthropist Henry Phipps, the vaccine manufacturing unit was opened in Coonoor on April 25 as the Pasteur Institute of Southern India. In 1977, it became the autonomous Pasteur Institute of India. The world of labs With a staff strength of 303 and a sprawling campus of 16 acres scattered across the hill with enviable views of tea gardens, PII is presently helmed by veterinarian Dr S Sivakumar. “Initially PII manufactured ARV from inactivated sheep neural tissue. In 2001, it was replaced with in-house developed inactivated, highly purified vero cell-derived ARV. From 1982, the DPT [protects against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus] DT and TT vaccines were manufactured,” says Dr Sivakumar, the Director, as we walk down a winding road to where the state-of-the-art labs, which are under qualification, are located. PII has mice and guinea pigs to test vaccine safety and potency. “There are seven new and two modified GMP facilities equipped with automated and semi-automated equipment established with a budget of Rs. 137.02 crore funded by the Union Government and taken over by PII in 2019,” he adds. “PII can produce 80 to 100 million DPT group of vaccine doses per annum once the facility, equipment and process is validated. The Government has recently approved 30 acres in Coimbatore for PII to set up new BSL-2 and BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level) facilities for the manufacture of viral, bacterial, conjugate and r-DNA vaccines to strengthen the nation’s health and vaccine security,” he says. As we climb back up, the main building with its green-gabled roof and gold topped Baroque domes stands framed by PII’s beautiful garden flush with lilies, bougainvillea, roses and a jacaranda tree. It lends the modern facility an old-fashioned charm. The pioneering research inside its walls inspired many like my great-grandfather to pursue Genetics and work on newer trends in Veterinary Science. “The building, designed by Government architect GTS Harris, now has the Director’s chamber, the library where rare books are housed in glass cabinets, purchase and quality assurance departments and a host of administrative offices. Earlier, it also had the production facility of neural tissue ARV and the quality control division,” says Dr Sivakumar. The building bears the plaque 1906 on its portico and is well preserved with an impressive teak staircase and taciturn portraits of every man and woman who has contributed to PII. In the foyer, also hangs a framed banner of the institute with words from Tennyson’s poem, Ulysses emblazoned on it — To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield — that have inspired its work for over a century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vials-of-hope/article34654093.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A camera in the kitchen||Recently released film Bloom has a scene that is reflective of the times we live in. A doorbell rings and a girl rushes to see who it is. “Aye, mask potutu po ,” her aunt says. As she pulls it on and opens the door, a surprise awaits: the boy she has been secretly texting is standing outside. Masked. Though they live in the same street, this is the first time they are seeing each other, after communicating virtually every day, all through lockdown. There’s romance in how they lock eyes. This 35-minute Tamil-English short film based in Chennai gives an insight into the minds of the two leads, showcasing how romance plays out among millennials in the times we live in. Even as we brace to survive the relentless second wave of COVID-19, and yet another lockdown, theatres are shut and big film releases have paused. However, in this space, an encouraging new trend is emerging: a spate of realistic and sensitive, hence powerful, short films set in these unnerving times. And though escapism will always be popular in times like this, it is also cathartic to watch these stories unfold. Since March 2020, directors have started thinking up projects that are easy to execute, keeping in mind pandemic-appropriate behaviour and protocol. Leading Tamil director Sudha Kongara did not just ensure the release of her Suriya-starrer feature film Soorarai Potru on an OTT platform but also did two short films: Ilamai Idho Ido (part of Amazon Prime’s Putham Pudhu Kaalai ) and Thangam (part of Netflix’ Paava Kadhaigal ). “As filmmakers, we have started thinking of more contained, smaller, location-safe subjects,” she says. These are usually between a few minutes to half an hour, have just a few characters and are mostly shot within an apartment space or a street. Established filmmakers including Gautham Menon, Karthik Subbaraj, Venkat Prabhu and Vijay tried their hands in the short film format. Gautham’s Karthik Dial Seytha Enn featuring Simbu and Trisha released in May, kickstarting a bunch of shorts. With Kutty Story , released earlier this year, Tamil cinema acknowledged the short film storytelling format on the big screen. Sometimes, these shorts are also bunched together with a common theme, like Paava Kadhaigal . “It was most exciting as it meant four different voices saying the same kind of story,” says Sudha, who collaborated with Vetri Maaran, Vignesh Shivan and Gautham Menon on the project. The new wave Now young, amateur filmmakers are also riding the wave. Bloom , released on the Madras Talkies YouTube channel last week, is the latest. A love story set during the 2020 pandemic in Chennai, this short attempts to explore two young minds. “There are a lot of things about the phase that were unsettling, but I wanted to document the little joys that life threw at us. I felt that the structure in the love story was similar to what I felt about the pandemic,” says its director Richard Anthony, who has earlier assisted Mani Ratnam in Katru Veliyidai and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam . This 35-minute short features just two actors, Mitra Visvesh and Ashwin Raam, and was shot with limited crew in two apartments. “Most films that represented lockdown felt very claustrophobic. So, my DOP (Niketh Bommi) and I used lenses specifically to show the spaces inside the small house as an expanse, to represent the liberation that the characters felt.” This current spurt in short films for YouTube and other OTT platforms is similar to a wave a decade ago in Tamil cinema; back then, TV show ‘Nalaiya Iyakkunar’ was in the forefront of change. If TV helped showcase them to the world then, it is Internet doing the trick now. And it is a more democratic medium, which means we are likely to see a wider gamut of stories and fresh talent. Many of these short films are released on YouTube channels, so the world is their audience, with feedback being instant. “It was like releasing in a theatre, because we get to reach a wide range of audiences who have free access,” says Bloom creative producer Vivek Ramanujam, “There’s also healthy conversation happening in the comment sections. As a team getting into the industry, it encourages us to create an expanded world with bigger budgets.” With YouTube channels like Madboys, Awesome Machi and Certified Rascals too showcasing strong short films in romance and comedy, the future looks bright. A good start In Kerala, Varsha Vasudev, wrote, directed and produced Malayalam short film Ente Narayanikku . “Making the short was the best decision I took in 2020,” says the 29-year-old, who gave up her career as an engineer to become a filmmaker.  Ente Narayanikku revolves around two characters, Ann and Aravind, quarantined in adjacent flats in an apartment complex during the pandemic. They communicate without seeing each other, calling each other by the names Narayani and Basheer, characters from Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s Mathilukal , which was made into a classic of the same name by auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan. Sooraj Tom, who had already directed two Malayalam features, Pa.Va and Ente Mezhuthiri Athaazangal , [before lockdown] chose to produce his short film, Sarbath , on his own. He spent about Rs. 1 lakh on it. “It was dubbed in five Indian languages as well,” says Sooraj about his short that revolves around a non-resident Malayali, who is on quarantine following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Lockdown shorts captured the essence of what many people were going through. Bangalore-based Harish Gowda’s recent Kannada short Lockdown Phoenix deals with what filmmakers themselves undergo: his protagonist is a filmmaker who gets a big break but has to cancel shoot due to lockdown. “We need to look within ourselves and draw strength,” says Harish, who joined hands with cinematographer Shivakumar to release the film on YouTube channel Signature Studio. When we look at these films two decades from now, they will surely serve as a reminder for the times we lived in.  (With inputs fromAthira M, Shilpa Nair AnandandShilpa Anandraj)   Making the short film was the best decision I took in 2020 Varsha Vasudev||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-camera-in-the-kitchen/article34654096.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Unlocking Loki||“Everyone has been asking ‘when are we going to see Loki’s real power?’,” starts Michael Waldron, as he animatedly dives into the upcoming Loki miniseries, starring Tom Hiddleston. “To have six episodes to explore his power has been so liberating because just from a ‘pure superhero abilities’ perspective, we wanted to explore the awesome stuff he can do, and also dramatically too.” Last we saw the Norse trickster god, he had a giant purple hand wrapped around his neck. The shocking demise of Loki at the hands of the mighty Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War broke the hearts of millions everywhere. What would the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) be without his quick-witted jests and pranks and devilish smile? In 2019, the announcement of Loki , fans already speculated that it would take place in one of the Marvel Universe’s alternate timelines — and they were right. Dissecting and peeling back the layers of the multiverse has been “thrilling” for Waldron, director Kate Herron and the series cast and crew. “It’s a new sandbox, a new corner of the universe to play in. It was certainly a challenge to define the rules of these spaces, the Time Variance Authority and how these branching timelines work. It wasn’t just about going ‘anywhere’ it was about going ‘anywhen’.” In the series, Loki is seen tumbling into the hands of the regulation-body Time Variance Authority, headed by Mobius (played by Owen Wilson). Explaining that “it was a blast” to tip the scales for Loki while making room for his inevitable naughtiness, Waldron says, “It was a chance for our writers’ room to delve into some therapy, if they ever had to go to the DMV (US Department of Motor Vehicles). While we were writing the show, I was in the process of getting a new passport. And you go back to work and go ‘ugh, you’ll never guess the bureaucratic red tape I have had to deal with! But we got excited, too, and were like ‘That’s the TVA!’ so we used that. Taking an organisation that is so soul-crushing by-the-book, so to speak, in their managing of time and dropping the most chaotic character in all of the MCU smack-dab in the middle of that is just amazing juxtaposition.” Waldron, who has worked on projects such as Rick and Morty , and is set to produce MCU’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , has nothing but high praise for Hiddleston and his versatility as an actor and storyteller. It was integral that he pushes Hiddleston’s boundaries. “That’s where the collaboration between writers and actors is such a joy...when you push one another,” he explains, “and my goal from day one was to tell a story of Loki that had never been told before. Now we are starting with this version of Loki at the end of the first Avengers film. So it was our responsibility to not retread old ground. Tom was more than game for that, in fact, he wanted to do that and go deeper into Loki’s shapeshifting identity.” Probably one of the best surprises is Owen Wilson thrown into the mix. So what about Wilson struck a chord with Waldron? “ I love Owen and he is so great in this show; his energy and vibe is so different from Loki’s. They [Owen and Hiddleston] both have natural comedic abilities and they can have a purely dramatic conversation and they could play off one another’s energies and make certain the right moments funny and right moments dramatic. I didn’t even have to set up punchlines to get laughs in this show!” Loki streams on Disney+Hotstar Premium from June 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/unlocking-loki/article34654097.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Now, login for dabbawalas||Mumbai’s well-loveddabbawalasare back in action. Only this time, instead of delivering home cooked lunches to office goers, their bicycles are loaded with cheeseburgers, tiramisu and frappes. The many lockdowns since March 2020, to combat COVID-19, combined with most people working from home, had left them out of work. A unique lunch box delivery system, the network transports freshly cooked meals from homes to offices in Mumbai, via bicycles and trains. What makes thedabbawalasspecial is the fact that the empty boxes are returned in the afternoon, and despite serving 2,00,000 people with a network of about 5,000, mistakes are rare. Recently, Mumbai-based Impresario Handmade Restaurants launched a collaboration with Mumbai’s dabbawala s, recruiting them as delivery partners to facilitate direct ordering from restaurants. The company has 57 restaurants across 16 cities across the country, including SOCIAL, Smoke House Deli and Salt Water cafe in (a total of 20) Mumbai. In the first week of its pilot project, about 30 dabbawala s were engaged to make between 600 and 1,000 deliveries every day from the group’s restaurants in the Lower Parel, Bandra (West), and BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex) areas. On the phone from Mumbai, Riyaaz Amlani, CEO & MD Impresario Handmade Restaurants says, “Dabbawalasare the original backbone of Mumbai’s food delivery system. The food industry has now come together with the dabbawalas to form a symbiotic partnership to empower and enable each other over the next few months. The association will roll out more phases over the next few months, each employing more dabbawalas .” Ulhas Muke, president, Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, a part of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association, says, “When the first lockdown was introduced, it was the toughest time we’ve ever faced; our members were left with little to no money in their bank accounts. Although there are many restaurants and hotel chains in our city, in the past we’ve only catered to office-goers at their workplace. Now that work from home has become the norm, it’s important to go where the customer is.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-login-for-dabbawalas/article34654090.ece
27 May 2021||May 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Man enough?||There are different lenses through which one can view masculinity in India, but one of the more straightforward ones is Bollywood, that reliable barometer of public sentiment. In the ’50s and the ’60s, the typical hero was a stoic figure, coping with his (and, metaphorically, the country’s) lack of resources, never showing a sign of weakness or visible vulnerability. Stoic silence soon gave way to red-hot rage: the era of Amitabh Bachchan and the ‘angry young man’ gave the average Joe a certain license to explode. And now, finally, we have heroes who aren’t afraid to cry: Vicky Kaushal’s famous weeping scene in Masaan and Ranbir Kapoor’s many teary moments across the last decade, are examples. “More often than not, men are encouraged to keep their emotions to themselves,” says Deepa Narayan in one of the first episodes of her podcast, What’s a Man . For this 10-episode series, Narayan — who worked for the World Bank for over 20 years — and her team interviewed hundreds of middle and upper-class boys and young men, not to mention prominent men from different walks of life — including Retired General HS Panag, author Amish Tripathi, comedians Abish Mathew and Neville Shah, among others.

It cannot be a one-way street.”  Devraj Sanyal, Managing Editor and CEO, Universal Music Group.   “Men are very pampered (in society), which makes them feel very special. There’s a certain value still attached to being a man. But there are also other parts of him that feel very confused, depressed or weak. They are not allowed to be vulnerable.” Dr Ashis Roy, psychoanalyst and faculty at Ambedkar University   “I was the kind of unsympathetic, insensitive, stereotypical man who thought he could live his [your] whole life on testosterone alone. I used to think people who go to therapy are weak-willed, how can you not control your emotions et cetera.” Comedian Neville Shah   “ In our surveys and user-generated pieces, we found that men who had a relaxed (not shameful) relationship with the body also had quite positive sex lives .” Paromita Vohra, filmmaker and founder of Agents of Ishq||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-enough/article34653839.ece
27 May 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan govt. to audit COVID-19 deaths||The Congress government in Rajasthan has ordered an audit of deaths caused by COVID-19 infection amid allegations levelled by the Opposition BJP that the fatalities were being under-reported. The audit will also help in taking a decision on social security measures for the families which have lost their earning members during the pandemic. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said here on Wednesday that the State government was not hiding the number of COVID-19 related deaths and was fighting against the disease with “complete transparency” and with the cooperation of all sections of society. While the State’s COVID-19 death toll climbed to 8,018 on Wednesday with 107 more fatalities, Mr. Gehlot gave instructions to the Medical and Health Department officials to formulate an effective strategy to deal with a potential third wave of the virus infection. The active cases reported in the State were 78,126. Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma has ruled out the possibility of under-reporting of COVID-19 related deaths and said every death was being recorded meticulously in the dedicated health facilities. He said it would be wrong to connect the deaths owing to diseases, accidents, age and other reasons in a big State like Rajasthan with the virus infection. Mr. Gehlot also accused Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan of misleading the country on the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, when the vaccination centres across the countries were being closed down. “Amid the shortage of vaccines, Dr. Vardhan says there are enough one crore vaccines in the country. But this number will be finished in just one day,” he said.  Disposal of bodies The Chief Minister urged the Centre to issue guidelines under the COVID-19 protocol on how the bodies should be buried along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna rivers and on immersion of ashes to prevent further spread of virus. The pandemic could become more serious if the infection spreads from the bodies during the rainy season, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-govt-to-audit-covid-19-deaths/article34654111.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Centre can’t leave it up to States to get vaccine: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday likened the “acute shortage” of COVID-19 vaccination in the country to a war-like situation that all governments, from the Centre to the States, had to confront as ‘Team India’. The Centre cannot abdicate its responsibility and leave vaccine procurement to the States, he said, adding that this akin to Delhi being asked to arrange its own weapons and Uttar Pradesh its own tanks if Pakistan declared war on India. “Vaccines for the 18-44 age group are finished in Delhi. For the past four days, vaccination centres for the young have been shut. Covaxin for the elderly is also finished. We have written to the Centre but the vaccines have not yet arrived,” he said in a video message. In a pandemic situation, new vaccination centres should ideally be opening every day but that is not happening, he added. Mr. Kejriwal said “certain huge mistakes” had been committed in the vaccination effort. “If the people in India had been vaccinated at the right time, then possibly the effect of the second wave could have been reduced, several lives could have been saved, several homes could have been saved from destruction,” he added. “India’s response to the situation was delayed by six months. We made a huge mistake. Instead of vaccinating our own citizens, we began exporting vaccines. Scientists of India made the world’s first vaccine. We should have started producing vaccines on a war footing right then and begun vaccinating our citizens on a mass scale. I am particularly saddened that we are still not operating with a level of urgency,” he added. In the last two months, every State has been working towards arranging vaccines but not a single State has been able to arrange one extra dose, leave alone the vaccine doses provided by the Centre, Mr. Kejriwal said. Vaccine manufacturing companies have clearly stated they will deal directly with the Centre, he said. Many State governments had issued global tenders and failed. “Why is the country not buying vaccines? Currently, India is battling the pandemic, and in such a situation, State governments cannot be asked to look out for themselves,” he said.  ‘Act in unison’ He said it’s time they acted in unison. “I would like to assure the Prime Minister that all the CMs, rising above petty party politics, are working along with you like soldiers of the nation. You procure the vaccines and distribute them to States — administering them is our duty, which we will fulfil,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-cant-leave-it-up-to-states-to-get-vaccine-cm/article34653849.ece

Vaccination data could not be fully updated to the Central Co-Win server or platform due to technical difficulties and the updation is in process,” said the Office of Jharkhand Chief Minister on Twitter on Wednesday.  ‘Wastage at 4.63%’ “About 48.63 lakh vaccine doses were supplied to all districts while 42.07 lakh doses have been utilised. Vaccine coverage across all districts is about 40.12 lakh. The percentage of wastage is estimated at 4.63%,” it pointed out. Vaccines available in the State are 6.56 lakhs “The Jharkhand government is fully focused on utilising its available vaccine doses in the most prudent manner possible, ensuring minimal wastage. We hope to minimise it further with more focused awareness campaigns in forested and other rural areas,” the Chief Minister’s Office said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jharkhand-dismisses-centres-charges-on-vaccine-wastage/article34654113.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Drive-through vaccination facility in Dwarka comes in handy for many||People who were unable to get an appointment on the government portal and those who were too scared of going to a hospital were among the ones who came to get their COVID-19 vaccine at a drive-through facility in Dwarka on Wednesday. The facility is run by Aakash Healthcare, a private hospital, and people have to pay Rs. 1,600 for a dose. Citizens can get vaccinated without stepping out of their car. Before coming for vaccination, they have to get an appointment through 8800015999. As you drive in, there is a counter where the hospital officials will check whether you have done pre-registration and payment. At the second counter, the person will be inoculated and at the third, further details are verified. The person is then asked to wait at the parking area for 30 minutes before leaving. “If you feel any dizziness or discomfort, then blow the horn and our team will check on you,” an official told one of the people who got vaccinated. No walk-in registration will be allowed for drive-through vaccination and Aadhaar card as an identity proof is a “must”, the hospital said in a statement. “Fifty employees from Aakash Healthcare will operate the centre that plans to administer a minimum of 250 to 300 doses a day. The centre will also run a mobile vaccination unit called ‘VaxiVan’, to vaccinate people in residential housing societies and corporate offices,” the statement said. Mixed reaction Naresh Singh (22), a college student who got his first shot, said: “The process was easy and comfortable and there was social distancing as I didn’t have to step out of my car.” Hardeep Kaur Chatrath, (41), said she and her husband had been trying to find a slot through CoWIN for the last two weeks. “We kept checking several times during the day, but did not get any slots. Finally, we came to know about this facility and booked it over the phone. We didn’t want to go to hospitals to get vaccinated,” she said. Karthik Bharadwaj said he had also been trying to get a slot via CoWIN for the last two weeks, but was unsuccessful. “Here, we got the slot very easily, but it is expensive. One shot is Rs. 1,600 and we had to wait sometime before getting the shot as the Chief Minister’s visit was going on,” he said. Mr. Bharadwaj said the authorities should reduce the rate. Puneet Nayyar (41), who came to vaccinate his 81-year-old father, also complained of the waiting time. “We came at 11.30 a.m. and got the shot at 12.45 p.m. They should streamline the process,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/drive-through-vaccination-facility-in-dwarka-comes-in-handy-for-many/article34653850.ece
27 May 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi positivity rate dips; for third day, no free jabs for youth||Delhi reported 1,491 new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 14,21,477 on Wednesday. A total of 130 deaths were also registered in a single day, pushing the toll to 23,695. A total of 77,103 tests were also conducted and the test positivity rate (TPR) was 1.93%. The last time, the infection rate was this low was on March 27, when it was 1.7%. The TPR had reached a peak of 36% on April 22. “These are the lowest numbers in the last two months. We still need to take all precautions and follow COVID-appropriate behaviour,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain tweeted. Of the total cases, 13,78,634 people have recovered and there are 19,148 active cases. Out of the total 25,106 beds available for COVID-19 treatment, 71.2% were vacant on Wednesday. No vaccine for youth There was no free vaccination — either Covishield or Covaxin — for the 18-44 age group for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, and the only way for youth to get vaccinated is by paying in private hospitals, said AAP leader Atishi. There is also no stock of Covaxin for people above 45 years of age as well as healthcare and front-line workers, said a government bulletin. “On May 25, 43,824 vaccines were administered. Out of this, nearly 33,320 were first doses and about 10,504 were inoculated with their second dose. The repeated decline in numbers has been due to the shortage of vaccines. For those between 18 and 44 years of age, the entire vaccination programme has been temporarily halted. Moreover, around seven days ago, the numbers were as high as 1,20,000-1,40,000,” Ms. Atishi said in a statement. “Vaccination of youth is now being done only in private hospitals. One dose costs between Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,350,” she said, adding vaccines are available in the international market that are not approved by the Centre but are approved by the World Health Organization.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/positivity-rate-dips-to-19-for-third-day-no-free-jabs-for-youth/article34653851.ece
27 May 2021||Guwahati,||Assam schoolmates ‘reunite’ for COVID cause||Four batchmates of a school in western Guwahati’s Maligaon area have “reunited” for a common cause — to serve free home-cooked meals for people in quarantine or home isolation due to COVID-19 infection. Jayashree Choudhury, Ashok Sen, Basab Bhattacharjee and Amitabh Choudhury are from the 1991 batch of students of the Bengali-medium Netaji Vidyapith Railway Higher Secondary School. Work and domestic responsibilities often did not allow them to meet at a time despite all of them staying in the Pandu-Maligaon area of the city. The suffering of one of their classmates who lives in another part of the city brought them together in the second week of May. “This friend of ours and her family members were going through a difficult phase as all of them were in isolation. We decided to do something about it and that was how our group, Friends Forever came up with the idea of cooking meals and delivering them free to people in quarantine,” Jayashree Choudhury said. “It was a reunion of sorts on a daily basis to cook 50-60 meals hygienically, pack them and get them delivered to the doorsteps of people who need them,” she told The Hindu . The driver of the initiative has been her businessman husband, Abhijit Chakraborty. First-hand experience The friends knew how difficult life could be in isolation or during recovery from COVID-19. One of them, Amitabh Choudhury and members of his family, including his aged parents, had caught the novel coronavirus in 2020. The friends posted about their initiative on social media. They received 10 requests on May 12, hours after social media users shared their offer in different groups. They have so far served 800 meals, and they intend to carry on as long as people need their free service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-schoolmates-reunite-for-covid-cause/article34654109.ece

The affairs of Bodoland were under the Welfare of Plain Tribes and Backward Classes Department earlier. The announcement was made after a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The Cabinet also decided to set up a Bodoland Administrative Staff College in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of BTR, and start it immediately from a rented building if no suitable government facility is available. The Bodos are the largest plains-dwelling ethnic community in the Northeast and the focus of the Cabinet on Bodoland is believed to have been a reward for playing a role in voting the BJP back to power in Assam. Dr. Sarma said a decision was also taken to eliminate the system of seeking the Finance Department’s approval for releasing monthly stipends to beneficiaries of schemes for the old- age pension, widows and the differently-abled. “The seniormost secretary of the department concerned has been empowered to transfer cash to the accounts of the beneficiaries within the 10th of every month,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-government-creates-separate-department-for-welfare-of-btr-areas/article34654114.ece
27 May 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. Minister’s brother quits after row over appointment||Following the controversy surrounding his appointment under the Economically Weaker Sections quota, the brother of a Minister in the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has resigned from the post of Assistant Professor in a university in Siddharthnagar. Arun Kumar said on Wednesday that efforts were being made to tarnish the image of his elder brother and State Basic Education Minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi through a “baseless and offensive” allegation linking him to the appointment. ‘On merit’ Mr. Kumar was appointed as an assistant professor in the psychology department by the Siddharth University, a State university, on May 21. While the University and the Minister maintained that the appointment was made on merit and was valid, questions were raised about his securing the job under the EWS quota. Both the Minister and the University, however, have said they were ready for a probe. “There is no intervention by me in this matter. Nor do I want to say anything. It is a misfortune that he is my brother. If anyone has an objection, he can get it probed,” Mr. Dwivedi had said on May 23. Vice-chancellor Surendra Dubey said Mr. Dwivedi’s resignation had been accepted. “He has said it was due to personal reasons. It is one-line [resignation letter],... it does not mention any reasons,” Mr. Dubey told The Hindu . Mr. Kumar, announcing his resignation, said he wanted to protect the social and political honour of his brother. “Because of me I don’t want any baseless allegations to be levelled against my elder brother who is honest, diligent and has a clean political image.” Probe demanded Lucknow-based social activist Nutan Thakur said the matter did not end with the resignation. He has written to the Chief Minister demanding an “independent probe” into how the Minister’s brother secured a job under the EWS quota in the first place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-ministers-brother-quits-after-row-over-appointment/article34653846.ece
