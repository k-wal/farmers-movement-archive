04 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam abuzz over choice of next CM||Election won, the buzz in the Bharatiya Janata Party camp in Assam is now around the next Chief Minister. The BJP did not project anyone as itscandidate for CM this time unlike in 2016 when the party’s campaign revolved around the “happiness” that Sarbananda Sonowal would ensure. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to party national president Jagat Prasad Nadda, everyone had in the election rallies, made a conscious effort to give equal importance to Mr. Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, seen as the chief architect of the two consecutive electoral victories for BJP and its allies. A day after the saffron camp secured a majority with 75 seats in the 126-member House, leaders of BJP and its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) have been indirectly rooting for Dr. Sarma. “The people of Assam have given us a chance to serve them once again. We need a dynamic and efficient leader as the Chief Minister to live up to the expectations of the people,” UPPL president Pramod Boro said on Monday. AGP president Atul Bora said choosing the Chief Minister should be best left to the BJP’s central leadership. Tuliram Ronghang, the chief executive member of the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council, minced no words. “The MLAs from the hill districts would like to see Dr. Sarma as the next CM. But it is up to the BJP to decide,” he told journalists. Dr. Sarma was instrumental in dropping four of the five BJP legislators from the hill districts of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The party swept the hill constituencies. Mr. Sonowal and Dr. Sarma chose not to comment on who would be in the hot seat. “The ball is in the court of our central leadership,” the latter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assam-abuzz-over-choice-of-next-cm/article34476102.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||TRS continues its sway in the ULB elections||The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi continued its sway in the electoral politics in the State in its second term in office. The party has obviously fine-tuned its poll strategies after the bypoll of Dubbak Assembly constituency and the election to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls, where the TRS could not achieve expected results. The reorientation of the strategies by the party president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao yielded rich dividends as the party continued its victory march in the elections held for two municipal corporations and municipalities – Siddpet, Nakrekal, Atchampet, Jadcherla and Kothur. TRS has secured majority in all the urban local bodies that went to polls, securing over 70 per cent votes in all the ULBs. Of around 250 wards in two municipal corporations and few municipalities that went to polls on April 30, the TRS won in as many as 181 wards in addition to the three wards won by the CPI in the Khammam Municipal Corporation. Counting in the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation continued till late in the evening amidst indications that the TRS established clear leads in more than 80 per cent of the wards that went to polls. The same is the case with Khammam Municipal Corporation where a majority of the TRS candidates have established unassailable leads over their rivals. In an important development, the BJP won one seat and Congress won nine seats in Khammam out of the 60 plus seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/trs-continues-its-sway-in-the-ulb-elections/article34476469.ece
04 May 2021||Mysuru,||23 COVID-19 patients die in Karnataka hospital||As many as 23 COVID-19 patients died at the district hospital in Chamarajanagar near Mysuru in Karnataka between Sunday night and Monday morning, with relatives alleging that the deaths were caused by lack of oxygen. One more death was reported from Kamagere in the same district. However, soon after the incident, State government and district administration went into damage control mode, refuting the allegations. The State government has ordered an inquiry by KSRTC managing director Shivayogi Kalasad, who is to submit a report within three days. Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar claimed that there were “discrepancies” in three of the 23 deaths and the inquiry would bring out the truth. Contrary to the Minister’s claim, locals and relatives of the deceased said patients on ventilators choked to death as the medical facility ran out of oxygen around midnight. Efforts at the late hour to replenish supply came too late to save the patients on the life support systems, they said. The district entirely depends on Mysuru for oxygen and supply from there has not been steady, sources said. The sudden surge from an average of 8 to 10 deaths per day to 24 in the district (including 23 in Chamarajanagar district hospital alone), has created a scare among people. However, Dr. Sudhakar, who reached Chamarajanagar on Monday afternoon said as per his information 14 patients were on ventilator, 36 on non-invasive ventilator, 58 on high-flow oxygen, and 29 patients on normal oxygen of up to 10 litres per minute. Dr. Sudhkar said the timeline indicated that 14 patients had died between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Sunday, three patients died between midnight and 3 a.m. on Monday and seven more patients died between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. When questioned whether he was indicating that there was no oxygen scarcity or that the deaths had nothing to do with it, the Minister said he would not elaborate as an inquiry had already been ordered. Earlier in the day Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who is in charge of Chamarajanagar district, had aired similar views, saying that “not all deaths” were due to oxygen shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/23-covid-19-patients-die-in-karnataka-hospital/article34475937.ece
04 May 2021||Chennai,||Local issues crucial to voters across States: survey||The “local” was of utmost importance in the decision-making of voters in the Assembly elections, according to a special post-poll survey conducted by the Lokniti-CSDS for The Hindu.  Each of the surveyed States had specific local variables that swayed and determined the choices of the respondents. Clearly, the voters were determining their electoral choice for State and national elections distinctly. As to the question whether any particular national issue made an impact at all, the surveyors found that one issue was particularly resonant across States — the Citizenship Amendment Act. In all four States, the opposition to the CAA was higher than support for it. Beginning today and over this week, The Hindu will publish a series of articles explaining the verdicts in the four States — West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam — and the Union Territory of Puducherry that went to the polls in March-April 2021. The team which led this study included Sanjay Kumar, former Director, CSDS and Co-Director, Lokniti; Suhas Palshikar, Co-Director, Lokniti; and Sandeep Shastri, National Coordinator, Lokniti.  Key issues These data-based articles will detail the key issues that mattered to the electorate, the specificities in each of the States (and Union Territory) that had a bearing on the results, and what were the variables that determined the survey respondents’ choices. The articles will also be carried along with a methodological note on how the survey was conducted, the sample size for each State and the method used to weight responses based on the composition of the voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/local-issues-crucial-to-voters-across-states-survey/article34475940.ece
04 May 2021||KALABURAGI,||Two COVID-19 patients die in Kalaburagi||As health facilities across Kalaburagi, particularly those in the private sector, started falling short of medical oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients, six patients, five COVID-19 patients and one suspected to have contracted COVID-19, died in the last 24 hours. The cause of two of these deaths was said to be oxygen scarcity. As per information provided by sources in the Health Department, two COVID-19 patients, a man and a woman, died at Anand Hospital in Kalaburagi on Monday due to oxygen shortage. Hospital’s Managing Director Anand also said that dearth of oxygen was the cause of death. Four more patients died at Aland Taluk Hospital, three COVID-19-infected women late on Sunday night and one suspected to have had COVID-19 on Monday morning. The hospital authorities cited health complexities as the cause of deaths. People who rushed a patient suffering from breathlessness to the District General Hospital attached to Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) were found waiting with the wheelchair-bound patient outside the hospital. The relatives of the 53-year old patient from Bhimabal village in Kamalapur taluk ran from pillar to post visiting every hospital desperately searching for a bed before reaching GIMS. The patient’s brother was seen crying for help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-covid-19-patients-die-in-kalaburagi/article34476045.ece
04 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Newly elected DMK MLAs to meet today||The newly elected DMK MLAs will meet at Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters, on May 4 to elect M.K. Stalin as the leader of the DMK legislature party. Party general secretary Duraimurugan has directed the MLAs to attend the meeting without fail. After the meeting, the DMK will intimate Governor Banwarilal Purohit of the election of the legislature party leader. Subsequently, the Governor will invite Mr. Stalin to form a government, and the DMK has to present a list of Ministers-designate. The swearing-in ceremony is likely to be held on May 7. Mr. Stalin has already said the event will be held in a modest way at the Raj Bhavan in view of the second wave of COVID-19. Talking to reporters after paying his respects at the memorial of his father M. Karunandhi on Sunday night, he said the DMK government would dedicate itself to fulfilling the promises made in the election manifesto. “We will also implement the 10-year vision statement released by me,” he said. AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami resigned as Chief Minister and extended his wishes to Mr. Stalin. “I extend my wishes to Mr. Stalin, who is set to take over as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Palaniswami wrote in Tamil on Twitter, tagging Mr. Stalin’s handle. Thanking him for the wishes, Mr. Stalin requested Mr. Palaniswami for cooperation. “Your suggestions and cooperation are necessary to make Tamil Nadu great. Democracy is both ruling and Opposition parties. Let’s protect such a democracy,” he said.

04 May 2021||Bengaluru,||Many city hospitals stop admitting COVID-19 patients||Oxygen shortage, which has been a major issue ever since the second wave of COVID-19 set in, continued to hit patients in the city with several hospitals asking them to shift to other facilities as they ran out of stock. Many hospitals, except the corporate chain facilities, said they had stopped admitting COVID-19 patients even if they had beds as they do not have oxygen supply. On Monday, at least 30 patients at Medax Hospital in Sultanpalya were asked to shift out as the hospital ran out of oxygen. The hospital’s medical director, Srihari R. Shapur, gave in writing to the relatives of the 30 patients, seven of whom were in the ICU, to arrange for beds in other hospitals as the oxygen stock there was just enough to last till 5 p.m. on the day. ‘A horrible situation’ There was chaos near the hospital with the patients’ relatives scrambling to ensure their dear ones got life support. Dr. Shapur told TheHindu , “We discharged five of the patients, including two from the ICU, after they made arrangements elsewhere. We are still waiting for stocks. It is a horrible situation.” Soon after the shocking news of the Chamarajanagar deaths started pouring in, several hospitals in Bengaluru flagged the oxygen shortage issue with the government. Rajarajeshwari Medical College hospital on Mysuru Road, which had 200 patients on oxygen, said the hospital is running out of oxygen by 5 p.m. on Monday. The issue was resolved only by 8 p.m. when oxygen on the way to another hospital was diverted there. Doctors at Supra Multispeciality Hospital in J.P. Nagar, which is also facing a similar situation, said the hospital had only three cylinders left for 35 patients. “Although we had been assured of supply in the afternoon itself, we are still waiting for stocks. We did not admit new COVID-19 patients on Monday and will continue to do so till we have enough stocks,” said Vinay B.G., who runs the hospital. It was a similar situation at Chaitanya Medical Centre in Yelahanka New Town and several other such smaller facilities.  Prasanna H.M., president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association, attributed the problem to logistical issues in the supply chain. “Quantity is not an issue, but the problem lies in the supply chain. With very few supply tankers, the vendors are unable to visit the hospitals two or three times a day for refilling,” he said. “If the available quantity is utilised properly and the supply chain upgraded, the problem can be resolved. What we need now is uninterrupted supply of liquid oxygen to the suppliers and from them to the hospitals,” Dr. Prasanna added. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said most of the smaller hospitals run on cylinders that require frequent refilling. “The vendors are finding it difficult to visit the hospitals for refilling several times a day. We are trying to address the issue.”  Quantity is not an issue, but the problem lies in the supply chain. With very few supply tankers, the vendors are unable to visit the hospitals two or three times a day for refilling Prasanna H.M., president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/many-city-hospitals-stop-admitting-covid-19-patients/article34476408.ece
04 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||CM meets Governor, tenders resignation||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday submitted the resignation of the Council of Ministers to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan. Mr. Vijayan, who arrived from Dharmadam, presided over the last Cabinet meeting. Later, he called on the Governor and tendered his resignation. A Raj Bhavan communiqué said the Governor had accepted the resignation and asked Mr. Vijayan to continue in office. The 14th Kerala Legislature Assembly was also dissolved by the Governor, official sources said. New Ministry The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) had swept the elections to the 140 seats by bagging 99 seats. Steps to form a new ministry will begin with the CPI(M) State secretariat meeting at the AKG Centre on Tuesday. The meeting will decide on the number of ministers for each coalition partners. This will be followed by a meeting of the LDF to decide on Ministers, portfolios and other formalities. The meeting to select the LDF’s parliamentary party leader is likely to be held online as the risk of asking the newly elected legislators to reach the capital can be avoided in view of the prevailing situation. Official sources said the General Administration Department and the Public Works Department had been alerted to make arrangements for the swearing in ceremony. Raj Bhavan hall will be the venue for the swearing in on account of the curbs due to the second wave of pandemic. After the swearing in, the first Cabinet will request the Governor to convene the 15th Kerala Legislative Assembly. First session The first session of the Assembly will be held in May by following COVID-19 protocol and the Legislature Secretariat had initiated steps for it, sources said. Before the House meets, the Governor will administer the oath of office to the Pro term Speaker at the Raj Bhavan. The Pro tem Speaker will chair the proceedings of the first session when each of the other 140 elected members of the House take oath as legislators. The Pro term Speaker will also oversee the formal anointment of the new Speaker of the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-meets-governor-tenders-resignation/article34476071.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||COVID-19 testing centres in Delhi turning away people||Getting a free test for COVID-19 continues to be a challenge in Delhi as the government-run centres are accepting only a limited number of people. At the testing centre in Nehru Homoeopathic Medical College in Defence Colony, the entry gate was found closed at 1 p.m. on Monday. “We take only 50 people a day. You will have to come around 5-6 a.m. tomorrow and stand in line. If your number does not come, then you will have to return another day,” an official at the government-run testing centre said. Testing is free at all government centres. Many people who came for testing at 1 p.m. were turned away. “When we come for work at 9 a.m., there is already a serpentine queue. We count and take a set number of people and close the gate again. The situation was not like this always, but it has changed in the past one month,” said a hospital security official. The situation was similar at a government testing centre in Begumpur. It tests only 100 people a day. Many who came for testing at 2 p.m. were asked to come the next day. Anuj, who had gone to an Aam Aadmi Polyclinic in Karkardooma last week to get his brother tested, said: “We reached at 10 a.m., but they said they will take only 40 samples and that all slots are already full. They asked us to come the next day.” ‘Low footfall’ The total number of daily tests being conducted in the city for the past 10-15 days has been in the range of 70,000-80,000. In early April, over 1 lakh tests were being done daily. Despite this, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said last week that the government had not reduced testing. “The Delhi government has not reduced its testing strategy. In the face of the lockdown, public movement has substantially dropped and footfall has decreased in dispensaries and hospitals. It is only because of the reduced footfall that tests have slightly decreased but otherwise tests are being conducted in large numbers,” he had said. Some private facilities are carrying out COVID-19 testing round the clock and some even offer home collection of samples, but it is not free. On April 24, The Hindu had reported about people waiting outside government-run testing centres from as early as 4 a.m. in some parts of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-testing-centres-in-delhi-turning-away-people/article34476224.ece
04 May 2021||GUNTUR,||Partial curfew to be imposed in State from tomorrow||The State government has decided to impose a partial curfew for 14 days starting from Wednesday. Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy took the decision at a review meeting at his camp office on Monday. All the shops shall be open only from 6 a.m. to 12 noon with the Section 144 in force. Only emergency services will be allowed from thereon. The decision was taken in view of the spike in infections and to ensure that economic activity was not hit. The Chief Minister asked the officials to identify the primary contacts of infected persons at the earliest and to see that there was no shortage of doctors and para-medical personnel in the government empanelled hospitals. Mr. Jagan directed that all hospitals should have enough oxygen supplies, in worse cases he told the authorities to import oxygen and make arrangements to store it, stating that no hospital should report oxygen shortage. The officials informed that so far, 1.66 crore tests had been conducted across the State at an average rate of 3.10 lakh tests per month. There were currently 558 COVID hospitals, with 44,599 beds, of which 37,760 were occupied with COVID patients. Besides these, around 3,597 patients were being treated on ventilators, and 1,01,204 were in home isolation. As on date, there were 41,780 beds in 81 COVID Care Centers (CCCs), of which 9,937 patients had received treatment till May 2. Also, nearly 31,843 beds were still available at CCC’s, said the officials. Oxygen facilities The officials said oxygen facilities were available in 146 hospitals and there were 26,446 beds with an oxygen pipeline in those hospitals. They said 420 to 500 metric tonnes of oxygen was being used on an average daily and it was estimated that the usage may increase by the end of the second week of May. While 480 tonnes of oxygen was allotted for Andhra Pradesh, only 448 tonnes (including government and private hospitals) was being used due to lack of tankers for transportation of oxygen, the officials said. The officials said they had urged the Centre to increase supply of oxygen to the State, and added that they had requested to supply 200 metric tonnes of oxygen each from Perambadur (Tamil Nadu) and Ballari (Karnataka) and to provide tankers for transportation. The officials said eight lakh Remdesivir injections were ordered from Mylan lab and added that 5.6 lakh N-95 masks,7.76 lakh PPE kits, 35.46 lakh surgical masks, 2,04960 isolation kits were available. The officials said the first dose of vaccine was administered to 52 lakh people above 45 years, and 1.33 crore people were yet to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-to-impose-partial-curfew-from-tomorrow/article34475895.ece
04 May 2021||MANGALURU,||Appointments for vaccination cancelled in twin districts||The Health Department in Dakshina Kannada has begun cancelling appointments of those aged 45 and above who have booked online for their first dose of vaccination. The department is now sending messages cancelling the bookings to the mobile phones of such people. It is because there is shortage in the supply of vaccines. And, in Udupi, the District Hospital in Ajjarakadu and the Community Health Centre at Brahmavar have displayed information that there will be no vaccination on Tuesday, also due to short supply. Dakshina Kannada District Nodal Officer for Vaccines B.V. Rajesh said that short messages cancelling appointments are being sent to avoid crowding at the health centres. “We do not want people to return disappointed after visiting the centre. When fresh stock arrives, we will intimate those slated for the second dose as they will get preference over those receiving the first dose,” he said. While 70% of the fresh stock will be used for those slated for second dose, 30% will be used for those getting the first dose. As private health establishments are yet to receive stock from the manufacturers, they have also been told to cancel vaccination sessions and inform people of it, he added. Dr. Rajesh said that with 1,058 persons receiving the vaccine on Monday, 1,480 doses of Covishield vaccine were in stock at government health facilities in the district for Tuesday. They are expecting fresh stock of vaccine by Tuesday evening. With 2,780 persons receiving the vaccine in Udupi on Monday, only around 500 doses remained for Tuesday. The Udupi district administration too has decided to give preference to vaccinate those slated for the second dose. Among those who are waiting for the second dose include those who have already completed eight weeks since taking the first dose, an official said. Vaccine supply for Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Chikkamagaluru districts will come to the District Vaccine Store in Mangaluru from where the vials will be sent to Udupi and Chikkamagaluru districts. A total of 3,52,892 persons have been given the vaccine in Dakshina Kannada so far. On Monday 423 were administered the vaccine at the Government Wenlock Hospital, 149 at the Sullia Taluk Hospital and 57 at the Amblamogaru Primary Health Centre (PHC). As many as 2,58,611 persons have been given the vaccine in Udupi district till Monday. While 279 persons received it at Kundapur General Hospital, 212 received it at the Udupi District Hospital. And, as many as 166 were administered the vaccine at the Karkala Taluk Hospital, 100 at Kokkarne PHC, 88 at Byndoor Community Health Centre (CHC), 87 at Manipura PHC, 84 at Udupi UPHC, 71 each at Kaup and Kukkundoor PHCs, 63 at Karje PHC, 61 at Kollur PHC, 55 each at Hebri CHC, Padubidri and Belman PHCs, 53 at Manipal UPHC and 51 received the vaccine at Shirva CHC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/appointments-for-vaccination-cancelled-in-twin-districts/article34476571.ece
04 May 2021||MYSURU,||As cases surge, these coaches remain unused||The current protocol advising home isolation for those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 and the demand for oxygenated beds and ventilators has ensured that the isolation coaches made ready by the Railways remain unused as of now. There are nearly 320 isolation coaches ready for deployment anywhere in the jurisdiction of the South Western Railways but so far they have not been utilized despite the surge in COVID-19 cases. The Railways’ authorities have been directed to remain in a state of ‘full preparedness’ to handle patients at short notice. Consequently, the Mysuru Division of the South Western Railway will conduct interviews to recruit eligible doctors, nurses and pharmacists on a contract basis for the COVID-19 Isolation Ward and the Railway Hospital in Mysuru and for the Isolation Coaches. (Candidates may call 0821-2428630.)  Walk-in interview The walk-in interview is scheduled to be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesday at the DRM’s office in Mysuru and the authorities intend to appoint 14 doctors, 20 nurses and 2 pharmacists for COVID-19 duties. Though the conventional coaches of the Railways were modified last year to function as isolation wards where patients could be quarantined, they were not deployed. The coaches were modified by removing the middle berths and ladders for greater comfort and to create additional space; providing holders in each compartment for holding medical equipment as well as water bottles, etc. Each can accommodate 16 to 18 patients at a time. A senior official in the district administration said the effort is commendable but the issue in the second wave is not of isolating or ensuring quarantine. “There is a surge in demand for oxygenated beds and ventilators and hence the isolation coaches of the Railways have remained unused,” he said. Even hospital admission is being carefully regulated and only serious cases requiring monitoring are being given preference. Doctors aver that in almost 90% of the cases, isolation will suffice for which there were plenty of options and facilities have been created by the district administrations. This ranges from tie-ups with hotels or converting hostels or vacant buildings into COVID-19 Care Centres, etc., and could be reasons why the isolation coaches are going underutilized.  But senior railway officials said cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi or Belagavi may not require isolation coaches given the facilities they may have. However, the idea behind the coaches is to deploy them in wayside stations where there are hardly any facilities or options for quarantining. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms could be shifted to isolation coaches which will also reduce the burden on district centres, the officials added. Though hardly deployed anywhere in the country last year, they are in use in certain States given the surge. Hence, the railway staff in SWR have been directed to remain prepared so that they could be deployed at short notice, if the need arises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-cases-surge-these-coaches-remain-unused/article34476173.ece
04 May 2021||ANANTAPUR,||Three die as hospital ‘runs out’ of oxygen||Three persons died on Monday allegedly due to lack of oxygen when the tank at Hindupur Government Hospital ran out of stock. The patients’ kin raised a hue and cry on the hospital premises, when there was none to make alternative arrangements to connect the bulk oxygen cylinders. Upon information, Hindupur police CI Bala Maddileti, along with his staff, brought the situation under control. “The oxygen supply suddenly stopped at 5.40 a.m. and there was no one to connect the bulk cylinders. We had to get the cylinders and connect them ourselves. In this interregnum, three patients died,” the attendants alleged. Oxygen Nodal Officer R. Jagannath Singh said they had made arrangements for oxygen supply with 140 bulk cylinders that were connected to the grid. “We knew that there was a shortage as only 1.4 KL of oxygen was available in the 6-KL tank last night. We have a monitoring team at the hospital and they are taking care of it,” he said. Another bulk container arrived at 8 a.m. and has filled the 6-KL tank , he added. “The patients’ SPO2 saturation levels were low for the past two days and it was due to those complications that they died, not due to lack of oxygen supply,” claimed Hospital Superintendent Prabhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3-die-as-oxygen-runs-out-at-hindupur-hospital/article34475930.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cannot stop reports on court observations: SC||Media cannot be stopped from reporting oral remarks made by judges during a court hearing. The honest and full reportage of these comments give the public an insight into whether judges are genuinely applying their minds to resolve their crisis, the Supreme Court told a “hurt” Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday. The ECI had complained to the Supreme Court about certain oral comments made by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court. The HC judges had accused the ECI of being solely responsible for the super-spread of COVID infection through uncontrolled election rallies, campaigning, etc. Instead of patting the EC officials on their backs, the HC judges had said the ECI should be charged with “murder”. Soon after, a troubled ECI had approached the HC to take back its words and restrain the media from reporting the comments as FIRs for murder were registered against the poll body officials. But the HC, on April 30, refused to budge, saying there were more pressing issues at hand. “We cannot expect the media not to report dialogues. Oral observations are as important as orders... Unfolding of process of judicial thinking is equally of interest to the public,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud addressed the ECI, represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi. “We don’t want to demoralise the HCs. They are vital pillars of the judicial process... HC judges are doing tremendous work, burning the midnight oil, they are overwhelmed. They know what’s happening on the ground. It is bound to affect your psyche,” Justice Chandrachud said. Justice Shah said the ECI should take oral observations of judges in the right spirit. Judges do not follow a prepared script during a hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cannot-stop-reports-on-court-remarks-sc/article34475982.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||No GST on imports of vaccine, medical oxygen||Imports of COVID-19 relief material, including vaccines, medical oxygen and Remdesivir vials, will get a conditional ‘ad-hoc’ Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemption till June 30, the Finance Ministry said on Monday. These items are already exempt from customs duty and health cess; now integrated GST (IGST), levied on such imports, will be withdrawn for two months for ‘relief materials being donated from abroad’. The exemption won’t be available for domestic companies or charities importing these items if they are purchasing them, even if for free distribution in the country, officials clarified. The relevant notification specifies that the relaxation is for COVID-19 material ‘received free of cost for free distribution anywhere in India for COVID relief’. Nodal officers State chief secretaries were told to appoint nodal officers so that ‘entities desirous of importing COVID relief material for free distribution may approach them for certification’. Global donors would need to register with individual States where they wish to route relief. Goods already imported but pending clearance from Customs as of Monday, will also be covered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-gst-on-imports-of-vaccine-medical-oxygen/article34475941.ece

The Centre must call all Opposition parties for a discussion and to form a strategy to fight out the pandemic. “He [Narendra Modi] can no longer handle the situation on his own,” he said. The NCP has also sought permission from the Centre to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from global market. “The Centre had controlled the supply of vaccines for those above 45 years, but for those from 18 to 45 the responsibility is on the States. Considering the vaccine shortage, we should be allowed to purchase from global market to complete vaccination in six months,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/it-is-time-to-impose-health-emergency-ncp/article34476588.ece

The work on the project has continued despite the second week of lockdown in the Capital that has brought most construction sites to a grinding halt.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Why no recount, asks Mamata||Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Monday said her party will approach the court on the Nandigram election results. Speaking to presspersons outside her residence, Ms. Banerjee claimed that the Returning Officer for Nandigram did not order a recount of votes as he feared for his life. While Ms. Banerjee lost from Nandigram, Trinamool won 213 of the 292 seats that went to the polls in West Bengal. “Everywhere there is one result; at one place it is different. Where did the 8,000 votes lead disappear? Then suddenly the server went slow for four hours, and then there was load shedding for 40 minutes. They have changed many things, including machines,” Ms Banerjee alleged. She raised questions on why the Election Commission refused a recounting of votes. “Anyone can demand recounting of votes. What stake has the Election Commission to deny re-counting,” Ms. Banerjee asked. ‘Life under threat’ Ms. Banerjee also shared a purported message that the Returning Officer allegedly sent to an acquaintance, stating that his life was under threat. “Look at the situation — the RO says there is a threat to his life if he orders a re-counting,” she said, as she asked a journalist to read it out. “Sir, it is not in my purview. Sir, Plz save me. My family will be ruined. I have no other option, but to commit suicide. Life threat is coming. I may be murdered. I had nothing to do. Plz forgive me. I have little daughter,” the purported message read. Nandigram which witnessed the most high-profile campaign, kept both the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party on the tenterhooks till late on Sunday evening . After the end of 17 rounds of counting, the Commission announced that the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari had defeated Ms. Banerjee by a margin of 1,956 votes. A total of 1,10,764 votes were polled in the favour of Mr. Adhikari, while Ms. Banerjee got 1,08,808 votes. Trinamool supporters continued to stage protests outside the counting centre in Purba Medinipur district. Ms. Banerjee said the protests would be lifted only after the Commission ensured that the electronic voting machines used for polling in Nandigram were properly preserved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-no-recount-asks-mamata/article34475876.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||ICMR to get royalty from sale of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin||The intellectual property governing the use of Covaxin, jointly developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research, was “shared” and the ICMR would receive royalty payments, the organisation confirmed to The Hindu . “The Public-Private Partnership was executed under a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the ICMR and the BBIL which includes a royalty clause for the ICMR on net sales and other clauses like prioritisation of in-country supplies. The product IP is shared. It is also agreed that the name of ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) will be printed on the vaccine boxes. The same is being done now,” ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava said in an email. However he did not say how much money was spent. The partnership between the two organisations involves 12 activities that include clinical and preclinical studies. Five of these were funded entirely by Bharat Biotech: Candidate vaccine development, preclinical safety and toxicity studies in small animals (rats, mice and rabbits), phase-1 clinical trials including funding of sites, hiring Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) for trial monitoring, insurance, laboratory testing; phase 2 clinical trials including funding of sites, hiring CRO for trial monitoring, insurance, laboratory testing and all other logistics and hiring a CRO for phase-3 trial monitoring, insurance and laboratory testing. The activities funded by the ICMR were: isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from a “huge number” of clinical samples, passage testing and confirmation; BSL-3 facility validation of BBIL for Covaxin production; vaccine strain characterisation by ELISA tests, electron microscopy, next generation sequencing; testing serum samples from preclinical studies in small animals; preclinical safety and efficacy in golden Syrian hamsters and preclinical safety and efficacy studies in rhesus macaques (monkeys); testing sera of Covaxin vaccinated individuals for U.K. strain, Brazil strain, South African strain and double mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2; U.K. variant virus isolation and characterisation, titration, sequencing from clinical specimens and funding the site for the phase 3 clinical trial. Vaccine pricing Covishield constitutes over 90% of the country’s vaccine supply so far and has been developed as partnership between the Oxford University and AzstraZeneca. Serum Institute of India is one among the many manufacturers in the world with a production licence and has to pay royalty to a foreign company. Covaxin on the other hand is almost entirely indigenous and yet is priced higher than Covishield. Both are so far being bought by the Central government for Rs. 150 a dose. However, Covishield was first offered to States at Rs. 400 a dose and Rs. 600 to private hospitals and Covaxin was offered at Rs. 600 for State governments and at Rs. 1,200 for private hospitals. Later Covishield’s price was reduced to Rs. 300 a dose for States and Covaxin reduced theirs to Rs. 400.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/icmr-to-get-royalty-from-sale-of-bharat-biotechs-covaxin/article34475887.ece
04 May 2021||Kolkata,||Six deaths in post-poll violence in Bengal: BJP||The West Bengal BJP leadership on Monday alleged that party supporters were being targeted after the results of the Assembly polls were announced. Party’s State president Dilip Ghosh said six persons, including five party supporters, have been killed in the past 24 hours. “If is most unfortunate that a time when the COVID-19 crisis is at its peak, there is post election violence in the State. Not even 24 hours have passed, and five persons have been killed and thousands of shops and houses vandalised,” he said. Reports of post poll violence were coming both from north and south Bengal and almost from every constituency, he alleged. The BJP would bring the issue to the notice of the State government, the Election Commission of India and other stakeholders. “Violence is being perpetrated in front of police. Thousands of our supporters are turning homeless,” he said. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar raised concern about the situation. He said he had directed officials to submit a report on post poll violence and vandalism. He summoned the Director General of Police, the Kolkata Police Commissioner and the Additional Chief Secretary, Home, on the issue. “ACS Home @HomeBengal who was called by me in wake of rising post poll violence in State has been directed to submit report on post poll violence and vandalism in State & steps taken. He has been urged to take all possible measures to ensure accountability of officials concerned,” Mr. Dhankhar said. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee urged her supporters not to indulge in any violence. One of her party supporters was killed in Bardhaman, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/six-deaths-in-post-poll-violence-in-bengal-bjp/article34475864.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘This is Mamata’s victory over Modi’||A day after the Trinamool Congress’s emphatic victory in West Bengal, senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member Derek O’ Brien attributed the win to 10 years of people-centred governance by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, even as he alleged that rules were bent to favour the BJP.    Many congratulations for Trinamool’s victory. What were the factors that worked in your favour? Thank you! It has only been 12 to 14 hours since the results came in. I haven’t sat down to analyse it. But I would say that Trinamool and our captain Mamata Banerjee’s proposition to the people of Bengal was widely accepted. And what did we say? Judge us on what we have done in the past 10 years, on how many lives we touched. And then look at the other side, at all the unkept promises made in the past six or seven years, all bluster and lies. Every BJP hoarding, pamphlet, television advertisement had Narendra Modi’s face plastered. People have rejected Narendra Modi. This is Mamata Banerjee’s victory over Modi and Amit Shah.  In the last three phases of the Assembly election, which coincided with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a jump in Trinamool’s performance. Do you see a connection between the two? No. Look at the results carefully, Trinamool thrashed the BJP across all the phases. Nearly, all the BJP MPs who thought they could saunter in to contest the Assembly poll here, lost. The Union Minister lost by a margin of 50,000 votes. Also please understand, the Election Commission of India planned the polling schedule, dividing it into eight phases, to help the BJP build a momentum by the time the election reached Trinamool strongholds. The EC did not even care about the pandemic. They bent the rules to suit the BJP. For example, till now the booth agent had to be a resident of the area. Instead, because the BJP didn’t have an organisation, they relaxed the rule allowing anyone to become a booth agent irrespective of their address. They posted Central forces who spoke in Hindi and could not communicate in Bangla. They changed key police officers as per their whims. The EC officials worked like stenographers of the BJP.  The Trinamool has alleged that the EC worked with a bias for the BJP in the election. Now that you have won, what do you plan to do about it? No, no. EC did not work in a biased manner. The EC is a department of the BJP! Bias is too mild a word for them. All the political parties need to look at this and we need to protect this institution. We cannot have three retired officers to run the elections in this manner. We will get all the parties together demanding reforms in the functioning of EC. We need to do this for our democracy. The current situation can’t be allowed to prevail, it is very dangerous for our Republic.  With Trinamool’s victory in Bengal, DMK’s victory in Tamil Nadu super-imposed against the recent electoral reverses that the Congress has had in Bihar, Bengal, Kerala and Assam, one is forced to ask can it continue to lead the Opposition? What the Congress needs to do is up to them. I am not in a position to give them advice. Our first priority, as I said earlier, is to focus on how to tackle COVID in Bengal. Our next priority is to rebuild our team both at the organisation level and in government.  Let me reframe the question. Is Mamata Banerjee going to be the pivot of Opposition unity? We are not putting up our hand like that. We want the other Opposition parties to believe that if you do good work over a period of time and you have the self-belief, Modi-Shah’s BJP can be defeated. They are not invincible. In fact, I will also say that this is a bigger victory than the 2011 one. In 2011, Trinamool unseated a government that had been in power for 34 years. So the anti-incumbency against the Left government also worked in our favour. In this election we defended our ground and our 10 years of governance. And our vote percentage has only gone up. But having said all this, let me also add Mamata Banerjee was the first leader to call out demonetisation. She said yes to GST, but pointed out right at the outset that the implementation was all wrong. She has credibility and consistency. We are a national party which is strong in one region.  What are the national implications of these elections? A friend sent me a message two months ago which aptly sums up the implication of these results. He wrote, “Go, win this for ‘yourselves’.

04 May 2021||New Delhi,||BJP’s image dented: Chidambaram||The Narendra Modi government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has dented the image of the BJP as a party that is fit to run a Central government and impacted the Assembly poll result, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said in an interview to The Hindu on Monday. He said the Opposition and the regional parties managing to defeat the BJP in three of the four States can be the starting point for them to come together to take on it at the national level. Talking about the Congress’s performance in the Assembly polls, the veteran leader said the issue was not so much about leadership as it was about addressing the organisational weaknesses, something that the group of 23 (G-23) letter writers had pointed out to party chief Sonia Gandhi. “What is lacking is organisation. The leadership, as we have it, must get down to address the nuts and bolts of organisation.” He also suggested that national parties like the Congress should reinvent themselves by empowering State level leaders in terms of decision making and claimed that the BJP, that currently centralises decision making, too will pay a price for adopting a top heavy approach. “Well, I can’t really pinpoint the reason why West Bengal election results turned out the way they are but I know that travelling the length and breadth of Tamil Nadu and being in close touch with the people over the last five months in preparation for elections, the pandemic and the sharp deterioration in the last two months has completely dented the image of the BJP as a doer, as fit and proper to run a Central government,” he said. “The BJP was always suspect in the minds of the Tamil people, but then the image that they had built as a doer and Modi Hain toh Mumkin Hain [It’s possible to do with Mr. Modi] has been exploded. He and his Ministers have proved themselves to be completely incompetent. So that played a major part in Tamil Nadu and I assume that would have been a major factor in Bengal, especially in the last five rounds which took place after the surge.” He said Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress defeating the BJP, the DMK-led alliance winning in Tamil Nadu and the Left Democratic Front winning in Kerala have proven that the BJP’s juggernaut can be stopped. “As for national politics, this is not yet a turning point but could be the beginning of a turning point. If the 13 Opposition parties who issued a statement on Sunday on the corona situation understand the nature of India’s polity today and adjust with each other, they can present a formidable non-BJP front, that’s perfectly possible, perfectly doable and I hope it will happen,” he said. On whether the results, especially the decimation of the Left and the Congress in Bengal, convey that old style of doing politics has changed, he said, “I have held the view for long that national parties must reinvent themselves to have their State parties closer to the people. Why do regional parties win? Because they are much closer to the people and the buck stops at the level of this State leader. There’s nobody in Delhi to kick the ball to.”  (Scan QR code to watch the full interview)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjps-image-dented-chidambaram/article34475867.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Satisfied with Bengal result: Vijayvargiya||A day after the Trinamool Congress won the election in West Bengal, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said he was “personally satisfied” with the party’s tally that had gone up to 76 from three in the previous election. He accused the Trinamool of wreaking violence on BJP workers in several parts of the State. “There is anarchy and our people are being attacked and five of them were killed. Some were even chased out of polling centres during the counting,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Vijayvargiya, the party in-charge of West Bengal, attributed many reasons for its loss in the State. He asserted that the most important one seemed to be “the surrender of the Congress and the Communist Party of India”, especially after the letter by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar just before the polls announcing the support of many Opposition parties to Trinamool. “The heart went out of the Congress and the CPI(M) campaigns after that, with even Rahul Gandhi keeping away, albeit stating that it was due to the COVID-19 second wave. This led to a direct transfer of at least 9% vote from these parties to the Trinamool Congress,” he said, a reference to a huge minority consolidation behind Trinamool, which swept in the Congress and Left strongholds as well. He admitted that Ms. Banerjee got much sympathy and support from women, but said this was more because of her campaign on a wheelchair than speeches by Prime Minister Modi. “She did get sympathy from women for campaigning from a wheelchair which, by the way, she abandoned yesterday evening after winning the polls,” he said. Close contest Mr. Vijayvargiya insisted that in “at least 65 seats” there was a close contest between the BJP and Trinamool candidates, when asked on whether an overdependence on Trinamool turncoats queered the pitch for the BJP. Many Trinamool turncoats, even former Ministers in the Mamata Banerjee government, lost this time. “I am personally satisfied by the performance of the party. With the Congress and Left not having a single MLA, the BJP, with 76 MLAs, will be the official party of Opposition in the House and we will occupy a big space of oppositional politics in the State. We promise to be a constructive Opposition. But the Trinamool should restrain its cadre from killing and wounding our people. Even the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) office in Kolkata has been vandalised, let alone some of our offices in the interiors,” he said. The BJP, he stated, would do a detailed “ sameeksha ” (review) of the reasons for the loss. But now, the immediate issue was the security of the party cadre, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/satisfied-with-result-vijayvargiya/article34475871.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP begins consultation on next Assam Chief Minister||The BJP on Monday indicated that central observers may be sent to Assam in a day or two even as internal consultation on how to determine who would be the next Chief Minister has already begun. The BJP returned to power in Assam with Sarbananda Sonowal as Chief Minister but his colleague and campaign powerhouse, Himanta Biswa Sarma, is also seen as a contender for the chair, with the BJP never clearing the air during the polls that Mr. Sonowal would continue at the helm. That ambiguity even from senior leaders through the campaign fuelled speculation that change might be in the air. BJP sources said its parliamentary board may soon name central observers to preside over the meeting of its newly elected party MLAs in Guwahati where they will pick their leader. The observers generally convey the choice of the top brass to the State leadership which in turn is endorsed by the MLAs. The party has won 74 seats, along with its allies the Asom Gana Parishad and the United People’s Party Liberal. Mr. Sonowal, from upper Assam, is a long-time BJP man while Mr. Sarma has been the lynchpin of many of the party’s alliances in the northeast, and was at the forefront of handling the COVID-19 pandemic which many attribute as contributing to the BJP’s repeat victory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-begins-consultation-on-next-assam-chief-minister/article34475869.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Adequate oxygen available, says Home Ministry official||A senior official of the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Monday that there was adequate oxygen supply available in the country, despite the recent spike in demand. Speaking during the government’s briefing on the COVID-19 situation, MHA Additional Secretary Piyush Goyal said he wanted to “reassure all citizens, that despite the increase in oxygen demand, there is adequate supply of oxygen in the country”. He added that the government was importing oxygen to meet future needs. Mr. Goyal said the government was working on the transportation of oxygen from production centres to hospitals. He said the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had developed a real-time tracking system for oxygen tankers. He said States and Union Territories were provided air-lifting facilities for oxygen tankers by the Air Force as many times as they demanded in the past two weeks. In addition, the government had identified industries and nitrogen plants that could be used to boost oxygen production. When asked about the shortage of oxygen being reported in many parts, including Delhi, Health Ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said there were “challenges in the field”. On the vaccination front, he said 12 States had started the drive for 18-44 year olds from May 1.  Later during the briefing, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Delhi) director Randeep Guleria cautioned against the “misuse” of CT scans and biomarker tests. He said CT scans should not be done for mild cases and added that radiation from one CT scan of the chest was equivalent to 300-400 X-rays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adequate-oxygen-available-says-home-ministry-official/article34475892.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||NEET-PG put off for four months||The National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET) for postgraduate medical admissions have been postponed by at least four months, the Union government announced on Monday. It said medical interns would deployed for COVID-19 management duties to address the increasing human resource requirement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the human resource need for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government said in a statement. “Many important decisions were taken which will significantly boost the availability of medical personnel on COVID duty,” the statement said. The NEET-PG would not be held till August 31 at least. “Students will also be given at least a month’s notice before the exam is conducted. This will make a large number of qualified doctors available for COVID duties. It was also decided to allow deployment of medical interns in COVID-19 management duties under the supervision of their faculty, as part of the internship rotation,” it said. Final-year MBBS students could be deployed for services such as teleconsultation and monitoring of mild COVID-19 cases, the statement said. Nurses with B.Sc./GNM qualifications may be deployed for full-time COVID-9 duty, it noted. “The individuals providing services in COVID management will be given priority in forthcoming regular government recruitments after they complete a minimum of 100 days of COVID duty,” it read. All such health professionals would be covered under the government’s insurance scheme for healthcare workers engaged in COVID-19 care, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neet-pg-put-off-for-four-months/article34475884.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Serum Institute of India set to invest £240 million in U.K.||Ahead of the U.K.-India bilateral summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced £1 billion investment deals by Indian companies that will create 6,500 jobs in the U.K. The biggest in the investment deals is by the Serum Institute of India (SII) amounting to £240 million. The investment by the SII is aimed at the firm’s vaccine business in the U.K. and a new sales office, said an official statement. “The sales office is expected to generate new business worth over $1 billion, £200 million of which will be invested in the U.K. Serum’s investment will support clinical trials, research and development and possibly manufacturing of vaccines,” said the official statement. As part of its plans, SII has already started phase one trials in the U.K. of a one-dose nasal vaccine for coronavirus, in partnership with Codagenix INC. Other prominent investment deals announced include ones with Infosys, MPhasis, Wipro, and Goila Butter Chicken, which will invest £3 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/serum-institute-of-india-set-to-invest-240-million-in-uk/article34476404.ece
04 May 2021||Pune,||Centre says fresh vaccine orders issued for three months||The Centre on Monday said it had placed fresh orders for COVID-19 vaccines to be produced during May, June and July. The government’s statement came in the wake of an interview given to the U.K.-based Financial Times by Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of the Serum Institute of India, that “there were no orders” from the government and the vaccine shortage would continue till July. He said his company had been maligned by politicians over the shortage, and the government, and not the SII, was responsible for policy decisions. A statement issued by the Union Health Ministry, however, said: “There have been some media reports alleging that the Centre has not placed any fresh order for vaccines. The news reports suggest that the last order placed with the two vaccine makers [100 million doses with the Serum Institute of India and 20 million doses with Bharat Biotech] was in March 2021. These media reports are completely incorrect and are not based on facts.” The government clarified that “100% advance of Rs. 1,732.50 crore [Rs. 1,699.50 cr. after TDS] was released to the SII on April 28 for 110 million [11 crore] doses of ‘Covishield’ vaccine [to be produced] during May, June and July, and was received by them on the same day. As on date, against the last order of 100 million [10 crore] doses for supplies of the ‘Covishield’ vaccine, 87.5 million [8.744 crore] doses have been delivered till May 3”. The statement said, “Additionally, 100% advance of Rs. 787.50 crore [Rs. 772.50 crore after TDS] was released on April 28 to Bharat Biotech India Ltd (BBIL) for 5 crore Covaxin doses during May, June and July, and was received by them on the same day. As on date against the last order of 2 crore doses for Covaxin, 0.88 crore doses have been delivered till May 3. Hence to say fresh orders have not been placed by the Government of India is not correct.” In response to the Ministry’s statement, the SII put out a tweet. “We endorse this statement and the authenticity of the information. . We have been working closely with the Government of India for the past year and thank it for its support. We remain committed to ramping up our vaccine production to save every life we can.” Mr. Poonawalla tweeted that it was important to share correct information as his past statements may have been misconstrued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-says-fresh-vaccine-orders-issued-for-three-months/article34475888.ece
04 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||7 Myanmar refugees can approach UNHCR||The High Court of Manipur on Monday allowed seven Myanmar nationals, who entered India secretly following the February military coup, to travel to New Delhi to seek protection from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Though India is not a party to the UN Refugee Conventions, the court observed that the country is a party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966. “The far-reaching and myriad protection afforded by Article 21 of our Constitution, as interpreted and adumbrated by our Supreme Court time and again, would indubitably encompass the right of non-refoulement,” the court said. Non-refoulement is the principle under international law that a person fleeing from persecution from his own country should not be forced to return. “We welcome the judgment upholding the human rights of the seven Myanmar nationals, three of whom are minors,” Babloo Loitongbam, convener of the Citizens’ Committee Manipur (CCM), said. The other four are Niang Go Man, Pau Khan Thawn, Cing San Lun and Si Thu Aung. The last three are journalists who were working with the Mizzima news service banned by the military junta. Hiding in Moreh They had been hiding in the border town Moreh until they were brought to Imphal following an order of the High Court on April 20. “We continue to be deeply concerned about the plight of thousands of other Myanmar nationals taking shelter in the bordering villages of Manipur without any support and protection apart from the hospitality and warmth of the poor villagers,” Mr. Loitongbam said. The humanitarian sub-committee CCM has provided food, clothing, medicines and utensils donated by the people of Manipur in four villages in Kamjong district and three each in Tengnoupal and Churachandpur districts, housing more than 500 refugees from Myanmar, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/myanmar-refugees-can-approach-unhcr-hc/article34476100.ece

The most important task at our hand is to serve people in the times of COVID crisis,” she said. The Trinamool Congress chairperson said the swearing in ceremony will be a minimalist event. Ms. Banerjee also reiterated her demand that Centre should ensure universal vaccination free of cost. She thanked the people of West Bengal for “resisting the onslaughts of the BJP”, saying, “The spine of the people of West Bengal is still straight and upright. Only the women and youth can resist the BJP.” Asked whether the victory would mean that she will play a major role in national politics particularly in 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Ms Banerjee said, “I am just a street fighter. I can only boost up people so that we can fight a strong fight against BJP. One cannot do everything alone. It is a collective family and collectively if we can take a decision, there are so many political parties and so many people we are in touch. All together we can fight battle for 2024.” ‘Fight against COVID-19’ On being asked if there was a possibility of a Bengali Prime Minister, she said that in the present times all should fight against COVID-19 pandemic. The TMC chief said leaders across the country including Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackray, Punjab Chief Minister Amrinder Singh and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had called to congratulate her on her victory. Ms Banerjee added that she did not receive any phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-to-be-sworn-in-as-cm-on-may-5/article34475848.ece

Sudhakar claimed that there were “discrepancies” in three of the 23 deaths and the inquiry would bring out the truth. Contrary to the Minister’s claim, locals and relatives of the deceased said patients on ventilators choked to death as the medical facility ran out of oxygen around midnight. Efforts at the late hour to replenish supply came too late to save the patients on the life support systems, they said. The district entirely depends on Mysuru for oxygen and supply from there has not been steady, sources said. The sudden surge from an average of 8 to 10 deaths per day to 24 in the district (including 23 in Chamarajanagar district hospital alone), has created a scare among people. However, Dr. Sudhakar, who reached Chamarajanagar on Monday afternoon said as per his information 14 patients were on ventilator, 36 on non-invasive ventilator, 58 on high-flow oxygen, and 29 patients on normal oxygen of up to 10 litres per minute. Dr. Sudhakar said the timeline indicated that 14 patients died between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Sunday, three patients died between midnight and 3 a.m. on Monday and seven more patients died between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. Asked whether he was indicating that there was no oxygen scarcity or that the deaths had nothing to do with it, the Minister said he would not elaborate as an inquiry had already been ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/23-covid-patients-die-in-karnataka-hospital/article34475851.ece

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Cannot stop reports on court observations: SC||“We cannot expect the media not to report dialogues. Oral observations are as important as orders... Unfolding of process of judicial thinking is equally of interest to the public,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud addressed the ECI, represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi. “Public interest is not limited to judgments, but also the raising of questions in a court hearing, the dialogue between the Bar and the Bench... All of these show the public whether there was a genuine application of mind by judges... Had I been in the Bar, I would be very worried if judges don’t ask questions,” Justice Chandrachud said. The Bench said the ECI’s prayer to stop media from reporting the comments from the Bench was simply “far-fetched”. “We cannot say that the media cannot report the contents of the discussions in a court of law. Discussions in a court of law are of equal public interest, and I would put it in the same pedestal as the final order. Discussion in the court is a dialogue between the Bar and the Bench... We wish that media should report fully what is happening in court. It brings a sense of accountability. Media reporting would also show that we are dispensing our duties fully,” Justice Chandrachud said. When Mr. Dwivedi complained that the HC should not have accused another constitutional authority like the ECI of “murder”, Justice Chandrachud said judges were humans too. Some come reticent and other garrulous. Their comments may be borne out of frustration, but were certainly made for the cause of larger public interest. “We don’t want to demoralise the HCs. They are vital pillars of the judicial process... HC judges are doing tremendous work, burning the midnight oil, they are overwhelmed. They know what’s happening on the ground. It is bound to affect your psyche,” Justice Chandrachud said. Justice Shah said the ECI should take oral observations of judges in the right spirit. Judges do not follow a prepared script during a hearing. “Sometimes they are frustrated, they are angered. You should accept it in the right spirit. They are also human beings... It is a free,” Justices Chandrachud and Shah both said. “But to say that ECI should be charged with murder...” Mr. Dwivedi rued. “It’s a free-flowing conversation. We respect the ECI, don’t take it otherwise. This is not to belittle because ultimately democracy survives on the faith in the institutions... EC is an important pillar, but sometimes in dialogue, sometimes things are expressed,” Justice Chandrachud explained. Mr. Dwivedi said what happened in the Madras HC could hardly be called a “dialogue”. Justice Chandrachud pacified the poll body, saying the apex court would write a “balanced order”. “However, we have to as well protect the sanctity of the HCs, that they have the freedom and liberty to ask questions We wish the media should report fully of what is happening in Court, it brings accountability,” Justice Chandrachud noted. In its petition in the apex court, the Commission said the oral comments from the Madras HC would impact or lower the faith of the masses in the poll body and democratic process. The Commission said the comments were disparaging and derogatory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-stop-reports-on-court-observations-sc/article34475858.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘States cannot impinge on autonomy of pvt. schools’||The Supreme Court on Monday held that the States cannot impinge on the autonomy of private unaided schools to fix and collect ‘just’ and ‘permissible’ school fees from parents, especially in the name of the pandemic. “It is one thing to say the State may regulate the fee structure of private unaided schools to ensure that the school management does not indulge in profiteering and commercialisation, but in the guise of exercise of that power, it cannot transcend the line of regulation and impinge upon the autonomy of the school to fix and collect ‘just’ and ‘permissible’ school fees from its students,” a Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said in a 128-page judgement. The judgment, which would help schools retain their autonomy in deciding fee structure, came on the basis of a series of appeals filed by private unaided schools in Rajasthan against State notifications to defer collection of fees, including reduction limited to 70% of tuition fees by schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and 60% from the schools affiliated to the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education, in view of the reduction of syllabus due to the aftermath of the pandemic from March 2020. The judgment concerns around 36,000 private unaided schools, including 220 minority private unaided schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-cannot-impinge-on-autonomy-of-pvt-schools/article34475859.ece

04 May 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK continues its winning streak in Melur||All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) has retained the Melur Assembly constituency in Madurai district. The voters have remained loyal to the AIADMK since 2001 making it five wins in a row for the party in the Assembly elections. R. Samy, a close aide of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran, won as an AIADMK candidate in 2001, 2006 and 2011. Mr. Samy died in 2018 after a prolonged battle with cancer. He had joined the AMMK in 2018. Sitting MLA Periyapullan alias P. Selvam retained Melur constituency by a comfortable margin of 35,162 votes and defeated Congress candidate T. Ravichandran. In 2016, Mr. Selvam won by a margin of 19,723 votes, defeating DMK candidate A.P. Ragupathy. Mr. Selvam said that the people have been constantly supporting the AIADMK and this was a result of the hard work of the cadres who reached out to the people and were available to address their grievances. Melur used to be a Congress stronghold - it won here seven times. K.V.V Rajamanickam won from a Congress ticket in 1991, and following a split in the party, he won from a Tamil Maanila Congress ticket. Wrong choice? The residents say the reason why Congress lost ground in Melur was due to the wrong choice of candidates. With no prominent leaders contesting from Melur, it turned the tide in favour of the AIADMK, they said. Even in the 2021 elections, Congress, an ally of the DMK, contested from Melur. The verdict in favour of AIADMK has established that Melur has become an AIADMK bastion. Some are of the view that had the DMK contested from Melur, there might have been a close fight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-continues-its-winning-streak-in-melur/article34476565.ece
04 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||25 years on, Chennai sees a DMK sweep||In the city, electoral history has repeated itself after 25 years. After the 1996 Assembly election, Chennai has voted fully for the DMK and its allies, routing the AIADMK as it did then and giving the party a comfortable majority to form a government on its own. The verdict also symbolises the rise of DMK president M.K. Stalin. After the 1996 victory, he bacame the Chennai Mayor. In 2021, he is set to become Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. A post-poll analysis shows the decimation of the AIADMK-led alliance this time was due to many reasons, including the choice of coalition partners, lack of ground work by office-bearers, selection of candidates and the DMK’s promises that attracted both urban and rural masses. Chennai has been the DMK’s bastion since the late 1950s as the party had established a strong link with the working class and the urban middle class. Even senior leaders like K. Anbazhagan and Murasoli Maran chose Chennai as their electoral battleground. Voters in some constituencies like Mylapore and T. Nagar had swayed towards the AIADMK only after Jayalalithaa took over as the party leader, observers say. Asked about the possible reasons for the DMK’s massive victory, a cross-section of the city residents said the party’s election manifesto was more specific and detailed and provided a long-term plan. Former Chennai Mayor and DMK MLA Ma. Subramanian echoed this view. He said people had become aware of issues like infrastructure and environment and were impressed by what his party offered. “They were looking for a change, and a leader who will deliver on the promises,” he said, citing this as a reason for the party and its allies to poll a higher number of votes in most city constituencies than in the previous elections. A mix of first-timers, as in Villivakkam and Mylapore, and the choice of local and well-known candidates in constituencies such as Harbour, Ambattur and Avadi also helped the DMK. In places like Ponneri, local issues like the failure to address the opposition to the expansion of the Kattupalli port proved disastrous for the AIADMK, residents said. S. Sudharsanam, who has been elected as Madhavaram MLA for the second consecutive time, said people expressed their discontent over the negligence of civic amenities by the AIADMK for 10 years. “The DMK’s fight for the rights of Tamils even when it was in the Opposition and public confidence in its ability to deliver on infrastructure are the other major reasons.” An independent observer said the AIADMK was routed in the city because of the lack of coordination between the office-bearers and the cadre on the ground. “The Ministers concentrated on the western belt and left the city wide open. Since it was a do-or-die battle for the DMK, it put in 100% efforts, but the AIADMK was lackadaisical in its approach,” he said. “The DMK had a better set of allies too. The AIADMK had to carry the weight of the BJP and the TMC, which has no cadre base, and the PMK, which is seen as an opportunistic party. It is now time for the AIADMK to introspect and bring in new office-bearers,” he noted. S. A. Ponnusamy, Makkal Needhi Maiam’s Perambur candidate, said this election showed that people were not yet ready for a third front. “Though the city has a larger educated voter base, the masses are still with the traditional Dravidian parties,” he said. Naturally, expectations are running high. Voters want a better performance from the DMK that has regained power after a decade. Can the DMK repeat its 1996-2001 governance is the question. Some observers feel it was the least corrupt regime in the past three decades. “One reason was that the then Chief Minister [M. Karunanidhi] was surrounded by honest officials,” recalls a senior bureaucrat. V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents’ Welfare Association, said the big win indicated that people looked for a change as several infrastructure projects need to be completed. “The new government...is expected to accelerate development works,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/25-years-on-chennai-sees-a-dmk-sweep/article34476434.ece

04 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After impressive performance, Congress has its task cut out||By winning 18 out of the 25 seats it had contested in the Assembly election, a 72% conversion rate, the Congress has ended up as the party with the best strike rate. The strike rate of its senior partner DMK was 70.75%. The Congress can feel encouraged from this victory as it was blamed for a poor strike rate in the past elections, but the road ahead is long. There is a feeling in sections of the party that it cannot remain a junior partner forever, when even the BJP is aggressively pushing for expansion in Tamil Nadu. In 2006, when the Congress won 34 out of 48 seats, it failed to capitalise on its performance to help grow the organisation. For all the talk of ‘bringing back Kamaraj rule’ in Tamil Nadu, the factionalism and infighting has dented its prospects over the years. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri has managed to quell factionalism to an extent. Even when a few leaders protested against the nomination of some candidates, they were quickly asked to fall in line by Mr. Alagiri and senior leaders, including AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao, who realised the enormity of the task at hand. The agreements with the DMK for the past elections and its own performance deficit have meant that the Congress is unable to seek a share in power in the State. Even in 2006, when it won 34 seats and the DMK 96 seats, the Congress sat out of the government. The late AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa used to taunt it as a “minority DMK government”. The 2021 Assembly election results present an opportunity to the national party, which is fighting for relevance in many States, to strengthen its base, build its cadre and identify young and talented workers to enable it to have either a stronger bargaining power or the ability to fight elections alone, notwithstanding its alliance with the DMK at the national level. “The people of Tamil Nadu have a liking for the Congress, and among all the national parties, the Congress is the most liked here. We have to build our grassroots, identify good leaders. These results have helped us take forward the task of building our party at the ground level. But we have to fight the fascist force. That is our main priority,” Mr. Dinesh Gundu Rao told The Hindu.  Another senior leader said that while this victory was important for the Congress, it would not do anything to upset the alliance, pointing out that the party would have to work hard to grow its base in the State. The fact remains that the Congress’s dream of bringing back the Kamaraj rule cannot come true till the party is in a position to contest in all 234 seats in the State on its own (it had contested in all 39 constituencies alone in the 2014 Lok Sabha election) or lead an alliance in Assembly elections, a prospect that seems distant at the moment.  We have to build our grassroots, identify good leaders... We have to fight the fascist force Dinesh Gundu Rao, AICC in-charge for T.N.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-impressive-performance-congress-has-its-task-cut-out/article34475994.ece
04 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Secretariat prepares to host DMK govt.||Since the break of dawn on Monday, officials of the Public Works Department are working in the Secretariat to prepare the campus for the new government under DMK president M.K. Stalin. The Chief Minister’s Office has returned all the files to the departments concerned — files that have been disposed of and those that were pending. The Chief Minister’s office and nearby areas have been white-washed. The name boards of Ministers were removed in the morning, and the names were being scraped off. “Only after the swearing-in, I will be given the names of new Ministers to be painted on the boards. Right now, I am only scraping the old names off the boards,” says artist A.T. Mani, a former TANSI employee. The Public Department’s Official Procedure (OP-II) Section has been engaging him to paint these boards for several years now. A shuffle of IAS officers is also expected soon after the DMK assumes office. As it turns out, the change will be effected at all levels of the bureaucratic structure. Many officials in the Secretariat, who were Personal Assistants to AIADMK Ministers, have been lobbying for their return to their departments, and for safe positions. But there is also a ‘system’ in place even while lobbying for posts, some officials say. The Public Department has started receiving applications from Personal Assistants, Office Assistants and typists expressing their interest in working in a specific department, or under a Minister. However, new Ministers will have the final say. “It happens after every Assembly election. Employees are always divided into those supporting one party, and those supporting the others. Soon after the results come in, they decide among themselves on who will become which Minister’s Personal Assistants and who will wait for their turn,” says an Under-Secretary. For instance, there are some departments, which are considered key, and postings there are considered high-profile. Native district, sympathy with a party, caste and community, too, play a role in a person getting his/her desired post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/secretariat-prepares-to-host-dmk-govt/article34475996.ece
04 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Will take BJP to grassroots: Murugan||BJP State president L. Murugan has delivered on his promise that the party will have its members in the 16th Assembly. Four BJP candidates won in the April 6 election in the first victory for the party after 20 years. Although Mr. Murugan lost in Dharapuram (reserved), he has set his sights on the future. He told The Hindu that the work had just begun; he would reach out to areas where the party had no presence. “The people of Tamil Nadu have definitely accepted the BJP. In fact, they have welcomed us, if you look at the number of votes that our candidates have polled. Even in constituencies where we are not strong, we have polled a large number of votes. In Dharapuram too, without an adequate organisation, we came very close to victory [Mr. Murugan lost by 1,393 votes, polling 88,593 votes]. In Tirunelveli and Nagercoil, we had a very good margin of victory,” he said. Mr. Murugan said the work put in by the party cadre in the last one year, Vetrivel Yatra, the enrolment of new members and workers of other parties joining the BJP, all contributed to the victory. Despite having its MLAs in the Assembly, the party will sit on the Opposition benches yet again, as in 2001 when four BJP candidates won as part of the DMK-led alliance. “Unlike in 2001, times are different now. There was a constant rhetoric from a cross-section of political parties that the BJP would not grow in Tamil Nadu and it would not win even one seat. Yet, people believed in the need for the BJP to be present in Tamil Nadu and in Mr. Modi’s leadership. That’s why we have won,” Mr. Murugan said. He said the BJP MLAs would raise people’s issues in the Assembly; point out the mistakes of the government, if any, and offer suggestions; and work for the welfare of people. Mr. Murugan said he, his party MLAs, senior leaders and office-bearers would tour the State. “We are going to expand our work to the grassroots. Wherever we don’t have a base, we will go there and make efforts to grow the party,” he said. The AIADMK had won in the 2016 election without the BJP in its alliance. Yet, after the results came in, Union Home Minister Amit Shah wrote on Twitter that “the NDA has served the people of Tamil Nadu in the last five years”. Asked about it, Mr. Murugan said he must have referred to the AIADMK and the BJP working together as the ruling parties at the Centre and in the State and as NDA partners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-take-bjp-to-grassroots-murugan/article34475999.ece

04 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Beds in govt. hospitals filling up fast in Chennai||Almost all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the five government hospitals in Chennai are filled, while oxygen supported beds are running low, pushing hospital authorities to set up additional facilities. As per the data on bed status available onhttps://tncovidbeds. tnega.org/, only eight oxygen-supported beds out of 1,766 and one ICU bed out of 919 were available in the five government hospitals in the city. Hospital authorities said that work was under way to increase the number of beds and oxygen points to meet the rising demand. “We are bringing in 550 additional oxygen lines on floors 6, 7 and 8 of Tower 3 at RGGGH. Of this, 70 have been put to use,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said. From 810 oxygen points earlier, the hospital has increased it to 1,100 points, he added. At the zero delay ward, the hospital has added 20 more oxygen points to de-congest ambulances bringing in patients. “We want to reduce the waiting time for patients. A 10-member doctor team has been posted at the outpatient department. Two of them will enter ambulances and triage to prioritise patients,” he added. The hospital has formed a respiratory care team to assess the oxygen utilisation. “They will look at ways to conserve oxygen, and audit the requirement for patients on every floor,” he added. Women patients, who have recovered from COVID-19 and are in step-down wards, were shifted to the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore. At the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, 500 more oxygen-supported beds are being set up at the Super Speciality Block, dean P. Balaji, said. “Plans are afoot to add 100 more beds in the ICU, while the Directorate of Medical Education has planned to provide 100 ventilators from other districts,” he said. The hospital has added 50 more beds with oxygen points to the 20-bed zero delay ward. At the New Tower Block, where the Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency Care Initiative unit and IMCU functions on the ground and first floors, floors 2 to 6 have been converted into wards for COVID-19 patients, who have tested negative for the infection but are dependent on oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beds-in-govt-hospitals-filling-up-fast-in-chennai/article34476425.ece

04 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine supply to private centres stopped from April 30||Owing to limited allocation of COVID-19 vaccines from Chennai, the Health Department stopped from April 30 the supply of Covishield and Covaxin to vaccination centres run by private hospitals in Coimbatore district. A Health Department official said that the limited stocks of vaccines it received were supplied to vaccination centres in government hospitals, including medical college hospitals and primary health centres. The official also said that there was no clear information on when the district would receive adequate doses to continue supply to the private centres. Spokespersons from two major private hospitals in Coimbatore told The Hindu that they had to shut the vaccination centre temporarily due to unavailability of vaccines. “We are informing people who approach us about the lack of supply. Many of them are in need of their second dose to complete the course of the vaccination,” said a spokesperson. As of Monday evening, the district had 4,470 doses of vaccines (4,090 doses of Covishield and 380 doses of Covaxin) at two government medical college hospitals, government hospitals, primary health centres and the vaccination centres of the Coimbatore Corporation. The vaccination centre run by the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital at the Government Arts College witnessed heavy rush of people who came to take first and second jabs. Officials involved in the vaccination drive in the district feel that government-run centres will be flooded with people in the coming days if there is further delay in the procurement of adequate vaccine stocks for private centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-supply-to-private-centres-stopped-from-april-30/article34476442.ece
04 May 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Caste, absence of popular face led to DMK blackout in Coimbatore||Despite mounting a sustained and vociferous attack on the AIADMK’s prominent faces in the Coimbatore region, the DMK has drawn a blank in the industrial region. Its candidates were defeated in all 10 Assembly seats including Singanallur, the lone constituency it had won in 2016. This is the second time in a decade the party, which is set to form the next Government, is facing such a debacle. The DMK leadership had gone all out to target outgoing Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani on corruption charges and Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman on the blackmail and sexual assault case. Yet voters gave the AIADMK a sweep. AIADMK spokesperson Kovai K. Selvaraj says the sweep is an endorsement that the voters did not believe the DMK’s charges. He told The Hindu that the party’s strong cadre base helped it win. Claiming that the AIADMK has around 4.7 lakh members in Coimbatore district, he asserted that their groundwork led to the victory. “Many parties would not even have workers in some villages, but for us, there will be between 150 and 200 party workers for each polling booth,” Mr. Selvaraj said. These cadres countered the “false campaign” against Mr. Velumani and Mr. Jayaraman, he added. The AIADMK won nine seats, while Coimbatore South was bagged by Vanathi Srinivasan of ally BJP, who defeated Makkal Needhi Maiam leader Kamal Haasan by a slender margin. A DMK functionary, requesting anonymity, said the results showed voters from the Kongu Vellala Gounder community, a dominant caste in the district, did not favour the party. “People from this community feel that they would be more secure with the AIADMK in power,” he said lamenting that his party had not ensured adequate representation for Gounders in party posts or administrative post when in power. He gave the example of R. Sakkarapani of the DMK, a member of the Kongu Vellala Gounder, who has won for the sixth consecutive time from Oddanchathram in Dindigul district. “He was not given a cabinet berth in 1996 and 2006,” rued the DMK leader. “The caste factor could have worked. But we need to study the results in detail,” said Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan of the CPM, an ally of the DMK. There was also a feeling that the image that outgoing Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who belonged to the Gounder community, was accessible to all and some of the remarks by the DMK leaders made during the campaign could have also influenced voters. The victory margin in most constituencies in the district is less than 12,500 votes. A trade union leader said the DMK front lacked a commanding force to foresee the campaign in the district. For instance, eight unions belonging to one industrial sector gave their support to the DMK front. “No one came forward and asked us to work for the front or spoke to us. We have about 70,000 votes across the district. We could not even meet all the candidates,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/caste-absence-of-popular-face-led-to-dmk-blackout-in-coimbatore/article34476451.ece
04 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK retains its stronghold even after shuffling of constituencies, candidates||The Assembly election results have proved that constituencies in Coimbatore district remained a stronghold of the AIADMK even when the party shuffled incumbent candidates to work out alliance equations. Victory margin G. Arunkumar who won from Coimbatore North in 2016 contested from Kavundampalayam and won with a margin of 9,776 votes defeating DMK’s local strongman R. Krishnan alias Paiya Gounder. The party had sent Mr. Arunkumar to the fray replacing V.C. Arukutty who made consecutive wins in 2011 and 2016 from Kavundampalayam – the constituency with the highest electorate in Coimbatore district. Coimbatore north this time elected Amman K. Arjunan who won from Coimbatore South in 2016. Party workers had staged minor protests when the AIADMK front gave south to BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan as part of the seat sharing. While Mr. Arjunan had a margin of 17,419 votes in 2016, it shrunk to 4,001 this time. Mettupalayam was another constituency where AIADMK chose to replace the incumbent MLA. Veteran O.K. Chinnaraj who made three consecutive victories from 2006 was replaced by A.K. Selvaraj, the winner in 2001. Mr. Selvaraj, however, had a tough fight with DMK’s T.R. Shanmugasundaram and managed to win by a margin of 2,456 votes. “AIADMK leaders were with the people whenever they were in need. They have seen how Coimbatore changed under their leadership. The infrastructures that have come up, augmentation of Siruvani water scheme and ease of doing business are a few to name,” said AIADMK spokesperson Kovai Sathyan who names S.P. Velumani the architect of the victory. “All the leaders are easily approachable to people. They got the son-of-the-soil reception wherever they contested,” he added. The party is seeing another promising leader in K.R. Jayaram, urban district secretary of MGR youth wing, who defeated DMK’s N. Karthik in Singanallur constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-retains-its-stronghold-even-after-shuffling-of-constituencies-candidates/article34476449.ece
04 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Kinathukadavu also kept candidates, voters on the edge||Kinathukadavu Assembly constituency with 3.08 lakh voters also saw an exiting contest in the 2021 Assembly election. Just as the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency went down to the wire, Kinathukadavu also saw a tight race between the DMK’s Kurichi S. Prabhakaran and AIADMK’s S. Damodaran. But it was not a triangular contest. 36 rounds In fact, it was the last of the 10 Assembly constituencies in the district for which the officials declared the results. For, it had more rounds of counting than Coimbatore South – 36. At the start of the counting process, Mr. Damodaran led from the front maintaining lead until Round 13, when he had a 426-vote advantage. Round 14 onwards Mr. Prabhakaran began polling more votes. At the end of Round 14, he was 2,818 votes ahead of his rival and eight rounds later – at the end of Round 22 – he had established a lead of 7,936 votes. At this point it appeared that the DMK still had a chance in Coimbatore district and that Mr. Prabhakaran would open his party’s account. But it was not to be. The AIADMK candidate’s vote increased Round 32 onwards and at the end of Round 36 – the last round – he had 1,758 votes more. By then the postal votes had not been counted. As the counting process is manual, it was slow and the 1,758 margin only mandated that officials did a thorough job to eliminate errors and prevent candidates raising objections. The completion of the counting of postal ballots showed that Mr. Prabhakaran had polled 1,131 votes and Mr. Damodaran 468, a lead of 663 votes for the former. But it was not significant enough to impact the victory as the AIADMK candidate walked his way to the Returning Officer’s table to get his certificate of victory. The more number of rounds of counting, the swing in margin from the AIADMK to the DMK and back to the AIADMK and the postal ballots ensured that the counting process took time before the candidates and voters had a victor before them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kinathukadavu-also-kept-candidates-voters-on-the-edge/article34476441.ece
04 May 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Kamal Haasan led until things changed in Vanathi’s favour in the last four rounds||The battle for the much-watched Coimbatore South Assembly constituency went the Bharatiya Janata Party’s way with its candidate Vanathi Srinivasan winning by 1,728 votes. But the run-up to the result was an interesting period as it was Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) president Kamal Haasan’s show all the way until a late swing in Ms. Srinivasan’s favour changed the course. Of the 26 rounds of counting, Mr. Haasan was ahead of Ms. Srinivasan and Congress’ Mayura S. Jayakumar until Round 22. At the end of Round 22, Mr. Haasan had 176 votes more than Ms. Vanathi. By then Mr. Jayakumar was a distant third. At the end of Round 23, the balance tilted in favour of the BJP candidate as she had an 890 vote advantage over the actor-turned politician. She kept extending her lead to 1,114 votes at the end of Round 24, 1,237 votes at the end of Round 25 and 1,540 votes at the end of Round 26. Of the 26 rounds, Mr. Haasan had polled more votes than the other contestants only in nine; Ms. Vanathi stood in first place in 13 rounds and Mr. Jayakumar in four. The reason, according to data available with the Election Commission of India, that Mr. Haasan was leading for a good period was that his leads were in the initial rounds – Rounds 1 and Rounds 3 – 22. Ms. Vanathi led from Round 23 onwards until the end of counting. And in postal ballots, as Ms. Vanathi had polled more votes than Mr. Haasan. That Mr. Jayakumar had polled more postal votes than the other two did not count. At a press meet held here on Monday, BJP MLA to-be Vanathi Srinivasan said she was taking steps to help people affected by COVID-19 and had spoken to Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner in this regard. She was also in talks with a few local manufacturers to see how they could help with the right equipment for the COVID-19 positive persons. This would be her victory celebration. Besides, to thank the voters who had elected her, she would be going around with a few people , she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-haasan-led-until-things-changed-in-vanathis-favour-in-the-last-four-rounds/article34476447.ece

04 May 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||DMK wins four out of seven seats in Villupuram||The DMK-led front has routed the AIADMK in the Assembly election in Cuddalore district by making a near clean sweep. Final results declared on Monday showed of the nine constituencies in the district, the DMK, Congress and VCK nominees emerged victorious in seven seats with a comfortable margin. The consolation for the AIADMK was the victory of sitting MLA K.A. Pandiyan in Chidambaram Assembly constituency, while the party wrested the Bhuvanagiri seat from the DMK. While the DMK won Thittagudi (Reserved), Neyveli, Cuddalore and Kurunjipadi, the Congress won Vriddachalam. The Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK), which contested on the DMK symbol, won Panruti while the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) won Kattumannarkoil (Reserved). Of the four DMK candidates who won this time, three are incumbents — C.V. Ganesan retained Thittagudi seat, Saba Rajendran and M.R.K. Panneerselvam retained Neyveli and Kurunjipadi respectively. While Mr. Ganesan romped home with a margin of 21,563 votes over his nearest BJP rival TADA D. Periyasamy, Mr. Panneerselvam handed out a 16,456-vote defeat to Selvi Ramajayam of the AIADMK. In Cuddalore, DMK candidate G. Iyappan defeated sitting Minister M.C. Sampath by a margin of 5,151 votes and VCK’s Sinthanaiselvan defeated sitting MLA N. Murugamaran of the AIADMK by a margin of 10,565 votes in Kattumannarkoil. In Vriddachalam, the Congress candidate M.R. Radhakrishnan defeated his nearest PMK rival G. Karthikeyan by a slender margin of 862 votes. DMK’s Saba Rajendran retained the Neyveli seat by a margin of 977 votes, defeating K. Jagan of the PMK. AIADMK’s K.A. Pandiyan and A. Arunmozhithevan won the Chidambaram and Bhuvanagiri assembly seats by a margin of 16,937 and 7,969 votes respectively. In Villupuram, the DMK won four of the total seven constituencies, and handed a humiliating defeat to the AIADMK and its sitting Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam. DMK strongman and sitting MLA K. Ponmudi retained the Tirukovilur seat by a whopping margin of 59,680 votes defeating his nearest rival V.A.T. Kalivaradhan of the BJP. DMK’s K.A. Masthan, another incumbent, also retained the Gingee seat by a margin of 35,803 votes. The severe drubbing received by Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam in Villupuram constituency shocked the cadre. Right from the start of counting at the Arignar Anna Government Arts College, tense moments prevailed. At the end of Round 19, DMK’s R. Lakshmanan established a clear lead, defeating Mr. Shanmugam by a margin of 14,877 votes. In Vikravandi, DMK’s N. Pugazhenthi won the seat by a margin of 9.573. The AIADMK’s M. Chakrapani retained the Vanur (Reserved) seat, while the party candidate P. Arjunan wrested Tindivanam (Reserved) from the DMK. Mr. Arjunan won the seat by a margin of 9,753 votes. PMK’s Sivakumar won the Mailam seat by a margin of 3,748 votes. In Kallakurichi district, the DMK won three out of the four constituencies leaving one for the AIADMK. The DMK won Rishivandhiyam, Ulundurpet and Sankarapuram constituencies. Of the three DMK candidates who won this time, two are incumbents – Vasantham K. Karthikeyan has retained Rishivandhiyam while T. Udaya Suriyan retained Sankarapuram. DMK’s Manikannan wrested the Ulundurpet seat from the AIADMK defeating the sitting MLA R. Kumaraguru by a margin of 5,256 votes. The AIADMK retained the Kallakurichi (Reserved) seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-wins-4-out-of-7-seats-in-villupuram/article34476641.ece
04 May 2021||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||In Dharmapuri, DMK forfeits past gains||By losing to the AIADMK-PMK combine in all five Assembly constituencies in Dharmapuri district, the DMK appeared to have forfeited its past gains in the region. Its sitting MLAs were defeated by the PMK in Pennagaram and Dharmapuri. If the arithmetic that banked on the AIADMK-PMK voter base worked for the alliance, it appeared that the victory was sealed by the Kongu Vellalars, the second largest community in Harur (Reserved), Palacodde and Paapireddipatty) constituencies. This was contrary to the prediction that this community would tip the scales in favour of the DMK, given their resentment for not having representation in any constituency under the AIADMK and the belief that the Kongu Makkal Desiya Katchi, the figurative representative of the community had aligned with the DMK. Kongu Vellalars, who constitute 15.50% next only to Vanniyars (48.30%) in Palacodde; 14.5% third only to Vanniyars (35.1%) and Adidravidars (23.1%) in Paapireddipatty and constitute 22.70% next only to Adidravidars(23.40%) in Harur (R) instead reposed their faith in the figure of the AIADMK’s Kongu Vellalar [outgoing] Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami. Besides, the DMK’s perceived laxity in the choice of candidates, there was a recurring allegation from many quarters that local cadres in Palacodde (contested by the outgoing minister K.P.Anbalagan) were “bought off”. Within the DMK there was resentment over renominating the two MLAs P.N.P. Inbasekaran (Pennagaram) and P.Subramani (Dharmapuri). Both were party district secretaries with a “damp” record. The DMK had the advantage of lessons from the Lok Sabha elections that fetched it its young Lok Sabha MP Senthil Kumar, a first-timer, defeating the seasoned PMK candidate Anbumani Ramadoss only two years ago. For instance, in Pennagaram assembly segment, the DMK’s MP candidate trailed behind by only 200 votes, despite the disadvantage of the PMK-AIADMK arithmetic in Pennagaram assembly segment. Hence, Pennagaram was “winnable”, insist sources. But Mr. Inbasekaran was done in by his over confidence, claim some in the party. If Mr. Inbasekaran played the “outsider” card on the PMK candidate G.K.Mani, he himself was a “non-resident” living in Bengaluru. It was only months before the elections did he shift not to Pennagaram but to Dharmapuri, sources pointed out. Similarly, in Dharmapuri Mr. Subramani was perceived not to have mounted the challenge needed for a win against a ruling combine that had invested all its might, which resulted in a victory for the PMK with a thumping majority of 26,840 votes. That there was lacunae at the district level organisation was evident even in 2019 when it lost the by-polls in Harur and Paapireddipatty. Yet, this went unaddressed, according to observers. There is also a perception of a reckonable transfer of DMK’s Vanniyar votes to the PMK and the AIADMK. The gnawing question, however, was the relevance of the 10.5 % quota for Vanniyars to the win, if it did not adequately impact the outcome in the rest of the PMK strongholds in north Tamil Nadu. The Vanniars in the west backed the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-dharmapuri-dmk-forfeits-past-gains/article34476042.ece
04 May 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||BJP wins Modakkurichi by a margin of 281 votes||In a closely fought contest for the Modakkurichi Assembly constituency, first time contestant C. Saraswathi of BJP defeated former Union Minister and two-time State Minister DMK’s Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan by a least margin of 281 votes. Of the total 1,81,857 valid votes, Ms. Saraswathi, who is a doctor by profession for 45 years, secured 78,125 votes while the Ms. Subbulakshmi secured 77,844 votes. Re-counting thrice of postal ballot papers delayed the declaration of results as finally the BJP bloomed in the district at the late hours of Sunday. Ms. Subbulakshmi’s 44-year-old political career started with AIADMK in 1977 after which she joined DMK in 1980. During the 2019 Parliamentary election, she declared that she would not be contesting the elections due to age factor, paving the way for new leaders. However, the party’s decision to field her as a candidate in the Assembly election did not go well with the party men and it was said that turned in favour of the BJP. While Ms. Saraswathi and the BJP functionaries along with AIADMK cadre canvassed for votes highlighting the welfare schemes brought for the women, Ms. Subbulakshmi failed to impress the electors during the campaign, say sources. “Dissidents within the party and ineffective campaign led to her defeat,” said a DMK functionary, speaking on anonymity. The functionary said that DMK could have easily won the constituency if one of the aspirants who is known to the party men and the electors had been fielded. “The BJP utilised the opportunity to shine,” said a senior BJP functionary who credited the victory on the faith people had on the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-wins-modakkurichi-by-a-margin-of-281-votes/article34476041.ece

Chidambaram said the new government had a herculean task ahead and wished him good luck. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, he said the election results were on expected lines. However, he expressed disappointment over four seats bagged by the BJP in the poll. Praising the voters of West Bengal, he said despite threats and pressure from the official machinery including the Election Commission, people gave a comfortable victory to Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, who fought a lone battle. Blaming the Election Commission, Mr. Chidambaram said that someone of the stature of late T N Seshan should head the body, which alone would bring back its lost sheen. Many officials had turned partial to the BJP and its leaders. Institutions such as the Election Commission should function independently and give the fullest confidence to the people that there was no interference. On the charge that cash-for-votes played a major role in the election, he was in partial disagreement and stated that it might have taken roots, but more checks would certainly prevent the menace. Not all voters could have taken money nor all political parties encouraged corrupt voters. The ECI should have an able administrator, which would give it a better image among voters, he added. On the pandemic, Mr. Chidambaram said the situation was alarming. The representatives from 13 political parties had jointly sent a memorandum to the Prime Minister for speedy action. “If this is not going to be heeded to by the Centre, the government will be routed in 2024. The beginning has been set in Tamil Nadu.” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chidambaram-wishes-stalin-good-luck/article34476014.ece

04 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai’s urban voters have thrown in their lot with DMK||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has performed significantly well in urban Madurai as compared to 2016 Assembly elections. There is a notable increase in the percentage of votes polled and the number of seats bagged by the party in urban Madurai. The DMK and its ally have won four out of six urban seats in the district - Madurai East, Madurai North, Madurai South and Madurai Central. The other two urban constituencies - Madurai West and Tirupparankundram - were bagged by All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The DMK has won two more constituencies this time than in 2016 when it bagged only Madurai Central and Madurai East. Huge rise A comparison of the last two elections shows there is a huge rise in the percentage of votes secured by the DMK candidates in all the six urban constituencies. Even though the DMK candidates lost Madurai West and Tirupparankundram, the percentage of votes polled has increased. The candidates have also won with a huge margin, especially in Madurai East and Madurai Central. Thirumalai, a veteran journalist and author of ‘Madurai Arasiyal,’ said that similar to the State-wide trend, more percentage of urban voters of Madurai have voted for the DMK. He said that many first-time voters in urban areas have voted according to their choice and not based on any caste or religion of the candidates. “For these urban youth, unemployment and lack of industrial development are the major areas of concern. They have voted for the DMK with the hope that the party will solve problems of the youth,” said Mr. Thirumalai. He also pointed out that across the State the AIADMK had fared well in rural areas as the agricultural activities had flourished during the last term. The winner of Madurai Central constituency, P. T. R. P. Thiagarajan, said that more urban voters had opted for the DMK in Madurai as they were disgusted with the tardy execution of Smart Cities Mission projects. “The people are upset about the way they are being implemented and so wanted a change in the government,” he said. Brilliant campaign The DMK had also executed a brilliant publicity campaign in the urban areas of Madurai, resulting in better communication of the party’s agenda, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurais-urban-voters-have-thrown-in-their-lot-with-dmk/article34476567.ece
04 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen supply: two private hospitals press panic button||After two private hospitals flagged short supply of medical oxygen, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, has alerted Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan to act fast on the issue. In a tweet, Mr. Venkatesan said he received information about demand for oxygen increasing in private hospitals in Madurai. He also drew the attention of the Health Secretary by tagging him in his tweet. When asked, Mr. Venkatesan said he received SOS from two private hospitals in the city for replenishment of medical oxygen. “One hospital, with 11 COVID-19 patients on oxygen support, has oxygen stock that could last only till Monday night. With the oxygen supply seeming hard to come by, they sought my intervention. I have alerted the local health officials and the hospital has been promised fresh stock and uninterrupted oxygen supply,” Mr. Venkatesan said. A corporate hospital has also sought his help for oxygen supply. “Since the State has prioritised oxygen supply for government hospitals, private hospitals face problems,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said. This hospital has around 400 inpatients. “Though the hospital is not facing any imminent shortage of oxygen, there is a panic about routine supply getting affected, given the current situation,” Mr. Venkatesan said. From Kerala Stating that he had made attempts to facilitate oxygen supply for the hospital from Kerala, Mr. Venkatesan said that the Tamil Nadu government should be awake to the oxygen supply situation at this time of crisis. However, the MP said that government hospitals were getting regular supply till now.  Since the State has prioritised oxygen supply for GHs, private hospitals face problems Su.

04 May 2021||Namakkal,TAMIL NADU||NECC suggests egg price at Rs. 3.95||The Namakkal chapter of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) has fixed the price of egg at Rs. 3.95 on Monday. Namakkal is the major poultry hub of the country and eggs and poultry goods are exported from here to other States like Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and other Northern States. However, the price has been reducing since the past few weeks. Though there was an increasing trend in price during the beginning of April, the prices started reducing during the last weeks of the month. On April 8, the price of 100 eggs was Rs. 435. However, though the prices improved, the prices dropped to Rs. 415 on April 24 and to Rs. 385 on April 26. From April 29, the price of 100 egg was maintained at Rs. 395. P. Selvaraj, Chairman of NECC, Namakkal chapter said, “the price has been affected due to low consumption of poultry products due to summer. Also, lockdown and restrictions in other States has affected the sales in those region. We are hopeful that prices would further improve by end of summer season.” He said that approximately three crore eggs are supplied from the region on a day and there has not been any major issues with supply or production at the moment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/necc-suggests-egg-price-at-rs-395/article34476029.ece

04 May 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Cong., AIADMK taste worst defeat||The Congress and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam suffered the worst-ever poll debacle in the electoral history of the Union Territory. The national party which won 15 of the 21 seats it contested in the last Assembly poll declined to a single digit in the2021Assembly poll with three Ministers in the Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy-led Congress government losing their seats. The party could manage to win only 2 seats out of the 15 it contested pushing the party behind in the number of Assembly constituencies won by its alliance partner, DMK. The DMK won 6 of the 12 seats it contested in the polls. Prominent Congress leaders who lost the election are former Ministers M. Kandasamy, M.O.H F Shahjahan, R Kamalakannan, PCC chief A. V. Subramanian and former Government whip R. K. R Anantharaman. For the Congress, its misfortunes started weeks before the commencement of the Assembly poll with ministers and legislators deserting the party citing “differences” with the party’s local leadership, especially the Chief Minister. Interestingly, those who left the Congress to join the BJP and the All India N. R. Congress have won the election comfortably. The Congress suffered another setback when Mr. Narayanasamy himself “abstained” from contesting the poll inviting adverse publicity to the Congress during the election campaign. “It is anti-incumbency plus the perception generated before the poll itself that the party was not going to return to power which led to the debacle. The desertions before the poll and absence of a Chief Ministerial candidate led to our debacle. Even in2011Assembly poll held after Mr. Rangasamy left the party, the Congress managed to win seven seats. The party national leadership has to take a serious view of the affairs in the Union Territory,” said a former legislator. AIADMK loses all seats Equally unhappy about its performancewould be the AIADMK leadership as the party drew a blank for the first time in the last three decades. The AIADMK, which had four members in the last Assembly, lost all the five seats it contested in the poll. According to an AIADMK leader, the alliance with BJP had cost the party. “The party candidates in Karaikal South, Oupalam and Muthialpet lost a substantial chunk of minority votes. The party was also compelled to part winning seats such as Nellithope to the BJP due to the hard bargaining the saffron party made during the seat sharing talks,” he added. Another key aspect of the2021Assembly poll, would be the victory of Independent candidates. In a record, six Independents made it to the Assembly defeating party heavy weights, including former Chief Minister and AINRC chief N. Rangasamy in Yanam constituency. The Union Territory always had the presence of one or two Independents and they always played a crucial role in change of guards during the tenure of an Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-aiadmk-face-worst-ever-defeat/article34476639.ece

04 May 2021||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Vijayabaskar scores a hat-trick||Health Minister and sitting AIADMK candidate C. Vijayabaskar was re-elected for the third consecutive time from the Viralimalai Assembly constituency with the official declaration of his victory coming on Monday morning. The prolonged delay in announcement of Mr. Vijaybasker’s victory was due to stoppage of counting thrice on Sunday, leading to anxiety and tension. At the end of the final round of counting, Mr. Vijayabaskar won comfortably defeating his nearest DMK rival M. Palaniappan by a margin of 23,598 votes. Mr. Vijayabaskar polled 1,02,179 votes against 78,581 votes by Mr. Palaniappan. There were in all 22 candidates in the electoral fray in the constituency. Counting of votes for this constituency which started at 8 a.m. on Sunday along with the other five Assembly segments in the district was stopped for the first time in the morning, again in the afternoon hours and yet again late in the night after the completion of sixth round by when Mr. Vijayabaskar had gained a lead of 7,242 votes. The DMK initially complained and raised objections that the serial numbers in the control unit and that of the VVPAT differed which led to stoppage of counting. Heated arguments broke out between supporters of both parties at the counting centre. After some time, counting of votes resumed only to stop again after a coir thread was apparently noticed strapped on a box containing electronic voting machines triggering suspicion among DMK members who complained about some malpractice. Official sources said after detailed discussions with poll officials the counting of votes resumed well past midnight and went on till Monday morning. There were in all 23 rounds of counting. Mr. Vijayabaskar told reporters on Monday morning prior to announcement of the results that the margin of lead being high, he had wanted the results to be declared without delay. He said he had sent written representations to the Election Commission to declare the results as he had established a lead of over 23,000 votes. Official sources said votes polled in 13 electronic voting machines in which some objections were raised by the DMK members were also counted after bringing the issue to the notice of the Chief Electoral Officer and the results were officially declared on Monday morning. Mr. Vijayabaskar received the election certificate following his victory from the Returning Officer. In Tirumayam assembly constituency, former Union Minister and sitting DMK MLA S. Regupathy won by a thin margin of 1,382 votes defeating the AIADMK candidate P.K. Vairamuthu. Congress candidate T. Ramachandran won from Aranthangi constituency by a handsome margin of 30,893 votes. V. Muthuraja of the DMK won from Pudukottai assembly constituency by a margin of 13,001 votes defeating AIADMK's Karthik Thondaiman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vijayabaskar-scores-a-hat-trick-in-viralimalai/article34476008.ece
04 May 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Woman ‘offers’ tongue at temple||A 28-year-old woman allegedly cut a portion of her tongue and offered it to a temple at Paramakudi in the district on Monday. As news spread, locals rushed to Muthalamman Temple. They found a woman lying unconscious on the floor and immediately took her to government hospital. A portion of the cut-off tongue was also taken to the hospital. Doctors sutured the tongue and said the woman’s condition was stable. Due to the pandemic, temples were shut. Hence, the woman cut off her tongue and threw it in front of the temple and fell unconscious, passersby told police. Paramakudi Town police registered a case and preliminary inquiry revealed that the woman identified as K. Vanitha, 28, was married to Karthik, 32. The couple had two children.

04 May 2021||Thanjavur/Nagapattinam,TAMIL NADU||Number of COVID Care Centres goes up as cases increase||The district administrations in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam have increased the number of COVID Care Centres and the bed capacity, including beds with oxygen support, as the rate of infection reflected a sharp rise on Saturday and Sunday. While Thanjavur district had reported a gradual spike over the last month, with students of various schools reporting positive in April, the recent infections are among the general public. Keeping in mind the increasing trend, the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital has suspended all elective surgeries and treatments; only emergency care wing will be functional. A total of 1,060 beds, of which 389 have oxygen support and 218 are in the intensive-care unit have been readied, official sources said. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation Limited has helped set up a 10KL liquid oxygen tank on the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital campus. The civil work has been completed and the tank was ready for installation. Remdesivir and other necessary medication were also available. Speaking to The Hindu , S. Marudhudurai, Medical Superintendent, TMCH said that diverting all staff nurses and medical staff, other than those on emergency care duty has helped handle the spike. “Of the 380 staff nurses, 60% of them are on COVID duty on rotation. The process to recruit more nurses is also under way”, he said. The diversion has reduced the stress on the staff as COVID care is an intense service. A fully functional COVID Care Centre in Vallam has also been established with 640 beds. As of Sunday, 430 asymptomatic patients were receiving treatment at the centre, while two more- in Pattukottai and Kumbakonam have also been readied. Meanwhile, in the event of TMCH running out of beds to accommodate patients, the Raja Mirasudhar Government Hospital has readied 400 beds of which 178 are with oxygen support. Meanwhile, in Nagapattinam, which has reported a sudden surge in COVID cases, COVID Care Centres, with a capacity of 550 beds have been set up. District Health officials were focused on contact tracing to avoid further spread of the infection. When a patient tests positive, it was determined whether the case was mild, moderate or severe. Severe and moderate cases were being taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Nagapattinam where there were 200 beds of which 110 have oxygen support, Mayiladuthurai GH with 210 beds or Sirkazhi GH with 150 beds. If the patient has a mild infection, he was being either shifted to the COVID Care Centre or based on consultation with block-level health officers, shifted for home quarantine, District Epidemiologist A. Liakath Ali, said. At least 15 to 30 primary contacts were being tested per patient who reports positive. “If the patient reports visiting an event, or a shop, those individuals are also tested,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/number-of-covid-care-centres-goes-up-as-cases-increase/article34476000.ece

04 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Health workers under strain as COVID-19 spike continues||Doctors in hospitals in the central region have raised complaints of shortage of staff and misleading RT-PCR reports of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, flagging major challenges faced by healthcare professionals as they combat the second wave of the pandemic. Hospitals in Tiruchi and Thanjavur districts that have been witnessing a sharp increase in the number of cases and it has stretched the manpower to its full capacity. At the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, 380 nurses are on duty, of whom only 45 are on COVID-19 duty. They work in shifts, with 12 nurses in each shift managing at least 400 patients. This implies one nurse is deputed to look after at least 50 patients. “At times like this when deaths and severity of cases are on the rise, we are simply unable to manage,” a nurse at the GH said. The remaining nurses at the Tiruchi GH have been deputed to other wards, emergency, and trauma care, etc. “Last year, the entire healthcare workforce was deployed for COVID duty. This year, with no lockdown, it is different,” the nurse said. The increasing workload and paucity of manpower have caused severe stress, they say. “We are unable to cope. There is no time to breathe, and we see so many deaths every day; it is bound to take a toll on us. The authorities must pay heed and help us out,” a senior staff nurse told The Hindu . As many as 30 nursing students from private colleges were diverted to the Tiruchi MGMGH by the district administration. However, they are on non-COVID duty, they said. In Thanjavur, doctors continue to struggle convincing attenders of COVID-19 patients to follow protocol. “They refuse to wear masks and PPE kits. They will put themselves, and others outside at risk,” a senior health official here said. S. Maruthudurai, Medical Superintendent, Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, said that despite diverting all their manpower to the treatment of COVID-19, they are on the lookout for more staff. Dr. Maruthudurai said that nearly 200 patients admitted to the TMCH are patients who are termed as ‘suspected COVID’ cases. These patients come with all the COVID-19 symptoms, a CT- scan showing lung involvement of the infection, but a negative RT-PCR test. “We call them Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses, and treating them takes a sizeable portion of our manpower. These patients are not officially counted as COVID patients but we must treat them so,” he said. Meanwhile, private hospitals in panic, refer even patients with moderate symptoms to the TMCH, he said. Dr. A. Liakath Ali, District Epidemiologist, Nagapattinam echoed Dr. Maruthudurai's thoughts. “While the lockdown was effective last year, the potency of the virus was low. This time around, with the new variants, it is affecting patients severely,” he said. Not observing COVID-19 protocol has been one of the main reasons for the spike in cases, along with the relaxation of norms.  There is no time to breathe and we see so many deaths every day; it is bound to take a toll on us. The authorities must help us out Senior staff nurse Tiruchi MGMGH||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-workers-under-strain-as-covid-19-spike-continues/article34476003.ece
04 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK’s washout in Tiruchi surprises many||The total washout of the AIADMK in Tiruchi district, which was for long the party’s fortress, has caused disbelief among political observers. Out of nine constituencies, the DMK spared none to the AIADMK, which had held its sway in at least six rural constituencies for decades. The major cause for disappointment among AIADMK workers is the victory of DMK candidates with massive vote margins in some of the constituencies in Tiruchi as well as Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. While the DMK chose to field its candidates in seven of the nine constituencies in Tiruchi, leaving two to its allies, Chrishthuva Nallenna Iyakkam (CNI) and the Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK), the AIADMK contested in eight seats, leaving one to its ally, the TMC. Allotted to allies There was skepticism among the rank and file of the DMK when Tiruchi (East) and Manapparai constituencies were allotted to its allies. The candidates, Abdul Samad of the MMK and Inigo Irudhayaraj of the CNI, both were outsiders to their respective constituencies, and had to work overtime to win over the confidence of the DMK workers. But the AIADMK candidates failed to capitalise the outsider’s tag and their unfamiliarity. AIADMK (Tiruchi urban) secretary Vellamandi N. Natarajan faced a humiliating defeat at the hands of Mr. Irudhayaraj, a novice to electoral battle, with a whopping margin of 53,797 votes in Tiruchi (East) constituency. DMK heavyweight K.N. Nehru romped home with a margin of 80,927 votes against V. Padmanathan of the AIADMK. Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, who contested in Thiruverumbur, too managed to defeat his nearest rival, P. Kumar of the AIADMK, close to the margin of 50,000 votes. Traditional strongholds Out of nine constituencies, Srirangam, Manapparai, Musiri, Mannachanallur and Thuraiyur had been the traditional strongholds of the AIADMK. Since 1991, it has not tasted whitewash in the district except in 1996. Many feel it is the worst performances of the party in the region since inception. Indications are that Mutharaiyars, a dominant caste in the rural segments of the district, did not reinforce their faith in the AIADMK. The absence of a strong local-level leadership to steer the party and galvanize the workers to convince the voters about performance of the government had apparently dented the AIADMK vote bank. Lack of clear understanding among the workers on executing the “macro and micro” plan of the party leadership, infighting and improper candidate selection were also the factors for the debacle of the AIADMK. On the other hand, Mr. Nehru, who played a key role in ensuring the victory of all 14 panchayat unions in the local body elections played his trump card again to make strong inroad in the AIADMK bastions. “After the demise of Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK appears to have given room for the emergence of lobbyists at the regional level, who in turn groom followers and groups. Party tickets were given to their loyalists. It is one of the main reasons for the washout of the AIADMK in Tiruchi,” says a party veteran and a former Minister.  Party tickets were given to the loyalists of regional lobbyists.

04 May 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||What helped Raju defeat Dhinakaran||A likely consolidation of voters of non-Mukkulathor communities in Kovilpatti Assembly constituency may have helped AIADMK’s Kadambur C.Raju defeat AMMK founder T.T.V. Dhinakaran. The AMMK leader had shifted to Kovilpatti down south hoping to spring a surprise much like he did in Chennai’s Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar constituency in a by-poll in 2017. His supporters back then argued that it would be an easy victory for the party as post-delimitation, the Kovilpatti constituency had a sizeable percentage of voters from the Mukkulathor community to which Mr. Dhinakaran belongs. Some political analysts too had seen this as a shrewd move on the ground that if he won big, in a post-election scenario a weakened AIADMK could look up to him for direction. “Since we (AMMK) have got strong presence everywhere, I have come to Kovilpatti from R.K. Nagar,” Mr. Dhinakaran had reasoned. He toured extensively across Tamil Nadu for electioneering while dedicating only a few days for canvassing in Kovilpatti Assembly segment as he was confident of a good show. Moreover, the AMMK candidate for Thoothukudi Parliamentary constituency N. Bhuvaneswaran had polled over 19,000 votes in Kovilpatti Assembly segment alone. Kayathar union chairman and AMMK’s southern region organising secretary S.V.S.P. Manickaraja, who is believed to have convinced Mr. Dhinakaran to choose Kovilpatti, too was hopeful of victory. The AMMK anticipated that the imprisonment of Mr.Dhinakaran’s aunt V.K. Sasikala, in the disproportionate assets case and her recent release, could trigger sympathy from voters of her community. However, the trust they had reposed on the caste factor backfired with Mr. Raju getting a third straight win to the Assembly from the constituency. It is felt that voters of other communities favoured the resourceful Mr. Raju. Political analyst Surya Xavier said a leader who should have identified himself as a representative of all sections of the society, should not have come to Kovilpatti with an eye on getting the support of a particular caste. “While the AMMK hoped to get rousing support of Thevar community voters, other community voters have solidly backed Mr. Raju which made his win easier than thought. Moreover, the linguistic minorities living in Kovilpatti did not want them to be represented by a person with different identity. All resulted in the election of Mr. Raju,” Mr. Surya Xavier felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/what-helped-raju-defeat-dhinakaran/article34475990.ece

Stalin for the victory in the Assembly election. As the cinemas in the State have been impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said waiving these taxes would help reduce ticket costs, which in turn would encourage more people to visit the cinemas once they become operational. Many associations in the Tamil film fraternity, including the Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association, will conduct a felicitation ceremony for Mr. Stalin after the pandemic subsides, Mr. Subramaniam said.

04 May 2021||Tiruvarur,TAMIL NADU||‘Discontent among farmers led to DMK’s victory’||The All Farmers Organisation Coordination Committee (AFOCC), Tamil Nadu, has presumed that the united agitation of agricultural community against the “three anti-farmer laws” was the reason for the victory of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and this had way for its president M. K.Stalin to become the Chief Minister of the State. In a statement issued on May 2, the association president P. R. Pandian said that the farmers affected by the anti-people policies and the three anti-farmer laws enacted by the Union government, have voted against the ruling establishment in the Assembly elections. The fear among farmers about losing their right over the Cauvery waters in view of the implementation of ‘surplus water diversion’ project had prompted them to vote out the AIADMK government in unison. The AFOCC had organised several agitations till the eleventh hour of the elections in rural pockets to ensure that farmers repose their faith in the DMK for the betterment of their lives, Mr. Pandian said, exuding hope that the new government will accord priority for the farming community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/discontent-among-farmers-led-to-dmks-victory/article34476001.ece

However, the party could fare well only in three out of six Assembly constituencies where it had fielded its candidates. Sitting MLA M.S.R. Rajavarman took the top position with the most number of votes. He secured 32,916 votes, which proved detrimental to the victory of AIADMK candidate, R.K. Ravichandran, who lost to DMK’s A.R.R. Raghuraman by a margin of 11,179 votes. Similarly, the votes secured by Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam candidate, K.

04 May 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Fall of Rajenthra Bhalaji||He rose from a humble background and went on to become a Minister, not once but twice, and Virudhunagar district secretary of AIADMK for a decade. But, after having earned enmity all around, Minister for Dairy Development K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji lost to sitting MLA from Rajapalayam S. Thangapandian with a margin of 3,789 votes. Mr. Bhalaji became popular among the people with his frequent controversial comments on various issues after the demise of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. He was seen as being cosy with the BJP after his “Modi is our daddy” remark in the run-up to 2019 Parliamentary elections. Since then he started to make caustic remarks against his political opponents. Some of his remarks against the minorities during passage of Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act did not go well even with his party leadership. Subsequently, he was relieved from his party post. However, later he was made the party secretary of West Virudhunagar district unit after its bifurcation. The Opposition accused him of attack on a journalist and amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income, for which he is facing a case in High Court. Rajavarman factor However, when he developed enmity with his party MLA M.S.R. Rajavarman, several of his party men started complaining against him for bad mouthing and high-handedness. Mr. Rajavarman even complained that the Minister had threatened him with dire consequences. After Mr. Rajavarman vowed that his supporters would ensure the defeat of the Minister, Mr. Bhalaji switched to Rajapalayam Assembly constituency from Sivakasi, from where he had won twice. In the run-up to the election, some of his loyalists and party men left the AIADMK complaining against the Minister’s rude behaviour. They said Mr. Bhalaji was not allowing any party men to grow fearing that they would challenge his position in the party. “It was Mr. Bhalaji who denied seat to former MP T. Radhakrishnan and sitting MLA M. Chandraprabha (Srivilliputtur), who had remained with him all along,” a former MLA said. DMK cadre was also bent upon defeating Mr. Bhalaji after his “derogatory” remarks against their party president M.K. Stalin. Mr. Bhalaji said all DMK leaders were campaigning in Rajapalayam with the aim of defeating him. After claiming that he was behind all development works taken up in Rajapalayam, he sought votes for overall development of the constituency. But, his words failed to win the confidence of the voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-of-rajenthra-bhalaji/article34476017.ece

Kayalvizhi, who contested against BJP State president L. Murugan, was formally declared the winner with a margin of 1,393 in the early hours of Monday. Official sources familiar with the developments told The Hindu that the result was announced by the Returning Officer of Dharapuram (Reserved) constituency Pavankumar G. Giriyappanavar at around 12.30 a.m. at the counting centre in Tiruppur. While Mr. Murugan was leading in terms of number of votes since the beginning of the counting exercise till Round 13, Ms. Kayalvizhi took a surprise lead from Round 14. The margin of lead began with a few hundred votes and widened to over 2,000 votes and by the 24th and penultimate round of counting, her margin of lead was only 668 votes. As the 25th and final round commenced on Sunday evening, one control unit of electronic voting machine (EVM) for polling station 298A was reported to have malfunctioned. At this point, agents from the BJP and two other Independent candidates petitioned Mr. Giriyappanavar demanding recount of votes including postal votes. At around 9.30 p.m., Mr. Giriyappanavar issued an order rejecting the petitions demanding the recount of votes, the sources said. “...In case the victory margin is less than the total number of postal votes received, then only there should be a mandatory verification of all rejected postal ballots. Since the margin is more, the question of re-verification/recount does not arise,” he said in the order. Mr. Giriyappanavar ordered the counting of the voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machine for the malfunctioned EVM in a separate 26th round. Following the counting of the 393 votes in the EVM, Ms. Kayalvizhi still maintained the lead over Mr. Murugan. Following the counting of the remaining postal votes, it was seen that Ms. Kayalvizhi garnered 89,986 votes and Mr. Murugan secured 88,593 votes in total, following which she was formally declared as the winner of Dharapuram (Reserved) constituency, according to the sources.

Its candidates were defeated in all 10 Assembly seats including Singanallur, the lone constituency it had won in 2016. This is the second time in a decade the party, which is set to form the next government, is facing such a debacle. The DMK leadership had gone all out to target outgoing Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and Deputy Speaker Pollachi V.Jayaraman. Yet voters gave the AIADMK a sweep. AIADMK spokesperson Kovai K. Selvaraj said the sweep was an endorsement that the voters did not believe the DMK’s charges. He told The Hindu that the party’s strong cadre base helped it win. Claiming that the AIADMK has around 4.7 lakh members in Coimbatore district, he asserted that their groundwork led to the victory. “Many parties would not even have workers in some villages, but for us, there would be between 150 and 200 party workers for each polling booth,” Mr. Selvaraj said. These cadres countered the “false campaign” against Mr.Velumani and Mr.Jayaraman, he added. The AIADMK won nine seats, while Coimbatore South was bagged by Vanathi Srinivasan of BJP, who defeated Makkal Needhi Maiam leader Kamal Haasan by a slender margin. A DMK functionary, requesting anonymity, said the results showed voters from the Kongu Vellala Gounder community, a dominant caste in the district, did not favour the party. “People from this community feel that they would be more secure with the AIADMK in power,” he said lamenting that his party had not ensured adequate representation for Gounders in party posts or administrative posts when in power. He gave the example of R. Sakkarapani of the DMK, a member of the Kongu Vellala Gounder, who won for the sixth consecutive time from Oddanchathram in Dindigul district. “He was not given a cabinet berth in 1996 and 2006,” the DMK leader said. “The caste factor could have worked. But we need to study the results in detail,” said Coimbatore MP PR Natarajan of the CPI(M).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/caste-factor-cadre-base-helped-aiadmk-in-coimbatore-region/article34476429.ece

Manjunath Prasad, who is also member-secretary of the executive committee of the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority.  The Hindu had reported on May 2 on the toll the pandemic was taking on the children of parents affected by the pandemic. Messages are being circulated on social media platforms about children, whose parents had succumbed to COVID-19, being up for adoption, which sent warning signals to several child rights’ activists in the city. The Karnataka government’s Childline (1098), that is run by Childline India Foundation, has also been receiving stray calls from across the State on children orphaned after their parents succumbed to COVID-19. Many callers seek food assistance for children whose parents are hospitalised or are in need of oxygen support. A group of experts, government officials and members of several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is now working together to identify such cases and ensure that the children’s rights are protected and they are cared for. Vasudeva Sharma, director of Childline Nodal Agency, said that such mischievous messages on children ready for adoption is tantamount to trafficking. He said that the Centre had recently issued a directive to all States to ensure that the local Childline unit contacts the child to confirm the case, and produce the child before the Child Welfare Committee. The district administrations were directed to take steps to immediately restore normalcy in the life of children orphaned by COVID-19. Uma Mahadevan, IAS officer who has coordinated efforts to form the expert group, said that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was being drawn up for such cases. “It is an evolving situation. While some children may require short-term care, there may be cases where the children have no kin and need to be taken into care by the State. We are looking at various possible scenarios to ensure that the child’s rights and interests are protected,” she said, adding that the SOP would be ready in a few days. Sindhu Naik, who is part of the expert group, said the kind of support a child needs would depend on the situation, whether there is an adult at home available to take care, whether relatives and friends of the parents step in. “We are still working on the modalities. Meanwhile, a few childcare institutions have come forward to provide care for such children,” she said.  It is an evolving situation. While some children may require short-term care, there may be cases where the children have no kin and need to be taken into care by the State. We are looking at various possible scenarios Uma Mahadevan, IAS officer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/efforts-on-to-help-orphaned-children/article34476415.ece
04 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hospitals asked to use ‘scarce resource’ oxygen judiciously||Hours after the tragedy in Chamarajanagar that claimed 23 lives in the district hospital, allegedly on account of oxygen scarcity, the State government sprung into action putting in place a stringent system for “rational and judicious use” of oxygen in hospitals, as it is a “scarce resource”. Hospitals have been directed toshore up their storage capacity and ensure they are able to store up to three day’s worth of oxygen requirement on the premises in cylinders, or by putting up a plant, to prevent a tragedy such as the one in Chamarajanagar. However, shortage of oxygen remains an issue, sources said.While the projected demand in the State is 1,471 tonnes per day (TPD), the State has been allotted 865 TPD of medical oxygen from the Central grid. However, sources said that even the allotted oxygen was not reaching the State. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday directed officials to ensure supply of the allocated quantity of oxygen to the State from the centralised grid. Generator plants The State government is now looking at alternative sources of oxygen to tide over the shortage as far as possible. The Health and Family Welfare Department has directed every dedicated COVID-19 hospital to set up an oxygen generation plant with a capacity to meet the hospital’s need for a day. The government has also mandated the deployment of oxygen concentrators for mild cases. Meanwhile, the State government has devised an audit mechanism both at the supply (producers and refillers) and the consumption (hospitals) side to conserve oxygen. As oxygen is a scarce resource, it has to be judiciously used and wastage completely avoided, senior officials said. The Health and Family Welfare Department has asked all hospitals to form oxygen audit committees. In a detailed six-page list of guidelines on rational use of oxygen in treating COVID-19 patients, hospitals have been directed to classify the patients and accommodate them in five zones based on their oxygen needs, which will be reviewed and reclassified daily. Oxygen concentrators have to be used wherever possible. Oxygen saturation is to be adjusted to the lowest permissible level to target an oxygen saturation of 92% to 94%. Prone position is to be used intermittently to improve saturation levels.  Plants to be monitored  The State government has brought all the oxygen producers and refillers under its direct supervision. The plants will be monitored by a camp officer of a rank not lower than tahsildar to ensure smooth supply of oxygen to hospitals. Refillers should also submit details every day for an audit.        Regulating usage Hospitals have to classify patients and accommodate them in five zones based on their oxygen needs, which will be reviewed and reclassified daily  Oxygen saturation is to be adjusted to the lowest permissible level to target an oxygen saturation of 92% to 94%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospitals-asked-to-use-scarce-resource-oxygen-judiciously/article34476193.ece
04 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Once a ‘green district’, Chamarajanagar saw massive COVID-19 surge in April||Chamarajanagar, which managed to remain COVID-19 free for over three months after the pandemic broke out last year in Karnataka and was declared a green district, has seen a moving growth rate (MGR) of nearly six times more than the rest of Karnataka (excluding Bengaluru Urban) in terms of active cases during the second wave. Since March 30, excluding Bengaluru Urban, rest of Karnataka (29 districts) collectively recorded 1,087% growth rate in active cases. In Chamarajanagar, this increased by 5,844%. Active cases in the district shot up to 2,390 on April 30 from 34 on March 31. As on May 3, active cases stood at 3,098, bringing Chamarajanagar among the group of 19 districts that have over 3,000 active cases. From 17 active cases on February 28, the number nearly doubled in a month on March 31. Active cases started increasing from April 7 and touched 313 on April 15 from 179 on April 7. This number more than doubled to touch 637 on April 20 and stood at 2,390 on April 30. Besides, this district has recorded a 45% increase in the 28-day MGR of positivity cases since March 31 and is now one among the top 10 districts, according to an analysis by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Medical Association and Proxima, a management consulting firm. Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, said nearly 6,000% MGR of active cases in Chamarajanagar even after 15 months into the pandemic, clearly confirms complete breakdown of containment management here. “We are recording hospitalisation rate of around 30% during the second wave. Chamarajanagar needs approximately 1,000 beds to treat the current active cases and at least 100-150 ventilators. Unfortunately, the district is not equipped to handle the influx of patients. Nearly half of the new cases reported daily are under home isolation that need regular and proper monitoring,” he said. According to projections by experts, cases will start declining in Bengaluru Urban May 10 onwards. However, what is worrisome is that there will be a steep rise in cases in the rest of Karnataka after that. “We have been discussing this in our meetings with the government. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended that there should be district specific plans for pandemic management. We should now strengthen the health infrastructure and necessary consumables, including oxygen, in the districts,” said C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said Karnataka should now be considered as a country as different districts will witness a surge at different points. “Earlier, Bengaluru Urban recorded 70% of the daily total caseload. But now the surge in districts is 50% of the total caseload. This will further increase and we need proper management strategies for the districts too,” he said. A senior health official admitted that management of the pandemic has become difficult due to the unprecedented surge in cases during the second wave. “We had underestimated the second wave and were not prepared. It is a challenge to sustain the same pace as our systems were designed to manage short-term crises,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/once-a-green-district-chamarajanagar-saw-massive-covid-19-surge-in-april/article34476059.ece
04 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Officials told to ramp up oxygen supply||Rattled by the severe shortage of oxygen supply in hospitals burdened with COVID-19 patients and the death of 23 patients at a district hospital in Chamarajanagar, the State government on Monday convened a meeting of oxygen manufacturers and suppliers and decided to ramp up the supply of oxygen across Karnataka. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa chaired the meeting at his official residence here and instructed officials to take steps to ensure there is no reduction in quantity of oxygen supplied to the State from the Union government quota. He told officials to reduce the time required for filling up oxygen tankers. In an hour-long meeting with representatives of oxygen manufacturers and suppliers, it was decided that signal-free green corridors would be provided for oxygen tankers to ensure timely supply of the liquid to hospitals. Oxygen manufacturers and suppliers were directed to resolve the issues and problems by approaching the officials concerned directly and to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen. Toll plazas on national highways have been told to ensure free movement of tankers carrying oxygen. In case of shortage of tankers and drivers, officials have been told to utilise LPG tankers and their drivers for faster transportation. At the meeting, it was also proposed to convert nitrogen and argon tankers available for supplying oxygen Last Saturday, the Chief Minister held a meeting with heads of top private hospitals in the city and promised to provide financial support to set up oxygen plants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/officials-told-to-ramp-up-oxygen-supply/article34476200.ece
04 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court directs State govt. to implement ‘Shuchi’ scheme in letter and spirit||The High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government “to implement in letter and spirit” the ‘Shuchi’ scheme, a menstrual hygiene project of distributing sanitary napkins to around 17 lakh beneficiary adolescent girls, for the year 2021-22. The court issued the direction while noting that the scheme was not implemented in 2019-20 and 2020-21 as the procurement of sanitary napkins to be distributed to adolescent girls was not done because of financial constraints. “In our view, the provision of separate toilets for adolescent girls in schools and that of [providing] sanitary napkins to such girls on a regular basis are all instances of not only empowerment of the girl child, but also implementation of the fundamental right under Article 21A of the Constitution insofar as girls aged between six to 14 are concerned,” observed a Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice J.M. Khazi. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition, filed in 2018 by the city-based Anti-Corruption Council of India, through which the court is monitoring infrastructure in schools, health check-up of children, and the implementation of the ‘Shuchi’ scheme in schools. “While we appreciate the State for envisaging such a scheme, it is necessary to emphasise that it should be implemented in its true letter and spirit,” the Bench observed. Nod for procurement Earlier, the government counsel told the court that this month, administrative approval would be sought and within 90 days thereafter, around 2.04 crore sanitary napkins would be procured. In the event schools are closed, there will be community-based door-to-door distribution through health workers, but if the schools reopen the distribution of the hygiene products shall be done at the schools themselves, the counsel told the court. The State government’s ‘Shuchi’ scheme covers adolescent girls in the age group of 10 to 19. The government told the Bench that a budgetary estimate of Rs. 47 crore has been made for the procurement of these hygiene products this year. In rural areas The Bench pointed out that proper implementation of the ‘Shuchi’ scheme would help empower adolescent girls, particularly those residing in rural and remote areas who travel to the taluk and district headquarters for education. They usually miss attendance on certain days of the month during menstruation on account of not having these hygiene products.

04 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||FIR against Karnataka officer for ‘insulting’ RTI activist||The Vidhana Soudha police have registered an FIR against State Information Commissioner K.E. Kumaraswamy under the SC,ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for allegedly insulting and abusing an RTI activist during the hearing of a case. The police were allegedly reluctant to receive the complaint, following which the complainant had to approach senior police officers before approaching the court. Based on the directions of the court, the Vidhana Soudha police have taken up a case against Mr. Kumaraswamy on May 1. Mr. Narayanaswamy, RTI applicant from Srinivasapura, filed an application before the Public Information Officer, District Manager Office, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Development Corporation, Kolar, in January last year seeking information on the tender notifications issued for digging of borewells and supply of pumpsets under Ganga Kalyana scheme in all taluks of Kolar district. As no information was provided, he filed a first appeal and thereafter, a second appeal before the Karnataka Information Commission in May last year. According to Mr. Narayanaswamy, during the hearing of the appeal, he was humiliated by the Commissioner and a detailed complaint was filed before the Vidana Soudha police in March. However, the inspector refused to receive the application, he alleged. Later, the complaint was sent by registered post. On March 6, about 50 activists of DSS and other social activists met the Chief Information Commissioner and submitted a memorandum and requested appropriate action. Later, a delegation met the Additional Director General of Police, Civil Rights Enforcement Directorate, and requested action. They also visited the police station and filed a complaint. However, no case was registered. Instead, an FIR was registered against the RTI applicant on March 10 by the Secretary of Karnataka Information Commission based on the orders of the Information Commissioner.  Aggrieved, Mr. Narayanaswamy filed a private complaint before the jurisdictional magistrate and was later on referred to the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vidhana Soudha division, for investigation. Although the post of State Information Commissioner is equivalent to the Chief Secretary, the FIR was earlier refused by the police stating that they cannot register an FIR against the Commissioner without prior approval of the High Court of Karnataka, he said in his complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fir-against-karnataka-officer-for-insulting-rti-activist/article34476068.ece

04 May 2021||Bengaluru/Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Police turn to pressure cooker steam therapy||Every day, personnel at Sarjapur police station gather around a pressure cooker that has been converted into an inhalation device. The cooker is filled with boiled water and topped with herbs and leaves from medicinal plants like neem, tulsi and eucalyptus. It emits steam that police personnel inhale through vents. From practising pranayama to taking kashaya and zinc tablets, police personnel in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka are increasingly adopting different measures in an attempt to keep COVID-19 at bay. The latest trend is medicinal inhalation. Harish V., station in-charge, recently ordered a custom-made cooker, which has a long steel pipe and a pair of vents that two police personnel can use at a time. “Staff have been asked to inhale steam after completing their shift, and before returning home,” Mr. Harish said . The pandemic has taken its toll, not just on police personnel but also on their loved ones. At Sarjapur station, staff are given tablets. “However, when I came across this pressure cooker therapy, I decided to introduce it at the station,” he added. This trend has caught on at Barke police station in Mangaluru where a steel pipe with four openings has been tied to a wooden frame. Police personnel can inhale steam through three vents while the fourth is connected to a pressure cooker via a rubber pipe. Inspector Jyotirling Honakatti, who conceptualised this idea, said he inhaled steam in his house during his stint in Belagavi last year. “When Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar asked us to take steps to prevent COVID-19 infection, I took his permission to have this facility at the police station,” he told The Hindu . Several police stations in Chitradurga, Shivamogga and Haveri districts have introduced this facility for personnel, while others have expressed interest in starting something similar. “We are getting inquiries from colleagues in neighbouring stations,” said a police officer from Sarjapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-turn-to-pressure-cooker-steam-therapy/article34476421.ece

The Deputy Commissioner said that in all, 1,753 COVID-19 patients are getting treated in various hospitals of the district, including KIMS and the District Hospital. Of these, 742 patients are in KIMS, There are 757 beds and 32 ventilators still available for emergency treatment. Of the 1,753 patients, 371 are in ICU. Out of the total 180 ventilators in the district, 148 are under use at present, he said. To a query, he clarified that the supply of Remdesivir injection to the district has been continuous and subsequently, they are forwarded to hospitals that have a requirement. Next consignment Mr. Patil said that the next consignment of Covishiled vaccine would reach the district on Wednesday. “Those who have already received the first dose should get the second dose between the sixth and eighth week from the date of the first dose. “Doctors have said that if there is a delay in getting the vaccine, there is nothing to panic about. But, still all steps are being taken to get timely vaccine for the citizens,” he said. 85% in twin cities The Deputy Commissioner said that among the positive cases in the district, 85% are from the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad and the remaining are from the rural areas. He said that on an average, swabs of 4,000 people are being collected for testing and positive reports are being dispatched within a time of 24 to 36 hours. Admitting that there is a delay in giving reports of those who have tested negative for the infection, he said that the delay is due to samples arriving from other districts to the laboratories in the district. But all efforts are being made to give the reports early, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-is-no-dearth-of-oxygen-adequate-ventilators-beds-available/article34476051.ece
04 May 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Minister Patil seeks cooperation from people||While the impact of the second wave of the pandemic has been severe in the State, the situation in Gadag district is under control and people should cooperate with the district administration by adhering to COVID-19 protocol, Minister for Information and Public Relations and district in-charge for Gadag C.C. Patil has said. He was speaking to presspersons after holding a review meeting on the pandemic with elected representatives and officials in Gadag on Monday.

04 May 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Madhavi Joshi, granddaughter of Gangubai Hangal, no more||Some of the family members of legendary vocalist the late Gangubai Hangal, including her son Baburao Hangal and grandson Arun Hangal, have tested positive for COVID-19, while a granddaughter, Madhavi Joshi, has succumbed to the infection. The condition of Mr. Baburao Hangal, 90, is serious. He is in an ICU of a private hospital in Bengaluru. His son Arun Hangal, admitted in the same hospital, is on oxygen support. All three had recently held a press meet in Hubballi in connection with Ganga Lahari, the home of Gangubai Hangal, and wanted it to be declared a monument. Ms. Madhavi Joshi’s husband Biswajit Joshi, a railway contractor, said that after testing positive, his wife was admitted to a private hospital in Pune in Maharashtra, but she developed complications and breathed her last. She was 55 and is survived by her husband, son Manas, and daughter Aishwarya. Ms. Madhavi wanted her grandmother’s musical tradition to continue by converting her home in Hubballi, which has been visited by legendary musicians, into a monument. She wanted it to be done either by handing it over to the government or by constituting a trust to maintain it. After the death of her brother Manoj Hangal two years ago, Ganga Lahari along with its museum of classical music remained closed as her father Baburao had to shift to Bengaluru for treatment. The subsequent lockdown forced the family to stay away from Hubballi. But when the rules were relaxed, Ms. Madhavi visited Hubballi on a regular basis for maintaining the house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/madhavi-joshi-granddaughter-of-gangubai-hangal-no-more/article34476203.ece
04 May 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Private hospitals in Kalaburagi facing shortage of oxygen||The rapidly widening gap between demand and supply of medical oxygen has pushed healthcare facilities into a deep crisis in Kalaburagi. Particularly, private hospitals and critical COVID-19 patients being treated on oxygen fear the worst, with the district administration allegedly asking oxygen suppliers to cut supply to private hospitals by half to augment supplies in government hospitals. There were four oxygen plants in the district that supplied oxygen to various hospitals in the district after converting it from liquid to gas and filling it in cylinders. Two of them recently downed their shutters mounting more pressure on the remaining plants. For the last two days, the administration deployed police force in the plants to ensure diversion of filled cylinders to government facilities, especially to ESIC Medical Complex where ICU bed capacity is being expanded. The local administration has even collected oxygen cylinders from private hospitals for the purpose. Supply stopped Some hospitals had managed to get supply from Raichur till the last few days. However, increased local demand compelled the Raichur district administration to stop supply to Kalaburagi. “We need at least 200 oxygen cylinders a day, of which we used to get 100 from Raichur. After Raichur supplies were stopped, we had to depend on local suppliers who hardly give 50 cylinders a day. There are a number of critical COVID-19 patients, who are on oxygen support in this hospital. How do we treat them without oxygen?” asked the managing director of a private hospital. He pointed out that despite having enough time after the first wave, the administration hardly did anything to augment and streamline oxygen production and supplies. It is now a knee-jerk reaction with no contingency plan, he added.  Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna, taking note of the increased consumption of oxygen, has directed an oxygen audit to ensure its optimum utilisation. Health authorities have also told hospitals to stop using high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) that requires more oxygen and instead use a non-invasive ventilation method to save oxygen. “It is true that private hospitals are reeling under oxygen crisis due to inadequate supply. We have asked all hospitals to stop HFNC so that a certain amount of oxygen could be saved and used for other patients,” Gopal Rao Bhandari, Assistant Drug Controller who was involved in the pandemic control exercise, told The Hindu . “If the government is not able to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to private hospitals, it should better ask private parties to close down their COVID-19 hospitals and shift all patients to government hospitals,” a doctor who runs a COVID-19 hospital said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-hospitals-in-kalaburagi-facing-shortage-of-oxygen/article34476056.ece

04 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Animal waste found dumped into rivulet near Farangipet||Farangipet located between Mangaluru and BC Road on National Highway 75 once infamous for stench emanating from fish stalls located on the highway continues to remain infamous even after these stalls have been shifted. Even before entering Farangipet, just after one crosses Arkula Junction, one would be welcomed by a reeking rivulet filled to its brim with animal waste. Over the years, meat merchants of Farangipet and adjoining areas have made this rivulet joining the Netravathi a little ahead, a dumping yard for animal waste. Although stench from the fish stalls in Farangipet town has considerably reduced after they were relocated a little ahead on the flanks of National Highway 75 because of enhanced hygiene, dumping of animal waste continues to haunt the region. The stalls were shifted after the Railways reclaimed its land on which they were located a couple of years ago. The rivulet has its origin somewhere near Mermajal Hills a few kilometres to the North of National Highway 75 and joins the Netravathi between Arkula and Farangipet. Culverts of the highway on this rivulet provide easy access to people to dump waste. Thousands of tonnes of waste has got accumulated in the rivulet over the years, said Ahmed Bawa, a resident of the area. Immediate action When The Hindu brought this to the notice of the district administration and the Zilla Panchayat, both responded positively and promised to take immediate action to curb dumping of waste. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that it [dumping waste] was unpardonable and he would ask the Zilla Panchayat to act immediately. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Kumara said that he sent executive officers of Mangaluru and Bantwal taluk panchayats along with panchayat development officers of Arkula and Pudu gram panchayats to the spot immediately. The officials told meat merchants in no uncertain terms not to dump animal and other waste into the rivulet and warned them that they will impose hefty penalty, Mr. Kumara said. The panchayats would also take steps to clear the already dumped waste from the rivulet, he said.  Fencing Meanwhile, MLA U.T. Khader, under whose constituency Pudu panchayat falls, said that he would consider erecting fences on the guard walls of the rivulet and adjoining areas to prevent waste dumping. Mr. Khader, who was instrumental in getting fences erected on the guard walls of the Netravathi Bridge between Mangaluru and Thokkottu to prevent suicides, said that barbed wire fencing could be prone to destruction and instead, metal sheet fencing would be done.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/animal-waste-found-dumped-into-rivulet-near-farangipet/article34476573.ece
04 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||MRPL and ONGC to set up seven oxygen plants in State||Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) and its parent company ONGC will together set up seven oxygen generation plants, including the one in Mangaluru, in the State to support the State government in the fight against the pandemic. Of these, MPRL will set up five plants and the remaining two will be established by ONGC. A 930 litre per minute (LPM) production capacity plant at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.12 crore will be established in the Government Wenlock Hospital here.

The plant will have compressors, PSA tank, filters, tanks, dryers and will ensure oxygen pressure of four bars with purity of 93 +- 3 which should be sufficient to meet medical oxygen requirement,” Managing Director of MPRL M. Venkatesh said in a release here on Monday. In addition to the Mangaluru plant, MRPL will set up four more plants in four different locations in the State as guided by the State government. Of these, three plants will be of 530 LPM capacity and another plant will have 1,000 LPM production capacity. Orders for establishing two of the three 530 LPM capacity plants have been placed and for the remaining two plants, one of 530 LPM capacity and the other having 1,000 LPM capacity, orders are yet to be placed. The two plants for which the orders have been placed will together cost Rs. 1.40 crore. ONGC will set up its two plants in locations where they are required, the release said. The Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had recently asked different oil and gas PSUs to set up 28 oxygen plants in the State. Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel had, in a meeting with industries in Mangaluru last week, asked them to support the government by setting up oxygen plants. During the first wave of the pandemic, MRPL had supported the district administration with food kits, sanitisers, masks, travel arrangement for migrant workers and food for unorganised sector and destitutes, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mrpl-and-ongc-to-set-up-seven-oxygen-plants-in-state/article34476578.ece
04 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Two statements give differing versions of status of oxygen supply in district||Confusing statements emerged from government authorities on the status of medical oxygen supply to hospitals in Dakshina Kannada on Monday. The statements lacked clarity. The statement forwarded by the Department of Information which did not quote any authority as saying said that there is disruption in the supply of enough oxygen cylinders to hospitals. It is because there is delay in the supply of liquid oxygen from Inox Air Products Private Ltd., Palakkad, Kerala, to the three oxygen refilling units in the district. At the same time, the statement said that there is no disruption in oxygen supply to patients in hospitals. When contacted, an official of the department told The Hindu that the statement has been sent by the Office of the Deputy Commissioner. The other statement issued by in-charge of Dakshina Kannada and Minister for Muzrai, Backward Classes Welfare Kota Srinivasa Poojary said that he chaired an emergency meeting on the status of oxygen supply with Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel, MLAs Y. Bharat Shetty and D. Vedavyasa Kamath and Mayor Premananda Shetty and Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra. Quoting the Deputy Commissioner as saying, the Minister said that the district received 25 tonnes of oxygen supply from Ballari and Palakkad (Kerala) and there is no shortage in supply. The State (Kerala) has been requested to take steps not to delay supply of an average six tonnes of oxygen from Palakkad. At present, 430 patients in the district have availed of treatment with oxygen support and of these, more than 200 patients are in ICU and on ventilators. Immediate steps are being taken to add more beds with oxygen at the Government Wenlock Hospital. The Minister and the MP instructed the officials, including District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishor Kumar and Medical Superintendent of Wenlock Hospital Sadashiva Shanubhog, to be prepared to face any difficult situation, the release said.

04 May 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Innovative ideas to the fore at TiE University Pitchfest-2021||Automated battery swapping stations that provide for almost instant refuelling of exhausted batteries of electric vehicles, horizontal sewer pipe cleaning robots and floor cleaning devices were among the innovative ideas pitched by students participating in the TiE University Pitchfest 2021 organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) in Mysuru recently. A total of 48 teams from 26 institutions across the State participated in the event. Satyam Raj of Cambridge Institute of Technology, who is working on the automated battery swapping stations, said his pitch involved an innovative battery pack and swapping cable set-up. However, the users will have to visit their battery swapping station. If the idea becomes successful, electric vehicle users can refuel in less than 30 seconds at the swapping station and continue with their journey just like refilling vehicles with petrol and diesel at petrol bunks. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Satyam Raj said today electric vehicle (EV) charging stations cannot compete with the refuelling time of petrol or diesel vehicles at petrol bunks. “This is why we are developing battery swapping stations that can refuel a vehicle in 30 seconds”, he said adding that the stations will look and operate just like a regular petrol pump. “Once the user connects the swapping cable from the station to a port in her/his vehicle, the swapping process begins. The discharged cells from the vehicle’s battery pack are replaced by fully charged cells from the charging station via the swapping cable. We achieve this by using our proprietary battery packs and swapping technique, which works on an array of cells model, where cells are swapping individually instead of an entire battery pack at once”, Mr. Satyam Raj said. “In our model, the customer gets the battery pack for free and pays a monthly subscription cost for using the swapping infrastructure. Thus, the cost of maintaining an electric vehicle comes down by 30 to 40 per cent”, he said.  Suraj from VIAT Muddenehalli pitched an innovative horizontal sewer pipe cleaning robot to provide controlled cleaning of pipes. The 15 inch x 15 inch robot can remove any blockage in horizontal sewer pipes by travelling upto 30 metres. The robot, which has built-in water-proof camera, can be customised to pipes of varying diameter ranging from 6 inches to 12 inches, according to the features of the product described on the website of Drona Automations, which has been founded by Mr. Suraj. Broomstick, a Mysuru-based start-up co-founded by Mehul Jain and Yogindra K.G. from NIE, Mysuru, mooted an innovative device for commercial floor cleaning for the Indian market; and Sapientury, an IIMB-incubated start-up has developed a DIY Kit coupled with online micro-courses for engineering students to become industry-ready by learning beyond syllabus. The four teams made it to the final round. Panel of judges PThe panel of judges for the TiE University Pitchfest 2021 included Craig Abbott, Managing Partner, CWA Advisors and Board Member, TiE New York, USA; Hemalatha Annamalai, former CEO and MD, Ampere Vehicles and Past President, TiE Coimbatore Chapter; and Viiveck Verma, Founder of UpSurge Enterprise Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and Board Member, TiE Hyderabad Chapter. The judges evaluated the pitches on parameters including innovation, scalability, market opportunity, commercialisation and business model. Eventually, Team Sapientury, co-founded by Kushal S.L. and Komala Channa from RV College of Engineering, won the round and became eligible to participate in the TiE Global University Pitchfest, where more than 30 global teams will participate. Team Saptientury will receive a cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh from TiE Mysuru chapter, said a press statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/innovative-ideas-to-the-fore-at-tie-university-pitchfest-2021/article34476185.ece
04 May 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A night of despair and anguish for families||The district hospital in Chamarajanagar echoed with piercing wails of men and women in mourning on Monday. Converted into a dedicated hospital for treating COVID-19 patients, it had the appearance of a morgue with families in distress as 23 people died in a span of 24 hours here, many of them allegedly due to lack of oxygen. Young widow “My relative was married only two months ago and he called me at 12.30 a.m. complaining of lack of oxygen. We rushed to the hospital to help but nobody was allowed inside. Then we received information that he had passed away,” said Rajanna from a village near Chamarajanagar town. Besides Rajanna were other relatives of the deceased, including the victim’s wife who was sobbing inconsolably. Notwithstanding the official claims that not all deaths were because of oxygen scarcity, eyewitnesses said tension began to unravel around 10 p.m. when some of them received calls of a possible oxygen shortage and an urgent need for replenishment. The issue was also brought to the attention of local journalists in Chamarajanagar by some of the relatives, and the scribes contacted officials and elected representatives. “We withheld filing the news pertaining to scarcity and decided to help those in distress as saving lives was more important,” said a local correspondent of a prominent Kannada daily. Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, said he was alerted by local scribes from Chamarajanagar and he arranged for immediate dispatch of 50 oxygen cylinders. Though the oxygen cylinders did reach Chamarajanagar from 2 a.m onwards, it was too late for many of them. Govt. in denial Meanwhile, R. Narendra, Hanur MLA, lashed out at the government for “suppressing” the exact number of dead between Sunday and Monday. He said as per as information based on data gleamed from various centres in his constituency, at least 35 people had lost their lives. But the authorities are withholding details, he alleged. “I spoke to the Chief Secretary about the oxygen scarcity in the district but nobody has taken any action. I am in constant touch with the district medical officers, all of whom confirm that there is scarcity but the government is in denial,” said Mr. Narendra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-night-of-despair-and-anguish-for-families/article34476067.ece

The authorities said there was no delay on the part of the Mysuru district administration and they ensured the supply of the cylinders by midnight for which there are records. While 40 oxygen cylinders were transported from the district hospital in Mysuru, 210 were transported from a private agency in the city, the authorities said. The clarification follows allegations being aired that the supply to Chamarajanagar district was restricted so as to cater to Mysuru. Liquid Medical Oxygen used to be sourced from Ballari and transported to Chamarajanagar and there could have been some delay in the delivery, said the authorities in Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-ensured-oxygen-supply-mysuru-administration/article34476064.ece
04 May 2021||Mysuru/Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Former MP says he had alerted authorities||While the Opposition Congress has demanded a judicial probe into the death of 23 COVID-19 patients at Chamarajanagar, former MP and KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayan has claimed that he had alerted the district administration about the impending oxygen crisis on Saturday. He said he had gathered from the officials in Chamarajanagar about a looming threat to oxygen supply from Mysuru on Saturday during his visit to the town for launching the Congress’ health helpline. “The moment I learnt from officials in Chamarajanagar that Mysuru district administration was not in a position to spare oxygen and a crisis would arise, I called upon Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi. However, he assured me that necessary steps were being taken,” Mr. Dhruvanarayan said. Around 9.30 p.m. on Sunday night, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said he received calls from representatives of media and political activists that oxygen stock had been exhausted and several lives were in danger. He said he also called Minister in charge of district S. Suresh Kumar, who assured intervention. “Yet, we learnt on Monday morning that 24 lives had been lost,” Mr. Dhruvanarayan lamented, laying the blame squarely at the doorstep of the State government. Mr. Dhruvanarayan, who visited Chamarajanagar on Monday along with Dharmasena, MLC, said he met the Deputy Commissioner, who expressed helplessness over his pleas for oxygen cylinders being ignored. Mr. Dhruvanarayan, quoting the officials, said they were “begging” for oxygen cylinders every day. When asked about the stock of oxygen on Monday, after 24 deaths, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said the officials informed him that they had 300 cylinders, which was just about their daily requirement. “The authorities have not even been able to keep a stock for 3 to 4 days,” he said. Meanwhile, the Congress, besides a judicial probe, also demanded the resignation of Health Minister K. Sudhakar. Speaking to reporters after a virtual meeting of the Congress Legislature Party, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah demanded a probe by a committee headed by a district court judge. The probe by IAS officer and KSRTC managing director Shivayogi Kalasad would not bring out real facts and provide justice to families, he said. The Congress leader demanded compensation of Rs. 25 lakh to the families for the loss of lives. Officials who were responsible for the deaths should be suspended, he demanded. The district hospital has 180 beds and of them 120 were oxygen beds and 20 ventilators. The hospital required 350 cylinders daily for providing oxygen to patients. Oxygen was being supplied from firms based in Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/former-mp-says-he-had-alerted-authorities/article34476055.ece

Eshwarappa, who is in charge of the district, reviewed the situation at McGann Hospital in Shivamogga on Monday. He expressed shock over the increase in the number of deaths in the recent days. He wanted to know the reasons for this. As on April 26, there was only one death in the district. Gradually the number went up. The Minister said that staff members in the hospitals should work with commitment to save lives. Those officers who failed in their duties would face disciplinary action. He instructed the heads of departments to issue notices to erring staff and ensure all the staff members reported to duty on time. He also instructed the officers to make arrangements to provide PPE kits for caretakers of patients so that they could wear them whenever they get inside the hospitals.

Vijay Kumar, a resident of Hassan, said three of his relatives had been admitted to the hospital. One among them, aged above 70 years, was in critical condition. “We have been trying to get an ICU bed for the last four days. People in the general wards are dying as they have been denied ICU beds”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/2685-test-positive-in-mysuru-more-deaths-in-shivamogga-hassan/article34476180.ece

The Mysuru City and District Congress Committees jointly launched the campaign by writing to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to either restore the scheme or vacate the Chief Minister’s seat. Several Congress leaders including Mysuru City Congress Committee President R. Murthy, Mysuru District Congress Committee President Vijaykumar, State Mahila Congress chief Pushpa Amarnath, and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson H.A.Venkatesh were among the leaders who turned up at the post box in front of the MCC office. The partymen queued up in front of the post box by maintaining a safe distance as per the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, said a press statement from the Congress party. The BJP government should resume giving 10 kg of rice per person per month as per the Anna Bhagya scheme launched by the Congress during the regime of former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, they said. The postcard campaign comes after Mr. Siddaramaiah appealed to the government to give 10 kg of rice to every poor person in the State as a large number of poor are finding it difficult to afford basic essentials during the lockdown caused by the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/postcard-campaign-launched-to-restore-rice-scheme-for-the-poor/article34476184.ece

The police are re-redirecting such calls to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) control room. The control room gets around 4,000 calls each day, and the staff work in three shifts with 45 members in each shift. “We are getting hundreds of calls from people seeking information on beds, medicine and hospitals, and to help them with contact numbers,” said Isha Pant, DCP, Command Centre. “It is heart-wrenching to hear the callers and their desperate situation. We try to calm them down in all possible ways and share the numbers required,” a staff member said. “Those calls and voices haunt us for many hours even after we finish our shift,” another staff member said. Many callers complain about the behaviour of people in public spaces when it comes to observing social distancing, hygiene and using face masks. “This time, the city police’s focus is on enforcement and acting on information and complaints related to masks, social distance, and shops and commercial establishments violating lockdown guidelines. Policemen on the field for enforcement duties are working for over 15 hours. Many of them have not returned home and are staying back at the station as they want to cut down risk of infection for their families,” a police official said. 33 cops test positive As many as 33 police personnel from the city tested positive on Monday, taking the total number of positive cases in the force to 875.

A similar system will soon go live for beds available under private quota. The Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) will be launching the ‘Search My Bed’ portal that provides information on availability of beds in private hospitals by Wednesday, said Prasanna H.M., president, PHANA. “We were running the portal privately, but there were some technical issues that cropped up. We are providing training to hospital staff on updating information on bed availability in real time. We will go live by Wednesday,” he confirmed. According to a press release from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), 11,000 beds were available in both government and private hospitals in BBMP limits. Over the past five days, 5,013 beds had been allocated through the system. BBMP issues order On Monday, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta issued an order directing all hospitals registered under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments Act to mandatorily register on PHANA’s portal and update data on vacant bed position category-wise in real time. Hospitals have also been directed to install a board indicating the above information near the citizen help desk created by the BBMP. Failure to comply would invite action under KPME Act, Disaster Management Act, 2005, the order stated. Taking note of the non-transparent and arbitrary manner of triaging patients and assigning beds using the CHBMS, Mr. Gupta has issued another order constituting a committee to study the existing practice of bed allotment and suggest ways to make it transparent and robust. The committee will comprise V. Ponnuraj, nodal officer for State War Room, Kumar Pushkar, nodal officer for CHBMS, and Vipin Singh, nodal officer for 1912 helpline. The order stated that simultaneous remedial action will be taken to rectify defects, if any. The committee has been directed to submit a report within 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/portal-on-beds-in-private-hospitals-to-go-live-tomorrow/article34476417.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Sumanahalli crematorium shut down till May 10||The overworked furnaces at Sumanahalli electric crematorium, which have been taking a significant load of COVID-19 bodies, have broken down. The facility, which is operated by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), will be shut up to May 10. These are not the first furnaces to break down. In the last two weeks, furnaces at the crematoriums on Mysuru Road and at Kudlu also broke down, unable to take the load of bodies. The Hindu had reported on the issue on May 1. Overload “A furnace in an electric crematorium can burn a maximum of five bodies a day. But in the last month, these furnaces have worked relentlessly without a break burning bodies several times their capacity. Their breakdown was expected, and it is imminent in other crematoria as well,” said a senior official overseeing electric crematoria in the city. Both furnaces at Sumanahalli electric crematorium have to be changed. This will severely impact cremation of COVID-19 bodies in the city, probably creating a glut of bodies at other crematoria that are already overworked. A senior civic official said open cremation using firewood was the only way out. Open crematoria “We have started open crematoria in Giddenahalli, Tavarekere, Mettipalya, T.R. Mills, while another is coming up in Mavallipura. Mass cremations are being held at these locations, which will absorb the workload of Sumanahalli crematorium,” the official said adding given that the city is expected to record less number of cases over the next 10 days, they hope that the death toll will also come down.

04 May 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Alappuzha DCC president resigns||District Congress Committee (DCC) president M. Liju has resigned from the post in the wake of the heavy defeat of the party in the district in the Assembly polls. Mr. Liju submitted his resignation letter to Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran on Monday. “I have tendered my resignation taking moral responsibility for the party’s debacle in the Assembly polls,” Mr. Liju said, adding that various factors had contributed to the Congress’s poor show in the district. The Congress, which had contested in eight seats in Alappuzha lost seven. While its ally Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph tasted defeat in the Kuttanad segment. As the Left Democratic Front (LDF) wave swept the district, the Haripad constituency provided the only solace to the Congress, where Ramesh Chennithala emerged victorious. It is the second Assembly polls in a row, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has to settle for a single seat in the district. In the 2016 polls, the UDF had lost all seats except Haripad constituency. The Congress, later, increased its tally to two when it wrested the Aroor segment from the LDF in a bypoll held in 2019. One-and-a-half years after the victory, however, the party failed to retain Aroor as sitting MLA Shanimol Usman lost the electoral battle to Daleema Jojo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). 2016 polls Although the UDF’s vote share, compared to 2016 polls, has increased in Aroor, Cherthala, Alappuzha, Ambalappuzha, Kayamkulam, Mavelikkara, and Kuttanad constituencies that was not enough to secure victory for UDF candidates in these seats. In Haripad, Mr. Chennithala got 72,768 votes, a decrease of 3,212 votes from 2016. His victory margin fell to 13,666 from 18,621 votes five years ago. In Chengannur constituency, once known as a Congress stronghold, its candidate M. Murali, who polled 5,588 fewer votes than P.C. Vishnunath of the Congress in the 2016 election there, finished a distant second. CPI(M) candidate Saji Cherian’s victory margin of 31,984 votes in Chengannur is the highest in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alappuzha-dcc-president-resigns/article34476148.ece

04 May 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Work in farms and estates unlikely to be hit||The works in the farm and plantation sectors are unlikely to be affected though the government has enforced strict COVID-19 regulations from Tuesday. District Collector H. Dinesan on Monday said the primary and secondary sectors had been exempted by the government and there was no curb in engaging the workers and doing the works in the plantation and farm sectors. An official at a major tea plantation in Munnar said that the month of May was the top production season and any curbs on work would impact the sector negatively. If the tender tea leaves were not plucked on time, the plants would have to be pruned and nearly a year’s crop was lost, he said. The district administration, in association with the tea estate management in Munnar, had already started an immunisation programme in estate areas. Tourism activities were banned and outsiders were not allowed entry inside the plantation areas, the sources said. In the vegetable hub of Kanthallur and Vattavada, the prime agriculture works like sowing the seeds for the first harvesting season in September would be done in May. But if the works got affected, the entire sowing season would be disturbed. But the farm workers were local people and hence there was no curb on farm works there, according to Devikulam Sub-collector S. Prem Krishnan. However, the works in the cardamom plantations might be affected as a large number of workers daily arrived from Tamil Nadu or from distant places in taxi jeeps. Works in the cardamom plantation were mostly done by the experienced women workers. The taxi jeeps would often be crowded. A manager at a cardamom plantation at Sulthaniya in Peerumade taluk said that a large number of workers arrived daily from distant areas. Curbs If the curbs on bringing them were enforced, the works would be affected. The main works like cleaning the dried leaves and pest prevention measures were usually done in May, he said. To tide over the crisis that might affect the working, Mr Dinesan said that a guideline for brining the workers to the cardamom plantations would be prepared in consultation with the police. He said that vehicles would be allowed to carry only the minimum number of passengers.  Vehicles from T.N. will be allowed to carry only the minimum number of passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-in-farms-and-estates-unlikely-to-be-hit/article34476136.ece
04 May 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||All hospitals ordered to reserve 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients||Kannur District Collector T.V. Subhash, who is also the chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority, has directed that half of the beds in all the hospitals in the district be set aside for COVID-19 treatment to ensure specialist treatment for all in view of the increasing number of cases in the district. The action was taken under Sections 24 and 65 of the Disaster Management Act. According to this, all government and private hospitals, including medical colleges in the district, co-operative and ESI hospitals should reserve 50 per cent of their beds for COVID patients. Admission to 25 per cent of the reserved half beds will be done through the DDMA. Category B and C patients with severe symptoms will be admitted. At the same time, the order said that hospitals should make arrangements to provide necessary treatment to non-COVID patients seeking emergency treatment. The Collector also ordered the appointment of an incident commander at each of the major hospitals in the district to ensure the physical condition of the beds, D-type oxygen cylinders and other life-saving medicines required for the treatment of critically ill patients. Kannur Aster MIMS, Gym Care, Ashirvad Specialty, Sreechand, Dhanalakshmi, Koyili, AKG, KIMST Mother and Child Hospitals, Cherukunnu SMDP, Thalassery Indira Gandhi, Thalassery Co-operative Hospital, Tely Hospital, Jose Giri, Christuraj Mission Hospital, Iritty Amala hospital, Taliparamba Lourdes, Co-operative Hospital, Payyannur Priyadarshini, Co-operative and Church Hospitals, would appoint incident commander in the first phase. They should visit the hospitals concerned and report to the DDMA on the number of D-type oxygen cylinders available there and the availability of oxygen plants. The beds available here should also include the ICU and ventilator. The number of COVID patients admitted to the hospital should be updated daily by A,B, and C categories. In addition, the daily stock of life-saving drugs should be reported, Mr. Subhash said. He said in the order that an oxygen help desk should be set up at the hospital and work in coordination with the oxygen nodal officer here. He also directed the District Law Officer N.V. Santosh to set up a help desk in the collectorate as the nodal officer to coordinate these activities in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-hospitals-ordered-to-reserve-50-of-beds-for-covid-19-patients/article34476089.ece

04 May 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||Eriophyid mite infestation found in amaranthus||A team of researchers in Kasaragod has found Eriophyid mite, which damages amaranthus (red cheera), a common leafy vegetable cultivated all over the country. The researchers said such infestation in amaranthus was being reported for the first time in India. The mite causes severe malformation of the shoot, making it fibrous and reducing the yield. The researchers, Dr. K.M. Sreekumar, Professor and Head, Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture, Padanekkad; Dr. Srinivasa Nagappa, and N. Sivamoorthy, Project Director, All India Network, Agricultural Acarology, found the mite in amaranthus. Dr. Sreekumar said that the extensive cultivation of amaranth was a common in the coastal areas of Kanhangad in Kasaragod district from October to the second week of June. However, the farmers have been experiencing the problem of Eriophyid mite infestation in the crop for the past three years, he said. He observed that these plants showed crinkling deformity and malformation of tender leaves, a severe reduction in the leaf size and stunting. Besides, farmers also found difficulty in harvesting. Explaining the study, Dr. Sreekumar said Eriophyid mites, numbering 8 to 28 were noticed in each plant. As a result, the number of periodical tender shoot harvests from April to June was reduced by 50 per cent. The farmers were severely affected as the produce fetched a very low price. He said an observation trial to contain the pest immediately after a harvest reduced the mite damage symptoms almost completely for at least 15 days when the new shoots would be ready for the next harvest, he claimed. Even though Eriophyid mites were reported in Tanzania in 1992, it is the first report of the mite infestation in amaranth in the country. He appealed to the farmers to contact 9447691821 for help if they saw any growth or stagnation in amaranth cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/eriophyid-mite-infestation-found-in-amaranthus/article34476086.ece

While over 17,000 tests were done on Saturday, the figure dipped to 11,734 on Sunday, followed by a further fall to 10,099 samples on Monday. On Friday, a total of 11,255 tests were done at private laboratories, while 5,651 were done on Sunday at private labs. The number of tests done at private labs was not yet available on Monday. The number of RT-PCR tests in Ernakulam has stood at a figure well over 6,000 daily as per figures from April 22 onwards. It stood at over 8,500 on April 26. The number fell to 5,763 on April 30, 5,557 on May 1, 3,810 on May 2, and 4,239 on May 3. While one private lab owner in Kochi said that testing could just be slow because of May Day and the weekend, another said that some private labs across the State had halted RT-PCR testing since the rate for such tests at private labs had been slashed from Rs. 1,700 to Rs. 500. The government order cutting the rate was released on April 30. C. Balachandran, a private lab owner in the State, said that once the order was issued, a few labs had decided not to take any samples on Saturday since it was not viable. “But since it is a pandemic situation, some labs resumed collecting samples on Monday at government fixed rates. We are unsure about how long we will be able to proceed at this rate, considering the staff and resources involved in the process,” he said. Total testing could have fallen since the contribution of private labs was substantial, he said. District Medical Officer N. K. Kuttappan said that since the rate had fallen, tests in private labs had fallen as well. “But if they do have the approval to do RT-PCR tests, they must do it, and cannot refuse,” he said. “Why there has been a fall in testing will have to be examined. If labs authorised to do RT-PCR tests refuse to do them, action will have to be taken,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-19-testing-slackens-in-ernakulam-as-govt-cuts-rate/article34476533.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||BJP-RSS votes shifted in favour of Congress, says Radhakrishnan||The shifting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) votes in favour of the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate resulted in the poor performance of the BJP in Thripunithura, alleged K.S. Radhakrishnan, the party candidate and party State vice president. Except for the personal votes garnered by him, the traditional BJP votes were not polled in his favour, which resulted in the party vote share taking a dip, and him losing the election, said Mr. Radhakrishnan. There has been a dent in the vote share of the party from the Thripunithura municipal area, a party stronghold. All that the party candidate got in the constituency was the votes polled in his favour and not the votes of the BJP or the RSS. Had the votes of the BJP and the RSS been polled in favour of the candidate along with the personal votes, the electoral outcome would have been different, said Mr. Radhakrishnan. “The party hoped to get over 60,000 votes polled in its favour in the constituency on the assumption that all the BJP-RSS votes would be polled in the election symbol lotus, along with the personal votes I could attract as a candidate, which proved wrong,” he said. A winnable seat The revelations of the BJP candidate are likely to raise a storm in the party as Thripunithura was considered a winnable seat for the party. Incidentally, Thripunithura was one of the Assembly constituencies which the party had earlier identified for E. Sreedharan, as the party had high hopes of winning the constituency. Mr. Radhakrishnan became the choice of the BJP after Mr. Sreedharan opted for Palakkad. Mr. Radhakrishnan, while pointing out that the vote share of the Left Democratic Front candidate M. Swaraj had remained intact, said the shift in BJP-RSS votes had done the magic for K. Babu, the Congress candidate. Other than Mr. Babu, no Congress candidate in the State had openly declared that he would get RSS votes. The posters that appeared in the constituency urging Hindu voters not to vote for the BJP candidate to ensure the defeat of the LDF candidate was part of that strategy, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-rss-votes-shifted-in-favour-of-congress-says-radhakrishnan/article34476521.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||LDF’s calculations go wrong in Angamaly and Aluva||The poll results of Angamaly and Aluva constituencies have exposed the chinks in the armour of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Expectations were high in Angamaly after the Communist Party of India(Marxist) [CPI(M)] agreed to the candidature of Jose Thettayil of the Janata Dal (S). A two-time MLA and former Minister, Mr. Thettayil’s name had raised the stakes in the contest after many termed it a “neck-and-neck race”. But, the results proved otherwise. Congress candidate Roji M. John retained his winning streak by an improved margin, compared to the elections held in 2016. From a lead of 9,186 votes in 2016, he improved his margin to 15,543 votes this time. Mr. Thettayil failed to secure a lead even in his booth, where Mr. John was ahead with over 200 votes. The Left camp will have much to think about as it could not cash in on the pro-incumbency wave. A campaign that Mr. Thettayil could be a possible Minister in the wake of an LDF win also failed to connect with the voters. Independent candidate The situation in Aluva was no different. By fielding the daughter-in-law of six-time Congress MLA K. Mohammadali, the LDF had anticipated making dents in the traditional vote base of the Congress. However, it did not yield any major results. Anwar Sadath, who had a hat-trick win, secured the lead in all the booths. Even in Edathala and Keezhmadu panchayats where the LDF is in power, the Congress candidate earned a considerable lead over Shelna Nishad, who had entered the political arena as an Independent candidate of the Left. She not only failed to secure the lead in her booth, but also went down to the third position. M.N. Gopi of the Bharatiya Janata Party was in the second place in her booth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldfs-calculations-go-wrong-in-angamaly-and-aluva/article34476525.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Second wave of pandemic puts the brakes on car sales||The resurgence of the pandemic has come at a time when the demand for cars and SUVs surpassed supply in Kochi. “The second wave of the pandemic struck in mid-April when the sale of four wheelers of a few brands was witnessing parallels with their corresponding demand in the first quarter of 2020. Their sales figures would have been higher but for poor supply from the manufacturers. This has resulted in the waiting time for many popular models extending to over six months. The demand for petrol-run cars has increased, while diesel SUVs are more in demand,” said a proprietor who handles dealerships of multiple brands. The acute shortage of semi-conductors and chips in the wake of the disruption in the supply lines has further dampened the roll-out of cars and SUVs, said Rajwanth Ben, owner of a car dealership in the city. “Our sales figures were showing an upbeat trend since September 2020, especially after February 2021. The second wave of the pandemic has seen bookings drop by The slump caused by the resurgence of the pandemic struck the automobile sector at a time when registration of vehicles was getting back to their normal figures at the Ernakulam RTO office and sub RTO offices in the suburbs. The option for online registration made the process much smoother. The registration of two wheelers and private four wheelers was seeing a steady climb since the last quarter of 2020, so much so that between 70 and 100 vehicles were being registered daily at the Ernakulam RTO office till recently. A bulk of the newly-registered vehicles were two wheelers, followed by four wheelers. The registration of commercial vehicles has fallen, said P.M. Shabeer, Ernakulam RTO. This is because many commuters who relied on public transport purchased used or new two wheelers, while many two wheeler users purchased used or new cars. They could transfer the ownership of used cars for the prescribed fee of Rs. 1,000. “The pandemic situation has resulted in people seeking a safe mode of commute - going by the demand for cars, while financially well-off people are purchasing SUVs. Many two wheeler riders are thus investing in used cars, in which different people travelling in the same route travel by pooling money,” Mr. Shabeer said. The demand for two and four wheelers has been on the increase since December 2020, said Salim Vijayakumar, Jt. RTO, who heads the Aluva Sub RTO office. “Unlike in most parts of Kerala, the demand for commercial vehicles saw an increase in Aluva, possibly due to high industrial activity,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-wave-of-pandemic-puts-the-brakes-on-car-sales/article34476077.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||When lawyers took up the plough||The COVID-19 restrictions had turned many professionals into farmers. From school teachers to home-makers, all have taken up cultivating vegetables and fruits, rice, and fish over the past more than 12 months. One such group is a set of lawyers, under the aegis of All India Lawyers’ Union, Ernakulam district committee, who have come out with flying colours in an attempt to cultivate paddy in 5.5 acres in Kadungalloor panchayat in Ernakulam. P.R. Ragesh, member of the district committee of the union, said more than 50 members, enthusiastic about farming, contributed Rs. 2,000 each to see through the initial expenses of the cultivation. Aid from The plot was taken up with the help of the local paddy collective (Paadashekhara Samiti), which extended all help. Mr. Ragesh said there was no hesitancy on the part of the lawyers’ collective, who wanted to do something positive during the pandemic times. The experiment has been a great success, said M.P. Udayan of Mundakkali Paadashekharam (polder) at Kadungalloor, who looks after the day-to-day affairs of the paddy cultivation. He said the harvest fest was organised recently. Mr. Ragesh said the idea of rice cultivation initially came from members of the Lawyers’ Union taking up vegetable cultivation in their backyards or terraces of their homes after the lockdown was announced in March last year. Vegetable cultivation was a grand success. The Uma variety of seed was selected for the project, and Mr. Udayan feels that around six tonnes of paddy could be obtained from the fields, now waiting to be harvested. New season  Efforts are on to extend paddy cultivation to the new season, he said. Kadungalloor has a large extent of paddy fields, and cultivation can easily be extended, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-lawyers-took-up-the-plough/article34476079.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pandemic, barriers hit seafood exports||Marine products exporters have said their business has gone through one of its "worst years" in 2020-21 and recorded a drop of turnover and volume of around 20% with markets hit by China being almost closed to India and EEC trade barriers. In an appeal to the Union government, the seafood exporters claimed that Russia and other markets were not being aggressively pursued by the government. The industry had also been affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, affecting the labour flow seriously. Besides, the crash in the price of raw materials had seriously affected the supplies of raw materials. The viability of aquaculture shrimp farming and related activities and capture fisheries have been seriously affected too. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana Scheme will help the fisheries sector both capture and culture mostly at the primary levels of production and infrastructure in the long run. No stimulus package However, there is no direct support to the export sector in the scheme, or even any kind of stimulus offered during the pandemic to any export sector. There is sickness brewing in the sector with many small exporters on the verge of being classified as NPAs, particularly those depending predominantly on the ocean catches or capture fisheries, mostly located on the west coast. Added to this, banks have started increasing interest rates by downgrading the exporters’ credit ratings as they have not been able to keep up with their sales projections owing to the pandemic. The sector is highly employment-oriented, with a workforce of more than 15 million, but it had not been included in the list of sectors for additional financial support by the banks, the exporters said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-trade-barriers-hit-seafood-exports/article34476539.ece

For Roji M. John, who won Angamaly for the second consecutive time, the primary focus will be on the timely completion of the Angamaly bypass project. “Funds have been allocated under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The land acquisition procedures have started,” he said. On the Kalady bridge project, Mr. John said it would also figure among the priority projects. “The final proposal is ready. It will have to go through the necessary approvals,” he said. The second-time Congress MLA attributed his win to the overwhelming support from various sections of the society, irrespective of political or religious differences. The activities undertaken during the time of the floods and the pandemic had also earned the appreciation of voters, he said. Hat-trick win Anwar Sadath, who had a hat-trick win in Aluva, placed the completion of the Airport-Seaport project as his top priority. “The land acquisition process is progressing. I hope that the work can be finished without much delay,” he said. Mr. Sadath said equal importance would be given to the completion of the Parappuram-Vallamkadavu and Alungal Kadavu bridges. “The KSRTC bus terminal project in Aluva is another key project. The widening of the market road in Aluva also holds prime position among the immediate development projects. It would help in easing the traffic snarls in Aluva,” he said. The MLA said that his third consecutive win was the recognition given by voters for his various initiatives, especially during the floods and the pandemic crisis. “I could reach out to the public and help them in their time of crisis,” he said. Eldhose Kunnappilly, who won a close race in Perumbavoor, said the completion of the bypass project would be the first among his various developmental initiatives in the next five years. “Steps have been taken to speed up the land acquisition process. Efforts will be made to start the work without much delay,” he said. Mr. Kunnappilly said he was able to secure a lead in all booths despite the reduced margin of over 2,800 votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pending-projects-are-their-priority/article34476530.ece

Testing fell to 10,099 samples collected on the day when the figure was well over 16,000 samples till Saturday this past weekend. Recoveries were higher than new cases on Monday. While 3,291 tested positive, 3,500 people recovered and 176 people were discharged from hospitals and other facilities. Two health workers and a police officer tested positive. Thrikkakara recorded 124 new cases, followed by Palluruthy with 123. Pallipuram saw 95 cases, Rayamangalam 93, Vazhakulam 81, Choornikkara 78, and Payipra 71. The district’s active caseload stands at 53,826. While 46,963 people are recovering at home, 2,048 patients are admitted at private hospitals. At the Government Medical College Hospital, 181 patients are recovering, 67 are at PVS Hospital, 62 people are recuperating at the Aluva District Hospital and 26 patients are at the superspecialty block of the Ernakulam General Hospital. A total of 271 new admissions were made to hospitals and other centres on Monday. While 36 people are at FLTCs, 458 are at SLTCs, and 380 are at domiciliary care centres. As many as 375 patients are admitted in intensive care units. The administration is in the process of taking over a block of a medical college and hospital, where around 60 beds will be available, said District Medical Officer N. K. Kuttappan. Preparation are also under way to reopen the treatment centre at the Adlux convention centre, which was closed in December last year, he said. All major government hospitals that have inpatient facilities are being equipped with oxygen beds. While setting up the beds was not a problem, continuous oxygen supply could be an issue considering the growing caseload, though the district had not faced any major hassle so far, he said. A sufficient number of large tanks was not available for storage in hospitals, though smaller cylinders were available, he said. “The oxygen war room that was set up recently and the effort to use industrial cylinders for medical oxygen could help,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/test-positivity-rate-at-3259/article34476531.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Waste disposal solutions being delayed||Local bodies in Ernakulam that failed to ensure scientific waste management have found the proposed waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at Brahmapuram as an excuse for not finding solutions to the vexed issue. The Kochi Corporation and Aluva, Angamaly, Kalamassery, Thrikkakara, and Thripunithura municipalities were pulled up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for not initiating steps as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The corporation had come under fire for the poor functioning of its solid waste treatment facility at Brahmapuram. The municipalities too were under the lens for depending on the Brahmapuram facility for dumping their biodegradable waste. The Kochi Corporation quoted a letter issued by the Additional Chief Secretary, Local Self Government Department (LSGD), on January 8, 2020, for not installing source-level waste treatment systems. The government had asked the corporation not to undertake any projects on its own and in parallel to the proposed WTE plant, pointed out the Corporation Secretary in a letter to the Pollution Control Board (PCB) on April 9. Widening gap The municipalities have also started falling back on the energy plant whenever its faced with questions on the widening gap in setting up facilities for waste management. However, the LSGD has no clarity yet as to when the WTE plant will turn a reality. The Kerala State Industrial Corporation had to issue tenders again for the plant in January. The government had asked the corporation to invite fresh tenders after it cancelled the approval granted to a consortium on April 30 last year, maintaining that it had failed to achieve financial closure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/waste-disposal-solutions-being-delayed/article34476674.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||14% vote share a confidence booster: Sabu||The fact that Twenty20 candidates won 14% vote share in eight constituencies in Ernakulam where they were in the fray was a confidence booster and a bigger win than any candidate making it to the Legislative Assembly, said Sabu Jacob, entrepreneur and chairman of the outfit, a day after the poll results were announced. The candidates came third in six of the eight constituencies (except in Thrikkakara and Ernakulam where they were in fourth position), leaving National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidates trailing in the fourth position. Even more noteworthy was the fact that the eight candidates together bagged 1.46 lakh votes, in comparison to 90,000 votes (8% vote share) of the NDA candidates put together, in those seats, said Mr. Jacob. Candidates of the United Democratic Front (UDF) garnered 4.12 lakh votes, while those of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) got 4.10 lakh votes. “Our candidates got a 14% vote share, despite them being pitted against three major political fronts which have pan-India presence and comprise around 20 big and small political parties. The rivals had a whole lot of leaders to campaign for them from the Prime Minister and Chief Minister to Ministers and the Gandhis,” he told The Hindu . 2026 polls He said the party had its eyes fixed on the 2026 Assembly polls. “We changed track and decided to field candidates in Ernakulam district, following violent incidents and alleged attempts to intimidate voters in some areas and booths during the 2020 local body elections. Our candidate would have won in Kunnathunad by a sound margin but for our attention being divided among the eight constituencies,” said Mr. Jacob. “The vote share in our debut Assembly poll has equipped us with organisational experience to field candidates in all the 140 seats. An intra-party meeting should take a call on contesting the Lok Sabha poll that is three years away,” he added. On the party not winning any seats, chairman of Twenty20 advisory committee Kochouseph Chittilappilly said that voters probably thought that the party’s candidates would not be as effective as those of the two major fronts that took turns in ruling the State. “They probably wanted a safe bet. But it is heartening that we won much more votes than NDA candidates,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/14-vote-share-a-confidence-booster/article34476518.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Demand to augment safety of road users on NH Bypass||Inadequate, missing and misplaced signboards, traffic hold-ups at Vyttila and Kundannoor junctions even after the commissioning of six-lane flyovers, shoddily-maintained service roads and issues related to toll collection have compounded the woes of commuters along the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass. The complaint is rife that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which owns the 16-km corridor and an agency that collects toll and is duty bound to maintain it are seldom responsive to grievances raised by people’s representatives and others. Upkeep of stretch “Accidents often happen at U-turns and at points where vehicles enter NH Bypass from side roads, since signboards are missing at many locations on the corridor. Even worse, the NHAI and the operation, maintenance, tolling (OMT) contracting firm to which it has entrusted upkeep of the stretch have not bothered to install boards warning speeding motorists of pedestrian crossings,” said sources in City Traffic Police. Pedestrian lines were erased at pedestrian-dense locations like Chalikkavattom when foot overbridges (FOBs) were installed. However, not even 10% of the pedestrians crossing the NH use the FOBs due to the steep gradient of the structures. “They are at added risk since there are no warning signboards, while pedestrian lines were erased. Accidents involving pedestrians are common at several such spots. We have seen that the location of U-turns and cuttings permitted from service roads too is unscientific in many areas, which is yet another cause of accidents,” the sources added. Signboards are missing in many such spots, while blinkers to warn motorists of U-turns are dysfunctional or damaged at many turns. Drains on service roads Sources in the NHAI said that they would look into infrastructural inadequacies on the bypass, including the long overdue demand to widen the tarred portion of service roads from the present 5.50 m to 7 m, to ensure smooth and safe movement of vehicles. “There is also need to build drains on service roads where waterlogging occurs and to cover existing drains with slabs to prevent dumping of garbage. A proposal in this regard is awaiting clearance from the NHAI head office,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-to-augment-safety-of-road-users/article34476524.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cab driver turns Good Samaritan||Binu U.K., a cab driver from Ponnurunni, takes one too many showers a day though not out of any phobia. For someone now left to make a living transporting the pandemic-infected, that is the minimum he can do to have at least a notion of safety. Binu, 41, used to run tour packages before the outbreak of COVID-19 left the tourism industry in ruins. Things were beginning to look up and he had even organised a tour to Kullu-Manali and Goa earlier this year when the second wave of the pandemic hit, nipping his nascent hope in the bud. Then he joined the ranks of cab drivers operating from the Kochi airport but found the returns hardly commensurate with the long hours of waiting, as he often ended up getting short trips. Left with no alternative to make a living, Binu moved his wife and toddler son to her home and started transporting COVID-19 patients between hospitals, labs, and their homes. “Since I cannot afford PPE [personal protection equipment] kit for every trip, I use other safeguards like masks, shields, gloves, sanitisers, and internal separation of the cab. And then after every trip, I take a shower,” he said. He is now a regular in transporting infected people in the Vyttila Janatha and Ponnurunni divisions of the Kochi Corporation. “Binu is a very dependable guy who is very caring with the people he transports and charges only nominal fees. His phone number is available with Asha workers in the division,” said Baiju Thottaly, former councillor of Vyttila Janatha. Sony Joseph, the present councillor, said though he had not been formally engaged, his service often comes in handy. K.K. Pradeep Kumar, secretary of the Sahakarana Residents’ Association, Ponnurunni, is also appreciative of Binu who, he said, was available on call even during late nights. “He was at hand last Sunday when an aged and childless lottery agent had to be taken for testing after he developed complications following vaccination,” he recalled. For someone, who has always enjoyed life and frequently travelled with his family, Binu remains upbeat in the face of hardships though he is aware of the potentially serious health hazards. “Life cannot always be a bed of roses. This is a crisis that anyone can face, and it needs to be faced head-on,” he said brimming with optimism.  Since I cannot afford PPE kit for every trip, I use other safeguards like masks, gloves, sanitisers, and internal separation of the cab.

04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Video calls being used to trap people in sleaze||A woman in her 30s from Kakkanad recently got a WhatsApp video call from an unknown number. She attended the call only to be shocked by the nudity on the other side. The next moment she got a video clip of that chat with her face captured along with the obscenity with an extortion bid, to stop the video from being sent to her friends on social media. To prove the point, a screenshot of the image shared with one of her friends was also sent to her. Panic-stricken, she approached a police officer who advised her not to pay the money and to report it to the cyber cell. The practice of trapping unsuspecting victims in such sleaze videos to extort money has become so widespread and indiscriminate that even a police officer received such a video call. Being aware of the danger, he masked the camera before attending the call. “Most victims choose to remain mum the first time fearing humiliation and seek help only when threatened repeatedly though even then they insist on not lodging a complaint. The modus operandi is rather simple as the caller trains the camera on some nude video on a computer screen when the call gets connected and uses the interim before a shocked victim regains composure and reacts to capture the video or image, which is then used for extortion,” said cyber police sources. Nandakishore Harikumar, who runs a cybersecurity start-up and is actively associated with the Kerala Cyberdome, said that even lodging a formal complaint would be of little help as the perpetrator would be in some other State where the police would be hardly interested in pursuing the case even if the Kerala police were to diligently follow it up. He said there were many variants of the same fraud like the perpetrators forging social media accounts and inviting women in the friends’ list of the original account holder to video-call them. “There is no solution other than not attending video calls from unknown numbers. Falling for extortion bids would be a folly as there would be no end to it. For instance, a law professional paid Rs. 1.50 lakh in several lots under duress. It all boils down to data privacy and framing a law to ensure it. Since people leave digital footprints everywhere, it is easy for unscrupulous elements to access data and exploit it,” said Mr. Harikumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/video-calls-being-used-to-trap-people-in-sleaze-videos/article34476082.ece
04 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Study shows vulnerability of popular mobile apps||How safe are the countless mobile apps that a smartphone user so whimsically installs? The findings based on an analysis of 10,000 popular apps conducted last month by CloudSEK, a Bengaluru-based Artificial Intelligence-driven Digital Risk Management Enterprise, are not so reassuring. The analysis done with the help of BeVigil, a free security search engine tool developed for assessing threat perception of mobile apps, found that over 40 apps with a collective download of more than 100 million were highly vulnerable endangering their internal networks and data, thanks to hardcoded AWS (Amazon Web Services) keys. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing system used by businesses and even governments worldwide, offers compute power, database storage and allows users to interact with their infrastructure via APIs (Application Programming Interface). “The API acts like a password for the app to access data stored on AWS. To put it simply, if AWS is your apartment, where you store critical data and files, the API key unlocks your front door. While API makes it easy for developers to build apps that communicate with multiple sources and efficiently manage data flowing to and from the apps, hardcoding API keys into apps is akin to locking your house but leaving the key in an envelope titled do not open,” said Rahul Sasi, founder, CloudSEK. These keys could be easily discovered by malicious hackers or competitors who could use it to compromise their data and networks. Recent high-profile hacks, such as the Imperva breach, have leveraged this misconfiguration to compromise the cloud infrastructure. AWS has a documentation for accessing resources with secured keys. The fundamental security practice is not to hardcode them anywhere. If inadvertently exposed, the AWS Access Key should be either revoked or deleted. “While public API keys, such as that of Facebook and LinkedIn, are intentionally made available for other apps to verify user identities, most apps are supposed to use private keys that need to be kept secure. However, in the breakneck pace at which new versions of apps are released, it is not uncommon for developers to overlook exposed API keys,” said Shahrukh Ahmad, chief Technical Officer, BeVigil. Despite having over eight million apps to choose from, users, app developers, and security researchers don’t have a mechanism to determine the security posture of mobile apps. This leads to the user data being breached and sold on underground forums to the highest bidder, he said. “We believe that a cost-effective tool like BeVigil would encourage app developers to vet their apps for identifying vulnerabilities and address them before their launch,” said Mr. Sasi. The scan reports generated by BeVigil are made available to the global CloudSEK community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/study-exposes-vulnerability-of-popular-mobile-apps/article34476081.ece

04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fleeing youth electrocuted||In a shocking incident, a youth who was reportedly escaping arrest by personnel of the anti-narcotics special squad of the police, was electrocuted after he allegedly jumped off a building and fell atop electricity lines on the road leading to the KSRTC bus stand in the city on Monday evening. The body of Ottapalam native Renjith, who was entrapped in the power lines, was brought down by personnel of the Fire and Rescue Services after switching off the electricity. The police team had reportedly nabbed him and another person with 4 kg of ganja. Even as the arrest process was on, Renjith reportedly ran up to shops on the upper floor behind the Ambedkar Stadium and jumped off. The Ernakulam Central Police have registered a case of unnatural death.  ATM set ablaze An ATM machine at Kalamassery was partially gutted after an unidentified man set it afire on Sunday night. The incident, which was suspected as a fire due to a short-circuit, turned out to be an attempt to steal cash from the machine, on inspection of the CCTV footage on Monday. He is seen pouring a liquid on the machine and setting it ablaze.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-fleeing-from-police-electrocuted/article34476076.ece
04 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Jellyfish invasion hits fishing||Swarms of jellyfish have invaded the inland waterbodies of Kochi, making life miserable for fishers. The presence of the marine species has been reported from many parts of Vembanad lake. Jellyfish, which is a passive swimmer, flows along with the current. They get entangled in stake nets, making fishery impossible during the infestation period, complain fishers. It is during the peak summer months that jellyfish moves from the sea to freshwater bodies. They usually settle down on the ocean floor and coral and rock structures. They also get attached to sea walls and groynes that are laid in the sea for preventing sea erosion. As the salinity and temperature of freshwater bodies spike during the peak summer months, they leave the ocean floors to inland waterbodies, said those at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi. Climate change, pollution, and turbidity can trigger jellyfish bloom, as they have the capacity to outlive extreme conditions. They may survive in inland waterbodies during the pre-monsoon period and perish during the monsoon when water temperature and salinity drop with the influx of fresh water. The bloom subsides during monsoon, explained researchers. Experts have identified the species present in the Kochi estuary area as belonging to the genus Acromitus, which is a relatively harmless one. However, Chrysora, its cousin, which is known in local parlance as Theechori,  could cause health hazards if one comes into contact with it. The Chrysora species could cause severe itching and other discomfort and in some cases, medical support may be needed, warned researchers. Crambionella Orsini, another variety of jellyfish, is harvested in large quantities by trawlers of Kollam, Kanyakumari, and Thoothukudi during November to be exported to South Asian countries. The tentacles of the species are used for export, while the bell-like structure of its body is discarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jellyfish-invasion-of-vembanad-lake-hits-fishing/article34476140.ece
04 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Caught between COVID and duty||An investigation team from the Kochi City police which has been hopping around multiple State borders since last week to nab the accused in the alleged murder of a teenager and then take him around for evidence collection encapsulated the challenges facing uniformed men and women during this period of a resurgent pandemic. Thanks to occupational hazards, they are forced to overlook health risks and work often in disregard of physical distancing, which the force professes to the public as the second wave of the pandemic sweeps the entire country. “Except for a few teams engaged in the investigation of important cases, we have deployed the entire force on the road for COVID protocol management. “It is critical to motivate them to take risks, which could be done through leadership, welfare measures, and appreciating their work,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). Visiting police stations, enquiring about the well-being of families of cops rather than their work, and ensuring their timely incentives and promotions are some of the steps being taken by Mr. Nagaraju to inspire confidence among the force. “If we take care of our officers, they will take care of their work. Appreciate their work, and they will work with double the zeal. Guide them professionally without rank differences, and they will develop confidence in the leadership. Protect them from operational hazards, and they will risk anything. In short, we must treat them with respect and compassion,” he said. P.D. Baiju, secretary, Kerala Police Association (Kochi City), said the situation had descended to a state last year when the force was nearly exhausted in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. “Unlike now, during the lockdown, the police could fully focus on pandemic protocol management, as there were no other law and order issues, since people were mostly confined to their homes,” he added. The association may demand keeping a certain percentage of manpower in every station as reserve as was done during the height of the pandemic last year. The Police State Welfare Bureau has restored the emergency assistance of Rs. 5,000 for cops who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination The silver lining amid the gloom is that a majority of cops have at least received the first dose of the vaccine. “If things reach a state where it so warrants, we may also set up exclusive quarantine facilities for cops. We are also granting them leave on demand without hampering our work. Once the situation comes under the control, we may also arrange counselling facilities to de-stress them,” said Mr. Nagaraju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/caught-between-covid-and-law-and-order-duties/article34476538.ece
04 May 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||David and Goliath story at Chavara||A cliffhanger contest and a shocker climax similar to the Biblical story of David and Goliath—that’s what Chavara witnessed when a first-timer knocked down a political titan in the constituency. LDF-Independent Dr. Sujith Vijyan Pillai overthrowing a former Minister and UDF biggie like Shibu Baby John in a photo finish wasn’t something anticipated. Apart from marking an unexpected victory, the electoral outcome in Chavara also indicates the steady decline of Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), which once again failed to send any representative to Kerala Assembly. It was a do-or-die battle for the party in Chavara to protect its citadel and senior leader after it won zero seats in the last Assembly polls. For the first time in more than four decades, the party couldn’t claim a single seat in 2016 and that had left the leadership bewildered. It was a repeat of 2016 for RSP as it once again lost all its bastions including Eravipuram, Kunnathur and Chavara. Internal dissent following the party’s crossover to UDF in 2014 has now intensified and losing Chavara, the only constituency they were confident about, reveals the brewing rebellion within its ranks. The segment is considered a traditional RSP stronghold as it stood with the party in all Assembly elections till 2016. While N.K. Premachandran won Kollam Lok Sabha seat for two consecutive terms after 2014, all five-party candidates were defeated in the Assembly polls in 2016 and 2021, generating widespread discontent amidst the cadres. It was a sort of surprise when Communist Marxist Party (CMP) leader and late MLA N. Vijayan Pillai snatched the seat from an over-confident Shibu Baby John in 2016. But his son, a newbie in the field and a doctor by profession, emerging victorious despite a meticulous campaign plan was more of a shock. While Baby John, his father and one of the founding members of RSP, had won the seat six times, Shibu had successfully contested from Chavara on two previous occasions. Eravipuram The situation was no different in Eravipuram and Kunnathur where LDF managed to make strong inroads into the traditional RSP bastions, winning both the seats in 2016 and 2021. While two veteran leaders had to face humiliating defeats in Eravipuram, RSP dissident Kovoor Kunjumon kept the Kunnathur seat both times. Party State secretary A.A. Azis was defeated by M. Naushad in Eravipuram by margin of 28,803 votes in 2016 and in 2021, he clinched his second consecutive term with a majority of 28,121 votes beating former Minister Babu Divakaran. Though Kovoor Kunjumon won by a slight margin of 2,790 compared to his last 20,529, his success was another blow to the party. RSP had fielded A. Sreedharan in Attingal where the candidate was pushed to the third position while their fifth candidate Illikkal Augusthy was no match for Health Minister K.K. Shylaja who won by the largest margin in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/david-and-goliath-story-at-chavara/article34476150.ece
04 May 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||A blend of political acumen, controversies||The political career of Keezhoottu Raman Pillai Balakrishna Pillai, veteran leader and Kerala Congress (B) supremo, was storied and mired in controversies. A seasoned politician and seven-time legislator from Kottarakara, he had held portfolios of electricity, excise, and transport in the ministries of C. Achutha Menon, K. Karunakaran, E.K. Nayanar, and A.K. Antony. The youngest MLA to be elected to the Kerala Assembly in 1960, he has been serving as the chairman of Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities during his last days. With links across party lines, often he excelled as a leader who clearly understood the political nitty-gritty and undercurrents in a tumultuous career spanning six decades. MLA at 25 Born as the son of Keezhoottu Raman Pillai and Karthiayani Amma on April 7, 1934, Mr. Pillai started off his political career on the campus and later joined Congress. At the age of 25, he entered Kerala Assembly for the first time, representing Pathanapuram constituency, and three years later contested the local body polls to be elected as the president of Edamulakkal panchayat. In 1964, a faction quit the Congress and formed the Kerala Congress. Mr. Pillai was made the general secretary of the party. He tasted defeat in the next Assembly elections and later the party split into ‘B’ and ‘M’ groups, with Mr. Pillai and K.M. Mani heading the two new factions. Before joining the Achutha Menon ministry, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Mavelikara in 1971. He also served as the president of Kottarakara panchayat for long, till a legislation prevented MLAs and MPs from contesting in local body polls. Kerala Congress (B) was part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) when the coalition was formed and when it first came into power. While he represented Kottarakara constituency from 1977 to 2001 for seven consecutive terms, his son and Kerala Congress (B) leader K.B. Ganesh Kumar has been representing Pathanapuram for the last two decades. Incidentally, he passed away a day after his son was elected from the segment for the fifth term. Hitting the nadir The politician hit the lowest point in his career when he underwent rigorous imprisonment in the Edamalayar corruption case. Over the years he had courted controversy for an alleged communal speech and another speech that came to be known as his ‘Punjab model speech’ which resulted in his resignation from the K. Karunakaran ministry. In 2015, KC(B) walked out of the Congress-led coalition and joined the LDF. The move was preceded by a bitter war within the UDF, kicked off by his comments on corruption charges against Finance Minister K.M. Mani. After joining hands with the LDF, Mr. Pillai’s appointment as the chairman of Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities, the same position he held during the time of UDF government, had triggered another controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-blend-of-political-acumen-controversies/article34476163.ece

04 May 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||It’s soul-searching time for State BJP||In the end, the story of the assembly elections in Central Travancore turned out to be neither that of a consolidation of the Upper caste Hindu and Christian votes against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) nor a distinctive rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Despite all the campaign blitzkrieg featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance witnessed a sharp decline in its vote share across the 14 assembly segments in Kottayam and Pathanamthitta district. Worse still, the party’s State president K.Surendran was once again relegated to a distant third in Konni, an assembly segment where the outfit had witnessed a sharp rise in vote share since 2016. As per preliminary estimates, total votes received by the coalition across the nine assembly segments in Kottayam dropped by nearly one lakh this time when compared to 2016. Of the nine seats, the coalition bagged just 2,965 votes in Poonjar to stage its worst performance while K.J.Alphons, the BJP candidate in Kanjirappally received 29,157 votes to emerge as the best performer. The NDA, which had bagged 51,052 votes in the 2011 assembly elections, had raised its vote share by almost three times to collect 2,01,287 votes in 2016. The Sabarimala protests in 2018 had triggered a further rise in the coalition's vote share in the region, as demonstrated by the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Riding on the momentum, it then went on to capture power in a couple of panchayats, besides winning a handful of seats in other local bodies later next year. In Pathanamathitta too, the coalition experienced an unforeseen erosion in its vote base across the five assembly segments. While the vote share of Mr.Surendran, who had received 39,786 votes during the by-election in 2019, came down to 32,811, A.Padmakumar, the BDJS candidate in Ranni came up with the worst performance of 19,587 votes as against 28,201 votes in 2016. Adding to its concerns, the coalition even failed to gain an upper hand in the BJP-led Pandalam municipality, during the counting of votes polled to the Adoor assembly seat. The abrupt fall in numbers, meanwhile, has left the BJP leadership at the local level, scurrying for a proper explanation. “A detailed analysis of the results is yet to be done though it highlights the need to strengthen the party's presence at the grassroots,” said Noble Mathew, BJP district president, Kottayam. Official sources , however, attributed the below par performance to a host of factors starting from the selection of candidates to the absence of focused work in its core areas of strength. “Other than Sabarimala and Love Jihad, the BJP had nothing substantial to highlight as an alternative to the UDF and the LDF. Adding to it were the resentment over the selection of candidates in seats including Kottayam, Thiruvalla and Aranmula and the widening discord with the BDJS,” pointed out a senior BJP leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-soul-searching-time-for-state-bjp/article34476141.ece

Sukumaran Nair, on Monday resigned as a Syndicate member of the Mahatma Gandhi University. According to Mr. Nair, the decision to resign from the post was aimed at avoiding controversies in the future. “While it was the UDF government that first nominated my daughter to the university Syndicate, the LDF government retained her place in the panel. Both the governments had nominated her to the committee as an educationist based on her qualifications,” he said. Asserting that neither he nor his daughter ever approached any government or political leader for the nomination, he said she had been serving as Principal of the NSS Hindu College, Changanassery. “She has been a member of university Syndicate for the past seven years and has got three more years to complete the term. However, to avoid any controversy regarding her nomination, she has tendered her resignation on personal grounds,” he said. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alleged on Monday that Mr. Nair had intentionally signalled his supporters to vote against the LDF government on polling day. He raised his finger and said people should show the government the door. Mr. Nair had attempted to influence their choice to defeat the LDF, Mr. Vijayan said.

Mukkom Muncipality and Chengottukavu grama panchayat are declared as local self-government institutions in a critical condition. Mr. Rao said in an order that public gatherings have been banned in local bodies with a TPR of over 30%. People should venture out only for essential needs. Only hospitals, medical shops, and those selling food and essential stuff are allowed to open till 7 p.m. Hotels can provide takeaways and home delivery till 9 p.m. and in-house dining is not allowed. Movements in and out of these local bodies would be allowed only for emergency needs. The restrictions would continue until the daily TPR falls below 25%. Meanwhile, the State-wide restrictions imposed by the government too will come into force from Tuesday and continue for the next six days. Mr. Rao said in a release on Monday that only essential staff would be allowed in non-governmental institutions. All the staff should wear double face masks and carry their ID cards. Industrial units, companies, and organisations in the essential services sector can function. Only skeletal staff should work in the IT sector and others should work from home.

04 May 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Cong. fails to open account in Kozhikode for fourth time||After its crushing defeat in the Assembly polls, the Congress leadership will do an introspection on failing to open an account for the fourth time in a row in Kozhikode district. The leadership had given a thought to revamping its electoral strategy for the Assembly polls when the party was roundly trounced in the three-tier local body polls in December. However, this time too, the party failed to win a legislature seat. At the same time, the Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI), backed by the United Democratic Front , opened its account in the Assembly by winning the Vadakara seat. Also, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) captured the Koduvally seat although the party lost its two sitting seats- Kozhikode South and Kuttiyadi. This time, the Congress again fielded KPCC general secretaries K. Praveen Kumar and N. Subramanian in Nadapuram and Koyilandy respectively to wrest these segments. They failed to impress the electorate although both of them have been trying to establish their activities in these Assembly constituencies. However, their candidacies have been able to bring down the vote share of the Left Democratic Front ( LDF) nominees. Similarly, in Kozhikode North, Congress candidate K.M. Abhijith has been able to eat into the vote share of the CPI(M). He was also able to reduce the winning margin of the two-time Mayor Thottathil Raveendran in the constituency. In these three segments, the Congress leadership had hoped to spring a surprise. The party did not have any big expectations in Beypore and Balussery, the two segments where the Congress candidates were in fray. Party sources said that the decision of the KPCC to nominate K. Muraleedharan, who is also the Vadakara, MP to fight the polls in Nemom, put a vacuum in the electioneering of the Congress candidates in these segments. Not only did Mr. Muraleedharan finish in the third position in the Assembly polls, his absence adversely impacted the campaign of the UDF-led coalition in key segments in Kozhikode district. The Congress-IUML combine would have won a few more seats in Kozhikode district if Mr. Muraleedharan was present in the poll scenario, he said. Also, the KPCC was unable to coordinate the electioneering in the district with its vice president T. Siddique contesting from Kalpetta in neighbouring Wayanad district. A solace is that he won the electoral race. Besides, three KPCC general secretaries including P.N. Niyas were candidates in the district, a Congress functionary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-fails-to-open-account-in-kozhikode-for-fourth-time/article34476080.ece

04 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||SHRC seeks measures to check child pornography||The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Inspector General of Police, Crime Branch, to take necessary steps and develop effective methods to curb child pornography and other sexual crimes against children in the State. Acting on a petition filed by a human rights activist in Kannur, Commission member K. Byjunath had sought reports from the Director of General Education as well as the IGP of the Crime Branch. The Commission has come up with a set of recommendations for schools as well as the police in this regard. The petitioner had sought the SHRC’s intervention in directing the Home Department to take steps to curb child pornography, as the police was allegedly slow in taking action in this regard. He also sought a direction to cyber experts to look into darknet and social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram to track such cases. Along with this, the petitioner sought the intervention of departments of education, health and police to appoint a clinical psychologist in every school in the State and sensitise children to crimes against them. The Director of General Education informed the Commission in a report that appointing a clinical psychologist in every school would bring a huge financial burden to the government and instead suggested counselling classes in collaboration with the Health Department or utilising services of counsellors in high schools more effectively. The IG of Crime Branch, in his report, said about ‘P-Hunt’, an operation in place in the department since 2017, exclusively against child sexual abuse offenders in the internet. It also says about CCSE, a dedicated unit to track online sexual abuse offenders, which works in coordination with international organisations. Panel suggestions Appreciating efforts taken by the police and considering the seriousness of the matter, the Commission has directed the IG to effectively monitor the operations mentioned in his report and take steps to create awareness among students and parents regarding such crimes. The Commission has directed the Director of General Education to see that each educational institution regularly conducts counselling programmes for students with the help of NGOs or the Department of Social Justice. The Director has to ask heads of educational institutions to seek the help of the district and taluk-level Legal Services Authority for conducting awareness classes and providing legal services to parents, students or teachers.

04 May 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Good strategy, rainbow coalition helped LDF||A well thought-out political strategy coupled with some social engineering mechanism appeared to have helped the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) defy the anti-incumbency in the State. More than what churned out the spectacular victory of LDF albeit riding on the constructive popularity of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was a combination of factors, including the rainbow coalition comprising 11 constituents, that was successfully experimented in the three-tier local body polls in December. The entry of Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Kerala Congress (M) and the formal induction of Indian National League (INL) have helped the LDF in the Assembly polls similar to that in the local body polls. Nevertheless, the CPI(M) leadership knew in advance that to profitably achieve the first past-the-post in a three-cornered contest it would have to tweak its voter base along with the goodwill generated through social security measures and distribution of food kits through ration shops. Voting patterns in the just-concluded elections showed that party heavyweights although secured huge victory margins, many sitting legislators and fresh faces failed to either maintain the lead in the previous polls or managed to scrape through. The vote-share of the party dwindled in many winning segments in Kannur, Kozhikode and Palakkad districts and massively in Alappuzha and Kollam districts. The party wise vote-share of the CPI(M) stood at 25.38%, the Congress 25.12% and the BJP 11.30 %. Incidentally, the vote-share of the CPI(M) was 26.7%; Congress 23.8% and the BJP 10.6% in the 2016 polls. A consolation to the CPI(M) is that the party secured the support of a large section of the Christian community even while stalling the erosion of its core vote-share of the Ezhava community. A December Facebook post of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan against the Congress party that the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) seem to control the United Democratic Front (UDF) gave an impetus to the Hindu consolidation in favour of the LDF. The statement of Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair rooting for a Congress-led government turned out to be counterproductive with a section of Nair community rallying behind the LDF. This they read with the entry of IUML leader P.K. Kunhalikutty and dominating the State polity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/good-strategy-rainbow-coalition-helped-ldf/article34476154.ece
04 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vaccination at stadium likely to be wound up||Faced with criticisms over the conduct of the COVID-19 vaccination drive, the district health authorities are mulling over winding down the mega vaccination camp at Jimmy George indoor stadium. During the initial phase of the drive, the indoor stadium enabled the district administration to inoculate sizeable numbers, even while ensuring physical distancing. Serpentine queues However, serpentine queues that became a common sight lately have prompted officials to reassess its future course. The large crowds were fuelled by speculations over the dwindling vaccine stock as well as growing panic against the backdrop of the sharp surge in COVID-19 cases. Besides, the confidence held by senior health officials that vaccine-seekers would adhere to the allotted time-slots proved misplaced as unruly masses thronged the stadium on various occasions. While the district authorities have announced that the vaccine would not be administered at the Jimmy George indoor stadium on Tuesday partly due to low stock, chances are high that the centre will remain closed in the days to come. The capital district currently has nearly 7,000 vaccine doses left in its vaccine store. They will be administered through 18 vaccination centres in the district on Tuesday. These included the Government Medical College Hospitals, General Hospital, Thycaud Women and Children Hospital, district hospitals and taluk hospitals in certain places. Covaxin will be provided in Fort Taluk Hospital and Valiyathura Coastal Speciality Hospital. With the government yet to launch vaccination for the 18-45 age group, doses will be provided for those above 45 years only. Besides, 80% of the allotted doses will be supplied through spot registration for those requiring the second dose, while the remaining can be booked online. 9,659 inoculated On Monday, a total of 9,659 people were inoculated in the district.

The work on the two gas furnaces at Shanthikavadam began last year after the COVID-19 outbreak, when the Corporation realised that there is a strain on the existing facilities. Tested “We carried out the testing of the gas furnaces yesterday. It is now being used for cremating COVID-19 patients,” said a health official of the Corporation. Along with the two gas furnaces, the Shanthikavadam facility now has two electric furnaces and two wood-based ones. According to health officials, the gas furnaces and electric furnaces will be put to use exclusively for cremating COVID-19 patients during the pandemic period. “The average number of bodies being cremated at Shanthikavadam per day has gone up in recent days. Although the numbers are still manageable, there is certainly a huge load on the system. So, for the time being, we have set aside the electric and gas furnaces just for cremating those who died due to COVID-19, while using wood-based furnaces for the others,” said the health official. Some of the crematoriums that have come up in other regions in recent years have opted for LPG furnaces, prompting the Corporation too to choose it while increasing the number of furnaces. In addition to dead bodies from within the city, quite a few panchayats in the surrounding regions are also depending upon the electric crematorium here. After the pandemic outbreak last year, the civic body had also appointed two charge officers permanently at Shanthikavadam to streamline its functioning, in addition to the regular staff. Two junior health inspectors work as charge officers. Before this, the contractors used to handle much of the work here. Online system An online system has also been implemented for reserving the furnaces, through the Smart Trivandrum mobile application and web portal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crematorium-gets-2-gas-furnaces/article34476146.ece
04 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||BJP sold votes to UDF for cash: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday accused the BJP State leadership of betraying their followers by ‘selling’ party votes to the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in at least 90 Assembly constituencies. He urged the BJP’s national leadership to investigate the matter. The BJP’s electoral share had fallen short by four lakh votes. The UDF had made an equivalent gain, he said. Mr. Vijayan quoted elaborately from a break-up of election figures to press his charge against the BJP’s Kerala leadership. Mr. Vijayan said large-scale cash transfer had preceded the cross-voting. BJP leaders had cut a deal with their Congress counterparts in Kerala and channelled tens of thousands of votes into the UDF’s kitty for cash. ‘Entire State’ The pact spanned the entirety of the State. Politics had no role in the deal, he said. Mr. Vijayan said the BJP’s trade-off between organisational loyalty and money had occurred behind the back of the party’s national leadership. The BJP’s top leaders had earnestly campaigned for party candidates across Kerala. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and BJP national president J.P. Nadda held roadshows and rallies. However, the BJP votes had flowed to the UDF in the very same Assembly segments. The disloyalty had weakened the BJP’s organisational structure in Kerala and rendered it moribund. State leaders had backstabbed the BJP’s Central command. Citing examples He said the sly bargain was evident in the defeat of M. Swaraj of the CPI(M) in Thrippunithura and Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma in Kundara. Mr. Vijayan said Ms. Mercykutty Amma was also the victim of a criminal conspiracy involving a government insider to tarnish the LDF’s image. The Opposition had scripted the drama to sow disaffection with the government among traditional fishers. It had propagated the lie that Ms. Mercykutty Amma had abetted a foreign firm to trawl the deep seas. Priorities The State’s economy was sound. But it was vulnerable to the vagaries of the pandemic. Battling the plague and shielding the people from its worst ravages, primarily hunger and deprivation, were the new LDF government’s top priorities.  The BJP’s electoral share had fallen short by four lakh votes, while the UDF had made an equivalent gain.

04 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||26,011 persons test positive in State||The State added 26,011 new COVID-19 cases to its tally on Monday, when 96,296 samples were tested in past 24 hours. The dip in daily new cases was likely a reflection of the ‘Monday phenomenon’ that has been evident in the State since long when a decrease in testing over the weekend results in a lower daily case number. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said disease transmission continued to be very high. The average test positivity rate (TPR) in the State registered 27.01% on Monday. The active case pool grew to include 3,45,887 patients. ICU admissions up Hospital and ICU admissions continued to rise in the State and most private hospitals reported a total saturation of ICU and oxygen beds and having to re-direct patients to other hospitals or even hospitals in neighbouring districts. The number of COVID patients currently being treated in hospitals has risen to 27,181, with 3,091 patients getting newly admitted on Monday. The State has 1,952 critically ill patients in ICUs, with 722 requiring ventilator assistance. Fifty patients were put on ventilators on Monday. On Monday, the State added 45 new recent deaths to its official COVID-19 toll, taking the cumulative toll to 5,450 deaths. Ernakulam continues to have the highest number of active cases at 53,822, a slight dip in case number from the previous day, for the first time in weeks. Kozhikode (48,572), Malappuram (37,377), Thrissur (38,113) and Thiruvananthapuram (28,315) account for a chunk of the State’s active cases. Kozhikode reported the highest number of new cases with 3,919 cases, Ernakulam 3,291, Malappuram 3,278, Thrissur 2,621, Thiruvananthapuram 2,450, Alappuzha 1,994, Palakkad 1,729, Kottayam 1,650, Kannur 1,469, Kollam 1,311, Kasaragod 1,139, Pathanamthitta 428, Idukki 407 and Wayanad 325 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/26011-persons-test-positive-in-state/article34476165.ece
04 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Good performance led to victory in capital: LDF||Having achieved a near clean-sweep by winning 13 of the 14 segments in Thiruvananthapuram district in the Assembly polls, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) district leadership said the victory was largely along expected lines. The CPI (M)-led coalition had expected to better its performance during the 2016 elections when it had won 10 out of the 14 constituencies. Later, it won the Vattiyurkavu constituency too through a byelection in 2019. According to CPI (M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan, the electorate could see through the diversionary tactics of both United Democratic Front (UDF) and National Democratic Alliance (NDA). “Despite their attempts to divert focus from key issues, the public was well aware of the efforts that had been made by the LDF government,” he said. He attributed the increase in the LDF vote-share in most of its sitting seats to the projects that were successfully undertaken in a time-bound manner. Besides, the LDF’s victory in Aruvikkara, Thiruvananthapuram and Nemom boiled down to the lack of performance of the opposition MLAs. The LDF attributed its sole loss in Kovalam to vote-trading between its rivals. Despite managing to improve its vote-share, the LDF could not wrest the seat from M. Vincent who benefited from a significant increase in the votes he garnered, purportedly at the expense of the NDA. Nevertheless, Mr. Nagappan said that the Left front has succeeded in warming up to the coastal community over the years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/good-performance-led-to-victory-in-capital-ldf/article34476659.ece

However, the daily COVID-19 caseload took a significant dip in Thiruvananthapuram on the day as 2,450 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the last 24 hours, thereby registering a test positivity rate (TPR) of 24%. Bringing much relief, the decrease in COVID-19 count has come even as testing remained largely consistent. While the TPR touched 31.35% when 10,910 people were subjected to tests a day ago, it has now fallen considerably after 10,182 people were tested, according to official figures. With 1,956 recovering from the illness, the active caseload stood at 28,315. Five heath workers were among those who were infected. The source of infection in 216 was unknown. The latest set of COVID-19 deaths were of people who died on April 28 and 30. The deceased included 12 men, aged between 83 and 56, and four women, aged between 86 and 62.

04 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||No failure in Congress' campaign: DCC president||Before the Assembly elections, the talk in the UDF camp was about the number of seats they could recapture from the Left in Thiruvananthapuram district. In the Nemom constituency, the front brought in the Congress’ K. Muraleedharan MP with much fanfare, announcing their intention to reclaim the seat from the BJP. However, following the election results, which witnessed a massive Left wave, the UDF lost two out of their three sitting seats in the district and ended up a distant third in Nemom, in what was billed as a tight triangular fight. Speaking to The Hindu , District Congress Committee (DCC) president Neyyattinkara Sanal said that the party was still looking at the exact reasons for the unexpected loss. "We do accept the people's mandate. But, this was not the kind of defeat we ever expected, because no one thought the LDF would come back to power at a time when they were facing so many allegations. There is also no recent history of a front getting two consecutive terms. We will conduct a comprehensive study to look at the elements that contributed to our loss and the specific campaigns that aided their victory," said Mr. Sanal. He said that there had been no failing as far as the Congress' campaign was concerned, as the workers had diligently carried out the ground-level work. On Nemom, he said the Congress had put up a strong fight and played "a key role in closing the BJP's account", even though Mr. Muraleedharan had ended up third. The party was able to capture all of the Congress votes, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-failure-in-congress-campaign-dcc-president/article34476663.ece

04 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSEB clarifies on rates for vehicle charging||With the ‘go electric’ mantra being chanted ever louder, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has come out with clear directions on tariffs for different categories of electric vehicle charging points in the State. Private charging points in residences are permitted and the existing supply can be used for charging electric vehicles. No separate electric connection is required in this case. Additionally, the KSEB has clarified that the tariff applicable for domestic consumption will be applicable to these private charging points. The tariffs for captive charging stations - stations owned by fleet owners, government departments, corporate houses, bus depots - have not been specified in the revised guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Power in October, 2019, the KSEB noted. This being the case, captive charging stations have been assigned the respective tariffs of the office/corporate house/depots where they are maintained until the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission specifies the rates. Captive stations also can use existing supply for charging the EVs. But if the additional load caused by the charging infrastructure requires modification or change in the existing connection, it should be modified as prescribed by Regulation '90' of the Kerala Electricity Supply Code, 2014, the KSEB noted. Public charging stations - an EV charging station where any electric vehicle can get its battery recharged - will be given a separate service connection and will be billed at the tariffs approved by the KSERC. At present, this is LT-X and HT-VI categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kseb-clarifies-on-tariff-rates-for-vehicle-charging/article34476147.ece

The body of a COVID-19-infected person, who hailed from Neyyattinkara, was released to the family of another COVID-19-deceased who was a native of Vellayani on Sunday. The lapse came to light after the relatives of the Neyyattinkara native came to the hospital along with a few police officials to complete inquest proceedings. On reaching the mortuary, it became evident that the body was missing. Following an inquiry, the hospital authorities realised that they had released the body to the family from Vellayani who cremated the body at the Shanthi Kavadam by then. Officials claimed that the body was handed over after the family had wrongly identified the body. Mohanakumar, a security officer at the mortuary, has been suspended on the basis of preliminary findings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mch-releases-wrong-body/article34476661.ece

Rajesh noted that the ‘Left wave’ and a combination of other factors prevented the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from achieving intended targets in the district. The district unit of the BJP has initiated a detailed assessment of the party’s performance, especially in Nemom, the high-profile segment which it lost to the CPI(M), Mr. Rajesh said on Monday. “Our mandalam meetings are in progress. But if you look at the results, the BJP’s votes have increased significantly in constituencies such as Attingal and Chirayinkeezhu. On the other hand, they have dipped slightly in segments such as Parassala and Vattiyoorkavu. The Left wave was a factor, but the party has secured the sure votes from the BJP-RSS fold in the district,” he said. While the ground-level assessment in Nemom is still on, Mr. Rajesh observed that the Nair-Ezhava votes in the segment may have been split between the BJP and the UDF. He alleged that a section of the minority votes flowed to the Left under the guidance of the SDPI in segments where the odds were in BJP’s favour. False impressions contributed to the ‘Left wave,’ according to Mr. Rajesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-blames-left-wave-for-poor-show/article34476665.ece

Despite intensive campaigning that involved several star campaigners, the BJP managed to improve its vote share only in five constituencies in the district — Thrissur, Irinjalakuda, Nattika, Ollur and Chelakkara. The party, however, secured 15,709 more votes in the Thrissur constituency than the last time. In addition to the increase in party votes, the star influence of actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi too helped the BJP here. In Irinjalakuda, where the BJP fielded former DGP Jacob Thomas, it improved its vote share by 3,909 votes. The candidate’s influence might have made an impact here as well. In Ollur where B. Gopalakrishnan contested, the party secured 4,601 more votes. While there was an increase of 200 votes in Chelakkara constituency, Nattika registered a raise of just 66 votes. Dip in share At the same time, the party lost 4,905 votes in Wadakkanchery compared to the previous polls. In Kodungallur too, there was a dip of 4,589 votes. Likewise, the Kaipamangalam constituency recorded a massive decrease of 20,975 votes. When the BJP secured 8,928 votes less than that was polled the last time in Chalakudy, there was a dip of 940 votes at Puthukkad. In Manalur, where the BJP was expecting a surprise victory, there was a decrease of 1,114 votes, where as in Kunnamkulam, the party lost 1,492 votes. In the absence of its own candidate, the BJP-led NDA supported Dileep Nair of the Democratic Social Justice Party in the Guruvayur constituency. Mr. Nair secured only 6,294 votes in total, which is 19,196 votes less than what the front received in 2016. In the last Assembly elections, the BJP supported the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena candidates in Ollur, Nattika, Kaipamangalam, Chalakudy and Kodungallur.

Committee members G. Obul Konda Reddy and Venkatanarayana met GGH Superintendent K.S.S. Venkateswara Rao and asked him to immediately recruit/depute an adequate number of doctors and nurses. “Against 55 doctors needed for the hospital, only 25 of them were working there, and against a norm of 4 staff nurses, 2 male nurses, 2 SNOs and 4 sweepers, there were hardly any available in any of the 17 wards,” they told the GGH Superintendent. Three of the available lab technicians tested positive for COVID as also was Resident Medical Officer and all ECG Operators. “In such a condition, fresh appointments should have been made to save the lives of COVID patients,” the panel members said. The old methodology of tracing, testing, and treating followed last year should be continued, they added. Meanwhile, District Collector Gandham Chandrudu in a release said that for the Hindupur Government General Hospital, the district administration had appointed one general duty doctor, one paediatrician, 18 staff nurses, 5 house surgeons, 10 female nursing orderlies(FNOs) and MSOs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-panel-finds-shortage-of-staff-at-super-speciality-hospital/article34476592.ece

04 May 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shortage of health workers hits sanitation||Shortage of health workers, many of whom are overburdened, owing to COVID-19 has led to poor sanitation in some of the divisions of Chittoor Municipal Corporation and several municipalities in the last one month. The COVID situation in the Chittoor Municipal Corporation, which remained considerably under control till mid-April with daily cases between 70 and 150, went out of control at the end of the month with the daily cases crossing the 200-mark. The corporation with 50 divisions has close to 50 containment zones. With pressure mounting from the recently elected corporators, officials of the sanitation wing are finding it tough to carry out the twin responsibilities of disinfecting the areas from where COVID cases are being reported, and the daily routine of garbage collection and clearing sewage. Sanitary Inspector K. Chinnaiah said that in order to check the pandemic, two jumbo disinfectant sprayers were working round the clock to match the constantly increasing daily cases. He said that the workload on the health workers had increased in recent weeks with sudden spike of cases. “Due to this, it’s true that the public sanitation is taking a backseat in some areas. But, we are doing our best to remove the garbage and clear sewage lines. Of the 500-plus workers, including the permanent and outsourcing staff, on any given day, 90% of them are working,” he said. Waste collection In several municipalities, the collection of domestic waste is done on alternate days due to shortage of workforce. In Kuppam, which recently became a municipality, there is acute shortage of health workers. Though collection of waste was done on alternate days before the lockdown in March last year, residents say it was not seen since the outbreak of the pandemic. Several wards and public places are seen with clogged drains and piling up of garbage dumps. This scenario is attributed to overburdening of the health workers, diverted to COVID duties as the number of daily cases remained close to 100 since a week, as against less than 20 in early April. Similar situation is reported from Madanapalle, Palamaner, Puttur and Nagari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shortage-of-health-workers-hits-sanitation/article34475948.ece

04 May 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Aspirants cry foul over results of Group-1 Mains||The results of the APPSC Group-1 Mains examinations have stoked fresh concerns among a section of aspirants. Several candidates are raising questions over the genuineness of the results, saying that they had put in a much better performance in the exam than what the results indicate. Many of the candidates said they qualified in the UPSC Prelims and Mains exams as well, but were unable to qualify in the Group-1 Mains exam. On Monday, some of the candidates approached the APPSC secretary in Vijayawada, who stated that all procedures were followed while publishing the results. “Most candidates who cleared even UPSC Mains and interviews have failed to clear Group-1 Mains despite getting a year-and-half of preparation time,” said a candidate from Guntur. Some of the candidates have pointed out that the Commission has given the responsibility of conducting the Mains exam and evaluation of results to a third party. This private agency reportedly followed its own evaluation criteria, with answer copies said to have been digitally scanned. “How can the APPSC give up its Constitutional duty to conduct exams and evaluate results to a private organisation? What is the experience of this private organisation in handling a governmental recruitment examination? There are several questions such as the kind of training imparted to the evaluators by the private organisation and what parameters have been applied. Digital evaluation and digital scanning leaves a lot of scope for technical errors,” said another candidate requesting not to be named. Some aver that a significant proportion of candidates have cleared the Mains with just a month of preparation after APPSC released a new selection list in November 2020. These candidates, with a very low score in Prelims, have cleared Group-1 Mains but many candidates with good scores in Prelims, even after one-and-a-half years of preparation, have not made it past the interview. The candidates urged the Commission to publish the names and marks of all candidates who cleared Group-1 Mains, including their Prelims scores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aspirants-cry-foul-over-group-1-mains-results/article34475949.ece

The Collector took several key decisions on COVID-19 management including triaging during a review meeting on Monday. The details of the patients undergoing treatment at the Aarogyasri and non-Aarogyasri hospitals should be uploaded in the portal. First priority would be given to the frontline and healthcare workers. Oxygen audit would be done daily. “We are ensuring oxygen supply facilities even at the primary health centres. The staff will undergo training in the usage of oxygen and handling the equipment. It has come to the notice that oxygen supply is not controlled. Even mild asymptomatic patients are getting oxygen. An audit should be done on oxygen supply on a daily basis,” said Mr. Vivek Yadav.  The Collector said that CCTV cameras would be installed at the seven oxygen filling stations to monitor the supply. He suggested that audit should be done on the supply of Remdevisir injections in a transparent manner. “The hospitals must submit indents on the daily requirement of Remdesivir to the Drug Control Administration (DCA). All details should be displayed on notice boards,” he said and asked the officials to lay a pipeline for supply of oxygen at the Government General Hospital (GGH). Joint Collectors A.S. Dinesh Kumar, P. Prasanthi and DRO P.

04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||University of Hyderabad start-up claims breakthrough in COVID treatment||A breakthrough human Umbilical Cord (UC) tissue harvested and clinically processed adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)-based therapy to COVID patients has been announced by Transcell Oncologics,  a biotech start-up company, incubated at ASPIRE-Technology Business Incubator (ASPIRE-TBI), University of Hyderabad (UoH) on Monday. The firm had developed proprietary cell-based platform technology ‘HEMATO UC-MSCs’ with anti-cytokine storm properties, anti-inflammatory attributes and repairing abilities. The research recommends HEMATO UC-MSCs to be administered as “two intravenous infusions, at a dose of 100 million cells per infusion, given 72 hours apart to the COVID patients. “A significant decrease in a set of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 “cytokine storm”; with significantly improved patient survival and time to recovery was observed following the treatment,” claimed, an official spokesman in a press release. “MSCs have the proven ability to reduce ventilator-induced lung damage, reduce cytokine storm, regenerate damaged tissue encouraging practitioners to use them for pre-treating COVID patients in the hospital. HEMATO UC-MSCs fall in that category, per se they do not cause any adverse effects, are easy to administer, proven to be safe for human application, with added benefits like no damage caused to any organ,” said founder-CEO Subadra Dravida. She said the new method provides an alternative opportunity to the practitioners to treat increasing COVID-19 cases in the country. The advantage of the therapy is this new way of curing COVID patients in real time to save them and not to treat the symptoms alone. Also, if HEMATO UC-MSCs are administered as the first line of treatment followed by concomitant steps to alleviate the associated symptoms in a traditional way, COVID deaths can be dodged, she asserted. Effectiveness of this MSC-based technology has been confirmed by Cell Transplant Centre, Miami Miller School of Medicine, Jackson Health System, Department of Public Health Sciences, USA on COVID-19 patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It has released a detailed research paper on a randomised Controlled Trial (double blind pase 1/2a) and confirmed the laboratory findings from Transcell Oncologics. The CEO said HEMATO UC-MSCs are already being used by multiple hospitals in Hyderabad and rest of Telangana to save COVID patients. Hospitals in other cities are also in the process of starting the treatments. It can be delivered pan India within 48 hours and has been specially treated for storage under 2-8 deg C refrigerated conditions for ease of use by the practitioners within 72 hours. UoH Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao Podile expressed his happiness about the availability of an alternative treatment for the COVID-19 developed by UoH Startup Transcell Oncologics. Contact details for HEMATO UC-MSCs: Whatsapp or Regular phone: 91-8297256755 or 91-8886666615 orrgupta@tran-scell.com Transcell Oncologics is into drug discovery, enabling cancer medicine and the related invitro testing applications as alternative models to animals in validating pharma, vaccine and cosmetics intended for human consumption. HEMATO Global, a product brand from Transcell Oncologics, has over 20 distinct products based on clinically processed stem cells in and as therapeutic tools for imparting transplantations and crystorage services for cancer treatments, said a press release.

04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||CCMB dry swab RT-PCR test available for labs||The dry swab based direct RT-PCR method of COVID-19 testing, developed by CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and approved by ICMR can now be adopted in testing labs across the country. This method is easier to carry out than the current procedures, and can ramp up testing by 2-3 fold using the current infrastructure in the testing labs. The CCMB has offered to train ICMR-approved government as well as private COVID-19 testing centres to help them adopt this method. It aims to train staff at 500 testing centres across India, starting this week. Most of these sessions will be online. The willing centres can book their slots on -- http://e-portal.ccmb.res.in/ dst_slotbooking/. Those in and around Hyderabad can also avail physical training sessions by reaching out to the Director of CCMB. This method needs no Viral Transport Medium (VTM) for sending samples from sample collection centres to testing centres. This requires much lesser sample packing, and there is no contamination between samples, said a press release. In this method, the RNA isolation steps have been replaced by a single-step addition of an easily available reagent. Extract from this step can be directly used for RT-PCR without compromising on the quality of results. These make the tests faster, cheaper, safer for the healthcare workers, and increase throughput with existing resources and setup. “India is struggling with a steep surge in COVID-19 cases. The testing centres are overwhelmed with the number of samples that they have to test. It is an absolute need to increase our testing capacity within the existing set up. We are positive that the dry swab based direct RT-PCR method will help in the cause immensely,” said CCMB advisor Dr Rakesh Mishra. The technology has been licensed to various healthcare companies such as Apollo Hospitals, Meril Life, Spice Health and Capital Health Pvt Ltd to manufacture and commercialise these testing kits. Many other industry partners are expected to come on board soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ccmb-dry-swab-rt-pcr-test-available-for-labs/article34476135.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Yet another land grab probe against Rajender||The State government has ordered an inquiry into alleged land grabbing by former Minister Eatala Rajender and his supporters even as a detailed probe into land grabbing charges against Mr. Rajender is under way. The probe this time around is on large scale encroachment and illegal transactions of land belonging to Sree Seetarama Swamy temple at Devarayamjal in Shamirpet mandal of Medchal-Malkajgiri district. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said in the orders issued on Monday that the Endowments department was claiming that an extent of 1,521 acres and 13 guntas belonged to the temple and a couple of vernacular dailies extensively reported about the encroachment of the temple lands by Mr. Rajender and few other individuals. “It is reported that the value of the encroached lands is more than Rs. 1,000 crore and the temple has been defrauded of such high value properties,” the order said. It had also been reported that large constructions had been made on these lands without any valid permissions and in flagrant violation of several laws. “Besides gravely hurting the sentiments of the devotees and donors, it is alleged that these actions constitute grave violations of several laws in force,” the Chief Secretary said in the orders. It was accordingly decided to order a detailed inquiry into the issue by a committee of officials. The committee would be headed by Panchayat Raj Commissioner M. Raghunandan Rao and would comprise Collectors of Medchal-Malkajgiri (Sweta Mohanty), Mancherial (Bharati Holikere) and Nalgonda (Prasanth Jeevan Patil) as its members. The committee should conduct detailed inquiry into the details of encroachers and land encroached upon, the nature of encroachment and present usage, documents possessed by these encroachers and permission, if any, given by any government body. The committee would also examine violations of existing government regulations, extent of vacant land, the extent of land under encroachment by the benamis and influential persons behind them and extent of revenue loss to the temple and recommend action that should be initiated. The Chief Secretary has asked the committee to submit its report at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yet-another-land-grab-probe-against-rajendar/article34475898.ece

04 May 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Labs challenge slashing of RT-PCR test charge||A group of private diagnostic laboratories in Kerala on Monday approached the High Court against the order of the State government reducing the charge for RT-PCR tests from Rs. 1,700 to Rs. 500. In their petition, the laboratory owners said as per the present norms and quality standards, the average cost for conducting an RT-PCR test came to Rs. 1,500. The revision of the charges would detrimentally affect the quality of the tests. They pointed out that cheaper test kits were available in the market, but they might not give good results. The bulk of their clientèle were travellers abroad or those intending to undergo surgery in private hospitals. Therefore, accuracy of the test could not be compromised by using cheaper kits. It was next to impossible to do effective RT-PCR tests at Rs. 500 unless the quality of the reagents used in the test and the processes were compromised. The order would force the laboratories to use cheaper kits, leading to inaccurate results. The petitioners said the government had no power to issue an order fixing the charge at Rs. 500 and making it mandatory for the labs to collect only the fixed charge. They alleged that the government had passed the order unilaterally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/labs-challenge-slashing-of-rt-pcr-test-charge/article34475896.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||ISRO case: CBI files case against police officials||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case to probe the alleged role of senior Kerala police officials whose names have come up in the Justice D.K. Jain Committee report for allegedly framing space scientist Nambi Narayanan in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case of 1994. It is learnt that the police officials mentioned in the report have also been named in the FIR as accused persons. However, the agency has not revealed their identities. “As directed by the Supreme Court, the particulars are not being divulged,” said an official. Earlier, the Kerala police had registered the first case linked to the espionage allegation on October 20, 1994, against a Maldivian national under the Foreigners Act. They registered the second case under the Official Secrets Act on November 13, 1994, against two Maldivians and others. Both the cases were later handed over to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the State police. Besides the two foreign nationals, the SIT arrested four more persons, including two scientists then working with the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of the ISRO. The probe was then transferred to the CBI on December 4, 1994. The CBI, in its closure report, submitted that the espionage charge against the scientists at ISRO, including Mr. Narayanan, was not proved and was found to be false. The court accepted the findings. In a report, the CBI alleged that Siby Mathew, who headed the SIT, did not take adequate steps related to thorough interrogation of the accused persons and the verification of the “so-called disclosure” made by them. The CBI later submitted in the court that despite having highlighted the lapses, the State government failed to take any action against the erring officials. Mr. Narayanan approached the Supreme Court seeking action against such officials. The court, on September 14, 2018, awarded a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to him on various counts and also ordered the constitution of a committee for getting the actual scenario and to find out ways for taking appropriate steps against the officials concerned. Based on the committee’s report, the Supreme Court on April 15 directed the CBI to proceed in the matter in accordance with law. The agency has to submit its findings within three months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/isro-case-cbi-files-case-against-police-officers/article34475910.ece
04 May 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID spread, curbs hit MGNREGS workers hard||“How can we keep our bodies and souls together without work,” asks a group of villagers at Aluru village in Prakasam district, who are bearing the brunt of the lockdown-like restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the infection. As cases spike in the district, the authorities have stopped notifying them about works under the Centre’s flagship programme, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), launched to provide some financial cushion at a time when there is no work at farms. A group of workers at Kothapatnam Pallepalem, where curbs have been put in place, said: “It’s a deja vu for us. We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea once again, a situation similar to one last year. The government should ensure that work is provided to us uninterruptedly.” In addition to their demand for continuous provision of work, they want free vaccination for all workers. “It is high time the Centre adopts a universal vaccination policy and cover all those enrolled under MGNREGS as we cannot afford to abstain from work even for a day,” explains yet another group of workers in Kondepi village. Financial aid Taking cudgels for the workers, Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union Prakasam district secretary K.Anjaneyulu wants the government to either show them work or provide a financial aid of Rs. 10,000 to each worker. He also demanded that their pay be hiked for 200 days at the rate of Rs. 300 per day and also increase the summer allowance from 30% to 50%. “The workers who died at work site due to COVID-19 or any other disease should be provided a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh,” he said while making mention of a 52-year-old woman dying while working at J. Pangalur village recently. “We work under trying circumstances without a resting place. Supply of butter milk during summer has also been stopped following delay in settlement of pending bills to a Self Help Group, which was entrusted with the task,” said MGNREGS workers in Maddipadu village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-spread-curbs-hit-mgnregs-workers-hard/article34475954.ece

04 May 2021||SRIKAKULAM/VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Decision to impose partial lockdown welcomed||Trade unions and political representatives on Monday welcomed the State government’s decision to impose a partial lockdown from Wednesday in order to curb the dangerous rise in COVID-19 cases. According to a directive issued by the government on Monday, all shops and commercial establishments will be allowed to function only from 6 a.m. to noon. People can come out of their homes only during these hours. Welcoming the decision, Lok Satta State executive president Bhisetty Babji said that a lockdown was the need of the hour given the drastic spread of COVID-19 in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, where over 3,000 new cases were being reported daily. “The government should augment bed strength immediately as the existing COVID-19 hospitals are unable to provide treatment to all the patients. The curfew announced by the government should be implemented strictly,” he added. In Vizianagaram, Balaji Market president B.Venkata Rao said that all shop owners have been advised to follow physical distancing norms and proper sanitisation of their premises. He said that their Market Committee would ensure compliance with the State government’s new guidelines which come into force from Wednesday. ‘Death rate worrying’ Sankalp Shivam Jeevan Seva Foundation head Kinjarapu Shalini expressed concern over the death rate in Srikakulam district compared to other districts in the State. “Due to shortage of beds, many patients are being forced to remain in home isolation. Some of them are ignoring the seriousness of the disease. That is one of the main reasons behind the high death rate in Srikakulam. Fortunately, the curfew announced by the government may lead to a decline in new cases,” she said. Srikakulam Chamber of Commerce assistant treasurer Perla Mahesh urged the district administration to minimise congestion in the markets where more crowds were anticipated due to the limited trading hours. “In spite of the spread of COVID-19, physical distancing is hardly being followed at medical shops, grocery stores and other places. This is the main reason behind the rapid spread of the virus in Srikakulam district. The government should take stringent action against those violating the COVID-19 norms,” he said. Rush feared Srikakulam district Kalinga Komati Sangham president Boina Govindarajulu urged the government to give priority to traders in vaccination coverage as many traders involved in the sale of essential commodities had become victims of COVID-19. He expressed apprehension that the high rush at shops due to curtailed business hours will put the lives of traders at even more risk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govts-decision-to-impose-partial-lockdown-welcomed/article34476650.ece
04 May 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials overwhelmed as demand for hospital beds increases||In tune with the prevailing grim situation across the nation and the State, the district is also finding it difficult to grapple with the surge in COVID-19 cases. On March 1, the total active cases were just 24, and by May 2, the number has gone over the 12,000-mark. In the last 60 days, the district recorded over 25,000 new cases and over 120 deaths. The district has been recording close to 1,500 cases per day on an average over the last one week and this stretching the limits for the bed strength in the district. “Every day there is a demand for about 100 ICU beds or beds with some kind of oxygen supply and this has become a real test for us to stretch the limits,” observed District Collector V. Vinay Chand. “Each bed with oxygen once allotted to a patient is occupied by him or her, at least for a period of 10 days, and with the growing demand for 100 beds on a daily basis, it is really pushing our bed limits,” he said. The total bed strength in the district is around 10,000, including both in the private and the government hospitals, and out of which 7,000 beds have already been taken up for the COVID-19 treatment. Out of the 7,000 beds, about 4,000 have some kind of oxygen supply, which includes about 1,000 ICU beds. “We need to oxygenate the remaining 3,000 beds and efforts are on to get it done, at least to provide bedside oxygen cylinders,” said district COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. Apart from the 4,000 beds with oxygen that is at the disposal of the district administration, the authorities concerned need at least another 5,000 beds with oxygen supply on an urgent basis to mitigate the situation, it is learnt. Adding to the woes of shortage of beds, shortage of oxygen has become a double whammy for the district administration. Almost every hospital, has been suffering from shortage of oxygen, which is a unique situation, considering the fact that Visakhapatnam is the largest producer of LMO (Liquid Medical Oxygen) in the State. While the requirement for Visakhapatnam is only about 60 to 70 tonnes per day, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant alone produces around 170 tonnes on a daily basis.  Lack of planning The shortage is not due to lack of production or availability, it is due to lack of planning, timely delivery and adequate storage capacity. It is learnt that most of the private hospitals are putting up the request for refill in the last minute, as the tanks come near to drying up. If planned with a lead time of about four to five hours, things can improve, said a senior officer in the district administration. To mitigate the crisis, the district administration has formed a four-member committee to oversee the oxygen requirement of the hospitals and all indents for oxygen are routed through this committee. And the committee has observed that requests are coming late and that is upsetting the delivery time. Another reason is lack of storage, with the demand being very high, 24-hour back-up storage is not happening. With the shortage of beds and oxygen, straining the administration and health infrastructure, many feel that it is time to heed to the advice of AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria and go for a severe lockdown. It now appears that a lockdown is inevitable, considering the speed and quantum of spread, which is nearing 40% positivity rate, said a senior doctor in KGH. Only a strong lockdown can break the chain of spread. And during the lockdown period, the people already affected and hospitalised can be treated and discharged, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-overwhelmed-as-demand-for-hospital-beds-increases/article34476695.ece

According to sources, nearly 1,000 private buses are plying from Andhra Pradesh to the neighbouring States. Nearly 20 operators are running non-AC, air-conditioned, sleeper and semi-sleeper buses. They have their offices at Hanumanpeta, Police Control Room, Benz Circle, Lenin Centre, Gandhi Nagar, K.R. Market, Bhavanipuram, Gollapudi, Ibrahimpatnam and other places in Vijayawada.

People are avoiding travelling in buses owing to the fear of contracting infection and the slump in occupancy is forcing us to cancel the services,” says a private travel operator. Private travel operators are also running buses to Hyderabad, Benagaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and other cities in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and other States. “The second wave of the pandemic has hit the transport sector hard. During the first wave last year, we had cancelled buses owing to lockdown. Now, the low occupancy left the private bus operators bleeding,” says a manager of a travels company.

The board asked hospitals to appoint a nodal officer to look after the disposal at CBMWTF and update the information on the mobile app. The APPCB also asked municipalities and municipal corporations not to allow the municipal workers to collect the COVID waste from the COVID hospitals and allow only scientific disposal in the CBMWTF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/industries-get-appcb-nod-to-produce-oxygen-at-nitrogen-plants/article34476601.ece

Mr. Singhal said the government contacted the Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) following social media posts that a new strain was found recently in A.P. “We were told by CCMB that the said strain was first detected from A.P. samples in July of 2020. But the spread of news that the new strain was the reason for the rapid rise in cases, and that it was discovered recently, has been creating unnecessary fear among the public,” he said. People on social media should refrain from sharing unverified information, he said. Mr. Singhal said that people should get vaccinated as and when doses are available. About the partial lockdown, Mr. Singhal said that detailed guidelines will be issued on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/n440k-strain-found-in-ap-in-july-2020/article34476600.ece

04 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||A.P. strain at least 15 times more virulent: experts||While it is too early to state whether the new Coronavirus variant discovered by CCMB (Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology) N440K, is the variant that is creating havoc in Visakhapatnam and other parts of the State, experts say the new prevalent variant, which is being called as the AP strain as it was first discovered in Kurnool, is at least 15 times more virulent than the earlier ones, and may be even stronger than the Indian variants of B1.617 and B1.618. “We are still to ascertain, which strain is in circulation right now, as samples have been sent to CCMB for analysis. But one thing is certain that the variant at present which is in circulation in Visakhapatnam is quite different from what we have seen during the first wave last year,” said District Collector V. Vinay Chand, who has been updated by senior doctors in the health department. Confirming the enhanced power of the virus, District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar said, “We have observed that the new variant has shorter incubation period and the progress of the disease is much rapid. In the earlier cases, a patient affected with the virus would take at least a week to reach the hypoxia or dyspnea stage. But in the present context, patients are reaching the serious condition stage within three or four days. And that is why there is heavy pressure on beds with oxygen or ICU beds,.” he said. Experts also point out that unlike during the first wave, a shorter exposure is enough to acquire the virus, which enables an infected person to infect four to five persons, within a shorter contact span. “Most essentially, none is spared, as we have observed that it is affecting the younger population in a big way, including those who are fitness freaks and have high immunity levels. It is also observed that cytokine storm is occurring faster, and some are responding to treatment and some are not,” said Dr. Sudhakar. According to the experts the bottomline is — this variant is highly unpredictable. The best way to keep it at bay is to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour of wearing good mask, keeping away from gatherings, sanitising hands regularly and staying home as far as possible, said Hema Prakash, senior microbiologist from GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-strain-at-least-15-times-more-virulent/article34475906.ece

Born on June 1, 1952, in Visakhapatnam, Hari completed his Intermediate and degree education at Mrs. AVN College, and pursued business activities for sometime before joining Congress in the mid-1980s. Hari had served as Mayor of Visakhapatnam from 1995 to 2000 and was elected as a member of the 15th Lok Sabha from Anakapalle in 2009 on a Congress ticket. He had distanced himself from active politics after the 2014 elections and joined the TDP before the 2019 elections and contested the Assembly elections unsuccessfully from Bheemunipatnam on a TDP ticket. Mr. Venkat said that his father wanted to take the jab but couldn’t do so due to election-related activities. Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu used inquire about his health from time to time. Condolences pour in Mr. Venkat thanked all those who stood by his family during the crisis and appealed to people not to attend the funeral in view of the pandemic. Condolences poured in after the news of his death. Himachal Pradesh Governor Bandaru Dattatreya expressed shock and recalled the contributions of the former Mayor to the development of Vizag. Former Union Minister and Congress leader T. Subbarami Reddy recalled his three-decade association with the former Mayor and expressed his condolences. YSRCP MP V.

Vinay Chand to increase the amenities for COVID-19 patients in view of the rapid increase in the number of positive cases in the district. In a memorandum submitted to the Collector on Monday, party State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao and city secretary B. Ganga Rao said that the number of oxygen beds should be increased by at least three times in view of the exponential rise in cases. They suggested that this can be done by increasing the beds at the hospitals of public sector units like Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), Visakhapatnam Port, Hindustan Shipyard Limited and BHEL. The allocation of beds in the CSR Block of KGH should be regulated.  ‘Appoint staff’ They also sought immediate filling of vacant posts of doctors, nurses and other staff, extensive testing at ward secretariats, PHCs and Urban Health Centres, increasing number of virology labs, measures to increase oxygen supply and prevent black marketing. There are 72 CM Health Centres in Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) limits and an additional 42 centres were sanctioned but were not started. They sought immediate appointment of doctors, nurses and staff and opening of those health centres. They also suggested that rythu bazaars should be set up in open grounds as in the past to prevent overcrowding at the stalls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/augment-oxygen-bed-strength-by-3-times-cpim/article34476693.ece
04 May 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CITU: take over oxygen plant set up on VSP premises||Steel Plant Employees Union, an affiliate of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions( CITU), has demanded that the Centre take over the oxygen plant set up by Air Liquid India Holding Private Limited of France on the premises of RINL-Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and hand it over to the VSP for production of oxygen. In a letter to Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday, CITU State president Ch. Narasinga Rao, honorary president B. Ganga Rao, president J. Ayodhya Ram and general secretary Y.T. Das noted that the then Union government in 2009 had allowed the French company to set up a plant to produce oxygen and nitrogen in the VSP. The company had established the plant in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, with a production capacity of 1,700 tonnes per day. As per the MoU, the Company must sell its oxygen and nitrogen to the VSP only for a period of 15 years after which the company must be handed over to the steel plant. But the company management had left the plant idle for nine years after completion of construction, they alleged. It has resorted to litigation since its inception and after several international arbitrations, the judgment came on April 2, 2021, that the company must start its trial run from May 1. But the company has asked for some time to resume the trial run, as the plant was idle for a long time. The plant can produce 100 tonnes of oxygen per day, which will be very useful for the country amid the pandemic. The VSP is ready to pay the value to the Air Liquid Company, as per the award of the international arbitration tribunal. The VSP management has also agreed to pay Rs. 85 crore as advance to the company towards the cost of the trial run, Mr. Narasinga Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/citu-take-over-oxygen-plant-set-up-on-vsp-premises/article34476690.ece

The action comes in the wake of serious allegations levelled by several Adivasi organisations over the alleged scam involving diversion of COVID-19 drugs from the State-run area hospital to a private hospital, sources said. When contacted, Bhadrachalam Circle Inspector of Police T Swamy said Dr. Krishna Prasad was arrested for admitting COVID-19 patients at his private hospital in an unauthorised manner endangering the lives of others. He is booked under the relevant sections of the IPC and also the provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Mr. Swamy said, adding that investigation was underway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/contract-doctor-held-for-diversion-of-drugs/article34476510.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dead and on display in the corridors||Wrapped in plastic bags and piled on gurneys, the skin-crawling sight of bodies of COVID-19 victims lying in the corridors of the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) has been leaving patients and their attendants horrified. The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the already-burdened healthcare system to its brink and the gaps in management are not going unnoticed. However, at TIMS, the major concern is that of an inordinate delay in clearing bodies from plain sight. People who have lost a loved one to the deadly infection say that no one should be subjected to such a gut-wrenching sight when they step into the facility hoping to recover. Some of the disturbing photos are with The Hindu, which is refraining from publishing those. In one of the photos, at least five bodies wrapped in plastic are kept on a row of beds at end of a corridor. The patients’ belongings wrapped in other bags are kept next to the bodies. Plea of health staff Healthcare workers at TIMS have corroborated that many bodies were not cleared for 10 to 12 hours on some days. They have also pleaded for the issue to be addressed at the earliest. The attendant of a patient said it was a traumatic sight, no less. “The bodies were kept on beds on the ground floor, near the ICU. Is that a sight one expects to see after stepping into a hospital? Are we stepping into an ICU or a mortuary? Why can’t the government take steps to take care of such a thing when they claim thousands of crores would be spent for COVID management? I lost a family member recently, and I sincerely wish no one else is reminded of death and loss in this grisly manner,” the grieving attendant said on the condition of anonymity. “Recently, a male patient in Room number 226 died in the morning, and his body was lying in the corridor for hours. Healthcare workers pointed it out around 5 p.m. that day and requested for it to be cleared. There were many similar situations which were pointed out by doctors along with the floor number, time of death and delay in clearing the body,” a source at the hospital said. Miscommunication Sources also pointed to long delays in updating family members about a patient’s condition or informing them of a death. “In one such case, while doctors went out of their way to inform the death of a patient, the reception desk said the patient was alive. The family wanted to keep up the faith and thought the doctors had given wrong information, and confronted them. Such miscommunication creates unnecessary anxiety for a family which is already going through a lot,” a source added.  Are we stepping into an ICU or a mortuary? I lost a family member recently, and I sincerely wish no one else is reminded of death and loss in this grisly manner.

04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eatala to take on TRS leadership, cries witch-hunting||Former minister and Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender, who has fallen out of the grace of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) supremo and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, has stated that he would move legally against the ‘witch-hunting’ unleashed against him by the State government using all its might. He criticised Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao for acting with such a venomous attitude and said it does not suit the stature of a leader such as KCR. Not stopping at that, Mr. Rajender also pointed out the ‘irregularities’ of his leader till the other day, seeking to know whether the link road to KCR’s farmhouse was not laid through assignment and private lands illegally. “Eatala Rajender is not a person who can be cowed down by threatening arrests and false cases. I am not so small to be unsettled with such tactics as I too have trod the path along with you (KCR) for 19 years. How could a ‘brother’ like me become a demon overnight. I will prefer to die but won’t mortgage my self-respect at any cost,” he said on Monday in his first reaction after being dropped from the Council of Ministers on Sunday night. The actions of Chief Minister would not suit his stature as he would often say that he embarked upon the struggle for statehood to Telangana for the self-esteem of the people. “As he (KCR) used to say that he was alone when he took off for the self-respect of Telangana people, I too may be alone now in the struggle for self-respect,” Mr. Rajender said, reciting KCR’s words: “ Sar pe kafan baandh ke nikla akela... ”. Stating that he would chalk out his future course of action, including quitting as MLA, only after consulting his constituents in Huzurabad, Mr. Rajender said it was they who had been his strength for the last 20 years. He said he was hurt badly not for the allegations of land-grabbing or encroachments, but poking his self-esteem. On the allegation of land-grabbing and encroachment in Atchampet and Hakimpet villages of Masaipet mandal in Medak district, Mr. Rajender pointed out how the administration — Revenue, Vigilance and Revenue Departments — had given a go-by to norms by not even serving notice on him (the company owned by his family that owns the lands in question) and finalised land survey and report in a matter of just 24 hours. The report against him (his family) was finalised in such a hurry that the officials had even misrepresented his family relations by stating Jamuna, the chairperson of Jamuna Hatcheries, as wife of Nithin Reddy. (Jamuna is Mr. Rajender’s wife and Nithin Reddy their son). He said there were thousands of such alleged land disputes/irregularities in the State and the government could as well order a common probe into all. Mr. Rajender revealed that no minister in the Cabinet or legislator in TRS could boast of any self-respect when facing the leadership as many would often say privately that they should be given a better treatment, at least as human beings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-to-take-on-trs-leadership-cries-witch-hunting/article34476499.ece
04 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Single mother cheated of Rs. 10 lakh||A city-based techie, who posted her profile for second marriage on Telugu Matrimony site, was cheated to the tune of Rs. 10 lakh reportedly by Nigerian tricksters. Recently, the 34-year-old victim from Begumpet, who has a son from a previous marriage, approached Hyderabad Cyber Crime police stating that she was a divorcee and a few months ago she was introduced to one Mohal Kumar from the United States via Telugu Matrimony. Over time they developed a liking for each other and started chatting and talking over phone. He told her that he was a Gujarti born and brought up in the States, and currently his mother was staying at their native place in Gujarat. Visa process A few weeks ago, the duo decided to tie the knot and ‘Mohal’ promised to complete the visa process for her visit to the US before they get married and other documentation work related to their marriage, for which he asked the woman to send Rs. 2 lakh. She transferred the amount. Later, he asked her to send additional Rs. 2 lakh to his mother’s bank account in India for house repair work, as he was facing some difficulty in forex transfer and she did transfer the money again, Cyber Crimes ACP KVM Prasad said. Mohal told the woman that he was coming to India to meet her and purchased expensive goodies, including gold jewellery, and luxury watches. ‘Duty tax’ “After reaching India, he called her again stating that Customs officials have caught him for bringing several expensive goods, and were asking to pay duty tax. Believing his tricks, she again transferred Rs. 6 lakh more to set him free, only to realise that she was cheated by a cybercrook,” Mr. Prasad said. Again the suspect called her to transfer additional Rs. 2.5 lakh to get the goods released. Based on her complaint, police registered a case and are suspecting the involvement of Nigerian cyber crime gangs. “She believed his words for a bright future for her son and new life for herself in America and got cheated,” Mr. Prasad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/single-mother-cheated-of-rs-10-lakh/article34476490.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Anxiety up for bank staff as cases rise||Almost two weeks after the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) recommended banks be allowed to reduce business hours and operate with limited staff, anxiety levels run high among banks employees with the Telangana government yet to give approval for the measures. Compounding their worries is the unabated increase in number of people testing positive for COVID-19, including hundreds of bank employees and officers. The nature of their job, especially those manning counters at the branches, puts them at risk of contracting the virus. Recommended timings One of the key measures the April 21 meeting of SLBC unanimously recommended was to make available services at the branches/offices to customers from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and close the facilities by 4 p.m. up to May 15. It also favoured permitting banks to work with 50% staff strength on any given day and declaring all Saturdays, again till May 15, as holidays. While scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative banks are to be covered by the decision, by extension the private banks would follow suit. A delegation from the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU)-Telangana unit had also met Finance Minister T. Harish Rao. Convenor of TS unit, R. Sriram said the Minister had “responded positively and also immediately conveyed our views to the appropriate authorities for issue of necessary instructions”. But with the State government taking time presumably to study the impact of the measures, employees are concerned, bankers said. A few large banks, on instructions from their head offices as well as in the backdrop of an advisory from the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), have started operating with limited staff. The State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and the Union Bank of India, which between them account for a large chunk of the business handled by State-owned banks, have switched over to working with 50% of the staff last week. They are implementing this across as many branches and offices as possible and it is unlikely that the measure will remain in force only till May 15, sources added. A senior banker said this move to call employees in batches ensures that there are people to maintain the services delivered through branches. On the change in the business hours, a banker said it is something that cannot be implemented without the concurrence of the State government. In Andhra Pradesh, the bank working hours have been reduced, he said. For some banks such as the Andhra Pradesh Grameena Vikas Bank, which is a RRB, operating with less staff is not an option considering their emphasis on a lean structure. Digital banking But as sources in Bank of Maharashtra said, what is causing concern to the bank employees is an increase in footfall that branches will see in the first week of the month, as customers visit the facilities to withdraw salaries, pension and government benefits. Even those visiting the branches are likely to get infected, bankers say, pointing to the need for customers to adopt digital banking as far as possible. On the number of bank staffers infected during the second wave, sources said in State Bank of India alone, it hovers around 900, while in Union Bank of India it is 400-500. The number across all the banks could be much higher and at least 10 bank staff have died due to COVID-19 complications in the State, they said. The focus of many banks now is on getting the employees vaccinated, something an officer regretted the government did not consider despite their being frontline workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/anxiety-up-for-bank-staff-as-cases-rise/article34476483.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No more walk-ins allowed for vaccination at govt. centres||After a brief uncertainty over resumption of COVID-19 vaccination for people aged above 45 years, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao released a video on Monday evening stating the drive has restarted at the Government COVID vaccination Centres (GCVCs) for the age group across the State from the morning itself. On Friday, Dr Srinivasa Rao had informed that immunisation programme will not held at the GCVCs during the weekend (May 1 and 2). After that, however, there was no communication from the official regarding the resumption until the video was released. By then, time for the day’s vaccination had already passed. Pre-booking He stated that walk-in registrations has been stopped from Monday onwards. Slots have to be pre-booked on ‘cowin.gov.in’ for both, first and second doses. Many, however, said that slots were not available for the next few days. Some others said despite booking slots for Monday beforehand, they were sent back from the vaccination centres without getting the shot. No offline option Many citizens sought alternative options for those who are not tech-savvy and may not be able to navigate the Co-WIN portal for registering their names. They particularly named the elderly staying away from their respective families, the poor who do not own electronic gadgets and the homeless as disadvantaged groups. Dr Srinivasa Rao suggested that people who don’t have means to book the slots on their own can visit the nearest internet centre for the purpose. The suggestion, however, may fall short in completely addressing the concern.  Many who took their first jab are struggling to get the second one, due to insufficient stock of vaccines. One of the most asked questions is about the prescribed gap between doses. Dr Srinivasa Rao said the gap between first and second dose of Covishield is six to eight weeks, and four to six weeks in case of Covaxin. Stressing that people have to take both doses for protection against coronavirus, he said that a few extra days in the gap between first and second dose will not lead to any problem. Meanwhile, those aged 18 years and above took to Twitter to ask when they can start booking slots for the vaccination, which was opened to them from May 1. Though they have registered for the jab, slots for the age group were not displayed till late Monday evening. On April 28, the senior official had told the media that the standard procedure regarding vaccination for that particular age group will be out “in the coming two days”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-more-walk-ins-allowed-for-vaccination-at-govt-centres/article34476476.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘More resources needed to handle high death burden’||Delay in handing over the bodies of COVID-19 victims to their family members and space crunch in the mortuary are the two major reasons behind the corridors-of-death scene at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), suggest sources. “If a patient dies at night, the attendants cannot reach the hospital immediately due to night curfew and lack of transport options, especially if they are in a faraway district. In some cases, we have observed that the health staff advises the attendants to put up in the city limits as the patient undergoes treatment,” explain sources. They say that there has been an increase in the number of staff who handle the bodies. “People who do this job in these grim times are doing a valuable service. They should be motivated by the authorities. More resources are needed urgently to handle the high burden of deaths,” sources add. Major corporate hospitals in Hyderabad are almost always full with COVID-positive persons. Small scale hospitals, on the other hand, are refusing to admit elderly patients with co-morbidities, and those with low oxygen saturation levels. In such a scenario, people are heavily relying on State-run facilities such as Gandhi Hospital, TIMS, District Hospital in King Koti, and Government General and Chest Hospital, which see a steady rush of critical patients throughout the day. Clinging to hope against all odds, some patients are brought dead too. Prior to the pandemic, the government hospitals had not handled such a high number of deaths. Around 25 to 30 deaths used to be recorded at Gandhi Hospital. In the past a few days, over 70 to 100 deaths are being recorded at the hospital and the fatalities included patients who were brought dead and unidentified bodies. TIMS has only functioned for a little over one year. Senior officials had earlier said that some private hospitals are sending patients in end-stage to government hospitals, adding to the latter’s death tally. Staying prepared for a high death burden would help address the issue of bodies being left in the open. It was learnt that freezer boxes are allocated to the District Hospital in King Koti. Senior officials said that similar resources would be provided to TIMS too.  People who are handling bodies in these grim times are doing a valuable service. They should be motivated by the authorities. A source||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-resources-needed-to-handle-high-death-burden/article34476481.ece

Later, he along with DCP Traffic Vijay Kumar SM flagged off the pick-up van of the organisation. The website ‘dontwastefoodfoundation.org’ was part of the initiative started by philanthropist Chakradhar Goud and social worker Malleshwar Rao in 2011 for feeding thousands of hungry people for free. “Humanity exists. 'Don't Waste Food' distributes leftover food among the poor and the food is also distributed among the kith and kin of patients who wait outside government hospitals in the city,” Mr. V.C. Sajjanar said. “It is a great gesture that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his flagship programme ‘Mann ki Baat’ appreciated social worker Malleshwar Rao for his services,” he said. Presently, the organisation distributes food to around 2,000 people each day. “If we can utilise the food being wasted in hotels of Hyderabad every day, no one will sleep hungry in the city," the officer said.

04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CBI probe demanded into Devaryamjal issue||Hours after former minister Eatala Rajender criticising Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the issue of Masaipet lands, Congress MP from Malkajigiri and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) working president A. Revanth joined the issue and demanded a CBI probe into the encroachment of Endowments lands at Devarayamjal. “Instead of singling out Mr. Rajender, a comrade-in-arms of the TRS leadership for long, the government should institute a common probe into the issue of lands at Devarayamjal where Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao’s family, including his son and Minister K.T. Rama Rao, chairman and managing director of a newspaper owned by the ruling party D. Damodar Rao, Minister C. Malla Reddy and several other leaders of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi have lands in the survey numbers in dispute or those believed to be belonging to the Seetharamaswamy temple there,” the Congress leader said. However, since most of the TRS leaders, including the newspaper owned by the ruling party, which he said is printed in the lands in question, have mortgaged the lands with banks and borrowed huge amounts for their businesses the matter had gone beyond the State’s purview. As deceiving banks was a crime to be dealt by Central agencies, the issue was a fit case to be handed over to CBI, Mr. Revanth Reddy said speaking to newspersons on Monday. He furnished details of the land holdings of the TRS leaders in this particular parcel to buttress his claim. Mr. Revanth Reddy said he would write in his capacity as an MP to Union Home Minister Amit Shah requesting him to order a probe into the alleged encroachments of Endowments lands by the ruling party leaders in Telangana along with documentary evidence.   Meet Kishan Reddy “As I am not a position to visit Delhi personally for the purpose due to the COVID conditions, I will meet Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy here in a couple of days and seek a CBI probe into the lands issue.” Explaining that a total of 1,531 acres of Endowments lands belonging to the temple were encroached upon at Devarayamjal, the Congress MP said Mr. Taraka Rama Rao had purchased the land in 2009 while Mr. Damodar Rao did in 2015 in survey number 437. Similarly, Minister Mr. Malla Reddy has a farmhouse on 7 acres land in survey number 658.  Records not visible However, to cover-up the shady land deals the government had taken out all land records pertaining to the erstwhile Rangareddy district out of the public domain (website) although the records of all other district were available, Mr. Revanth Reddy alleged. TRS leaders Keshava Reddy, Veera Reddy, Sudhakar Reddy, Rajasekhar Reddy and several others too have lands there. As the government itself was stating the value of land (30 acres) in Mr. Rajender’s possession was worth Rs. 1,000 crore it should also reveal the value of lands held by other leaders of the party, including KTR and Mr. Malla Reddy. (Earlier, Mr. Rajender said his family owned 6.2 acres land there since 1995). Mr. Revanth Reddy also asked the State leadership of BJP to demand for a CBI probe into the lands issue if it was not colluding with TRS leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cbi-probe-demanded-into-devaryamjal-issue/article34476501.ece

Government Whip Balka Suman, who spoke to newspersons on Monday night, said the probe would bring out the benami holdings of several leaders there, including the godowns constructed by them. He stated that it would also bring out landholdings, if any, by TRS leaders and Namasthe Telangana newspaper.

04 May 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Emphatic victory for TRS in Khammam||The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has registered a thumping victory in Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections, winning 43 of the total 60 wards. The TRS repeated its feat of impressive victory in the maiden elections to the KMC held in March 2016 thereby retaining its hold over the urban local body (ULB) for the second term in a row. The municipality of Khammam was upgraded to Municipal Corporation in October, 2012, in the then United Andhra Pradesh. Harping on the development plank, the ruling TRS maintained its dominance by winning 43 of the total 57 wards it contested. The ruling party had already won the 10th ward unanimously. The TRS is all set to win the coveted Mayor post reserved for women (general). Allies gain The CPI, which contested from three wards in tie-up with the ruling TRS, bagged the three wards. The Congress party has managed to win nine wards and its ally the CPI (M) has won two wards. The BJP suffered a major setback with the party winning just a single ward of the total 47 wards it contested in the KMC election. Independent candidates have won two wards. The TRS won three wards by a whisker. Its candidates from 33rd, 45th and 15th wards had won by a thin margin of 27, 34 and 37 votes respectively, sources said. The CPI (M) candidates had lost the election in a few wards by a narrow margin. Minority Welfare Department Secretary Ahmed Nadeem, the General Observer for the Khammam Municipal Corporation election, along with Collector R V Karnan oversaw the counting process at SR&BGNR College held in adherence to the COVID-19 safety protocols. Voters thanked Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar on Monday thanked the people of Khammam for giving a resounding victory to the TRS in the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections.

Scores of people aged above 45 years thronged the hospital to get COVID-19 jabs on Monday morning after a two-day break in the vaccination drive due to alleged short supply of vaccines. After being told to come the next day by the staff at the vaccination centre, the local residents as well as some villagers from distant places staged a protest holding placards in front of the hospital, sources said. CPI(M) plea Addressing the demonstration, the CPI (M) district committee member B Rambabu urged the authorities to ensure supply of adequate quantities of vaccines and prompt implementation of the vaccination drive to check spread of COVID-19. He deplored that the short supply of vaccines was subjecting elderly people, particularly those suffering from underlying medical conditions, to severe inconvenience in getting vaccinated against COVID-19. He demanded that the vaccination drive should be conducted at all health sub-centres on a daily basis to improve access to COVID-19 vaccine in rural areas to effectively combat the pandemic. Meanwhile, sources in the Health Department said that COVID-19 vaccination drive resumed in the government hospital in Wyra and elsewhere in the designated centres, including in PHCs, following replenishment of vaccine stocks on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/protest-over-shortage-of-covid-19-vaccines/article34476493.ece

Harish Rao proved his hold on Siddipet with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) winning 36 of 43 wards in the elections to Siddipet Municipality for which counting was held on Monday. While independents won in five wards in one ward a rebel has won. BJP and MIM bagged one seat each. The result is a major victory for the TRS, which faced a humiliating defeat in the recent byelection to the neighbouring Dubbak assembly constituency.  Focus on development The results are a reflection of the trust of the people of the town in Mr. Harish Rao who has been focusing on the development of the town, irrespective of elections. After formation of separate district, more funds were brought to the district and several activities were taken up in the town. Komaticheruvu was developed on par with tank bund at Hyderabad. Siddipet was also the first district headquarters, which got a medical college after formation of districts. Right from the notification for elections to the municipality, Mr. Harish Rao focused on selection of candidates. Many sitting members were dropped and new faces introduced. He focused on door-to-door campaign and met as many people as possible.  Poor strategy On the other hand, the Opposition parties entrusted the responsibility of winning the elections on the candidates. “The civic body elections have once again proven that Siddipet is a bastion of the TRS. People voted for development and welfare, party president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. I thank people for the faith bestowed upon the party,” said Mr. Harish Rao responding to party’s victory. Independent (rebel) candidate from 20th ward Riyaz and from 35 ward Bhumpalli Srilatha and Payyavula Purnima have joined the TRS after the results were announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-wins-36-wards-in-siddipet-municipality/article34476508.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Makeshift hospital at Singhu now extends COVID support||The makeshift hospital at Singhu border protest site is not only taking care of the protesting farmers but also those struggling in Delhi-NCR with oxygen cylinders and ambulance. Avtar Singh, who runs the Life Care Foundation Hospital, recalled an incident over three days ago. With profound grief, he said that an eight-month pregnant COVID positive woman came with her husband in the hope that the hospital could treat COVID-19 patients but unable to do so, they provided her with the ambulance. “Her husband said that they were unable to arrange an ambulance to go looking for a hospital as her oxygen was dropping. We then provided them with our ambulance which is fitted with oxygen and told them that they can keep it for as much time as required,” he said. Unfortunately, the woman couldn’t find a hospital for a long time and when she did, ahead of Karnal, she passed away in two hours, Mr. Singh said. According to Mr. Singh, they receive several SOS calls for help from neighbouring Singhu village as well. The hospital has been able to provide oxygen to those in need after thorough verification. “When we receive these calls, we don’t take the patient’s word for it. We tell the family members to show us the patient on video call first and see his or her oxygen levels after which the cylinder is provided,” he said. On Saturday, Mr. Singh said that they received a call from a family of a 40-year-old resident of Singhu village that his oxygen levels were dropping and they need a cylinder urgently. “We verified the information and provided the family with one cylinder of 47 litres of liquid oxygen. The person’s oxygen levels had dropped to 70,” he said. The team at the hospital then also checks on the patient regularly and guides them as to when should look for a hospital. According to Mr. Avtar, those residing in the village find it tougher to arrange a hospital bed or oxygen because they’re in the outskirts of the city and there are less resources around there. In a related development, the protest, he claimed was continuing and many protesters are taking the COVID-19 situation seriously as opposed to what how they believed initially when the protest started in November. “Locals like labourers, workers and street vendors are asked to wear a mask strictly because they don’t lodge here,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/makeshift-hospital-at-singhu-now-extends-covid-support/article34476219.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks update from Centre, Delhi on enlisting Army’s help||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre and the Delhi government on the status of seeking help from the Armed forces to set up oxygenated and ICU beds to treat COVID-19 patients saying what the Capital was a “national calamity”. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said that a “good case” was made out for seeking assistance of the Army due to the immense load on the existing manpower and infrastructure in the Capital. The court asked Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma to get an update on a letter written by the Delhi government to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh seeking help from the armed forces to set up, operationalise and run 10,000 beds facility and arrangement of oxygen and medical essentials. Mr. Sharma said the matter was now being looked into by the Defence Minister himself. Pending with Customs During the hearing, the HC also enquired from the Centre on the number of oxygen concentrators that are stuck at the customs. The High Court made the query after it was informed that Max Hospital has 3,000 concentrators lying in customs. “People should not lose lives for this that there are resources but they are pending clearance. It should be released so that it can be used,” the court remarked. The government has said that no such consignment is pending with Customs. Referring to a picture shared on social media about 3,000 oxygen concentrators stuck with the Customs, the Ministry has sought information from anybody in the know about where these concentrators are lying so that immediate action may be taken. The HC also gave a stern warning to hospitals over reports of oxygen tankers being detained by a private hospital here and forcing the driver to deliver more than the allocated quantity. ‘Conduct not acceptable’ “This will not do. This will break the discipline. If everyone was to do this, the tankers will not reach you,” the High Court said taking strong exception to Batra Hospital seizing a oxygen tanker on Saturday. Goyal Gas, which distributes oxygen to hospitals, had complained that its tanker which went to Batra Hospital was detained and driver was forced to deliver more than the allocated quantity. While 2.5 metric tonne was required to delivered, but the tanker was forced to deliver 4.2 metric tonne. The High Court made it clear that it will not tolerate this sort of conduct from anyone in future. The Centre also assured the High Court that it will honour the directions of the Supreme Court to ensure the oxygen supply deficit to the Capital is rectified before the midnight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-seeks-update-from-centre-delhi-on-enlisting-armys-help/article34476211.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeks to regulate cost of HRCT tests for COVID-19||The Delhi High Court on Monday issued notice to the government on a petition seeking direction to cap the price of High Resolution Computerised Tomography (HRCT) which is used for detecting the presence and severity of COVID-19 infection in the lungs of patients. Lawyer’s plea A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh sought response from the Delhi government on the plea by Shivleen Pasricha, a lawyer, who has claimed that for detection of COVID-19 amongst suspected/ probable patients, the most widely recommended test is RT-PCR. ‘Need of the hour’ “At present, the price for getting HRCT done in Delhi is somewhere between Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 6,500. As such, regulation of price of the same has become need of the hour... That in light of the present gruesome circumstances in Delhi, regulating the price of HRCT, becomes all imperative and necessary,” the petition said. The plea stated the cost of HRCT in the Capital is “unregulated and very high” beyond what a common man can afford. It has further claimed that HRCT has, in the current state of circumstances, become one of the most relevant and vital tests, recommended actively by the doctors for the diagnosis, management and treatment of infection in suspected or probable COVID-19 patients. “Of late, it has been seen that multiple variants of COVID-19 are not detectable through RT-PCR,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/plea-seeks-to-regulate-cost-of-hrct-tests-for-covid-19/article34476209.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Centre, Delhi recriminations no solace to citizens, observes SC||The recriminations between the Centre and Delhi government give no solace to citizens whose lives depend on a “thin thread” of oxygen being made available, the Supreme Court has said. The top court directed the Centre to create buffer stock of oxygen for emergency in collaboration with States and decentralise the location of the stocks so that it is immediately available if the normal supply chain is disrupted. It asked the Centre to create the emergency stocks of medical grade oxygen within four days. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said the deficit oxygen supply to Delhi must be remedied “forthwith” as “the situation on the ground in Delhi is heart rending”. “Recriminations between the Central government [which contends that Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi has not lifted its allocated quantity] and GNCTD (which contends that despite its projected demand the quantity allocated has not been enhanced) can furnish no solace to citizens whose lives depend on a thin thread of oxygen being available,” the top court said in a 64-page order uploaded on its website on late Sunday night. In the battle of shifting responsibility of supplying/ off taking of oxygen, lives of citizens cannot be put in jeopardy and “the protection of the lives of citizens is paramount in times of a national crisis and the responsibility falls on both the Central Government and the GNCTD to cooperate with each other to ensure that all possible measures are taken to resolve the situation”, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-delhi-recriminations-no-solace-to-citizens-observes-sc/article34476217.ece

Rina sold fake injections in Delhi while Shrawan was graphic designer, who helped the gang in manufacturing of identical wrapper and boxes of original Remdesivir injections. He was also involved in sale of fake vials. He is a native of Roorkee,” said the officer. The arrested persons were used to deal in medical and surgical equipments and were known to each other. They got in touch with Aditya and in order to earn quick money they also involved in sale of fake Remdesivir. The gang members took a medical manufacturing unit on lease in Kotdwar district of Uttrakhand. “The gang procured large quantity of antibiotic injections from the market that to be used in treatment of typhoid and the bottle of injection resembles the shape and size of Remdesivir injections. They used to replace sticker on injection bottles,” said the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/3-more-held-over-fake-remdesivir-injection/article34476212.ece

Taking cognisance of such cheating and fraud, eight FIRs have been registered in CyPAD and different police stations. The police said that in the view of malpractices coming to notice recently regarding COVID patients being overcharged by ambulances, harassment faced at cremation grounds, black-marketing of life saving drugs, oxygen and medical articles, and cheating and fraud in name of supplying covid drugs or oxygen etc., Delhi Police urged the general public to call the COVID helpline number 011-23469900 to report such incidents.

The pump owners have particularly asked that the Delhi-Panipat side be opened as farmers have agreed to give way in wake of wide spread of the COVID pandemic. “Several fuel pumps and other business establishments are closed for sale due to ongoing farmers agitation for more than five months now with no income are facing closure and has become difficult to sustain hundreds of employees,” said Rajeev Jain, one of the fuel pump owners at Singhu border and executive member of Delhi Petrol Dealers Association (DPDA).

04 May 2021||Mumbai,||BMC may resort to aggressive testing policy||Even as the daily COVID-19 cases in Mumbai are on the decline, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wants to increase the number of tests hoping that an aggressive testing policy will lead to reduction in the positivity rate. As per the data from the BMC, the number of tests in the city has dipped from over 50,000 to 38,000 and even to around 28,000. On May 3, the civic body conducted only 23,542 tests of which 2,662 were positive. While on May 2, a total of 28,636 tests were conducted, the figure was 37,607 for May 1. Around 43,525 and 38,848 samples were tested on April 30 and 29, respectively. On April 28, around 39,135 tests were conducted while on April 27 and 26, around 30,428 and 28,328 samples were tested, respectively, as normally observed on weekends. According to BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, the number of tests in a single day had gone beyond 50,000 in April. “Our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction in the positivity rate. We need to increase the testing to 40,000 a day, if not more,” he said, appealing to citizens to come forward and test themselves for the virus. In the last few days, Mumbai has witnessed a drop in the test positivity rate (TPR) with the Opposition attributing it to low testing. On May 2 and 1, the TPR was 7.79% and 9.62%, respectively. Throughout the last week of April, the city has maintained the TPR in the range of 12% to 9%. According to experts, even though the cases may appear to have plateaued, restrictions should not be lifted, and strict health guidelines needed to be followed until mass vaccination was completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bmc-may-resort-to-aggressive-testing-policy/article34476128.ece
04 May 2021||Mumbai,||Rashmi Shukla moves HC seeking no coercive action||Senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla approached the Bombay High Court on Monday as she was apprehending arrest and sought no coercive action against her by the Cyber Crime Department in the case of alleged phone tapping that leaked certain documents related to postings of police personnel. Ms. Shukla, who moved the court through advocate Sameer Nangre, claimed, “The approach of the State is to arm-twist Ms. Shukla by a bogus and frivolous case.” She is an IPS officer of 1988 cadre and has been in the police service for more than 30 years. She is currently the additional director general of south zone, CRPF, Hyderabad. The plea said, “She has exposed the nexus between ministers and politicians and gross corruption involved in assigning posting to police officers. This reveals her courage and integrity in performing official duties and her best endeavour to expose and eliminate corruption by bringing the guilty to book. Instead of applauding her work, government authorities are framing her in a false criminal case.” The matter will be heard by a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and Manish Pitale on May 4. In March-end, Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis had cited a letter allegedly written by Ms. Shukla to then Director General of Police about alleged corruption in police transfers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rashmi-shukla-moves-hc-seeking-no-coercive-action/article34476131.ece
04 May 2021||Mumbai,||TV news anchor apologies to Sena over erroneous report||A senior anchor of an English television news channel apologised to the Shiv Sena on Monday following a protest letter to the channel after he erroneously named the party for threatening Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawala over vaccines. Senior Sena leader and Maharashtra Industries Minister Subhash Desai wrote to Aroon Purie, head of India Today group, demanding an apology from anchor Rahul Kanwal for an ‘untrue and defamatory’ story. The letter said, “We do not know the political leanings of the news group as earlier too we have seen another senior Hindi news anchor voice her personal bias against one of our party leaders. However, to attach another party president’s video to the Sena and to deliberately defame us through misinformation speaks volumes of the political bias of the anchor.” It said that such action “reeks of malice and a misinformation campaign, may be to divert the national debate…” Hours later, Mr. Kanwal tweeted, “Yesterday while anchoring I had spoken about a video of a leader threatening Serum Institute. The video was issued by Raju Shetty who is leader of Swabhimani Shektari Sanghatana (SSS) and not a leader of the Shiv Sena (SS). The confusion and inconvenience caused is regretted.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tv-news-anchor-apologies-to-sena-over-erroneous-report/article34476126.ece

04 May 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Navi Mumbai civic body forms task force to curb misuse of Remdesivir||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation Commissioner Abhijit Bangar on Monday set up a task force under the supervision of a deputy commissioner level officer to control the misuse of Remdesivir injection. The team has been instructed to visit the hospitals either after receiving complaints or as per the schedule and to check whether they have procured Remdesivir vials as per their requirements and how many of them have actually been used. “This will ensure that the anti-viral injection is used only for the patient as requested by the hospital, and the team will also inspect whether the name of that patient is written on the empty bottle. The caps of injections used are to be preserved by the hospitals and they will also be verified. The team will also check whether the stock of Remdesivir provided to the hospital is used only for the patients admitted there,” Mr. Bangar said. As per the norms, every hospital is supposed to get the injection from the collector office. At the end of the day, the hospital should inform the collector office of its need for the next day. “The demand, distribution, and use of Remdesivir has been decided by the Thane District Collectorate for Navi Mumbai and the necessary supply is being channelled through it,” the commissioner said. He further said that no hospital was supposed to ask the patient’s relatives to arrange the injection which also encouraged its black marketing. “Despite these instructions, we have been getting several complains about private hospitals resorting to such practice. Hence, we decided to have a task force to keep tabs on the purchase and use of the injection by the hospitals,” Mr. Bangar said. The corporation had on Saturday served show cause notices on three private hospitals for allegedly prescribing the injection to patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/navi-mumbai-civic-body-forms-task-force-to-curb-misuse-of-remdesivir/article34476130.ece
04 May 2021||Pune,||Poonawalla must reveal names of those threatening him: Cong.||Stating that the issue of alleged threats to Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla were extremely serious, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole on Monday demanded that Mr. Poonawalla immediately reveal the names of those powerful political people who had purportedly made menacing calls to him. Mr. Patole said Mr. Poonawalla, who is currently in the U.K., must return to India as soon as possible to supervise the production of vaccines and address the massive deficit facing the country. “Mr. Poonawalla himself said in an interview to a U.K. newspaper that he had been threatened by a key political figure. If so, he should reveal who the political figure is…he must return to India from London as soon as possible in the interests of the country and produce vaccines in large quantities to redress the massive deficit.” The Maharashtra government and the Congress, too, would provide security to Mr. Poonawalla if needed, he said. Less than a week ago, the Centre had accorded ‘Y’ category security to Mr. Poonawalla in view of “potential threats”. “What is the Centre’s intention behind providing ‘Y’ category security when Mr. Poonawalla himself had not sought security from either the State or the Central government? What is the politics behind this?” Mr. Patole said. In The Times of London interview, the SII CEO spoke of receiving allegedly menacing calls from some of the most powerful men in India (who ostensibly included political figures and heads of business conglomerates) and that owing to a noxious environment at home, he was mulling over being out of the country for an extended period and making plans to produce vaccines elsewhere. Mr. Patole took aim at the Centre saying COVID-19 fatalities across the country and Maharashtra were on the rise owing to its wrong-headed policies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/poonawalla-must-reveal-names-of-those-threatening-him-cong/article34476133.ece
04 May 2021||London,||Embrace diplomacy, Blinken tells N. Korea||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday opened the Group of Seven’s first in-person talks in two years by presenting the new administration’s new approach on North Korea, which has already denounced it. With COVID-19 raging in India but increasingly coming under control in the West, Britain welcomed Foreign Ministers of the club of wealthy democracies in London to discuss a post-pandemic agenda and prepare for a G7 summit in England next month. India, South Korea, South Africa and ASEAN bloc chair Brunei were invited as guests to the three days of talks, which will also address rising tensions with Russia and China as well as diplomacy to revive a nuclear accord with Iran. Amid stringent anti-pandemic measures, including restrictions on movements, Mr. Blinken met separately at his hotel with the Foreign Ministers of Japan and South Korea days after President Joe Biden completed a review on North Korea policy. “We are grateful to have this opportunity to have in-depth discussions with the U.S. after the conclusion of your policy review,” South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong said, as he welcomed the “very positive and open message” by Mr. Biden in his address to Congress last week. The State Department said that Mr. Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi “shared their concerns about North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes” in their meeting. They agreed to work together along with Japan’s sometime rival South Korea “towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” a statement said. Mr. Biden ordered an assessment of North Korea policy after his predecessor Donald Trump’s unusual, highly personalised diplomacy that featured three made-for-television meetings with the totalitarian state’s young leader Kim Jong-un. Middle ground The review proposed a middle ground by moving away from Mr. Trump’s ambitious but unsuccessful bid to reach a far-reaching agreement that, after seven decades, could finally bring an official end to the Korean War. But the White House also said it would engage with North Korea, a shift from former President Barack Obama’s policy of “strategic patience” — or, keeping Pyongyang at arm’s length until its behaviour changes. “Our policy will not focus on achieving a grand bargain, nor will it rely on strategic patience,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, while acknowledging that successive administrations have failed to achieve the goal of ending North Korea’s nuclear programme. North Korea on Sunday denounced Mr. Biden approach, saying he was keeping a “hostile policy” in place for more than half a century. “The U.S.-claimed ‘diplomacy’ is a spurious signboard for covering up its hostile acts, and ‘deterrence’ touted by it is just a means for posing nuclear threats to the DPRK,” Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun said. U.S. officials largely expected a strident reaction from North Korea, which is known for its colourful statements, including in 2019 describing Mr. Biden as a “rabid dog” who “must be beaten to death with a stick”. A welcoming dinner for the G7 Foreign Ministers will address both North Korea and Iran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-presents-new-n-korea-approach/article34475835.ece
04 May 2021||Damascus,||Assad to face two ‘rivals’ in May vote||A Syrian Former Minister and a member of the Opposition will face Bashar al-Assad in this month’s presidential election, the constitutional court said on Monday. The Assad-appointed body approved only three out of 51 applications to stand in the May 26 ballot, among them the 55-year-old president himself, widely expected to win a fourth mandate. The court’s president said in a press conference broadcast on state TV that Abdallah Salloum Abdallah, a State Minister from 2016 to 2020, had been approved to run for President. The third candidate was named as Mahmoud Marei, a member of the so-called “tolerated opposition” long described by exiled opposition leaders as an extension of the regime. All 48 other applications were ruled out for “failing to meet constitutional and legal requirements”, the court president said without elaborating. They have until May 7 to appeal. Applicants needed to garner support from at least 35 Members of Parliament, each of whom is only allowed to back one candidate. Exiled opposition members are de facto ruled out by an electoral law that stipulates candidates must have lived in Syria continuously for at least the past decade. The election will be the second since the start of a decade-long conflict that has killed over 3,88,000 people and forced more than half of Syria’s pre-war population from their homes. Damascus has invited lawmakers from allied countries such Russia, Iran, China, Venezuela and Cuba to observe the electoral process.  West rejects ‘outcome’ Western members of the UNSC, led by the U.S., France and Britain, rejected the outcome of the May 26 poll in advance, a position denounced by Russia as “unacceptable”. Mr. Assad, who has already been in power for 21 years, was elected by referendum in 2000 and 2007. For the first multi-candidate poll in 2014, only two candidates besides Mr. Assad, out of 24 applicants, were allowed to run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/assad-to-face-two-rivals-in-may-vote/article34475844.ece
04 May 2021||Bangkok,||Myanmar ethnic guerrillas say they shot down helicopter||An ethnic rebel group in northern Myanmar said it shot down a government military helicopter on Monday during heavy fighting over a strategic position. The claim by the Kachin Independence Army came as protests against Myanmar’s military government continued in Kachin State and elsewhere in the country. It would be the first aircraft shot down during recent hostilities between the government and ethnic guerrilla armies. The Kachin are one of several ethnic minorities who have allied themselves with the nationwide protest movement against the military’s February ouster of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was arrested and remains in detention. The country’s ethnic minorities have been fighting for decades against the central government for greater autonomy. Government offensive is under way against the Kachin and the Karen, another ethnic minority in eastern Myanmar that maintains its own armed force and also has been the target of air strikes. The fighting in Kachin and Karen states has displaced more than 45,000 villagers. Col. Naw Bu, a spokesman for the Kachin Independence Army, said his group’s forces shot down the aircraft after junta used helicopters and jet fighters in an attack on Momauk township, where the Kachin seized a base from the government on March 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-ethnic-guerrillas-say-they-shot-down-helicopter/article34475837.ece
04 May 2021||Taipei,||Russia turns to China to make Sputnik V jabs to meet demand||Russia is turning to multiple Chinese firms to manufacture the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in an effort to speed up production as demand soars for its shot. Russia has announced three deals totaling 260 million doses with Chinese vaccine companies in recent weeks. It’s a decision that could mean quicker access to a shot for countries in Latin America, the West Asia, and Africa that have ordered Russia’s vaccine, as the U.S. and the EU focus mainly on domestic vaccination needs. Earlier, criticism about Russia’s vaccine have been largely quieted by data published in The Lancet that said large-scale testing showed it to be safe, with an efficacy rate of 91%. Yet, experts have questioned whether Russia can fulfill its pledge to countries across the world. While pledging hundreds of millions of doses, it has only delivered a fraction. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said demand for Sputnik V significantly exceeds Russia’s domestic production capacity. To boost production, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled Sputnik V, has signed agreements with drug makers in India, South Korea, Brazil, Serbia, Turkey, Italy and others. There are few indications, however, that manufacturers abroad, except for those in Belarus and Kazakhstan, have made any large amounts of the vaccine so far. Airfinity, a U.K.-based science analytics company, estimates Russia agreed to supply 630 million doses of Sputnik V to over 100 countries, with only 11.5 million doses exported so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-turns-to-china-to-make-sputnik-v-jabs-to-meet-demand/article34475838.ece
04 May 2021||Dubai,||German philosopher refuses UAE prize||The board of trustees of a high-priced literary award from the United Arab Emirates expressed regret on Monday that prominent German philosopher Juergen Habermas had turned down the prize, reversing his earlier decision. The 91-year-old German, considered his country’s most eminent contemporary philosopher, announced earlier this week that he would not accept the Sheikh Zayed Book Award over its ties “with the existing political system” in the UAE, a hereditarily ruled country long criticised for its suppression of dissent. While describing itself as an “independent” initiative, the prize is administered by Abu Dhabi culture and tourism authorities. Mr. Habermas’ influential writings on human rights, morality and democracy, among other topics, have stirred debate in Germany and beyond. On its website, the board of the literary award, among the most well-funded in the region, said it “expresses regret” for Habermas’ decision “but respects it.” The prize, it added, “embodies the values of tolerance, knowledge and creativity while building bridges between cultures, and will continue to fulfill this mission.” Mr. Habermas was named the Cultural Personality of the Year, a distinction that carries a cash prize of 1 million dirhams. The award is named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the UAE when the federation of seven sheikhdoms became a country in 1971.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/german-philosopher-refuses-uae-prize/article34475846.ece
04 May 2021||Abu DHabi,||U.S. officials in West Asia to reassure jittery allies over Iran||Top Biden administration officials and U.S. Senators crisscrossed the West Asia on Monday, seeking to assuage growing unease among Arab partners over America’s re-engagement with Iran and other policy shifts in the region. The trips come as the U.S. and Iran, through intermediaries in Vienna, discuss a return to Tehran’s tattered 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that former President Donald Trump abandoned three years ago. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies, excluded from Obama-era nuclear negotiations, have repeatedly pressed for a seat at the table, insisting that any return to the accord must address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and support for regional proxies. Sen. Chris Coons, a key Biden ally, told reporters in Abu Dhabi that he hoped to allay the sheikhdom’s “understandable and legitimate concerns” about the return to the landmark deal and to create “broader engagement” with Gulf partners. Mr. Coons said “close consultation” with the UAE about the ongoing talks in Vienna was “important, expected and happening,” adding that he hopes the Emiratis “may not just be notified, but actually help.” “I did not in any way mean to suggest that there was some deal in the works where the Emiratis would be securing anything,” he said. “Vienna is the place where the U.S. government is negotiating.” Senator Chris Murphy joined the flurry of diplomatic activity in the region this week, jetting to Oman, Qatar and Jordan for dialogue on a political solution to the war in Yemen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-officials-in-west-asia-to-reassure-jittery-allies-over-iran/article34475847.ece

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Local factors determine electoral outcomes in States||Even as the nation battles the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Assembly elections have been completed in four States (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and West Bengal)and one Union Territory (Puducherry). Though citizens and governments came to be exposed to the debilitating impact of COVID-19 in the course of these elections, voter turnout did not see any major decline. The five electoral outcomes mirror the diversity that the country represents. In these trying times, the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Lokniti conducted a post-poll survey in the States that went to the polls (the post-poll survey was not conducted in Puducherry). Our field investigators followed all the strict protocols that the pandemic necessitated and did a truly commendable job (See methodology). We present in a series of articles, to be published over the next few days, an explanation of the electoral verdict as seen from the perceptions and attitudes of citizens. This round of State elections is set to impact the trajectory of Indian politics in important ways. The verdicts underscore the specificity of the local in defining and determining electoral outcomes. Three of the four ruling parties/ coalitions secured another term in office, while one was voted out of power. Like Assam, Puducherry, too, decided to entrust power to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). All these States saw a sharp bipolar contest with the third player being relegated to a distant third position. As these were verdicts on who should be entrusted with the responsibility of managing the State administration, the leadership at the State level came to be a key factor. Clearly, the voter in India is making a categorical distinction between voting in a national election and in a State election. If more proof was needed of the same, it was provided by the electorate in the States that went to the polls. State-wise analysis A deeper analysis of the specificities of the local merits attention. Kerala set aside its revolving door policy of four decades and accorded a second term to the Left Democratic Front (LDF). While it was a clear endorsement of the track record of the State government, it was also an expression of disapproval of the ruling party at the Centre. In Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) faced the consequence of visible anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years. Further, being the first election after the death of both Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, the victory of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is a clear indicator of M.K. Stalin having been accepted as the inheritor of his father’s legacy by the DMK supporters. In the case of the AIADMK, it is not clear whether supporters of Jayalalithaa see the present AIADMK (and its leadership) as the true successors of her legacy. In neighbouring Puducherry, the Congress-led alliance (which was dismissed on the eve of the elections) was neither able to garner any sympathy nor convince the voters of its track record in government. Assam saw a polarisation on religious lines like never before and the State leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was able to successfully lead a well-planned election strategy and campaign. The Trinamool Congress under Mamata Banerjee, which retained power in West Bengal, occupied the centre stage both during the election campaign and when the results came trickling in. While different parties and alliances have won the five elections, the central theme that connects all the verdicts is the privileging of the local. This is further underscored by the data emerging from the CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey. State poll vs national poll The categorical distinction between a national verdict and a State-specific verdict was revealed in the response to the question on whether the respondents felt that for the development of their State, it was necessary that the party in power at the Centre should be the ruling party in their State too (See Table 1). More than half the respondents in Kerala fully disagreed with this statement while in Tamil Nadu, four of every 10 respondents took this stand. Given the sharp polarisation in West Bengal, close to one-thirds of the respondents fully disagreed with this statement. It was only in Assam that four of 10 respondents strongly agreed with the statement. In the southern States, it was very clear that voters saw little merit in the same party being in power at both levels while the jury was more divided in the east. The focus on the local was also visible in the levels of satisfaction with the State and Central governments (See Table 2). If the results of the present post-poll survey are compared with those of the post-poll survey conducted after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is noticed that the net satisfaction (percentage of those satisfied minus those dissatisfied) with the State government has increased and is uniformly high. In Kerala and West Bengal, the net satisfaction was reasonably high. In the case of Kerala, the net satisfaction with the Central government was in the negative and in West Bengal it had declined as compared to two years ago. In Tamil Nadu, the net satisfaction with the State government was very marginal while the dissatisfaction with the Central government was evident. Assam saw a net satisfaction with both the Central and State government as what was recorded in 2019 and this explains the return of the BJP to power. The highlighting of the local is also evident in the strong pro-incumbency sentiment in the three States where the ruling party/coalition was returned to power (See Table 3). In Kerala and West Bengal, over half the respondents wanted the ruling party back in power. In Assam this sentiment was expressed by four of every 10 respondents. In Tamil Nadu, which saw the defeat of the incumbent, half the respondents were against the incumbent being given a second chance. Clearly, the voters’ perception of the performance of their State governments was critical in the decision on who to vote for. It must, of course, be highlighted that the primacy accorded to the party over the local candidate in the polls was evident in the post-poll survey (See Table 4). Across States, close to six of every 10 respondents said that they kept in mind the party when voting. In Kerala and Assam, three of every 10 respondents stated that the candidate drove their voting choice. The same view on CAA On one critical matter, all four States seem to have a common approach — about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. In all the four States, complete opposition to the CAA was stronger than the complete support for it (See Table 5). In Kerala, more than half the respondents were completely opposed to it while in Assam, close to half the respondents took that stand. In Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, close to one-thirds of the respondents were fully opposed to it. The jury was mixed when it came to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) (See Table 6): it found very strong support in Assam and lukewarm support in Tamil Nadu. In West Bengal, those fully opposed to it were marginally higher than those in complete support of it. In Kerala, there was a very high degree of opposition to the NRC. The response is directly linked to the political preferences of the voters in that particular State. Thus, the lessons to be learnt from the verdicts in the four States and one Union Territory are evident. State elections are fought on local factors which define and decide the nature and intensity of a verdict. In the electoral competition for a State, it is evident that the nucleus of the campaign is the local leadership. While national leaders of a party can provide support and enhance the visibility of the party, the ground work needs to be done by local leaders with a mass base and sustained presence in local politics. In Assam, the BJP has been able to adapt to this State-specificity and also project State-level leadership. It reaped dividends on this score. In the other three States, the BJP appears quite some distance from both adapting to the core features of the State politics and projecting credible leadership from the State. This limitation has halted its onward march in these new territories in spite of considerable headway in West Bengal.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Under-reporting does hurt the COVID fight||India, now home to the world’s worst ongoing coronavirus pandemic, is currently reporting nearly a million new cases and 10,000 deaths every three days, according to data released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (covid19india.org). The true extent of the second wave now ravaging India is likely much worse than official numbers suggest. The reasons Is it a problem noted only in India? Not capturing all COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths is not unique to India. Research on the behavioural dynamics of COVID-19 (https://bit.ly/337iW75) from a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates the global under-reporting factor for cumulative cases around 7 and for deaths 1.4 as of December, 2020. Researchers further note that these factors vary substantially across nations. In India, this problem seems to be particularly acute during the second wave based on empirical evidence and epidemiological models. Why is it hard to capture all COVID-19 infections and related deaths? There could be several reasons why we cannot capture all COVID-19 infections such as silent asymptomatic infections, barriers to testing due to cost and travel time, reluctance to get tested due to COVID-19 associated stigma, limited availability of tests, obtaining a false negative test (remember that diagnostic tests are not perfect) and alike. Deaths related to COVID-19 that are missed often consist of deaths that happened outside health-care facilities at home, and post-COVID-19 deaths where the cause of death is listed as a pre-existing comorbidity such as heart disease or kidney failure. India also has a poor and delayed infrastructure for reporting of deaths and certifying the cause of death in general, particularly in the rural areas. In a 2017 estimate, one out of five deaths was medically reported. How do we estimate this under-reporting from epidemiologic models? For modelling growth of an epidemic, what we observe are deaths, cases or hospitalisations. However, what really defines an epidemic is not exactly the growth of these observed quantities but the infections, which in turn become these outcomes (deaths, cases, hospitalisations) with some delay, and not all infections get converted to these observed quantities. What proportion of people die from an infection is a very important quantity as it allows us to know how dangerous a disease is. Another important quantity is how many infections a health system identifies, that is, how many of these will actually end up being reported as cases. A high number of infections being caught by the health system shows a successful surveillance strategy. On epidemiological models In a recent study (https://bit.ly/3xI3ufO), epidemiological models attempt to capture covert infections by accounting for unreported, but infectious individuals. Expected deaths are then estimated from the estimated number of infections and assumed infection fatality rates based on historical data. Such models (https://bit.ly/3nG50u6) indicate the under-reporting factor for cases between 10 and 20 and for deaths between two and five based on data from the first wave for India. Can we validate what the models are saying? How do we validate the extent of unreported cases: We can cross-check under-reporting of infections directly with serosurveys carried out in India. The third serosurvey (https://bbc.in/3eMDPdb) conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (from December 17, 2020 till January 8, 2021) reports that 21.5% of all Indians above the age of 18 have antibodies present that indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past. Approximately 59% of India’s 1.36 billion citizens are above the age of 18. This implies nearly 173 million adults infected. Factoring in the nearly 11 million COVID-19 cases reported by January 8 (assuming most cases are adults), this points to an implied under-reporting factor of roughly 16 for infections. In other words, only 6% of India’s COVID-19 infections are reported. Hence, the question of “missing infections” in India is undeniable and not contingent on a belief in the legitimacy of mathematical models — it is evident based on figures released by the Indian government/bodies alone. Mortality data How to validate the extent of unreported deaths: During wave 1 (https://bbc.in/2RlzDZS), a group of volunteers collected every reported death from obituaries in newspapers and reported almost twice the number of deaths than officially reported. During this recent surge, a recent report in The New York Times (https://nyti.ms/3xEudK2) noted that authorities in Gujarat reported between 73 and 121 COVID-related deaths each day in mid-April. The report added that one of Gujarat’s leading newspapers, Sandesh , sent reporters to cremation and burial grounds across the State and reported that the number was several times higher, around 600 each day. The extent of this under-reporting is higher than our past model estimates. This current increased case-fatality is not only due to clinical lethality of the virus, but more patients are dying due to not receiving adequate medical care. A way to capture the holistic effect of COVID-19 (direct and indirect impact on mortality) will be to perform a proper excess death calculation where demographers can take the number of people who die from any cause in a given region and period and compare the same with a historical trend based on the past few years and come up with a difference of observed and expected number of deaths. This method of investigating excess deaths is something various nations have explored, such as the United States (https://bit.ly/3eafKh8; 22% excess deaths in 2020 and 72% of these attributed to COVID). India has not made historical mortality data and data from 2020 publicly available, making this calculation infeasible at this point. Is India testing enough during wave 2? Lack of adequate testing could be one of the causes of missing infections. Testing in India To understand India’s scale of testing, let us look at the U.S. during its highest surge in January (November 1-February 15) and India during this recent surge (March 28-April 27) in terms of testing. The bar plots show that India has a maximum daily test positivity ratio (TPR) around 25% and the U.S. had a maximum daily TPR around 15%. More interesting is Figure 2 showing seven-day growth rate in cases versus testing. While testing and cases have grown at a comparable rate in the U.S., in India the growth in reported cases on an average has been nearly five times higher than the growth in testing. India is not testing enough. How does under-reporting matter? Right now, the country is reeling from skyrocketing infection and death counts. This surge has thrown our health-care systems off balance. Crucial medical supplies run dangerously low and hospitals are forced to turn away patients. These forecasting models are used to predict the need for oxygen, hospital beds, intensive care unit care needs, the peak and duration of the pandemic. Without having more informative data, accurate projections are impossible. Knowing the truth is better for both public and policymakers to gauge the true state of the pandemic. Finally, the exact extent of under-reporting is debatable, but we should never forget that these numbers represent people. The official system can fail to capture the diseased and the deceased, but families cannot. The tragedies that have unfolded in thousands of families in India, with an astounding number of people that are currently sick and grieving for the dead, can never be captured through the reported staggering numbers and the ones that were missed.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A ‘One Health’ approach that targets people, animals||The father of modern pathology, Rudolf Virchow, emphasised in 1856 that there are essentially no dividing lines between animal and human medicine. This concept is ever more salient as the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions that took place around World Veterinary Day, on April 24, 2021, focused on acknowledging the interconnectedness of animals, humans, and the environment, an approach referred to as “One Health”. Across the species barrier Studies indicate that more than two-thirds of existing and emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, or can be transferred between animals and humans, and vice versa, when the pathogen in question originates in any life form but circumvents the species barrier. Another category of diseases, “anthropozoonotic” infections, gets transferred from humans to animals. The transboundary impact of viral outbreaks in recent years such as the Nipah virus, Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Avian Influenza has further reinforced the need for us to consistently document the linkages between the environment, animals, and human health. India’s framework, plans India’s ‘One Health’ vision derives its blueprint from the agreement between the tripartite-plus alliance comprising the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) — a global initiative supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank under the overarching goal of contributing to ‘One World, One Health’. In keeping with the long-term objectives, India established a National Standing Committee on Zoonoses as far back as the 1980s. And this year, funds were sanctioned for setting up a ‘Centre for One Health’ at Nagpur. Further, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD) has launched several schemes to mitigate the prevalence of animal diseases since 2015, with a funding pattern along the lines of 60:40 (Centre: State); 90:10 for the Northeastern States, and 100% funding for Union Territories. Hence, under the National Animal Disease Control Programme, Rs. 13,343 crore have been sanctioned for Foot and Mouth disease and Brucellosis control. In addition, DAHD will soon establish a ‘One Health’ unit within the Ministry. Additionally, the government is working to revamp programmes that focus on capacity building for veterinarians and upgrading the animal health diagnostic system such as Assistance to States for Control of Animal Diseases (ASCAD). In the revised component of assistance to States/Union Territories, there is increased focus on vaccination against livestock diseases and backyard poultry. To this end, assistance will be extended to State biological production units and disease diagnostic laboratories. WHO estimates that rabies (also a zoonotic disease) costs the global economy approximately $6 billion annually. Considering that 97% of human rabies cases in India are attributed to dogs, interventions for disease management in dogs are considered crucial. DAHD has partnered with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the National Action Plan for Eliminating Dog Mediated Rabies. This initiative is geared towards sustained mass dog vaccinations and public education to render the country free of rabies. Need for coordination Scientists have observed that there are more than 1.7 million viruses circulating in wildlife, and many of them are likely to be zoonotic, which implies that unless there is timely detection, India risks facing many more pandemics in times to come. To achieve targets under the ‘One Health’ vision, efforts are ongoing to address challenges pertaining to veterinary manpower shortages, the lack of information sharing between human and animal health institutions, and inadequate coordination on food safety at slaughter, distribution, and retail facilities. These issues can be remedied by consolidating existing animal health and disease surveillance systems — e.g., the Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (https://bit.ly/2SqNHlr), and the National Animal Disease Reporting System (https://bit.ly/3aVTPbq) — developing best-practice guidelines for informal market and slaughterhouse operation (e.g., inspections, disease prevalence assessments), and creating mechanisms to operationalise ‘One Health’ at every stage down to the village level. Now, as we battle yet another wave of a deadly zoonotic disease (COVID-19), awareness generation, and increased investments toward meeting ‘One Health’ targets is the need of the hour.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||What was the methodology used?||The findings presented here are from post-poll surveys conducted in Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal by the Lokniti programme of CSDS, Delhi. The surveys were conducted from March 28 to April 21 in Assam, April 7 to April 13 in Kerala, April 7 to April 20 in Tamil Nadu, and March 28 to May 1 in West Bengal. In Assam, the survey was conducted among 3,490 voters at 140 polling stations spread across 35 Assembly constituencies; in Kerala, among 3,424 voters at 140 polling stations of 35 Assembly constituencies; in Tamil Nadu, among 4,354 voters at 160 polling stations in 40 Assembly constituencies; and in West Bengal, among 4,223 voters at 200 polling stations spread across 50 Assembly constituencies. Sampling design The sampling design adopted was multi-stage systematic random sampling. The Assembly constituencies were randomly selected using the probability proportional to size method. Thereafter, four polling stations within each of the sampled constituencies were selected using the systematic random sampling method. Within each polling station, 40 voters were randomly sampled from the electoral roll using the systematic random sampling method. Of these 40, 25 interviews were targeted. The interviews of electors were conducted face-to-face at their homes after voting had taken place in their area. The questionnaire designed for conducting the interview was a standardised semi-structured one and was translated into the local language/s. In Assam, the interviews were conducted in Assamese and Bengali, in Kerala in Malayalam, in Tamil Nadu in Tamil, and in West Bengal in Bengali. The interview duration across all States was about 35 minutes on average. While the interview targets were more or less achieved in Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, in West Bengal, the total number of interviews fell short of the target due to challenges/slowdown in fieldwork on account of a surge in COVID-19 cases during the latter phases. In order to ensure representativeness and correct for under-representation of key demographics, the achieved raw sample has been weighted by gender, religion, locality, and caste group based on Census 2011 data. The final data sets have also been weighted by the actual vote shares secured by the major parties and fronts that contested the elections in each State. All analysis here has been presented on the weighted data sets. Safety of investigators In order to ensure the safety of the field investigators amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and also of those around them, field investigators were provided with masks and sanitisers for the fieldwork and it was ensured that the interviews were conducted following proper physical distancing and mask rules. Before going to the field, field investigators were made to sign an undertaking that they are not showing any of the COVID-19 symptoms and that they would take all the necessary precautions in the field.  In Assam, the survey was coordinated and supervised by Dhruba Pratim Sharma (Gauhati University) and Nurul Hassan (Kampur College, Nagaon). In Kerala, it was conducted by Sajad Ibrahim, Kiran Raj and Abhishek P.S. (University of Kerala). In Tamil Nadu, it was conducted by P. Ramajayam and D. Kirubanithi (Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli), Gladston Xavier and Paul K. Nathan (Loyola College, Chennai), Benisha Catherin (Programme manager, Glo Foundation) and Mercy Pious (Independent development consultant). In West Bengal, it was conducted by Suprio Basu (University of Kalyani) and Jyotiprasad Chatterjee (Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College). Sanjay Kumar of Lokniti-CSDS, Delhi directed the survey.  In Assam, the interviews were conducted in Assamese and Bengali, in Kerala in Malayalam, in Tamil Nadu in Tamil, and in West Bengal in Bengali.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/what-was-the-methodology-used/article34475834.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A transient high||India’s GST regime could not have hoped for a better start to its fifth year. Revenues from the tax hit an all-time high of Rs. 1,41,384 crore in April, surpassing the previous month’s record of about Rs. 1.24 lakh crore. After a disastrous period for the economy following last year’s national lockdown, GST revenues hit Rs. 1.05 lakh crore in October and have shown a steady uptick since then, in tandem with hopes of a sustained recovery. April’s numbers, which are essentially driven by the transactions in March, were bolstered by heightened economic activity, no doubt. The spectre of rising COVID-19 cases and the fear of an impending lockdown could also have driven people to make advance purchases in anticipation. Moreover, firms in the process of closing annual accounts may have remitted higher GST based on audit advice, while a gradual tightening of the compliance regime, and pro-active co-ordinated probes against taxpayers using fake bills to evade liabilities, have played no small part. In April 2020, GST collections had dipped to a mere Rs. 32,172 crore after all activity ground to a halt at four hours’ notice in late March. Economic activity may not yet be as badly affected amidst the pandemic’s second wave. So far, going by the restrictions imposed in several States, supply chain disruptions are not expected to be as challenging. However, weakening demand will trigger a recalibration of production and investment plans, some of which has begun to kick in. Consider some indicators — major two-wheeler producers saw sales plummet by around a third in April, compared to March. Plant shutdowns have gradually begun to reduce inventory build-ups. In a report, ‘Wall of Worry’, Crisil has warned of several indicators sliding since mid-April, including GST e-way bills which fell by over 6%, two weeks in a row. Manufacturing orders’ growth hit an eight-month low in April, as per IHS Markit. And the pandemic surge and desperate shortage of health infrastructure have prompted industry leaders to pitch for a stringent lockdown. It would be foolhardy now to expect GST and other tax revenues to stay robust till the government gets a better grip on infections and vaccinations. With the Assembly polls over, the Centre must urgently convene the GST Council. To add to what is already pending — rationalisation of GST rate slabs, a rejig of rates on critical pandemic supplies and the prickly issue of bringing fuel under GST — the Council must begin gearing up early for shortfalls in GST compensation to States that may arise this year. India can ill-afford a repeat of the 2020 face-off between the Centre and States that almost upended the very spirit of co-operative federalism the GST emerged from.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-transient-high/article34475812.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The nuclear challenge||President Joe Biden’s call for “stern deterrence” in response to North Korea’s nuclear programme and Pyongyang’s angry reaction, accusing the Biden administration of being “hostile”, suggest that both countries are headed towards a diplomatic showdown. In his first congressional address last week, Mr. Biden said the nuclear programmes of Iran and North Korea posed a “serious threat to America’s security and world security” and promised to respond through “diplomacy and stern deterrence”. His administration has also completed a review of the U.S.’s North Korea policy. Mr. Biden is likely to steer between Barack Obama’s “strategic patience” and Donald Trump’s top-level summitry in dealing with the North Korean nuclear challenge. North Korea has remained an unresolved foreign policy puzzle for all post-War American Presidents. In recent times, U.S. Presidents have shown a willingness to diplomatically engage with Pyongyang. The Clinton administration had signed a framework agreement with Pyongyang to halt its nuclear programme. Mr. Obama had initiated talks with North Korea in 2012, which collapsed after Pyongyang launched a satellite. He then adopted a wait-and-watch approach, which came to be called “strategic patience”. Mr. Trump altered his predecessor’s North Korea policy by reaching out to the regime and meeting its leader, Kim Jong-un, thrice, but without a breakthrough. In theory, the Trump administration and North Korea had agreed to a complete de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but failed to agree on its formula. In the 2019 Trump-Kim summit at Hanoi, the U.S. proposed removal of sanctions for de-nuclearisation, but North Korea rejected it. Pyongyang had taken a phased approach and sought sanctions removal in return. Ever since, there has been no improvement in ties. After Mr. Biden assumed office, North Korea had conducted short-range missile tests, which the U.S. saw as a provocation. Mr. Biden does not have many good options in dealing with North Korea. The U.S.’s key goal in northeastern Asia is the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. And the only practical way to achieve this is through diplomacy as a military strike on North Korea, a nuclear power, is out of the question. Though the Trump-Kim summits did not lead to any breakthrough, they have still created a diplomatic momentum for engagement. Despite its threats to expand its nuclear programme, North Korea sticks to the self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests. The North, as acknowledged by Mr. Kim recently, is going through a tough economic crisis and is open to talks. Mr. Biden should seize this opportunity and try to reach common ground with Mr. Kim that addresses both North Korea’s economic worries and the U.S.’s nuclear concerns. That should be the focus of the Biden administration’s new North Korean strategy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-nuclear-challenge/article34475813.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Factory output growth decelerates: PMI||India’s manufacturing sector activity was largely flat in April, as rates of growth for new orders and output eased to eight-month lows amid the rise in COVID-19 cases, a monthly survey showed. The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was at 55.5 in April, little changed from March’s reading of 55.4. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction. ‘Further slowdown’ “The PMI results for April showed a further slowdown in rates of growth for new orders and output, both of which eased to eight-month lows amid the intensification of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. Ms. Lima also noted that “the surge in COVID-19 cases could dampen demand further when firms’ financials are already susceptible to the hurdle of rising global prices.” The daily COVID-19 cases in India showed a slight dip with 3,68,147 new coronavirus infections being reported, taking the total tally of cases to 1,99,25,604, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on May 3.  Surging input costs On the prices front, survey participants also signalled a steep increase in input costs, the quickest since July 2014, and upward revisions to selling prices. “April saw the steepest increase in input costs for nearly seven years drive the sharpest upturn in output charges since October 2013. Data for the coming months will be important at verifying whether client demand is resilient to these challenges or if producers will have to further absorb cost burdens themselves to secure new work,” Ms. Lima said. The survey, however, noted that while output and sales increased at the slowest rates since last August due to an intensification of the COVID-19 crisis, there was a faster upturn in international orders. New export orders increased for the eighth consecutive month in April and at the fastest rate since October 2020. The rise was associated with a pick-up in international demand for Indian goods, the survey said. On the job front, although manufacturing employment continued to fall, the rate of contraction recorded in April was marginal and the weakest in the current 13-month sequence of job shedding, it noted.  April saw the steepest increase in input costs for nearly seven years Pollyanna De Lima,IHS Markit||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/factory-output-growth-decelerates-pmi/article34475806.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||CII’s Kotak urges firms to voluntarily curtail operations||A day after mooting more stringent restrictions on economic activity to contain the ‘suffering’ from the pandemic, CII president Uday Kotak on Monday urged companies to take ‘voluntary measures’ to break the COVID transmission chain by minimising all activity that requires in-person presence at the work premises for the next two weeks. Auto makers including Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, JCB India and Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India have taken the lead by halting production temporarily or advancing maintenance schedules, to protect their employees, Mr. Kotak pointed out. Similarly, services sector firms such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS and Infosys have adopted a work-from-home system. “The healthcare system and medical personnel are stretched to the limit and exhausted.

04 May 2021||COIMBATORE,||Sugar output rises by 41 lakh tonnes: ISMA||Sugar mills have produced 299.2 lakh tonnes of sugar between October 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021. This is 41 lakh tonnes higher than 258.1 lakh tonnes produced during the same period last sugar season, according to the Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA). Compared with the 112 sugar mills crushing sugarcane as on April 30 last year, 106 mills were involved as on April 30 this year. To support exports, the government had allowed the swap between MAEQ (Maximum Admissable Export Quantity) and domestic sales quota for the current sugar season (October 2020 to September 2021). This move had received a positive response from the millers. As per market reports, contracts for exports of about 55 lakh tonne had been entered into so far. This is more than 90% of the total MAEQ quantity for 2020-2021 sugar season. About 8-10 lakh tonnes may be exported in May. Against the total Letter of Intent quantity of 325.9 crore litre for ethanol, 117.7 crore litre had been supplied as on April 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sugar-output-rises-by-41-lakh-tonnes-isma/article34475794.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Export orders healthy, demand rising: FIEO||Indian exporters are expecting a continuous growth in the country’s outbound shipments despite an increase in COVID-19 cases as their order books are encouraging and there is a pick up in demand in rich markets. Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President S.K. Saraf said that in most of the States, manufacturing and export- related services have been exempted from restrictions and inter-State movement of cargo is permitted by the central government. “However, a pandemic of such magnitude does cause disruptions since various stakeholders are not operating with full manpower, including the industry. “We expect the peak to come before mid-May and the situation should improve thereafter,” he said. “With such assumptions, we expect exports to continue on the growth trajectory as the order-booking position of exporters is very encouraging,” he added. India’s exports in April jumped almost threefold to $30.2 billion even as trade deficit widened to $15.24 billion, according to the Commerce Ministry’s data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/export-orders-healthy-demand-rising-fieo/article34475801.ece

04 May 2021||MUMBAI,||KKR-RCB postponed amid COVID fears||The Indian Premier League game between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders scheduled in Ahmedabad on Monday was postponed after two KKR players — Varun Chakravarthy and Sandeep Warrier — tested positive for COVID-19. A statement issued by IPL, which confirmed the rescheduling of the match, said the KKR camp will be tested on a daily basis now. “Varun Chakravarthy and Sandeep Warrier were found to be positive in the third round of testing in the last four days. All other team members have tested negative for COVID-19,” the statement read. “Both the players have isolated themselves from the rest of the squad. The Medical Team is in continuous touch with the duo and monitoring their health. Meanwhile, the Kolkata Knight Riders have now moved towards a daily testing routine to identify any other possible cases and treat them at the earliest. “The Medical Team is also determining the close and casual contacts of the two positive cases during the 48 hours prior to collection of the sample that returned the positive test results,” the statement added.  The Hindu understands that a few other members of the squad are “showing symptoms”. According to the IPL’s ‘Health and Safety Protocols’ booklet, distributed to the franchises on March 19, each “close contact” of an “affected person” has to isolate for “six days” and return “3 negative tests on day 1, 3 and 6”. Varun is understood to have visited a designated hospital for a scan, something that is allowed according to the rulebook. Rescheduling one match, especially this year with the IPL following a caravan format, is going to be a tougher task than normal. Even if KKR gets the go-ahead to resume competing ahead of its next scheduled fixture on May 8 in Ahmedabad, it will be a challenge to reschedule Monday’s game without affecting other matches. As per the original schedule, RCB is supposed to leave for Kolkata on May 7, while KKR is scheduled to travel to Bengaluru on May 9 for the last leg of the league stage. It is understood that the IPL authorities will announce the reworked schedule on Tuesday.  We are a little fortunate that we have a bit of a break because our next game is on May 8 (against Capitals) Venky Mysore KKR CEO||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kkr-rcb-postponed-amid-covid-fears/article34475919.ece
04 May 2021||Valencia,||Barcelona edges a nail-biting encounter||Lionel Messi missed a penalty but still scored twice, including an exquisite free-kick, as Barcelona edged a five-goal thriller with Valencia on Sunday to stay within touching distance of the top of LaLiga. After Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid both won on Saturday, there was no margin for error at Mestalla, where Barca’s 3-2 win reduced the gap behind Atletico back to two points, now with four games left to play. Gabriel Paulista headed Valencia in front early in the second half before Messi missed a penalty, only to smash in from the resulting scramble. Griezmann and a superb Messi free-kick looked to have then made the victory secure but Carlos Soler’s stunning strike from distance left Barcelona holding on at the end, a nerve-wracking win meaning it could overtake Atletico Madrid next weekend if it beats Diego Simeone’s side at Camp Nou. “We knew we would not have any calm games,” said Gerard Pique. “We are still in the fight. Calm games mean you’re not competing for anything.”  Gareth Bale scored a hat trick as Tottenham stayed in the Champions League qualification race with a 4-0 win over relegated Sheffield United on Sunday. Bale claimed his first treble since returning on loan from Real Madrid for this season, and Son Heung-min also netted, as Tottenham rose to fifth place — five points behind Chelsea with four games left to play. Bale took his Premier League tally to eight goals in the last eight games, but with that must come a sense of what might have been this season. Under-used Bale was under-used by former manager Jose Mourinho, even when he had regained peak condition. Playing with freedom in a front four with Harry Kane, Son and Dele Alli, Spurs were a constant threat and a far cry from the pragmatic style that dogged Mourinho’s era. It may have come too late to gatecrash the top four this season, but playing like this makes them a strong bet to finish in a Europa League spot under interim manager Ryan Mason.  The results: Premier League: Tottenham 4 (Bale 36, 61, 69, Son 77) bt Sheffield United 0.   LaLiga: Granada 0 lost to Cadiz 1 (Sobrino 39); Valencia 2 (Gabriel Paulista 49, Soler 83) lost to Barcelona 3 (Messi 58, 69, Griezmann 63).   Serie A: Sampdoria 2 (Adrien Silva 45, Jankto 65) bt Roma 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-edges-a-nail-biting-encounter/article34475980.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Tottering Sunrisers face revived Mumbai Indians||A change of venue has worked for one team, while a change in captaincy hasn’t turned the fortunes of the other. No wonder then that Tuesday’s IPL clash between Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad will start with the defending champion enjoying the tag of favourite. After winning just two of its five games in Chennai, Rohit Sharma & Co. seems to be back in business in the national capital, notching up successive wins to revive its campaign. And the last-ball heist that Kieron Pollard pulled off against arch rival Chennai Super Kings over the weekend would have boosted its confidence further. With shorter boundaries and a quicker deck at the Kotla working in MI’s favour, the five-time champion would be hoping that Hardik Pandya, who has been lacklustre so far, and Suryakumar Yadav, who has had a dip of late, will be back at their best against a tottering SRH line-up. In addition to a formidable opponent, SRH has other battles to fight — getting the mood in the camp right, for instance. Despite David Warner putting up a brave front hours after being axed as captain and performing all the duties of a reserve player, SRH looked in disarray against Rajasthan Royals. With a solitary win in the first half, SRH will be hoping for individual brilliance to fire the team up. Can Kane Williamson, reinstated as captain midway through the tournament, deliver the much-needed boost against an attack led by Kiwi compatriot Trent Boult? With the Sunrisers’ middle- and lower-middle order having been found wanting time and again, the onus will be on the top three to make a match of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tottering-sunrisers-face-revived-mumbai-indians/article34475923.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Super Kings affected as well||At least two members of the Chennai Super Kings contingent, including bowling coach L. Balaji, have been diagnosed with COVID-19. It means that CSK’s next match, against Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday, will in all likelihood be deferred since Balaji and his “close contacts” will have to be isolated for six days. It was revealed on Monday that the reports of Balaji and a member of the logistics team (bus driver) for the tests conducted on Sunday were positive. Training called off Since Balaji was involved in CSK’s last-ball loss to Mumbai Indians on Saturday night, Monday’s practice session was called off and all members of the contingent were confined to their rooms. “One’s health is most important,” a CSK source told The Hindu . “The rapid antigen showed negative results but the RT-PCR tests came positive. But the symptoms are mild.” While K.S. Viswanathan, the chief executive officer, was also diagnosed with the infection, a rapid antigen test on Monday was found to be negative. Results of another RT-PCR test conducted on Monday are awaited. Neither CSK nor RR has been officially notified about a change in plan for Wednesday’s match but according to a BCCI official, CSK “cannot be allowed to play” as per the health and safety protocols for the tournament. Ashwin to rejoin Capitals Meanwhile, R. Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for the league stage’s last leg in Kolkata, starting on May 9. According to a DC insider, Ashwin will serve the mandatory week-long isolation before re-entering the bubble next week. Ashwin had left the squad due to COVID-19 concerns in his family at the end of the Chennai leg last week. Meanwhile, the Capitals team has been put in isolation in Ahmedabad since Monday afternoon as a ‘precautionary measure’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/super-kings-affected-as-well/article34475914.ece

Harris, who beat World No. 4 Dominic Thiem and Denis Shapovalov en route to the final in Dubai in March, pulled off another upset by ousting Dimitrov 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(5). The World No. 54 held off a late fightback from 13th seed Dimitrov, who saved three match points in the final set before breaking back to force a tie-break. “It was an up and down match, I had a set and a break, then I was a break up in the third too,” said Harris. “I got a little bit nervous at the end, but I was happy to close it out.” Two-time quarterfinalist John Isner battled past Serbia’s Miomir Kecmanovic 6-4, 7-6(6) while 11th seed Shapovalov defeated another Serbian Dusan Lajovic 6-1, 6-3. In doubles, Rohan Bopanna and Shapovalov got past Marc Lopez and Jaume Munar 7-6(4), 6-4 in the first round.

04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Not letting us get back home is a disgrace, says Slater||Cricketer-turned-commentator Michael Slater, who is currently doing commentary in the IPL here, has launched a scathing attack on his country’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison for not allowing its citizens to return from COVID-19 hit India, calling the travel ban a “disgrace”. Australia has shut its borders and not allowing any commercial flights from India because of the massive COVID-19 surge here which has led to all the players, support staff and commentators, who might have wanted to leave the IPL, in a fix. The government has made it clear that Australians who are engaged in the IPL will have to make their own arrangements. “If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It’s a disgrace!! Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system. I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect,” Slater tweeted. Threatening a five-year jail term or hefty fine, the Australian government temporarily barred its citizens from entering the country if they happened to be in India within 14 days of their intended arrival. The decision was announced after a meeting of the National Cabinet last Friday and came into force from Monday. Aims to check spread The move aims at keeping the COVID-19 spread in check in Australia as India is facing a surge in cases. The decision was also based on the proportion of overseas travellers in quarantine in Australia, who have contracted the infection in India, according to Health Minister Greg Hunt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/not-letting-us-get-back-home-is-a-disgrace-says-slater/article34475927.ece

04 May 2021||Bengaluru,||Don’t fear playing top teams: Nisha||Playing against World No. 2 Argentina and No. 3 Germany in their home countries has been a big confidence booster for young Indian women’s hockey defender Nisha. Having made her debut in 2019 at the FIH Women’s Series Finals Hiroshima 2019 when India played against Uruguay, Nisha has been gaining the right exposure at the international level to build on her game. “Playing against top teams like Argentina and Germany requires a tough mental make-up. Initially, I was worried about taking on a world class team but having played those matches on their home ground, I don’t fear them any more,” said Nisha in a Hockey India release. Nisha was part of the Indian team that toured Argentina in January this year of the team’s tour to Germany in February. “I feel getting that exposure to play against such top teams early in my career will help me improve as a player and I am grateful for the opportunity. These tours have certainly helped in boosting my confidence levels as I understand better what it takes to play the higher ranked teams,” said the 25-year-old. “Both Argentina and Germany play very tactical hockey and the way they communicate and look for gaps to penetrate into the circle is very unique. Defending against them was not easy but at the same time, there was so much to learn from them,” she added. Moving forward, Nisha wants to remain focused on the areas the chief coach wants her to work on and continue contributing to the team’s exploits. “With the Olympics fast approaching, all players want to prove their mettle in order to find a place in the team. There is a healthy competition within the core group which pushes each other to perform better.”  Both Argentina and Germany play very tactical hockey.

04 May 2021||Pallekele,||Jayawickrama spins Sri Lanka to series win||Sri Lanka spinner Praveen Jayawickrama enjoyed a dream debut as he claimed 11 wickets to seal a 209-run victory over Bangladesh in the second Test here on Monday. Chasing a daunting 437 to win, Bangladesh was dismissed for 227 in the first session of the final day after resuming at 177 for five as Sri Lanka wrapped up the match, and the series 1-0, after 90 minutes of play. The 22-year-old left-armer Jayawickrama was named ‘player of the match’ after claiming 11-178 on his first Test appearance as he added five second-innings wickets to the six in the first.  Off-spinner Ramesh Mendis dismissed four batsmen as all the wickets in Bangladesh’s second innings wickets were picked up by the slow bowlers. Jayawickrama struck in the third over of the day, his ninth wicket of the match, when he trapped Liton Das lbw with a ball that went straight on. He set a Sri Lankan record for a Test debutant, surpassing Akila Dananjaya’s eight for 44 against the same opponent in Dhaka in 2018. Bowling change works Mendis was replaced after a 15-over spell during which he took two wickets and the change worked immediately as part-time spinner Dhananjaya de Silva struck with his second delivery. Taijul Islam, on two, attempted a late cut, but only managed to edge it to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella. Mendis returned to have Taskin Ahmed caught by Dimuth Karunaratne. Jayawickrama then mopped up the tail. Mehidy Hasan fell first to take the young bowler's match haul into double figures, before the left-arm spinner sealed the Test and the series three balls later when he trapped Abu Jayed leg-before. Jayawickrama is the 16th Test cricketer to take 10 wickets or more on debut but only the second this century after Australia’s Jason Krejza, who took 12 wickets against India at Nagpur in 2008. Sri Lanka captain Karunaratne was named ‘player of the series’.  The scores: Sri Lanka 493/7 decl. & 194/9 decl. bt Bangladesh 251 & 227 in 71 overs (M.

04 May 2021||MILWAUKEE,||Giannis Antetokounmpo on fire||Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 49 points in his return from an injury as Milwaukee Bucks overcame Kevin Durant’s 42-point performance to beat Brooklyn Nets 117-114 on Sunday. Two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo, who had been dealing with a sprained right ankle, outdueled Durant in the Eastern Conference clash between the two highest-scoring teams in the league. Antetokounmpo finished just three points short of his career high, which he set two years ago against Philadelphia. Elsewhere, Pascal Siakam (39) and Kyle Lowry (37) combined for 76 points as Toronto Raptors kept its playoff hopes alive with a 121-114 win over the struggling Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers saw superstar LeBron James exit in the fourth quarter. “He was battling some soreness,” said Laker coach Frank Vogel. “We decided not to bring him back. We will see how he’s feeling tomorrow.” The win leaves the Raptors two and a half games behind Washington in the battle for the 10th seed in the Eastern Conference.

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Magnus Carlsen takes the honours||Displaying amazing resolve, Magnus Carlsen bounced back to thwart Hikaru Nakamura’s bid to force a tie-breaker and win the New in Chess Classic rapid online title on Sunday. Having won the first match of the final on Saturday, Carlsen gained the 2-2 draw he needed. In fact, Carlsen reached a completely winning position in the fourth game but accepted Nakamura’s draw-offer. Nakamura started well by winning the first game. He held a better position but settled for a draw in the second. Thereafter, it was Carlsen’s turn to win. In a must-win situation to stay alive in the final, Nakamura messed up his position in the fourth game and conceded defeat by offering a draw. This meant Carlsen won his first title on the Champions Tour that commenced in November. The World champion topped the preliminary league in each of the previous events — Skilling Open, Airthings Masters, Opera Euro Rapid and the Magnus Carlsen Invitational — but could not emerge as champion. The title also took Carlsen (185 points) to the top of the Champions Tour standings. Wesley So (145), Teimour Radjabov (109) and Anish Giri (105) trail Carlsen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/magnus-carlsen-takes-the-honours/article34475967.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pranati Nayak qualifies for Tokyo Olympics||Pranati Nayak, who had claimed a bronze in vault at the Asian artistic gymnastic championships in 2019, is set to compete at the Tokyo Olympics after qualifying through the continental quota. The 26-year-old from West Bengal, the second reserve behind Sri Lanka’s Elpitiya Badalge Dona Milka Geh for the Asian quota, became eligible to compete from the zone following the cancellation of the senior Asian championships, scheduled to be held from May 29 in Hangzhou (China), due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “I was very disappointed when I couldn’t achieve the qualifying score during the 2019 World Championship and with the pandemic cancelling all events, I never imagined that I will be able to realise this dream of going to the Olympics,” said Pranati. Pranati is waiting for an official communication from the Asian or world body. If confirmed, she will follows in the footsteps of Dipa Karmakar, the first Indian women’s gymnast to compete in the Olympics at Rio 2016. Dipa hasn’t qualified for Tokyo yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pranati-nayak-qualifies-for-tokyo-olympics/article34475971.ece
04 May 2021||Manchester,||Rested City welcomes a tired PSG||A rested line-up faces a tired team with its back to the wall after losing the Champions League semifinal first leg 2-1. According to the tournament’s history books, Paris Saint-Germain has only a 7% chance of reaching its second straight final in a competition it’s desperate to win. Manchester City, meanwhile, is odds-on to reach its first Champions League final and coach Pep Guardiola had the luxury of resting most of his key players at the weekend with the Premier League almost won. PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino couldn’t rotate his squad too much over the weekend because PSG is still second in the French league and under pressure to keep its title. Speedy recovery But he is hopeful that star striker Kylian Mbappe will be available after he sustained a right calf injury in the first leg. PSG’s top scorer with 37 goals this season, Mbappe has shown signs of a speedy recovery. Pochettino rested midfielder Leandro Paredes and right back Alessandro Florenzi on the weekend, suggesting both will start the semifinal. He used midfield schemer Marco Verratti for only 30 minutes against Lens on Saturday to keep him fresh to face City.  Tonight’s match: City vs PSG, 12.30 a.m. (Wednesday).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rested-city-welcomes-a-tired-psg/article34475976.ece

While there are no Proteas players in KKR, du Plessis, Lungi Ngidi and Imran Tahir play for CSK. Many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have banned flights from India but South Africa has still kept its borders open, with travellers needing to submit a negative test report within 72 hours of travelling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-is-for-the-players-to-decide-smith/article34476406.ece

Answering questions from mediapersons on Sunday night about the two overseas recruits turning up higher in batting order following K.L. Rahul’s non-availability, Mayank responded, “That’s something we have to speak about.” After PBKS suffered a seven-wicket defeat to Delhi Capitals, Mayank defended the team combination chosen for the match. “With Delhi’s batting, we thought we needed that firepower to get the wickets. That was the plan. And we back our bowlers to do it for us.” On the question of how prepared he was for captaincy, Mayank said, “I had been kept in the loop. Through the season, we were there in meetings. “There was enough time to prepare. When you play as a batsman, you don’t think like a captain, you execute your role as a player. When you are captain and batting, you want to take extra responsibility.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/there-was-enough-time-to-prepare-mayank/article34475916.ece
04 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Sindhu for ‘Believe in Sports’ campaign||World badminton champion P.V. Sindhu, along with Canada’s Michelle Li, has been nominated as an athlete ambassador for the International Olympic Committee’s ‘Believe in Sport’ campaign aimed at preventing competition manipulation. The two shuttlers will work other nominees in raising awareness about competition manipulation amongst athletes and entourage. Sindhu and Li have been global ambassadors for the Badminton World Federation ‘I Am Badminton’ campaign since April 2020. “It is an honour to be nominated by the IOC as an athlete ambassador. I stand alongside my fellow athletes in the fight against any form of cheating or competition manipulation. Together we are stronger,” the 25-year-old Rio Olympics silver medallist said on Monday. Sindhu said being an ambassador for such a cause is important not just to her but to the sporting fraternity itself. Fair play “I have always believed in playing the sport in a fair way without any manipulation, cheating or resorting to doping,” said Sindhu after a grinding, fitness session at Suchitra Academy here. “This honour is also a huge responsibility and gives us a platform to tell the world about the importance of playing any sport in the true spirit. Any sport has to be clean and devoid of any dubious means, no matter whether you win or lose,” “Being athletes we understand and know the value of sport being played the way it should be,” said Sindhu. It has not come as a surprise to Sindhu’s family, given the reputation she enjoys across the badminton world for her gentle behaviour even under pressure. The enduring image of a 21-year-old Sindhu walking across the court to place Carolina Marin’s Olympic gold medal next to the Spaniard’s bag reflected her sporting spirit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-for-believe-in-sports-campaign/article34475963.ece
04 May 2021||Beijing,||Sun gets Tokyo lifeline||China’s star swimmer Sun Yang, who is fighting to save his career after a doping controversy, has been given new hope of competing at the Olympics after China said the reigning world champion was eligible for Tokyo. The China Swimming Association’s announcement came as the three-time Olympic champion prepares for a new tribunal hearing over his refusal to give a doping sample when testers visited his home in September 2018. Sun, the 1,500m world-record holder, won the 200m and 400m at the 2019 world championships in South Korea. Sun was suspended for the maximum eight years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in February last year.

04 May 2021||DUBAI,||India drops to third in ODI rankings, NZ on top||India retained the second place in the ICC T20I team rankings but dropped a rung to third in the ODI chart following the annual update carried out on Monday. The Kiwis have replaced reigning world champion England as the No. 1-ranked side in the ODI rankings. India is trailing top-ranked England (277) by five rating points in the T20 team rankings. During this period, England drew a three-match series against Pakistan 1-1, defeated Australia 2-1 and South Africa 3-0 before losing an away series to India by a 2-3 margin. New Zealand has also gained in the annual T20I update, moving up from fifth to third after series wins over the West Indies, Pakistan, Australia and Bangladesh. Australia has moved the other way, down from third to fifth. In other movements at the top of the T20I rankings table, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have gained one place each to reach eighth and ninth positions, respectively, while the West Indies have dropped two places to 10th. According to the ICC, these updates eliminate results from 2017-18 and halve the weighting of matches played in 2019-20, which includes the 2019 World Cup. In the annual update of the ODI Team rankings, India dropped a place to third behind Australia and new table-topper New Zealand. New Zealand, which defeated Bangladesh 3-0 in their only ODI series during the past year, has advanced two slots after gaining three rating points to reach an aggregate of 121. Australia is second with 118 points while India and England are both on 115, with the former ahead on decimal points.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-drops-to-third-in-odi-rankings-nz-on-top/article34475925.ece
04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Desika’s pen picture||Bhooma Devi asked for Brahma’s help, because She was overburdened. Brahma, Siva and the celestials approached Lord Narayana, who was reclining on the milky ocean. There Brahma worshipped the Lord by reciting Purushasukta. Purushasukta says that the world owes its very existence to Him. It is His mercy which is responsible for the world and the many life forms in it. The Lord has a certain attribute, which is so strong, that He cannot go against it. He is bound by it. That powerful characteristic of His is His daya, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. To appeal to that quality of daya, Brahma recited the Purushasukta. Srimad Bhagavatam says that the Lord’s response was whispered by Him into Brahma’s ears. But Vedanta Desika, in his Yadavabhyudaya, says that everyone was blessed to have His darshan. And this is most appropriate, for after all, He was going to come as Krishna, and Krishna was most accessible to everyone. He is the Universal parent, father to everyone. And yet, Vasudeva and Nandagopa, were addressed by Him as ‘father.’ This too was one of His wonderful leelas. The Lord on the milky ocean is described by many poets, including Kalidasa. But Kalidasa does not talk about Garuda or Visvaksena. But in Desika’s work, Garuda and Visvaksena are also mentioned. Garuda touches his shoulders, which have carried the Lord many a time, and wonders if there will be much fighting in the avatara the Lord is about to take. Visvaksena, stick in his hand, is engaged in crowd management! The Lord says that if any apsara maiden wants to be born in Gokula, she can do so. If anyone wants to take the form of a cow in Gokula, that too is possible. This too is His leela, for in no other avatara did He give such options to those around Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/desikas-pen-picture/article34475885.ece

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Revving on residue||An old Biochemistry book from their grandfather’s library was the inspiration for Odisha-born sisters Nikita and Nishita Baliarsingh to create an electric vehicle (EV) battery from crop residue. “It is still so clear in my mind. There was a statement that read, ‘Proteins may have potential benefits in electrolytes’. That was the turning point. We pushed ourselves into continuous research and development and founded Nexus Power in April 2019,” recalls Nikita. Rewind to 2016, the EVsector was in its infancy with great potential but skewed demand. Buyers were not convinced of the efficacy of an EV battery over a traditional one. “This gap in the demand and supply forced us to investigate the root cause for the scepticism. Some of the main concerns were long charging time, high prices, and a paucity of local sources to procure lithium, and of course, the toxicity.” According to a report by The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in November 2020, a total of 5,30,560 EVs (two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars, and buses) were sold in India. The Baliarsingh sisters aim to take EVs across vehicle segments. The current market caters mainly to low-speed electric two wheelers that use lithium.  Nikita elaborates, “We spent almost six months only on theoretical research on bio-organic batteries. Our first prototype was built at home during the lockdown with simple household objects.” The biodegradable batteries are fashioned from crop residue. “A cell consists of three structural elements – the cathode, anode and electrolyte. Our process of manufacturing plays with the chemistry of the cell and builds all these elements with nanodot proteins derived from crop residue. Our batteries are lithium ion-free. We procure the crop remains from local farmers, and by applying a unique extraction and filtration process, we manufacture rechargeable energy storing EV cells out of it,” explains Nikita. The materials used at Nexus are derived from natural compounds, which are either underutilised or wasted by other industries. Procurement of crop waste helps the farmers in earning an additional income of Rs. 25,000 for every 100 batteries. The manufacturing process has been designed to ensure no element of the environment is exploited. “We emphasise having a sustainable manufacturing process with a zero-waste model. The production of our batteries creates bio-fertiliser as by-products, which we intend to return to the market to facilitate a favourable agricultural yield. That way we ensure a circular and viable green model,” Nikita adds. Looking to investors While Nexus is built on sharp technology and lofty targets, the company is mostly bootstrapped. The fledgling company has received two fellowship grants of about Rs. 10 lakh from the Indian Government under its TIDE and NIDHI PRAYAS programme and through KIIT TBI (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology- Technology Business Incubator), Bhubaneswar. While the EV sector is ripe for investment, most investors look to the lithium battery market. Nikita is confident, however, that Indian consumers are ready for a “truly green” battery. “The major differentiator for Nexus is that ours is a truly ‘Made in India’, fast-charging battery, which aims to make electric mobility more affordable and efficient.” The batteries charge eight to 10 times faster than conventional ones and last 20% to 30% longer. “Most importantly, once the batteries die, they can be recycled at no extra cost, which is not the case with the regular EV offerings. Made out of bio-degradable material, the cells rule out toxicity hazards and using crop residue ensures that some of it is not burnt, which in turn protects from deterioraton of air quality. Our entire process is energy efficient and sustainable,” says Nishita. The siblings have their eye on the new entrants in EV market. “Given a chance, Nexus would love to collaborate with big offerings such as Tesla and Indian vehicle makers like Tata, Mahindra, Hero and others. We are hopeful of collaborations with multiple two-wheeler EV manufacturers across the Asian region for our pilot programme, scheduled for Q3 or Q4 of 2021. A slightly long-term plan would be to develop Nexus batteries for four-wheelers and commercial e-vehicles. We also want to cater to the mobile phone and consumer electronics industry in the future,” concludes Nikita.  We emphasise having a sustainable manufacturing process which also encompasses a zero- waste model.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A disruptive feedback loop||With Hades sweeping up best games awards this year, it is clear that Roguelikes and Rogue-lites are here to stay. For those not familiar with the Roguelike genre, these games involve blazing through levels while gaining powers at a fast pace. The catch is, if you die, you lose everything and have to restart at the beginning of the level. Rogue-lites take that concept and apply it to different other sub-genres to make it more interesting. Returnal takes Rogue-lite elements and blends it with another sub-genre called ‘bullet hell’, something which Finnish game studio Housemarque is very good at. The setup for Returnal plays out like Tom Cruise's Edge of Tomorrow , and if you watched Love Death + Robots’ episode ‘Beyond the Aquila Rift’, it will strike a chord here. You play an astronaut named Selene who is stuck on the planet Atropos. You relive the moment her spaceship crashed on a loop. There are two characters in the game — Selene and the ever changing Atropos. If you have ever seen the first Alien movie or Prometheus by Ridley Scott, Atropos looks like it has jumped right out of the planet where they discovered the Derelict. Replacing H.R Gieger’s organic art with fairly generic architecture, the mood is still there, as every area is shrouded in a thick mist, with all sorts of creatures. This game is a study in great environmental storytelling. Fight the fight Gameplay-wise, Returnal is a cross between Control, Contra and Hades. Being a bullet hell game, you dodge various patterns of glowing orbs and fireballs shot by various aliens while you pick up various bullet trajectories to kill enemies in fun ways. It is the same here, except the game throws a lot of customisation options to help keep things fresh. On every run you get to equip parasites (creatures that serve up both functions and malfunctions) so it is up to you to gauge the risks. The goal is to blaze through the levels, which are familiar areas arranged differently every time, with certain goals in mind. If you die, you repeat the level from the starting point at your ship with nothing. You can retain some permanent abilities, half the fun is finding that perfect build for each session. Returnal, in this sense, has you literally playing safe even in bullet hell. It may sound frustrating and it sometimes is, especially when you think you are in a good spot and the boss just obliterates you. However, what will keep you returning is the fast and responsive shooting and dodge mechanics. The DualShock 5's adaptive triggers seal the deal here, and after this I cannot go back to a normal controller. Each gun is tactile, and the left trigger has a dual aim-and-fire mode; holding down gives you a tactile click and it switches to a powerful Alt-Fire. A feather touch will go into aim mode, which takes getting used to but always has me coming back. Being a next-gen PlayStation 5 exclusive, Returnal looks gorgeous, playing at an even 60 frames per secondat 4K. The dark levels and bio-luminscent creatures look great, but it is hard to make out fatal falls, leading to some embarrassing deaths. Returnal, making you want a PS5 even more, is a clever mix of genres that blend well. While at times it could be a frustrating endeavour, the rinse-repeat structure does not go stale.

04 May 2021||May 04 2021 00:00 IST,||An affordable all-for-one||The best smartphones these days are not defined by individual features such as a production-standard camera, a television-like screen resolution, a long-haul battery, and disruptive design. The real challenge for mobile phone companies these days is to surprise consumers with relatively low prices for progressive technologies. One such example is the Galaxy A52 from Samsung. The Galaxy A52 is a follow-up from the popular Galaxy A51 series which was a best-seller last year. This recent release resembles the flagship Galaxy S21 but has a sportier design in terms of finish. Our review device was in Awesome Violet and at just 189 grams, it is much lighter than the other Galaxy devices. The 6.5-inch Infinity-O Display for the Galaxy A52 5G has an Eye Comfort Shield that comes with the Galaxy S21 series. This is like the regular blue light filter but it comes with a special algorithm will adjust your screen’s colour depending on various factors, such as how bright it is outside. The Galaxy A52 5G’s 120 frames per second refresh rate with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G together sell home the smooth display, without eating into the 4500mAh battery life. However, do not expect an adaptive refresh rate with this device; it is an ‘either-or’ situation which you have to manually control. This is hardly a compromise, unless you are a smartphone gamer. Photography and videography on the Galaxy A52 is a real treat; one can either go high-res on the 64-megapixel main camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, or macro with the dedicated 5-megapixel ( f 2.4) rear lens. The depth camera is ideal for those portrait or product shots, without too much blur to ruin the integrity of the composition. The ultra-wide lens is ideal for those small spaces, too. The best part is, Galaxy A52 is equipped with SuperSteady, Samsung’s native stabiliser for smooth moving shots while shooting video. Though the Galaxy A52 5G promises and lives up to a lot of its features, there is still some overheating and the occasional lag during heavy-duty activities such as gaming and long video shoots. This smartphone is perfect for the basic everyday user who wants to have a device that does it all and not too much. With its starting price of Rs. 27,999, this is not too bad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-affordable-all-for-one/article34476099.ece
04 May 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder warns of complete lockdown if rules not followed||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday warned people against laxity in adherence to the curbs imposed in the State, and said if the situation did not improve, he would be forced to consider a total lockdown. The Chief Minister said he had so far refrained from ordering a sweeping lockdown in the State because it will hurt the poor the most and would lead to exodus of migrant labourers, plunging industries into chaos again. However, if the people do not stringently comply with the restrictions in place, harsher steps might have to be taken, he added. Captain Amarinder also appealed to the Centre for more oxygen tankers to be made available to the State, which did not have enough tankers to transport the critical commodity for saving lives of seriously ill COVID-19 patients. At a COVID-19 review meeting, he said the State urgently needs more tankers, as it currently has only 15 at its disposal, with two more likely to join the fleet by Tuesday. These, he said, were not enough to handle the requirement for transporting oxygen coming in from other States. Punjab has 195 metric tonnes (MT) allocation from various plants in other States, but the actual supply received over the past 7 days has been around 110-120 MT daily, which has also been erratic, the Chief Minister noted. In this period, the number of patients on oxygen support has gone up from 4,000 to around 9,000, and though the State government’s steps to monitor and streamline supplies through its controls rooms has helped in keeping things stable, the situation remains fluid and a matter of concern, he added.  Increase in demand The current consumption of oxygen in the State is more than 225 MT daily, while the average increase in demand every day is around 15-20%. Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan told the meeting that in addition to the shortage of tankers available with transporters in the State, the fact that a tanker takes around 4-5 days to bring the 90 MT allocated quota from Bokaro plant has made things worse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/amarinder-warns-of-complete-lockdown-if-rules-not-followed/article34476106.ece
04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. opens 301 vaccination sites in 76 schools for 18-44 age group||The Delhi government opened 301 vaccination sites in 76 schools for vaccinating people between 18 and 44 years of age on Monday, said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. These centres have a total capacity of more than 45,000 vaccinations per day. More than 33 lakh doses have been administered since the beginning of the vaccination in Delhi till now and more than 7 lakh beneficiaries have taken both the doses, the government said. “Delhi government has received 4.5 lakh vaccination doses until now, on the basis of which 301 vaccination centres have been made in 76 schools across Delhi, vaccinating 45,100 citizens. We want to ensure that all citizens between the ages of 18-45 are vaccinated. We are committed to scale vaccination centres in Delhi in a way that each school has 10 sites,” Mr. Sisodia said. The Minister said in the next few days, 3,000 vaccination centres will start operating in 300 schools across the city. He added that there is a 100% turnout and hopes that it will continue. ‘250 per centre’ “A total of 250 people have been called per centre for today’s vaccination drive, with 100% turnout. I am confident this turnout will prevail because I believe our youth is looking forward to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I met several people who informed me that while they faced no hindrances in getting vaccinated at the centres, there were challenges with regard to booking appointments. This is so because we only have 4.5 lakh vaccines at the moment with limited centres, but we will resolve these challenges as we continue to expand our centres,” he said. The Minister added that vaccination of all people will certainly help to reduce this spike and defeat the virus. At 3 p.m., officials at a vaccination site in Pandara Road said there was a good response today but some came without booking a slot and had to be turned away. Some people complained that many centres are still inoculating only people above 45 years of age and it was difficult to book a slot. Balkishan, 31, an advocate said, “I have been checking centres in south Delhi and I can’t find a slot for people above 18 in my area. I will check tonight again.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-opens-301-vaccination-sites-in-76-schools-for-18-44-age-group/article34476123.ece
04 May 2021||Noida,||Kids from COVID-affected households get police help||As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc across Gautam Buddha Nagar, affecting thousands of families in some form, a young IPS officer — in charge of women’s safety in Noida — is diverting resources at her disposal to help children from affected households who were left to fend for themselves. Over the last two days, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Women Safety) Vrinda Shukla has sent teams to escort children, whose parents are in home isolation, for COVID tests at district hospitals, provide multiple meals per day and, in an instance even secured the academic future and possible adoption of siblings orphaned by the raging pandemic. 10 children get help As many as 10 children — two siblings each from five affected families — have been aided in one way or another by Ms. Shukla. According to district records, there are currently 7,982 active COVID cases in Gautam Buddha Nagar and 250 people have lost their lives since the beginning of the pandemic last year. “I thought of taking up the programme on my own when I read a press statement being issued by the Noida police regarding a case where we received an emergency call from a crematorium related to the last rites of a COVID-infected couple that had left a child behind,” she said. “The child was too young to go about the funeral. So, a police team was sent to help. I realised there must be so many children who need assistance,” she added. Last week, Ms. Shukla took to social media and requested volunteers to step forward to help provide aid to such families. Following this appeal, she now has a team of 35 such volunteers. They, however, do not have a personal interface with the children they seek to help and any assistance which reaches them is through the police in the presence of officials from the district childline. In her capacity as DCP (Women Safety), Ms. Shukla has ensured that all calls made to the emergency number 112 in the district about such children be relayed to her department so that they can be helped. “In one instance, someone stepped forward to bear the cost of the education of two children who lost their parents to COVID and, possibly, if the requisite formalities are completed as per law, to adopt them. The objective is to assist as many children as possible,” she added. She said in case there are children from such families who need assistance, a call can be made to the emergency number 112. Information about such children can also be shared on the district childline — 9870395200.  ...the child was too young to go about the funeral. So, a police team was sent to help. I realised there must be so many children who need assistance Vrinda Shukla DCP (Women Safety)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kids-from-covid-affected-households-get-police-help/article34476117.ece
04 May 2021||MOHALI,||Punjab faces severe vaccine shortage||While the latest phase of COVID-19 vaccination drive for people above 18 years is yet to kick-start in Punjab, the vaccine shortage has now started to hit even the ongoing vaccination for people above the age of 45. At Mohali’s civil hospital several people on Monday returned without vaccination in absence of doses. The staff present at the COVID-19 vaccination centre was seen by the correspondent informing the people that vaccines doses were not available, and they should come later to enquire about the availability of vaccination. 50-year-old Rethi Madathil, told The Hindu , “I have come to the civil hospital (Mohali) to enquire about getting vaccinated after a private hospital cancelled my appointment of vaccination on the pretext that their stock of vaccine has finished. But here also the staff has informed that right now there no vaccine available. The doses may come in sometime but not sure about the time.” “I will leave for my home now because waiting here in the crowd means exposing oneself to the virus,” she said.  No second dose Brij Mohan, 59, a retired lecturer said he had come for second dose of the vaccine, but the vaccination could not be done as there was no vaccine available. “I got my first dose of Covishield vaccine on March 3, and today I came for the second dose. I have been told that there’s no vaccine available and also there’s no clarity on when the vaccine will be available,” he said. Another person, who did not wish to disclose his name, demanded a mechanism to be evolved about disseminating information about stock availability and confirmed date for vaccination. “If there’s no stock, the government should publicise it so that we come to know and can be saved from the unnecessary hassle,” said the person. With the State is getting an allocation of only 3.3 lakh vaccines for the 18-plus category from the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the month of May, Punjab government has ordered 70% of the doses to be reserved for individuals with co-morbidities, and the remaining 30% to high-risk category of employees and workers in this age group. Within these groups, district-wise allocation has also been prioritised based on population index, mortality and density. Given the severe supply constraints, the government has decided to limit the vaccination for 18-44 age group in this phase to major urban centres. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh chaired a high-level virtual review meeting and expressed concern over the fact that even for the 45-plus age group, the State was in short supply, as a result of which only a few vaccine centres were currently functioning. Punjab expects 2 lakh doses to arrive on May 4 for vaccination of 45-plus category. Of the 33,46,500 Covishield doses received so far, a total of 32,91,450 have already been utilised.  Limited supply Punjab has placed an immediate order of 30 lakh doses with Serum Institute of India for 18-44 category but has been informed that the allocation will be 3.3 lakh doses only for the 18-44 age group for the month of May 2021. In Union Territory, Chandigarh, the vaccination for 18-plus is yet to start, however, the ongoing vaccination of 45-plus population is under way. “We would be able to start 18-plus vaccination as soon as we get the vaccines,” Arun Gupta, Principal Secretary (Health) told, The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-faces-severe-vaccine-shortage/article34476107.ece

04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||City gasps for breath as oxygen battle rages on||The struggle to ensure that hospitals have enough oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients continued on Monday with several facilities reaching out to the Delhi government to provide emergency supplies. Smaller hospitals like Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, HAHC Hospital, Irine Hospital, IBS Hospital sent SOS calls on social media with the government rushing either D-type oxygen cylinders from their reserves or ensuing tankers reach as soon as possible. ‘Reserves depleting’ Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha said the government’s oxygen reserves were quickly depleting. “We shall spare no effort to address each and every SOS. But we at the Delhi government are raising an SOS too. Please give us our allocated share of oxygen,” Mr. Chadha said. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that on Sunday, the Capital received 440 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, which was lesser than the allocated quota of 590 MT and much lesser than Delhi's requirement of 976 MT. The Centre on Saturday had raised the city's daily quota to 590 MT from 490 MT, amid an acute shortage of oxygen, which is needed to treat critical COVID-19 patients. He said it was crucial that the government’s demand for 976 MT of oxygen is met due to the increasing number of patients requiring it to survive. He added that only if the oxygen is supplied to the Capital can the number of beds be increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/city-gasps-for-breath-as-oxygen-battle-rages-on/article34476125.ece
04 May 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. launches probe into death of 5 from ‘oxygen supply disruption’||The Meerut administration has launched a probe into the death of five patients in a private hospital after the kin alleged that the deaths occurred due to disruption of oxygen supply. The relatives created ruckus in the hospital premises following which police had to appear on the scene. Ujjwal Gupta said a nurse in the hospital had informed the family that their patient’s oxygen support system had run out of gas and that he was facing difficulty in breathing. “There was nobody to check if the oxygen was over or to refill it,” he told reporters, adding that there was no staff or doctor to explain to them how the patient died or how to take his body for final rites. Chief Medical Officer Meerut Akhilesh Mohan said it is a matter of probe if the deaths took place due to lack of oxygen or other reasons. All the five patients who died on Sunday were co-morbid and seriously unwell, he said. Mr. Mohan said some of the relatives had alleged that the oxygen supply at the Nutema Hospital had been disrupted for a while. The CMO acknowledged that in the present situation, the “supply of oxygen is tight,” and the administration and the government were trying to meet the requirements of all hospitals by providing “some amount” (thoda thoda) to all places. The requirement had increased a lot and the local infrastructure was not ready for it, he told reporters, adding that they were trying to augment the infrastructure, he said. Mr. Mohan also said an “artificial scarcity” was being created as people were carrying cylinders in their cars or storing them in homes. “The oxygen that should be in hospitals is inside people’s homes.” The fresh allegations surface even after the Yogi Adityanath-led government had claimed there was no scarcity of oxygen in any hospital in U.P.

04 May 2021||New Delhi,||Sisodia asks Centre to waive GST on oxygen concentrators for 6 months||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday wrote to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, requesting that GST be waived on oxygen concentrators for six months. These had emerged as “essential life support machines” given the surging COVID cases in the Capital and citizens would benefit if the GST component of their price could be waived, said Mr. Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio. “There is no availability of oxygen concentrators in the market…During this unprecedented health crisis, oxygen concentrators have become essential life support machines. It would be appropriate if the Centre and the GST Council consider exempting GST on oxygen concentrators for a period of six months to make them more affordable for our citizens,” he wrote. “As you are aware, Delhi is in the midst of unprecedented COVID surge, which has stretched the health infrastructure to the maximum level,” he said. He added that on an average, 25,000 new cases were surfacing daily and about 10% of them required some form of hospitalisation, including oxygen support. Number of beds Delhi has 16,272 non-ICU oxygen beds and 4,866 oxygen beds and the government was working on a “war footing” at creating 15,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds, 1,200 ICU beds over next 10 days even as more than 50,000 COVID patients were in home isolation. He expressed gratitude to Ms. Sitharaman for the Centre’s decision for allowing the import of oxygen concentrators for personal use through e-commerce portals till July 32 this year and the reduction of IGST on these from 28% to 12%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sisodia-asks-centre-to-waive-gst-on-oxygen-concentrators-for-6-months/article34476113.ece
04 May 2021||GUWAHATI,||BJP and allies have no Muslim face this time||The treasury bench of the 126-member Assam Assembly will for the first time in at least 50 years have no Muslim representative. The troika of the BJP, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) had the lone Muslim face in Aminul Haque Laskar among their 86 elected representatives in 2016. The BJP dumped the BPF and befriended the United People’s Party Liberal for mandate 2021. Mr. Laskar, who went on to become the Deputy Speaker in the 126-member Assembly, lost the Sonai seat in the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley to Karim Uddin Barbhuiya of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) by a margin of 19,654 votes. The AIUDF was the principal ally of the Congress in the 10-party ‘Mahajot’ or grand alliance that challenged the BJP and its allies this time but could win 50 seats. The BJP-plus won 75 while the jailed Akhil Gogoi, president of the newly-formed Raijor Dal, bagged the Sibsagar seat. Factors behind defeat Religious polarisation of votes and consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of the Congress-AIUDF are said to have been factors behind Mr. Laskar’s defeat. The Opposition bench, on the other hand, will have 31 Muslim MLAs this time, the second-highest after the 33 who were elected in the controversial 1983 elections held during the peak of the Assam agitation. The agitating organisations had boycotted the polls that year, with seven candidates declared winners unopposed and less than 20% of voters turning up in several constituencies. Of the 31 Muslim victors of the Mahajot, 16 were fielded by the Congress and 15 by the AIUDF. The two parties won 29 and 16 seats, both improving upon their 2016 performance by three seats each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-and-allies-have-no-muslim-face-this-time/article34476110.ece
04 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Positive patients overcharged for medical services’||The Delhi Congress on Monday alleged that the people battling COVID-19 were being asked to pay exorbitant rates for services like ambulances, oxygen and hospital beds and the government was failing to crackdown on those profiteering during the pandemic. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar alleged that when people were dying in thousands for lack of timely medical attention, private hospitals were either denying admission to serious patients or charging exorbitant rates for a hospital bed. He added that ambulance service providers were also charging mind-boggling amounts for transporting patients, that to after taking advance payments. “The black marketing of COVID medicines, oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and the exorbitant rates charged by labs for RT-PCR tests were being done and people are cashing in on the misery of the people,” Mr. Kumar said. He added that those who have died due to the virus are not getting proper final rites as at many cremation grounds, dead bodies are stacked on a single platform to give a mass cremation due to the unprecedented rush of the dead bodies and shortage space for individual cremation. ‘Take urgent steps’ He called for urgent steps to be taken to ensure that such profiteering during the pandemic is stopped at the earliest.

Apart from Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, senior government officials were also present at the meeting. The government said the Chief Minister was given detailed information about the facilities being provided to people undergoing treatment at home. During the meeting, Mr. Kejriwal told that those under home isolation should get a call from a team of doctors within 24 hours of being tested positive so that counselling can begin as soon as possible. The government said Mr. Kejriwal has asked to ensure that a “very clear and clean record” be kept of daily COVID reports, including the number of patients needing hospital admission and those under home isolation. Patients under home isolation should also be provided with an oximeter along with a COVID kit, he said. Mr. Kejriwal also instructed the authorities regarding the need to strengthen the home isolation system so that such patients can get good treatment with timely counselling.

04 May 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan scrambles to get tankers to transport oxygen||With only 1% of the cryogenic tankers in the country at its disposal, Rajasthan is trying hard to get the tankers for transporting liquid medical oxygen from the plants situated at places such as Burnpur, Kalinga Nagar and Jamnagar. The State government has initiated action to get the tankers on rent. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said here on Monday that the oxygen consumption in the State was increasing rapidly because of the rising virus infection. Since the Centre was allocating oxygen under the national plan, the quota for Rajasthan should be increased in view of the rising demand, he said. Among the 2,416 cryogenic tankers available in the country, Rajasthan has only 25 at its disposal. While 23 of them are being actively used, the State needs at least 54 more tankers for bringing liquid oxygen from far-off places.  No plan for tankers Though the Centre has formulated a national plan for allocation of oxygen to each State, there is no scheme operative for allotment of tankers for transport of the live-saving gas. During the second wave of pandemic, the Rajasthan government has got four nitrogen transporting tanks converted for oxygen transport through the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation. The State Transport Department has invited applications for getting tankers on rent from different organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-scrambles-to-get-tankers-to-transport-oxygen/article34476108.ece

It also asked the L-G to give permission to civic bodies to increase the number of hospital beds and set up new vaccination centres. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta termed “surprising” that the Delhi government had, so far, set up just 77 vaccination centres for the youth across the 11 districts of the city. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri demanded that the Delhi government open 10 vaccination centres each in all the Assembly segments and it should be ensured the vaccine is made available to all without problem. “All day today there were reports that the Centres started functioning after long delays and in the Laxmi Nagar Assembly area, vaccination centres didn't start at all.
