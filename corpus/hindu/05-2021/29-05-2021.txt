29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. puts off decision on tax relief for COVID-19 supplies||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council failed to agree on immediate tax breaks for critical pandemic relief supplies, including COVID-19 vaccines, and constituted a Group of Ministers to recommend individual items’ tax rates by June 8. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, chairing the Council’s first meeting in nearly eight months on Friday, said there were protracted discussions with ‘varying viewpoints’ on the taxation of COVID-related items and these dominated the over eight hour-parley between the States and the Centre. “So I have decided and announced a Group of Ministers to submit a report within 10 days so that if there are any further reductions that need to be done, will be done,” Ms. Sitharaman said. States’s demand Opposition-ruled States, including West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab, have been demanding that the GST levied on COVID-related items be scrapped. The Minister added that revenue implications were not driving the rate cut reluctance, rather the question of whether GST relief on such items will benefit the common man. Technical panels reviewing the rates have found that there will be a “collateral impact” of rate cuts on other items, she explained. “I underline the fact that it is not as if one segment said we should do it on humanitarian grounds and another said we shouldn't do anything on humanitarian grounds,” the Minister said. While Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that “GST #COVID19 relief put on hold for lack of compassion by the Union Government,” Ms. Sitharaman refused to react directly. “If we are quick to say that the Centre has no compassion, I have nothing to say. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our citizens’ welfare. I humbly submit that the interest of all the States and the Centre is towards making sure that Indians get the vaccine on time and the States get their fair share of revenues in time,” Ms. Sitharaman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-puts-off-decision-on-tax-relief-for-covid-19-supplies/article34672098.ece
29 May 2021||Chennai,||Kolkata’s COVID deaths in 2021 could be 4 times more||If data on certified deaths in Kolkata in 2021 so far are any indication, the number of excess deaths compared to previous years was as high as 4.5 times the official recorded figure of 1,371 COVID-19 related deaths, indicating a much higher toll from COVID-19. Excess deaths were estimated from data on death certification from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation accessed by The Hindu . In April and May 2021 (till May 27) of the second wave alone, excess deaths were as high as 6.87 times the officially recorded figure of 1,198 deaths. During this period when the second wave raged in Kolkata, there were 8,234 “excess deaths” compared to 1,198 reported COVID19 deaths. These “excess deaths” were calculated as the difference between the 17,587 certified deaths in April and May 2021 and the average number of certified deaths in the same period in the pre-pandemic years between 2015-2019 (9,353). It is to be noted that the excess deaths could also include deaths due to other causes because of the inability or the lack of access to health services, which were diverted to cater to the pandemic. But the bulk of excess deaths in a pandemic peak should largely be COVID-19 related deaths. The lower multiple of 4.5 for January-May 2021 as opposed to April-May 2021 was because of a low number of certified deaths in March 2021 — 4,384 compared to the pre-pandemic years’ (2015-2019) average of 5,520. This could also be because of lower certification numbers as deaths during recent months are certified with a lag — a pattern that holds true for April and May as well. Thus, 2021’s excess deaths could increase further as more data is available.

29 May 2021||PATNA,||Ranchi bridge collapses, parties call for probe||A bridge constructed three years ago over River Kanchi in Tamar area of Ranchi collapsed due to heavy rain after cyclone Yaas hit Jharkhand on May 27. Political parties have demanded a probe into the collapse. The Haradih-Budhadih bridge, connecting Tamar, Bundu and Sonahatu areas of Ranchi district, was constructed after spending crores of rupees during the previous NDA regime in the State. However, the linking roads of the bridge were yet to be completed and the bridge was not even formally inaugurated. State Congress leader Keshav Mahto Kamlesh demanded a high-level probe. He urged Chief Minister Hemant Soren to blacklist the company that constructed the bridge and take action against the engineers. State BJP leader Vinay Mahato Dheeraj also called for an investigation. As the bridge has collapsed, the people of the area would have to travel long distances to go to Sonahatu, Silli and Rahe areas across the river. Meanwhile, two people died and nearly 8 lakh were affected by cyclone Yaas in Jharkhand. At least 5,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas near several rivers in East Singhbhum district, while 15,000 were shifted to safer places. “Two persons lost their lives when a house collapsed due to heavy rain in Ranchi, while a bridge in Tamar collapsed”, said State Disaster Management Secretary Amitabh Kaushal. Heavy rains have lashed several areas of Bihar and Jharkhand from May 27 due to the impact of Yaas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ranchi-bridge-collapses-parties-call-for-probe/article34672227.ece
29 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Second wave will derail growth: Khan||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said the second wave of COVID-19 is posing an impediment to the development prospects of the State with high revenue as well as fiscal deficits staring at it. “Despite the constraints, vaccination will be provided free of cost to all. The additional cost to the exchequer will be at least Rs. 1,000 crore,” he said. The Governor listed out the policies of the State government in his address to the first session of the 15th Assembly on Friday. Even though there were over 22 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases till date, the State could contain the related mortality to 6,612 cases. The Governor said that title deeds would be issued to all entitled landless people in five years. Steps would be initiated to recover and protect government land from encroachers. All village offices would be made ‘smart’ and revenue records digitised. A unique ‘thandaper system’ that would give details of property owned by a person would be implemented. All government services would be provided online and it would be inaugurated on October 2. The policy address criticised the conditions enforced by the Centre while raising the annual borrowing limit from 3% to 5% of the GSDP. Expressing disappointment over the address, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the government had failed to come up with health and education plans in the wake of the pandemic. “We also expected a disaster management plan in view of the epidemic and natural disasters,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/second-wave-will-derail-growth-khan/article34672254.ece
29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||BC quota in education, jobs extended for 10 more years||The State government has extended the reservations for backward classes in education and employment, including age concession of five years for recruitment, for a further period of 10 years. The existing reservations for Backward Classes were extended in the undivided Andhra Pradesh in May 2011 for 10 years up to May 31, 2021. The quota was given to a total of 112 castes and later another class ‘orphaned and destitute children’ was included as the 113th community in 2015. In September last year, the government accepted the recommendations of Telangana State Commission for BCs to include 17 new castes in the list of BCs under Groups ‘A’ and ‘D’. This took the total number of communities enjoying BC reservations to 130. Accordingly, reservations for different categories of backward classes — BC-A (7 %), BC-B (10%), BC-C (1%), BC-D (7%) and BC-E (4%) — will continue for 10 more years till May 31, 2031. Reservation in favour of BC E group comprising socially and economically backward Muslims would however be subject to the outcome of civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court, BC Welfare department Principal Secretary B. Venkatesham said in the orders issued on Friday. The reservations for BCs have been extended for different periods from time to time since they were first introduced on the recommendations of a commission headed by K.N. Anantaraman since 1970. This was the fifth extension to be given now. The latest orders followed a communication addressed by the BC Commission informing the government that the existing reservations were set to expire on May 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bc-quota-in-education-jobs-extended-for-10-more-years/article34672551.ece
29 May 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata skips PM’s review meet on Yaas||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday skipped the review meeting on Cyclone Yaas presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kalaikunda airbase in the State, even though she met Mr. Modi at the same venue. The Chief Minister also handed the Prime Minister a report on the disaster caused by the cyclone. “After having review meetings in Hingalganj & Sagar, I met the Hon’ble PM in Kalaikunda & apprised him regarding the post-cyclone situation in West Bengal. The disaster report has been handed over for his perusal. I’ve proceeded now to review the relief & restoration work at Digha,” Ms. Banerjee said on social media. The Chief Minister told mediapersons that she could not participate in the review meeting as she had to attend a meeting on the damage caused in Haldia. “We went to Kaliakunda, Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyophyay accompanied me. We submitted a report and urged the Prime Minister that what he deems fit he should implement on the basis of the report,” Ms. Banerjee told mediapersons later in the day. She said that the State government has sought implementation of two schemes each of Rs. 10,000 crore for Digha development and Sundarbans development. This was the first meeting between Mr. Modi and Ms. Banerjee after the Assembly election. Sources said Ms. Banerjee was upset about BJP leaders, particularly Leader of Opposition and Nandigram MLA, Suvendu Adhikari, being present at the meeting. The developments evoked a strong response from the BJP leadership. Party chief J.P. Nadda said Ms. Banerjee’s absence is “murder of constitutional ethos & the culture of cooperative federalism”. Reacting to the developments, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said it would have served the interests of the State and its people “for CM and officials @MamataOfficial to attend Review Meet by PM”. “Confrontational stance ill serves interests of State or democracy. Non-participation by CM and officials not in sync with constitutionalism or rule of law,” he said on Twitter. Cyclone Yaas swept past the coastal areas of West Bengal and Odisha on May 26, causing widespread damage. Ms. Banerjee had estimated the damage in West Bengal to the tune of Rs. 20,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mamata-skips-pms-review-meet-on-yaas/article34672525.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,||Tamil Nadu extends lockdown till June 7||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday announced the extension of the State-wide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 by another week till 6 a.m. on June 7. But some of the conditions have been relaxed. Grocery shops, which were ordered closed in the current phase of the lockdown, will be allowed to sell essentials on carts or vehicles in their localities between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. with permission from the local bodies. “The provision stores will also be allowed to receive orders online or on the phone and deliver supplies at the customer’s doorstep between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.,” Mr. Stalin said. The Chief Minister instructed the Department of Cooperation and Consumer Protection to distribute a kit of 13 provisions to every rice ration card-holder through the Public Distribution System outlets for June. A senior official told The Hindu that the relaxation would come into effect only from May 31. He said the kit consisting of 13 essential items would be distributed free of cost. “The sale of vegetables and fruits through mobile shops, now being allowed in all districts, will continue,” Mr. Stalin clarified. The decision to extend the lockdown beyond the morning of May 31 was taken to save lives, and was based on a district-wise review of the situation he had undertaken, he said. Mr. Stalin reiterated the need for people to use masks, maintain physical distance at public places, wash hands at regular intervals and use disinfectants and sanitisers. He also insisted that people undertake a COVID-19 test at a nearby hospital soon after they noticed symptoms. A lockdown has been imposed across Tamil Nadu since March last year, with the conditions relaxed depending on the spread of the pandemic. On May 22, the government announced an intense lockdown until 6 a.m. on May 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tamil-nadu-extends-lockdown-till-june-7/article34672170.ece
29 May 2021||Mumbai,||Class X results to be based on Class IX exams, internals||Confirming the cancellation of Class X examinations, Maharashtra’s School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday announced the plan for assessment of students. She also announced an optional common entrance test (CET) for Class XI admissions. According to the assessment plan announced by the minister, each subject will have 100 marks, which will be divided into three categories. “The internal assessment of written assignments of the entire year will have 30 marks. Homework, oral test and practical exam will have 20 marks and subject-wise result of Class IX will have 50 marks. The final result of Class X will be based 50% on the student’s performance in Class IX and 50% in Class X,” said Ms. Gaikwad. She said that students who were not satisfied with the results base on the above method would have the opportunity to appear in the next two consecutive examinations under the grade improvement scheme as and when the pandemic situation normalised. “A seven-member committee will be formed at every school to monitor the result process. The result is planned to be announced by June-end, and therefore all schools must follow the timetable,” she added. A timetable for completing the student assessment process would be announced soon by the Maharashtra State Board Of Secondary And Higher Secondary Education. The seven-member committee will be led by a headmaster to regulate the results, while the records of these results would be verified by officials of the School Education Department at the divisional level, the Minister said, while warning of disciplinary action in case of irregularities or alteration of records at the school level. Students can sit for CET admission to Class XI. “This will be an optional test. This is being done to maintain uniformity among students taking admissions to Class XI since the Class X results will be based on internal assessment,” she said. Ms. Gaikwad said the CET would be based on the Class X syllabusand would be on multiple choice question pattern for the two-hour, 100-mark exam conducted by the optical mark recognition (OMR) method. Those who appeared for the CET would be given preference for junior college admissions based on their score. After the spots for those who had appeared for the CET were filled, those who did not appear for the CET would be considered for admission. The Bombay High Court had questioned the State government on cancelling Class X exams but the State government decided to maintain its earlier stand of not conducting exams during the pandemic. Ms. Gaikwad said the decision to cancel the examn was taken by the Cabinet keeping the health of the students as a priority. “The government has decided to pass all students based on internal assessment. We held over 24 meetings with different stakeholders including experts in education, teachers, principals, elected representatives, parent organisations and tech companies,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/class-x-results-to-be-based-on-class-ix-exams-internals/article34672624.ece
29 May 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi to start ‘unlock’ process from May 31||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the Delhi government will start the ‘unlock’ process in a phased manner from May 31 as the number of daily COVID-19 cases is decreasing. Construction activity and factories will start from the coming week as daily wagers and labourers were the worst affected due to the lockdown, Mr. Kejriwal said in a video message. The city was placed under a six-day lockdown on April 19. As infections and deaths continued to spike and pushed the city’s health infrastructure past its limits, the lockdown was extended several times. “This lockdown is till May 31, 5 a.m. On Friday, a Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting was conducted under the leadership of the Lieutenant-Governor wherein it was decided that we will slowly and steadily begin the process of opening up,” he said. Over the past 24 hours, the city saw around 1,100 cases and the test positivity rate dipped to 1.5%. “With great effort and difficulty, the situation has somewhat come under control, but the battle is not won yet. We should not lose all the gains of the lockdown by suddenly opening up. It is a unanimous belief among experts that the lockdown be opened up slowly,” he said. A balance must be struck between controlling the pandemic and allowing as much economic activity as possible, said the Delhi CM.  Weekly assessment Recognising the ‘dire situation’ of daily wagers and migrant labourers, Mr. Kejriwal said: “Such workers are found mostly in construction activities and factories. So, it was decided that these activities will be opened from Monday for one week.” The unlock process will be assessed weekly based on public feedback, he added. If the government observes that novel coronavirus cases are rising again, then the government will need to halt the unlock procedure, warned Mr. Kejriwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-to-start-unlock-process-from-may-31/article34672521.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||NCB arrests Sushant’s flatmate from Hyderabad||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday arrested Siddharth Pithani, a flatmate of the late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, in Hyderabad for his alleged involvement in the drugs procurement case linked to Sushant’s death. He was produced in a special court in Mumbai which sent him in NCB custody till June 1. He was arrested under sections 8 (prohibition of certain operations), 20 (punishment for contravention in relation to cannabis plant and cannabis) 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or pshyctrophic substance), 28 (punishment for attempts to commit offences), 29 (punishment for abetment and criminal conspiracy), 35 (presumption of culpable mental state) of Narcotics Drugs Pshyctrophic Substances Act. Mr. Pithani was among the four people present at Rajput’s Mumbai residence when his body was found on June 14 last year. In the same case, the NCB had arrested several persons, including the actor’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Sushant’s housekeeping manager Samuel Miranda and staff member Dipesh Sawant, besides drug peddlers. The NCB has instituted the case based on the initial information shared by the Enforcement Directorate on text exchanges among the suspects and its own preliminary findings. Rajput’s death is being probed by the CBI. It took over the case from the Patna police in August last. The police case was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by his father K.K. Singh, alleging criminal conspiracy, wrongful confinement, abetment to suicide, cheating and theft. Last year, the CBI had questioned Mr. Pithani multiple times to determine the sequence of events leading to the incident.

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday asked officials to remain on high alert in view of the rapid rise in new Mucormycosis (black fungus) infections. During a review meeting on Friday, Mr. Jagan said there were 808 black fungus cases so far, and the government had provided 5,200 injections, which were far less than the demand. “We should have at least 40,000 injections. We know that the supply of injections is regulated by the Centre. I urge the Medical and Health Department to look for alternative proposals. In some cases, the infection calls for immediate treatment like injections or tablets,” he said. Mr. Jagan said the Case Positivity Ratio of COVID-19 had shown a decline in the last 10 to 12 days. The CPR, which was 25.56% on May 26, had now decreased to 19.20%. Similarly, active cases reduced to 1.86 lakh against 2.11 lakh on May 18. The recovery rate also increased to 87.99% (May 27) from 84.3% (May 3). The data showed that the number of positive cases were showing a declining trend in many districts. The officials said there were 49,596 beds available in 597 COVID-19 hospitals, of which 32,567 were occupied and 24,985 patients were being treated.

Suresh has requested the Union government to schedule all the competitive examinations in September this year, as the State is hopeful of conducting the qualifying examination (10+2 or Intermediate) during August. In a letter addressed to Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, he said a large number of students from Andhra Pradesh write competitive examinations such as JEE Mains, JEE Advanced, NEET, and ICAR for admission to various professional colleges. “Besides, the State government conducts EAPCET for those who pass 10+2 for admission to engineering, agriculture and pharmacy courses, wherein 25% weightage is given to the qualifying examination score and the remaining 75% for the common entrance test,” Mr. Suresh explained, adding that this mandates the conduct of 10 +2 examination in the State. Mr. Suresh said the State was in favour of conducting the examinations as and when the conditions were conducive. The practical examinations had already been completed in April this year, and arrangements for the conduct of the theory examinations were in place. The plan was to conduct the examinations for the students of first and second (final) year Intermediate on alternate days. According to the time-table worked out, the theory examinations would be completed in 16 days. “In 40 days, the entire process of valuation and announcing the result can be completed,” Mr. Suresh said.

The State would have to wait as another council meeting would be convened to discuss the compensation issue, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said after attending the 43rd GST Council meeting held online on Friday. Mr. Balagopal sought immediate disbursement of the GST compensation arrears and extension of the compensation shortfall payment for five years from 2022 in view of the economic crisis arising due to pandemic-induced lockdown. The State sought exemption of GST on COVID-19 vaccines and essential supplies, instead of back to back loans.

One of the conditions of the bail granted by the Bench of Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices I.P. Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Arjit Banerjee included that the accused persons shall not “give any press interview or make any public comments in connection with the cases pending in this court or in the trial court, pertaining to the alleged offence concerning themselves or any other co-accused”. “The aforesaid accused persons shall make themselves available for interrogation in the course of further investigation, if any, of the alleged offence, as and when required by the CBI.

29 May 2021||New Delhi,||India seeks more studies on virus origin||India on Friday pushed for further studies on the origins of the novel coronavirus, as the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Health Assembly, reviewed the findings of its special team. The 120-page report submitted by the WHO on March 31 had listed various hypotheses as possible origins, including the “lab leak” theory that it said was “extremely unlikely”, but concluded that there was need for further research. Several countries at the Assembly’s ongoing annual meeting from May 24-June 1 have raised the need for further studies, but it is unclear whether the body will pass any resolution on the issue. “The WHO-convened global study on the origins of COVID-19 is an important first step. It stressed the need for the next phase of studies, as also for further data and studies, to reach robust conclusions,” said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. “The follow-up of the WHO report and further studies deserve the understanding and cooperation of all,” he stated, in reference to WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus’ earlier statement that accused China of limiting access to its team to conduct studies. On April 1, the MEA issued a statement on the report, which had listed “four pathways” or possible options that led to the pandemic: a direct zoonotic transmission; the introduction of the virus through another intermediate host or animal; the introduction through the cold chain or food chain; and a laboratory incident. The inquiry conducted over four weeks by a joint WHO-China study team had concluded that the first two theories were “likely to very likely”, the food chain theory “possible” and the lab incident theory “extremely unlikely”. In its statement, India also called for “a comprehensive and expert-led mechanism” to investigate the origin of COVID-19 in cooperation with all stakeholders, and supported the possibility of an additional WHO mission to the Chinese sites to further study the issue. India’s statement comes days after U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra called on the WHO to conduct a second and more transparent investigation into the origins of COVID-19. U.S. President Joseph Biden has also tasked his National Security Advisor and intelligence agencies to redouble efforts to reach a conclusion on the origins of the virus. China, which has consistently denied the theory that there was a leak from the Wuhan lab, where research on zoonotic transmissions of coronaviruses was taking place, criticised Mr. Biden’s statement. Spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhao Lijian accused the U.S. of not caring “about facts and truth...or serious scientific origin tracing,” on Thursday, indicating that China considers the “lab leak” theory report closed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-seeks-more-studies-on-virus-origin/article34672027.ece
29 May 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata skips PM’s review meet on Yaas||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday skipped the review meeting on cyclone ‘Yaas’ presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kalaikunda Air base in the State, even though she met Mr. Modi at the same venue. The Chief Minister also handed the Prime Minister a report on the disaster caused by the cyclone. “After having review meetings in Hingalganj & Sagar, I met the Hon’ble PM in Kalaikunda & apprised him regarding the post-cyclone situation in WB. The disaster report has been handed over for his perusal. I’ve proceeded now to review the relief & restoration work at Digha,” Ms. Banerjee said on social media. The Chief Minister told mediapersons that she could not participate in the review meeting as she had to attend a meeting on the damage caused in Haldia. “We went to Kaliakunda, Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyophyay accompanied me. We submitted a report and urged the Prime Minister that what he deems fit he should implement on the basis of the report,” Ms. Banerjee told mediapersons later in the day. She said that the State government has sought implementation of two schemes each of Rs. 10,000 crore for Digha development and Sunderban development. “I told him that since he wanted to meet me, I have come from so far and gave him the report. But I have a meeting scheduled in Digha and have to go there,” Ms Banerjee said.This was the first meeting between Mr. Modi and Ms. Banerjee after the Assembly election. Sources said Ms. Banerjee was upset about BJP leaders, particularly Leader of Opposition and Nandigram MLA, Suvendu Adhikari, being present at the meeting. The developments evoked a strong response from the BJP leadership. Party president J.P. Nadda said Ms. Banerjee’s absence is “murder of constitutional ethos & the culture of cooperative federalism”. Reacting to the developments, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said it would have served the interests of the State and its people “for CM and officials @MamataOfficial to attend Review Meet by PM”. “Confrontational stance ill serves interests of State or democracy. Non-participation by CM and officials not in sync with constitutionalism or rule of law,” he said on Twitter. Cyclone Yaas lashed the coastal areas of West Bengal and Odisha on May 26 causing widespread damage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-skips-pms-review-meet-on-yaas/article34672030.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||No rift over Lakshadweep ‘development’ push: BJP||The BJP’s in-charge for Lakshadweep and party vice-president A.P. Abdullakutty on Friday said the changes being pushed by the Union Territory’s Administrator, Praful K. Patel, were for the “development” of the islands as a tourist hub, and that reports of a split in the local BJP over the issue were exaggerated. “There is no split. There are some who are pushing the agenda of some mainlanders whereas the local leaders of the party are united,” he said. The BJP has been facing internal backlash after Mr. Patel proposed a series of actions which he claimed were for the development of the islands but which have been opposed by local representatives as doing lasting damage to ecologically sensitive archipelago. The changes include the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation which the Opposition says has undermined the role of the gram panchayats, and the cutting of links with Beypore port, a historic and cultural link,and shifting traffic to Mangaluru port. “The Opposition is unable to see that these changes are important for the development of the islands; it has great potential as a tourist spot and needs development to attract business. It is only after Narendra Modiji’s government came to power that investment is being done on things like optic fibre networks in the region,” he said. On the question of why beef, an integral part of cuisine in the area, was being banned and sale of alcohol being allowed when it was previously not, Mr. Kutty said the changes were “just a proposal”. “The matter is just a proposal and is open for comments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-rift-over-lakshadweep-development-push-bjp/article34672010.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Corporate mindset’ driving administrator’s action: MP||Lakshadweep MP P.P. Mohammad Faizal has said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former Union Minister Sharad Pawar has sought Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s time to urge him to recall the Union Territory (UT) administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, and if that fails, he will approach the court to put an end to Mr. Patel’s plans for the islands. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Faizal said Mr. Patel’s actions were driven by a “corporate mindset” that had also harmed the UTs of Daman and Diu. “His [administrator’s] actions reveal more of a corporate mindset than communal, an attitude that is autocratic and dictatorial too. In Daman and Diu too, we saw his autocratic and dictatorial behaviour in how traditional shelters of fishermen were destroyed and his actions as administrator there,” he stated. Mr. Patel was the Administrator of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli after the two UTs were merged. “The plans put forward by the administrator are in direct contravention of the Supreme Court and the findings of the Ravindran Committee that specifically said that all development projects relating to the islands have to be discussed and take into account the view of the gram panchayats. The Lakshadweep Development Authority and the powers vested in it are just being used to push for land grabbing,” he alleged. ‘Fragile ecology’ “Not only are the islands designated Scheduled Tribe lands where buying of land by outsiders is prohibited, they also come under government protection, but if you look at the islands, some of which are just over 3.2 sq. km. with a width of possibly 15m, what kind of highway or roads building are you talking about. These are plans that will disrupt the fragile ecology of the area and people are justifiably upset,” he said. “If we don’t get relief from the Central government in the withdrawal of these plans or recall of the administrator, we will approach the judiciary,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/corporate-mindset-driving-administrators-action-mp/article34672011.ece
29 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Yaas: PM announces Rs. 1,000 cr. aid for 3 States||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a Rs. 1000 crore assistance for cyclone ‘Yaas’-hit Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand. While Rs. 500 crore would be immediately given to Odisha, Rs. 500 crore was announced for West Bengal and Jharkhand, which would be released on the basis of the damage, said the Prime Minister’s Office in a statement. The Centre would send an inter-ministerial team to visit the States to assess the extent of damage. Soon after attending a review meeting with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Mr. Modi undertook an aerial survey of Bhadrak and Balasore districts battered by ‘Yaas’, en route to West Bengal. Appreciating the preparedness and disaster management activities by Odisha, which resulted in minimal loss of lives, he, according to the statement, noted that the State embarked on long-term mitigation efforts to deal with such natural disasters. Mr. Modi announced ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to the seriously injured in the cyclone. Earlier, after meeting with Mr. Modi,Mr. Patnaik said Odisha did not want to burden the Centre at the peak of the second wave of COVID-19 by demanding immediate financial assistance. He instead called for provisioning of assistance for long-term mitigation measures. “As the country is at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, we would like to manage it through our own resources to tide over the crisis,” said Mr. Patnaik. In a series of tweets, he thanked the Prime Minister for visiting the State. He said, “I have sought assistance for long-term measures to make Odisha disaster resilient as we are frequented by such climate hazards every year and highlighted State’s demand for disaster resilient power infrastructure and resilient coastal protection with storm surge resilient embankments.” On May 1, the Centre had released Rs. 641.6 crore in advance as the first instalment of the Central share of the State Disaster Response Fund. After the review meeting, Pradeep Kumar Jena, Special Relief Commissioner, elaborated that disaster resilient power system meant adoption of better technology and design preferably going in for underground power supply and strengthening of the power infrastructure. Governor Ganeshi Lal, CM Naveen Patnaik, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan and Minister of State of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Pratap Chandra Sarangi were present at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yaas-pm-announces-rs-1000-cr-aid-for-3-states/article34672233.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Children with comorbidities are at higher risk for disease’||Children with comorbidities or on immunosuppressants are at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 complications, said Dr. Narendra Kumar Arora , paediatric gastroenterologist and a senior member of the National COVID-19 Task Force. He warned that there are cases of Long COVID in children as well, in which a patient can develop a new disease such as diabetes or hypertension even after three to six months of recovery.  Recently, many States have reported an increase in the number of children testing positive for COVID. Do you think more children are being infected in the second wave? Children are as susceptible to COVID infection as adults and according to our latest national sero-survey, 25% of children surveyed were found to be affected. Even children below 10 years were found to be as infected as other age groups. National data on the disease tells us that around 3-4% of children were symptomatic during the first wave of COVID-19 and this percentage remains the same during the second wave. However, since the total number of cases has gone up, it has affected more children this time. Are more children developing severe infection during the second wave? A vast majority of children either remain asymptomatic or develop a mild disease. In a household, if several adults are diagnosed with COVID infection, there is a high possibility that the children will also be infected. Fortunately, in most such cases, the children, particularly those below 10 years old, are usually asymptomatic or have mild, common cold-like symptoms, or diarrhoea. However, children with congenital heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or those suffering from childhood cancers, or on immunosuppressants are at a higher risk of developing severe disease. Parents should watch COVID sick children closely. Many of the serious complications in children occur in or after the second week of acquiring the infection. Overall, there is no evidence that children are especially susceptible but due to a larger number of persons getting infected, the absolute number of affected children has also increased. How is the treatment for children different from that for adults? We don’t recommend any medicine for asymptomatic children. In mild cases, we prescribe simple paracetamol to manage fever and other mild symptoms. Similarly, diarrhoea is managed with oral rehydration fluids and plenty of fluid. In moderate to severe cases, the treatment is the same as that for adults. Parents must immediately consult a doctor if they observe respiratory distress, increased respiratory rate, severe cough that is interfering with feeding, hypoxia, uncontrolled fever, or any other unusual symptoms like skin rash or excessive sleepiness in children. Also it is very vital to know that there are cases of Long COVID-19 in children as well, in which a patient develops a new disease such as diabetes, hypertension even after three to six months of recovery. The parents should be in touch with their doctor for follow-up of children who have recovered from acute COVID illness. What precautions should the parents or caregivers take to protect themselves from catching the infection from children? Firstly, each member of the family should get tested for COVID-19. The caregiver should wear full protection gear — double masks, face shield, gloves — while caring for the child. Care should be provided under the guidance and supervision of a doctor. The caregiver and the child should isolate themselves from the rest of the family. We have also seen cases of new mothers contracting the disease. In such cases, how should she protect her child from getting the infection? In such cases any person who is not COVID positive should care for the child. However, a lactating mother should extract her milk and feed the child. If there is no one else to take care of the child, the mother should wear a double mask and face shield, wash her hands and sanitise her surroundings regularly. Mother’s milk is important for the child’s proper growth and development. The milk of an infected mother has antibodies against coronavirus. Adults are advised to follow COVID-appropriate Behaviour to keep them protected from catching COVID-19 infection. How can we protect the children? Well, older kids can follow COVID-appropriate Behaviour to protect themselves. We do not recommend masks for children below 2 years. In fact, we have observed it is difficult to make children between two to five years wear masks. So, it is advisable to keep them indoors. But don’t forget to engage them in play and physical activities as the first five years are crucial for a child’s mental and physical development. Every family member who is above 18 years of age should get vaccinated. If adults are protected, our children will also remain protected. Vaccines have been found safe for lactating mothers. So, they too should take the vaccine.  Everyone above 18 should get vaccinated. If adults are protected, our children will also remain protected||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/children-with-comorbidities-are-at-higher-risk-for-disease/article34672021.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi responsible for second wave of COVID-19, says Rahul||Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being responsible for the second wave of COVID-19, and warned of multiple such waves if the Union government didn’t evolve an effective vaccination policy. Mr. Gandhi, who was addressing a virtual press conference, alleged that the COVID-19 mortality figures put out by the Centre were “big lies”. Though Mr. Modi was worried about his image, “it is gone; it’s dead”. In the war against the pandemic, the country needed a strategy and vaccination was the only permanent solution. Lockdown was a temporary solution but it brought pain and benefits in equal measure, he said. The Prime Minister and his government have not yet “understood that corona isn’t just a disease but an evolving disease that gets more dangerous if it is given time and space to spread”, he stated. Mr. Gandhi also accused the government of shutting down the feedback and information system. The pressure against social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook should be viewed in that context, he observed. “Mr. Modi is responsible for the second wave of COVID-19; it’s a result of his ‘nautanki’ [theatrics] and lack of his responsibility. It’s time for him to be a leader, display leadership skills and show courage and not come out with excuses and blame others,” he said. “The problem is there is no strategy. The Prime Minister doesn’t think strategically. He is an event manager. He thinks one event at a time. You don’t need events now as events will kill people, you need a strategy. The aim of the strategy should be to shut the space for corona,” he noted. With only 3% of India’s population fully vaccinated and 97% potentially exposed to the virus, the situation was alarming not just to the country but a ‘liability’ to the entire planet, Mr. Gandhi said. As the virus mutated very fast, there could come a time when even vaccines may not be as effective as they were now. If 50-60% India’s population was vaccinated, then the threat of a third wave would greatly subside and there certainly won’t be a fourth or fifth wave, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-responsible-for-second-wave-of-covid-19-says-rahul/article34672024.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Scope of Section 304-B in dowry deaths widened by SC||The Supreme Court indicated in a judgment on Friday that a straitjacket and literal interpretation of a penal provision on dowry death may have blunted the battle against the “long-standing social evil”. Dowry deaths accounted for 40% to 50% homicides in the country for almost a decade from 1999 to 2018. The judgment pronounced by a Bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, called dowry harassment a “pestiferous” crime where women are subjected to cruelty by “covetous” husbands and in-laws. In 2019 alone, 7,115 cases of dowry death were registered under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code. But the language used in Section 304-B has always flummoxed courts. Courts have often opted for a strict and narrow reading of the provision, which was one of the many legal initiatives introduced against dowry. Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, who authored the judgment, said courts should instead interpret Section 304-B liberally while keeping in mind the law’s intention to punish dowry and bride-burning. According to Section 304-B, to make out a case of dowry death, a woman should have died of burns or other bodily injuries or “otherwise than under normal circumstances” within seven years of her marriage. She should have suffered cruelty or harassment from her husband or in-laws “soon before her death” in connection with demand for dowry. Absurd interpretation Over the years, courts had interpreted the phrase 'soon before' in Section 304-B as 'immediately before'. This interpretation would make it necessary for a woman to have been harassed moments before she died. Such “absurd” interpretations should be avoided, the apex court noted in the judgment on Friday. Instead, Chief Justice Ramana said the prosecution needed to show only a “proximate and live link” between the harassment and her death. “It is safe to deduce that when the legislature used the words ‘soon before’ they did not mean ‘immediately before’. Rather, they left its determination in the hands of the courts. The factum of cruelty or harassment differs from case to case. Even the spectrum of cruelty is quite varied, as it can range from physical, verbal or even emotional… No straitjacket formulae can therefore be laid down by this court to define what exact the phrase ‘soon before’ entails,” Chief Justice Ramana explained. The court further said the phrase “otherwise than under normal circumstances” in the Section also calls for a liberal interpretation. “Section 304-B, IPC does not take a pigeonhole approach in categorising death as homicidal or suicidal or accidental. The reason for such non-categorisation is due to the fact that death occurring in ‘other than under normal circumstances’ can, in cases, be homicidal or suicidal or accidental,” Chief Justice Raman noted. The judgment also raised concern about the casual way in which trial courts examined accused persons in dowry death cases under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The examination of the accused about the incriminatory material against him should be done in a fair manner. The court must put incriminating circumstances before the accused and seek his response. He should be given sufficient opportunity to give his side of the story. The court should question the accused fairly, with care and caution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scope-of-section-304-b-in-dowry-deaths-widened-by-sc/article34672008.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Javadekar hits back at ‘toolkit politics’||Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday decried the language used by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also cited the recent remarks by the Union Health Ministry that 108 crore peope would be fully vaccinated by December to rebut Mr. Gandhi’s criticism of the alleged slow pace of the inoculation programme. “The kind of language used by Rahul Gandhi and his attempts to stoke fear have confirmed that the toolkit to do so was prepared by the Congress,” said Mr. Javadekar. Word choice “Mr. Gandhi’s choice of words like “nautanki” for the Prime Minister at a time when Mr. Modi is working to curb COVID-19 is a part of the toolkit,” he alleged. “It has been confirmed, and there is no need for any evidence. It is clear that the toolkit was produced by you. The kind of language you used and the way you tried to stoke confusion and fear among people is part of that politics,” he stated. The Congress has registered an FIR against the BJP for alleging that a document by its research department was a toolkit to undermine Mr. Modi. The Congress insists the document was morphed. “The [Heath] Ministry has given a road map of producing 216 crore doses by December and how 108 crore people will be vaccinated,” Mr. Javadekar said. With over 20 crore doses being administered so far, India was the second in the world and the vaccination was set to see a big jump from August, he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/javadekar-hits-back-at-toolkit-politics/article34672019.ece
29 May 2021||New Delhi,||Centre tells West Bengal Chief Secretary to report to Delhi||Just hours after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee skipped a review meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the appointments committee of the Union Cabinet attached the State’s Chief Secretary to the Centre. The committee is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In an unprecedented order on Friday evening, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) invoked Rule 6(I) of the Indian Administrative Service (cadre) Rules, 1954 to place the services of West Bengal Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay with the Government of India. Rule 6(I) states that “provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central Government and the State Government shall give effect to the decision of the Central Government.” The order asked the State government to relieve the officer with “immediate effect” and directed him to report to DoPT office at North Block in Delhi by 10 a.m. on May 31. Due to retire Mr. Bandyopadhyay who was to retire on May 31 was given three-month extension by the State government. Earlier in December 2020, the Home Ministry had attached three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of West Bengal cadre but the State government did not relieve them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-tells-west-bengal-chief-secretary-to-report-to-delhi/article34672042.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Special GST meet on States’ compensation||A special session of the Council will be held to discuss with the States how long the Compensation Cess levied under the GST regime needs to be extended beyond its current sunset date of July 2022, Ms. Sitharaman said. For this year’s estimated shortfall in compensation cess collections to meet States’ dues, the Centre will raise Rs. 1.58 lakh crore to recompense States via back-to-back loans, like it was done last year. The same formula adapted last year will be used this year. A rough estimate is that the Centre will have to borrow Rs. 1.58 lakh crore and lend it to States on a back-to-back basis. Though the Council did not agree to the demand from Opposition States for a waiver on GST for COVID vaccines and other supplies to tackle the pandemic, it did agree to extend the GST exemption granted on relief material received free from abroad for donations to State-approved entities, to those who want to make such donations by purchasing the material from overseas. The period for availing this exemption has also been extended to August 31. “With the rising cases of Black Fungus, a particular medicine required for it — amphotericin-B — has also been included in the exemption list (for tax-free imports),” Ms. Sitharaman said. On the Delhi High Court setting aside the 12% GST levy on imports of oxygen concentrators for personal use, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said the order has led to a situation where GST levies will be zero if the item is received as a ‘gift’, but 28% if purchased from abroad. “The HC has ordered that if it is received as a gift, there will be no tax. While the notification has been set aside that was issued by us, which has resulted that if you buy from outside and bring it yourself, you are taxed at 28% which had actually been brought down to 12%. So inadvertently, what has happened is that because of this confusion, that tax has become 28%. But that will be taken care of by the GoM,” he said. Industry was broadly disappointed with the outcomes. “There were no major announcements and the issue of GST reduction on COVID items has been deferred by a few more days which is disappointing. The Council has failed to address major pain points of the industry and the common man resulting from the pandemic,” said Rajat Bose, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/special-gst-meet-on-states-compensation/article34672044.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,||India sees 1.69 lakh new COVID-19 cases||India recorded 1,69,064 new COVID-19 cases and 3,514 new deaths till 9.30 p.m. on Friday. The country has so far reported a total of 2,77,23,309 cases and 3,22,438 deaths. Tamil Nadu reported 31,079 new infections, followed by Karnataka (22,823) and Kerala (22,318). Maharashtra recorded 973 new casualties on the day, followed by Tamil Nadu (486) and Karnataka (401). Maharashtra’s fatalities include backlog deaths that were missed in the previous reports. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Ladakh. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. Around 20.71 lakh samples were tested in the country on Thursday (the results for which were made available on Friday), which is around 87,000 fewer tests than those conducted on Wednesday. India’s average daily test positivity rate (positive cases identified for every 100 tests) continues to decline. It was 10.4% on May 27, compared to the 15.4% recorded a week before. Vaccination numbers Over 29.2 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Friday, which is 10 lakh doses more than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. It is also 14.37 lakh more doses than what was recorded during the same period a week ago. This is the first instance in over two weeks when daily vaccinations have crossed the 25 lakh-mark. Until May 28, about 17.3% of India’s adult population, 37.5% of the 45-plus population and 42.6% of those aged above 60 years, had been vaccinated with at least one dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-sees-169-lakh-new-covid-19-cases/article34672039.ece
29 May 2021||New Delhi,||Board exam decision may come by June 1: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday orally advised a petitioner, who wanted the CBSE/ICSE Board exams to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 health crisis, to remain optimistic, while saying that the government may resolve the issue by June 1. A Special Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari adjourned the hearing of the case to May 31 on learning that the advance copies of the petition were not sent to them. The court said the CBSE, the ICSE and the Centre should be represented in the hearing. “Maybe by Monday there will be some resolution… Be optimistic. We will hear the matter on Monday,” the court told the petitioner. The government is expected to announce its final decision about the CBSE Class XII exams on June 1. The petition filed by advocate Mamta Sharma urged the court to direct the authorities to forego the exam and conceive an objective methodology to declare the Class XII results within a specific time-frame. “Issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to cancel the examination of Class XII and devise an objective methodology to declare the result within a specific time-frame,” Ms. Sharma has urged. Ms. Sharma said the CBSE and ICSE notifications deferring the exams to an unspecified date should be quashed. It said students cannot be made to suffer due to uncertainty in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the top court had asked the Boards to determine and declare Class XII exam results on the basis of their earlier grading. The petitioner said the same methodology could be used this year too. Ms. Sharma said the Boards have already cancelled the Class X exams. The same should be done for Class XII students. “As far as the innocent students of XII are concerned, a step-motherly, arbitrary, inhuman direction has been issued to postpone their final examination for an unspecified duration,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/board-exam-decision-may-come-by-june-1-sc/article34672026.ece
29 May 2021||NAMAKKAL,||Freedom fighter T.M. Kalliannan passes away||T.M. Kalliannan Gounder, the last surviving member of the Indian Constituent Assembly, died at the age of 101 at Thiruchengode in western Tamil Nadu on Friday. Mr. Gounder was born on January 10, 1921, at Akaraipatti village in Namakkal. He joined the Indian National Congress at the age of 19 and participated in the Quit India movement. He was elected to the Indian Constituent Assembly while he was 28-years-old. He was reportedly the youngest member in the Constituent Assembly then and also a member of India’s first provisional parliament. Mr. Gounder served as a Member of Legislative Council in Tamil Nadu and also as an MLA thrice, between 1952 and 1967, his family members said. A Gandhian, the freedom fighter had worked with stalwarts such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj. He served as president of the Salem District Zilla Board and was instrumental in setting up about 2,000 schools in the composite Salem district. He was also instrumental in the construction of the Ghat road to the Kolli Hills, several irrigation projects and various other development activities in unified Salem district including Salem, Namakkal, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri. ‘Huge loss’ Tiruchengode legislator and Kongunadu Desiya Makkal Katchi leader E.R. Eswaran condoled Mr. Gounder’s death and said his demise is a huge loss to Tamil Nadu. He added that Mr. Gounder brought light into the lives of poor children by opening several schools in unified Salem district. Minister for Tourism M. Mathiventhan, Namakkal MP A.K.P. Chinraj, and Congress leader Mohan Kumaramangalam also condoled his death.  Mr. Gounder’s mortal remains were cremated with full State honours at Sengodampalayam. Minister for Tourism M.Mathiventhan and other paid their last respects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/freedom-fighter-tm-kalliannan-passes-away/article34672006.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Covaxin output cycle may hit Centre’s deadline||According to a statement from the Department of Biotechnology on April 15, Bharat Biotech is to scale up production to 6-7 crore doses a month from July-August and 10 crore doses, a month from September. This works out to at least 52 crore doses from July-Dec, of which 40 crore is marked out from September-December. However, from what Bharat Biotech has stated about the time lag between production and supply, it appears this tranche may have to be excluded for this calendar year. The Centre has administered 2.1 crore doses as of Friday and, including doses of Covaxin in the pipeline, has got 3.1 crore doses from Bharat Biotech since the vaccine drive began in January. It had got a committment for another 1 crore by June end, the Health Ministry said on Friday. The government has placed an order for 7.5 crore doses so far of Covaxin, according to a response from the Health Ministry to a Right To Information request from activist Kanhaiya Kumar on Friday. If the requirement of about 4 crore is fulfilled by June, that still leaves a gap of about 3.5 crore doses. Thus if the expanded production of July-August (12 crore) numbers (to be available in November and December) are clubbed, that works out to 15.5 crore being available for the year, which is about 30% of Dr Paul’s estimate. “The manufacturing, testing, release and distribution of vaccines is a complex and multifactorial process with hundreds of steps, requiring a diverse pool of human resources. Production scale-up of vaccines is a step-by-step process, involving several regulatory SOPs of GMP (Standard Operating Procedures of Good Manufacturing Practices). There is a four-month lag time for COVAXIN to translate into actual vaccination,” the company said. All vaccines supplied in India are to be submitted for testing and release to the Central Drugs Laboratory, Government of India. It takes two days for vaccine supplies to reach the depots of the State and Central governments from Bharat Biotech’s facilities and from there, they are further distributed by the State governments to various districts. This requires additional number of days. From here on, vaccines are administered at the designated vaccination centres. Secretary, Department of Biotechnology Renu Swarup said while it could take nearly four months for a batch of vaccine to be prepared, the government prepared its estimate based on what the manufacturer had committed to supply. “Vaccine manufacturing is time consuming and complex. But if, as Dr. Paul has said, a certain number of doses would be available in a particular month, it accounts for the time taken to produce it,” she told . “However we have to be optimistic about production and musn’t forget that these are companies with long experience in vaccine production.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-output-cycle-may-hit-centres-deadline/article34672007.ece
29 May 2021||Kolkata,||Narada case listing: HC judge raises objection||Expressing objections to the manner in which the transfer plea of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Narada case was listed before the Division Bench as a writ petition, a sitting judge of the Calcutta High Court has written a letter to acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and other judges of the High Court lamenting that “our conduct is unbecoming of the majesty the High Court commands”. In a letter dated May 24, Justice Arindam Sinha said, “Our conduct is unbecoming of the majesty the High Court commands. We have been reduced to a mockery. As such I am requesting all of us to salvage the situation by taking such steps, including convening a full court, if necessary, for the purpose of re-affirming sanctity of our rules and our unwritten code of conduct”. The communication said that the Appellate Side Rules of the High Court, which govern the procedure of listing in such matters, require that a motion seeking transfer either on the civil or the criminal side, had to be heard by a single judge. “However, the first Division Bench took up the matter treating it to be a writ petition. The application, if the communication made on 17th May, 2021 can be considered as one, is by investigating agency/ prosecution against the accused person. It could not and was not treated as Public Interest Litigation. Even a writ petition under Article 228 of the Constitution should have gone to the single judge having determination,” the letter said.  In the two-page letter, the judge also questioned the manner in which the Division Bench stayed the bail granted by the special court to the accused on May 17. “Whether the High Court, exercising power in the matter of transfer of a criminal case at this stage, on its own initiative could have passed the order of stay is the second question,” the judge said. The judge also expressed reservation to the reference of the matter to a Bench of five judges after the judges on the Division Bench disagreed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/narada-case-listing-hc-judge-raises-objection/article34672013.ece

Justice Rao said the actual number of children abandoned or orphaned may be much more than what has been cited in official and news reports. Ms. Bhati and advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi, for the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, said the Commission had an online portal ‘Bal Swaraj’ wherein district authorities could individually upload the figures of orphans and children in need of care and protection within their respective jurisdictions. District authorities have already been given the password to operate the portal. The court directed the district authorities in every State to upload the details of children who were orphaned and in a position requiring care and protection after March 2020, the month when the pandemic began in India. The court asked the States to separately provide the facts and figures of such children by Sunday evening. The court scheduled a hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/help-children-orphaned-by-covid-19-orders-sc/article34672014.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Kolkata’s COVID deaths could be 4 times more||In 2020, the total reported deaths due to COVID-19 (from April to December) in Kolkata was 2,950. But there were 7,002 “excess” deaths — the difference between the certified deaths registered in the same months for 2020 and the average for the previous five years (2015-2019). This suggests that COVID-19 deaths could have been undercounted by a factor of 2.37 for 2020, much less than the undercount factor in the second wave. The numbers in Kolkata for the first and second wave follow similar patterns of undercounting in other metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Chennai and States like Gujarat, which were revealed recently (see Aashish Gupta et al, The Hindu , May 25; Rukmini S, The Hindu , May 26). But the estimated undercount factor of nearly seven in Kolkata in the second wave is lower only than in Gujarat (with an undercount factor of more than 10). That Kolkata is affected more than other metros indicates the severity of the COVID-19 wave in the city in last two months. This could be the result of elections conducted over eight phases in West Bengal, which registered a sharp spike in cases and deaths during the second wave. Manas Gumta, general secretary, Association for Health Service Doctors said the organisation has been pointing out that the numbers of infections and deaths both are under-reported. “The actual deaths will be at least three to five times more than the reported deaths. The WHO guidelines point out that deaths in case of COVID suspects should be counted as COVID deaths, which is not the case. Moreover, people living in the slums of the city are not coming in the net of testing and many deaths due to COVID are passed as routine deaths,” Dr. Gumta said. He added that under-reporting of deaths is happening across the country. In January 2021, the WHO had estimated, based on excess deaths data in just Europe and the American continents, that actual deaths were at least 1.6 times more than the recorded ones. Excess deaths information is not released in India, which makes it difficult to assess such data, but obtaining comparisons from death certification data is one way of estimating them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kolkatas-covid-deaths-could-be-4-times-more/article34672015.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Children under mid-day meal scheme to get aid||The Centre has decided to give about Rs. 100 each to children studying in Class 1 to Class 8 in government schools, who are beneficiaries of the Mid-Day Meal scheme. However, Right to Food activists say this is insufficient to provide the nutrition security envisaged by this measure. The money, Rs. 1200 crore in total, will be given to 11.8 crore children through direct benefit transfer as a one-time payment, according to an Education Ministry statement on Friday. The money comes from the cooking cost component of the scheme. “This decision will help safeguard the nutritional levels of children and aid in protecting their immunity during the challenging pandemic times,” said the statement. The Central Government will provide additional funds of about Rs. 1200 crore to States and Union Territories. Funds allocation The Central allocation for the Mid-Day Meal scheme in 2021-22 is Rs. 11,500 crore. It’s largest component is cooking costs, which cover the prices of ingredients such as pulses, vegetables, cooking oil, salt, and condiments. Last year, the minimum allocation for cooking cost per child per day was set at Rs. 4.97 for Classes 1 to 5, and Rs. 7.45 for Classes 6 to 8, with the Centre paying 60% of the cost. “Children are being given cash in lieu of the mid-day meal in some places and dry rations in others. Either way, the quantities/amounts are too low to be even adequate for one nutritious meal a day,” said Dipa Sinha, associate professor of economics at Ambedkar University, noting that Rs. 100 per child amounts to less than Rs. 4 a day even if it was a monthly payment. She suggested enhanced take-home rations, including eggs, vegetables, fruits, dal/chana, oil be given in order to ensure nutrition security. Reetika Khera, a development economist at IIT-Delhi and a Right to Food activist, said, “With approximately 200 school days, each child should be getting something like Rs. 900-Rs. 1300 annually [as cooking cost component]. All of last year, hardly any State did both — provide free grain and transfer these cooking costs. The government should transfer last year’s arrears also,” she said. She pointed out that when a school gets the per child allowance for cooking costs, they are able to pool the money to purchase ingredients at wholesale prices. “When this same amount is used to buy small quantities [for each child], parents will be able to purchase even less,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/children-under-mid-day-meal-scheme-to-get-aid/article34672022.ece
29 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||PM announces Rs. 1,000 cr. for 3 cyclone-hit States||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a Rs. 1,000 crore assistance for cyclone ‘Yaas’-hit Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand. While Rs. 500 crore would be immediately given to Odisha, Rs. 500 crore was announced for West Bengal and Jharkhand, which would be released on the basis of the damage, said the Prime Minister’s Office. The Centre would send an inter-ministerial team to visit the States to assess the extent of damage. Soon after attending a review meeting with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Mr. Modi undertook an aerial survey of Bhadrak and Balasore districts, en route to West Bengal. He announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to the seriously injured in the cyclone. Earlier, Mr. Patnaik said Odisha did not want to burden the Centre at the peak of the second wave of COVID-19 by demanding immediate financial assistance for cyclone restoration works. He instead called for provisioning of assistance for long-term mitigation measures. “As the country is at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, we have not sought any immediate financial assistance to burden the Central government and would like to manage it through our own resources,” said Mr. Patnaik. On May 1, the Centre released Rs. 641.6 crore in advance as the first instalment of the Central share of the State Disaster Response Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-announces-rs-1000-cr-for-3-cyclone-hit-states/article34672033.ece

Mr. Rao sought immediate release of Rs. 218 crore due to Telangana from the Rs. 13,000 crore deposited to the consolidated fund of Integrated Goods and Services Tax. The deposit to the fund was only Rs. 2,638 crore. He also wanted representation to the State in the Group of Ministers to study tax structure for race courses since it had also one. Mr. Rao expressed the dissatisfaction of the State to bring neutral alcohol under the purview of Centre administered GST as alcohol, petrol and diesel were the only items left to State governments to levy tax. Telangana would toe the line of all States in seeking exemption for alcohol from GST. The State governments would lose crucial revenue if alcohol was included in GST. Therefore, he urged the council to take a permanent decision to exempt neutral alcochol from GST. Making a case for more tax avenues to the States, he reminded the Centre that it already enjoyed huge revenue from cess and surcharges on various items. In the last year’s budget, the share of cess and surcharge in Centre’s revenue was 18%. Out of a budget of Rs. 22.17 lakh crore, the Centre earned Rs. 3.99 crore only from cess and surcharge. The States forfeited 41% of their revenues, totalling Rs. 1.41 lakh crore, to cess and surcharge collected by Centre. Telangana lost Rs. 3,439 crore which was 2.102 % in this process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/telangana-for-raising-frbm-limit-to-5/article34672558.ece
29 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha extends tender process for vaccine||The Odisha government, which was scheduled to open technical and price bids for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from the international market on Friday, has extended the global tender process by seven days. “Global tender has been extended by seven days in view of requests from many prospective vendors, cyclones and also for greater participation,” said a senior officer here on Friday. Odisha was among the first few States that considered getting vaccines from the international market. As per the revised schedule announced by the Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited, the final date for online bid submission, opening of technical bid and opening of price bid would be June 4.  Last week, the Odisha Cabinet had approved a tender document offering many relaxations to manufacturers. To ensure participation, the government has decided to waive the performance security amount, which was determined at 3%, for vaccine manufacturers whose numbers are currently very few in the market. Moreover, to facilitate the participation of manufacturer of vaccines that should be stored in supercool temperatures, the storage condition was revised up to -20oC provided that the vaccines would remain stable and maintain their potency at 2oC to 8oC for at least 12 hours.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||From karma to jnana||The lucid presentation of esoteric truths relating to Brahman in the Mundaka Upanishad helps in loosening the knots in one’s heart, to lead the spiritual aspirant to grasp the ultimate purpose of life, said Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. For instance, the salient features of the paths of karma and jnana, of Para and Apara vidya, are presented to help us evaluate their worth from the angle of salvation of the jivatma. Other issues including cosmology, Time, Space, as well as the attainment of Brahma vidya through the grace of the preceptor, etc, are also explained. Apara vidya is necessary for laukika purposes, but Para Vidya alone can lead us to moksha. Likewise, the path of karma is endorsed by the rishis of yore who have been blessed to understand the in-depth meanings of the Vedas and have prescribed the practices of Vedic rituals for the benefit of the jivatmas caught in samsara. All of us are bound to accept and abide by these which are the word of God. All the karmas are true and the fruits promised are also true. But all the goals of karma, such as attaining worlds like swarga etc are shown to be temporary goals and that mere adherence to karma cannot help one to cross samsara. If ignorance, desire and action bind us to the path of karma, and are the cause of all ills of samsara, Knowledge can lead us out of it. Vairagya can take root through chitta suddhi that comes from practice of selfless karma without aim on worldly and personal goals. The role of preceptor in bringing about this awareness of the true value of karma as a mere step for attainment of jnana is highlighted. After all, one is sure to understand at some point of time that Brahma jnana is the goal and this is attained by Upasana of Brahman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/from-karma-to-jnana/article34672028.ece

29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ministry caps deployment of flights at 50%||The Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday revised its cap on capacity deployment by airlines from 80% to 50% of pre-COVID-19 approved flights. The order comes into effect from June 1, 2021, and will last till July 31, 2021. The decision comes at a time when daily passenger traffic has registered a sharp decline due to the surge in COVID-19 cases and several States mandating RT-PCR test for arriving passengers. On May 18, various Indian carriers ferried a mere 39,370 passengers, as compared to nearly 2.5 lakh in March. In December, the government had raised permissible capacity from 70% to 80% when passenger demand was showing signs of recovery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ministry-caps-deployment-of-flights-at-50/article34672035.ece

29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Notify details of COVID-19 cases, private CT scan centres told||The Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to issue notice to all private CT scan centres for disease notification during the pandemic. Private hospitals and laboratories have already started notifying RT-PCR results to the Greater Chennai Corporation. But a large number of residents who have not undergone RT-PCR tests have started taking CT scan of the chest in private scan centres, without any system of notification of such cases to public health officials for quarantine and treatment. Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi has ordered 40 CT scan centres in the 15 zones to notify details of COVID-19 patients who get CT scan done without RT-PCR testing. Under the powers vested in the Commissioner as per Section 30(2) (V) (VI) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the civic officials would receive details on a daily basis of patients with COVID-19 like symptoms in a prescribed format. The scan centres will send the name, address, phone number, symptoms, COVID-19 severity and CORADS classification to understand the level of suspicion of COVID-19 infection in the patient. “Details of persons who undergo CT chest scan will also be sent by the scan centres. It has come to our notice that many COVID-19 cases have not been included in the database because they undergo CT scan without RT-PCR," said Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner Alby John Varghese. CT scan centres in hospitals and standalone facilities will email details daily togccpvtctscanreports@ chennaicorporation.gov.in Centres that fail to notify will be liable for punishment under Section 51 of Disaster Management Act, 2005. A team of officials, led by the Chennai Corporation Chief Vector Control Officer, will coordinate with the private CT scan centres in all the 15 zones of Chennai Corporation. Each of the 15 zones will be monitored by a junior entomologist of the Greater Chennai Corporation for correct reporting of data. Starting on Saturday, the CT scan centres will have to send details of CT chest scan of all patients to the Greater Chennai Corporation on a daily basis, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/notify-details-of-covid-19-cases-private-ct-scan-centres-told/article34672342.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Intake of foreign medicos capped at 10%||The Tamil Nadu Medical Council has directed all recognised medical colleges in the State to restrict the intake of Foreign Medical Graduates (FMG) to 10% of the sanctioned MBBS seats for undergoing Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) training. In an urgent communication, the TNMC said it had observed that the number of FMGs applying for provisional registration in the council to undergo internship was gradually increasing. From approximately 600 in 2018, the number had gone up to 1,000 in 2020 and likely to cross 1,200 in future. However, the recognised medical institutions for imparting internship training to them were found to be inadequate and hence “they are unable to accommodate the increasing number of interns, with a resultant crowding in a particular institution. The loss in quality of internship training in such institutions is understandable,” the Council said in its communication. In the list of recognised teaching and non-teaching hospitals for CRRI training, only 40 were approved by the erstwhile Medical Council of India and the data was not updated later. The Council had communicated to the National Medical Commission to provide a fresh list of hospitals/institutions approved for CRRI training in the State. The Council has asked all government district headquarters hospitals with a bed strength of more than 750 to admit 40 and those with more than 500 to admit 30 FMGs for CRRI training. Other private hospitals were told to follow the erstwhile MCI’s order till a communication was received from the National Medical Commission. The instruction assumes significance as the State government had lifted the restriction on the intake of students for internship at government medical colleges as a one-time measure to handle COVID-19. The government issued the orders acting on a proposal of the Director of Medical Education to relax the Tamil Nadu Medical Council’s stipulation that medical colleges issue the NOC to FMGs and students of other States after ensuring that the admission under the CRRI did not exceed 10% of the MBBS seats allotted by the National Medical Commission. The DME had sought lifting of the restriction on internship by students of private and foreign medical colleges at Madras Medical College, Stanley Medical College, Kilpauk Medical College, Madurai Medical College, Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College of Salem, Coimbatore Medical College, and Tirunelveli Medical College, which was agreed to by the government for this year. Justifying his proposal, the DME had underscored the urgent need to contain COVID-19 cases that had reached alarming proportions with increased mortality in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intake-of-foreign-medicos-capped-at-10/article34672486.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Healthy lifestyle can help beat pandemic blues’||At a time when the pandemic is raging, the best way to stay healthy, mentally and emotionally is to look at the positive things life has given. The time spent with family, the opportunity to catch up with what people have been putting aside could be therapeutic, according to S.P. Kurinjinathan, head of Psychiatry at MIOT Hospital. In a Wellness Series webinar on emotional well being at the time of COVID-19, the expert said people should have a daily structured routine and maintain it for their emotional well-being. Women, who have double the work load, should be assertive. “Be kind on yourself. Allocate some time just for you without having to think about others,” he said. They should delegate work, including children, and it “will make you appreciate your life,” he said. It is better to limit children’s use of gadgets and instead use gadgets as a reward for work done well, he suggested. Gadgets are addictive as they help appease the mind’s constant demand for stimulation. Children should be encouraged to read books and play board games instead. To some extent anxiety keeps people safe. “Maintain emotional health by remaining confident and sleep well. Good sleep for 7-8 hours and physical activity of 20 minutes will help to start secreting natural endorphines to make you more happy and energetic,” he said. Dr. Kurinjinathan said almost 20% of people who had contracted COVID-19, have psychiatric issues. The pandemic had driven even men to seek help, which they usually don’t, he added. He put to rest doubts about vaccination saying it protected people against the disease. All that people had to do is to inform the vaccinating officer about their conditions so they would receive appropriate advice. As for professional caregivers the best way to de-stress is to share their experiences with others in the same profession as them to help come to terms with their predicament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/healthy-lifestyle-routine-can-help-beat-pandemic-blues-says-expert/article34672210.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fiscal deficit within permissible level||Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit during 2020-21, which marked an all-time high in terms of absolute figures, was, however, well within the level permitted by the Centre for the year. The State’s fiscal deficit was 4.36% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), against the permitted level of 4.5% for the previous year, according to workings of the Finance Department. In terms of absolute figures, it was Rs. 84,696.69 crore. Fiscal deficit pertains to the difference between total expenditure and the sum of revenue receipts and non-debt capital receipts. Impact of COVID-19 Considering the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economy, the Central government had permitted the States to increase their borrowings by 2% of the GSDP, subject to certain conditions. In other words, fiscal deficit could go up to 5% of the GSDP, against the normal 3%. In the case of Tamil Nadu, it was 4.5%, as the Centre took cognisance of the State’s implementation of two of the four conditions — ease of doing business and the One Nation One Ration Card scheme — though the latter had contended that it had also taken up reforms in the finances of urban local bodies. As regards the fiscal deficit figure, the State government differs from the Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&AG), which has come out with a higher figure, Rs. 92,305.07 crore. GST compensation The difference is on account of the State government excluding Rs. 7,608.38 crore from the overall figure of fiscal deficit. This amount, despite being regarded as loan, is not liable to be repaid by the State as it is in lieu of compensation for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) losses, and is to be serviced out of the Centre’s GST compensation cess. A year ago, the government decided to raise the age of superannuation of employees and freeze the hike in dearness allowance. The measures had contributed to a significant degree of expenditure control, because even as per the C&AG’s calculations, expenditure on salaries and wages for the year was about 86% of the budgeted figure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fiscal-deficit-within-permissible-level/article34672493.ece

We are monitoring the treatment of those who have been admitted in the hospitals. Family members and ministerial staff are being given treatment on par with the police personnel. We are extending all facilities when they want to go for test or are under quarantine,” said Mr. Jiwal. In the second wave, more than 1,500 police personnel were affected and 350 are under treatment.

29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alumni urge SASTRA to follow UGC norms on sexual harassment||The alumni of SASTRA University have demanded that it follow the guidelines “for appropriate action to end discriminatory practices, deal with sexual harassment allegations against the staff and provide timely medical care, irrespective of students’ clothing”. The letter is in response to the university’s clarification on its website that alumni who had complaints could contact them with their grievance. It said that in the past, the institution had taken action against erring staff who had been expelled as well. It said that the university had a sexual harassment grievances committee as per the Vishaka guidelines and it acted on complaints of harassment. The alumni said the university needed to have sensitisation programmes on sexual harassment, sexual health, and a discrimination-free campus. It demanded response to emergency medical treatment. Ramita Rajaa, a graduate from the university, found the remarks about her personal choices in attire sexist and reeking of casteism. “Why do you assume my caste, how does it make any difference, and who are you to tell me what to wear,” she asked about their behaviour. Several alumni, including some men, have shared their angst. The alumni put out a letter in the public domain about the various issues they faced as students. The alumni said they had on several occasions spoken up but could not fight against the lack of empathy from the university authorities. The university claimed that it had not received any complaint so far from the alumni, who had posted on social media. It expected the complainants’ cooperation to inquire into incidents of harassments listed now. The management always protected the physical, psychological and emotional health of all the stakeholders, the statement said and invited complainants to file their complaints with the Presiding Officer, Internal Complaints Committee, at the university or e-mail them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alumni-urge-sastra-to-follow-ugc-norms-on-sexual-harassment/article34672207.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Healthy diet for elderly prisoners across Tamil Nadu||Egg, black channa, soup — this is part of the staple diet of elderly prisoners and those in poor health lodged in central prisons across Tamil Nadu. This is an effort to boost their immune system, helping them avoid contracting COVID-19. 15 elderly in Puzhal There are nine central jails in the State, where there are over 200 prisoners aged above 60 and more than 100 who have weak immunity. In Puzhal Central Prison alone, over 15 elderly prisoners have been housed for various offences. “During the first wave last year, inmates of the Puzhal prison were infected. A team of government doctors that monitored them suggested this diet. It had a good impact on their health, and they recovered. So we reintroduced this diet this year for those who are in need of a good immune system,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, DGP, Prisons. On regular days, the prisoners are given ‘upma’, made of pongal rice, for breakfast; for lunch, they are given rice, sambar and some vegetables and butter milk. In the evening, groundnuts are given. For dinner, rice or ‘chapatis’ are served. “We are following all protocols in the prisons. In order to strengthen their immune system, we have started serving the inmates healthy food, along with the regular menu, every day. In most prisons. ‘kashayam’, ‘amukara milk’, ‘kabasura kudineer’, brown channa, lemon juice, lemon soup, milk, ‘murungai’ (drumstick) soup and egg are provided,” said A. Murugesan, DIG, Prisons. Yoga sessions Online yoga sessions are also conducted for all prisoners. “They are also allowed to walk within their blocks,” said a prison official in Vellore. Besides, the arrested persons are first placed in 110 sub-jails across the State for quarantine and then brought to the central prisons after they test negative for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/healthy-diet-for-elderly-prisoners-across-tamil-nadu/article34672495.ece
29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||400 mucormycosis cases in Tamil Nadu||The number of persons diagnosed with mucormycosis has touched 400 in Tamil Nadu. T.S. Selvavinagayam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said that so far, 400 persons had been affected, with a majority of cases being reported from eight districts, including Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Vellore. Cases of mucormycosis, an invasive fungal infection, are being reported in patients recovering from COVID-19 across the country. Usually, it occurs one or two weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19, a time when patients are usually discharged, according to Mohan Kameswaran, managing director of Madras ENT Research Foundation. Dr. Kameswaran is a member of the task force constituted by the government for mucormycosis. “Cases of mucormycosis have increased rapidly. We are seeing that the cases have crossed 400 in the State. The silver lining is that general COVID-19 cases have come down, and we are hoping that cases of mucormycosis will also come down as it follows by a couple of weeks,” he said. He added that awareness among doctors had improved. “They are much more aware of the infection, and are monitoring blood sugar levels and the usage of steroids. In general, Tamil Nadu is far better than other States that have reported several hundreds of cases of mucormycosis. This is partly because of awareness, and also owing to the steps being taken by the medical community. In addition, the management of COVID-19 is more scientific here,” he said. He said many patients were being diagnosed fairly early. R. Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education, said the task force would look into the prevention of mucormycosis, its clinical presentation, management and research. A treatment protocol would also be formulated. “The committee will meet periodically and submit the proceedings to the State government,” he said. He added that when patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalised, doctors would monitor their blood sugar levels. “Along with COVID-19 management, our doctors check if patients are diabetic and maintain blood sugar levels. We have specialists from ENT, ophthalmology and neurology at our COVID-19 hospitals. So, we are able to pick up cases early and follow appropriate management, facilitating recovery,” he said.

The second plant will commence operations this Sunday and with this we will have an additional 20-30 tonnes of supply,” Sterlite Copper CEO Pankaj Kumar told The Hindu . “Apart from liquid oxygen, we are working to see how we can give cylinders to hospitals who need them,” he said. Every activity inside the plant was monitored by a committee appointed by the government. The company had invited Expression of Interest (EoI) for a solution to transport around 800 tonnes (per day) of oxygen to hospitals. “We are evaluating this now,” he said. Cost of operation Sterlite Copper had spent over Rs. 25 crore to get these two oxygen units up and operational. The operating cost of each plant is estimated at Rs. 5 crore a month. “The plant was shut down for over three years and we ensured that we started operations after we got power supply. The government and several OEMs helped start this plant,” he said. The firm has roped in 300 people to work at these plants, of which 150 were its own employees.

29 May 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hospital begins monoclonal antibody treatment||Kauvery Hospital in Chennai has treated a mildly symptomatic but high-risk COVID-19 patient with the monoclonal antibody cocktail that has been approved for emergency use in India. A statement issued by the hospital claimed that this was the first time the treatment had been used by a hospital in Tamil Nadu. The individual was a cancer patient, who was recently diagnosed with early onset of renal failure, and hence was at higher risk of developing severe complications due to COVID-19. The drug used was a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, which are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the human immune system in fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The drug, developed by the U.S.-based Regeneron and manufactured in partnership with the Switzerland-based Roche, is said to bring down hospitalisation by 70% when administered in the early stage of COVID-19. The Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation of India had provided Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to use the drug for high-risk patients earlier this month. Anita Ramesh, senior consultant, medical oncology, Kauvery Hospital, said the drug would help in reducing the multiplication of the virus and thus avoiding severe complications and hospitalisation. It has been found to be safe for use even among children above 12 years of age, she added. Aravindan Selvaraj, co-founder and executive director of the hospital, said the drug would be effective for cases that start with mild disease and then rapidly progress to critical situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospital-begins-monoclonal-antibody-treatment/article34672343.ece

29 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Night, early morning trains cause most elephant deaths’||Late night and early morning trains had caused the deaths of seven out of eight elephants on the two railway lines, A and B, between Kottekad and Madukkarai railway stations in the last five years, according to the Palakkad Division of the Southern Railway. As per the data shared by the Division, seven elephants were killed on the two railway lines between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The time of the death of the eighth elephant was not known. While seven elephants were killed after being hit by trains on B line, only one elephant was killed on A line, said the division in reply to various queries made by activist R. Pandiyaraja of Tenkasi district under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. According to the Division, five out of the eight elephants were killed on the 5.8 km stretch of B line on either side of Walayar railway station -- 4 km towards Ettimadai and 1.8 km towards Kanjikode. The RTI document said that A line runs through reserve forest for 17 km between Chullimada - Madukkarai stations and B line passes through reserve forest for 23 km between Madukkarai - Kanjikode stations. “These data shows that all the elephants were killed after being hit by trains at night and early morning. Thiruvananthapuram – Chennai Mail (12624) knocked down two elephants in separate incidents. As the deaths occurred on B line, trains that pass through the track at night and early morning should be diverted through line A. The permanent solution is to stop traffic through the B line and bring it along the A line,” said Mr. Pandiyaraja. He also noted that all the eight elephant deaths, except the one that was reported in March this year, occurred between June and December. Nature enthusiast Dayanand Krishnan said that the Railways and the Forest Department should jointly collect data of elephant deaths on tracks and map them for correction actions. “Based on the mapping, technologies should be improved to reduce further accidents involving elephants,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/night-early-morning-trains-cause-most-elephant-deaths/article34672206.ece
29 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corpn. to cross verify COVID-19 results from private labs||Coimbatore Corporation is planning to verify at random the results of swab samples from private laboratories. Sources said the Corporation was forced to come to the decision to verify or cross check the results after it turned out that the number of positive cases reported by a few of the laboratories was far in excess of the results declared by either the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital or the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital. If the positivity rate was around 25 from the government institutions it was thrice that number from laboratories, the sources said and wondered how one set of institutions reported one set of numbers and the private laboratories another when the samples the Corporation took were from a neighbourhood. The increase in number of samples that had turned positive created a burden on the system and resources. Therefore, the Corporation wanted to check the results by re-testing the persons whom the laboratories had reported positive. And in cross verifying the results from private laboratories, the Corporation treaded carefully lest it be accused of suppressing results, as it happened last year. The sources also said that Coimbatore was seeing only 1,800 to 1,900 positive cases a day in the city, which was less than 50% of the cases reported in the district. For instance, the 1,869 cases reported on May 27 was less than 50% of the cases reported in the district - 4,734 cases. To bring down the COVID-19 spread, the Corporation was going in for early detection of cases by asking persons who have fever symptoms to give samples or collecting their samples at door step using mobile collection units. Besides, the Corporation was also going in for early testing of the primary and secondary contacts of persons who had tested positive. The Corporation was checking on people in around 50,000 houses a day, the sources added. And, to check on people who were in home quarantine, the Corporation had roped in its teachers. On Friday the teachers underwent a training. The civic body would post them at control rooms or call centres to call and check on every positive person in the city, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corpn-to-cross-verify-covid-19-results-from-private-labs/article34672503.ece
29 May 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Trade unions call for better vaccination coverage for workers||Trade unions here have called for measures to ensure that all industry workers are vaccinated. Coimbatore MP PR Natarajan has appealed to the State government to take multiple measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in Coimbatore district. The officials concerned should employ more people to ensure that those in home quarantine did not come out, and get all their essential needs at their doorstep. Further, the number of oxygen beds should be increased to treat the COVID-19 affected people. More oxygen concentrators should be made available. Vaccination measures should be expanded to cover more people, he said. The MP had a discussion with Minister R. Sakkarapani in this regard here on Thursday. M. Arumugam, former MLA and AITUC leader, said the officials concerned should organise vaccination at all ESI dispensaries and hospitals. The Labour and Health Departments should have data on how many workers were affected with COVID-19 and how many had taken the vaccine. There should be door-to-door survey and vaccination drive. Further, attenders should not be permitted at CMCH and ESI to control the spread, he said. According to CITU leader for engineering workers union Perumal, supply of vaccines should increase. Some larger engineering units had vaccinated most of their workers and their family members too. However, it was a challenge for smaller engineering units and those who employed migrant workers. Hence, the district administration should step up the vaccination drive and carry it out at the workplaces. District General Secretary of Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Union, affiliated to AITUC, said the COVID-19 testing and vaccination should be expedited in rural areas. It was said that there was no vaccination or testing camps in areas such as Sulur and Annur. The Chief Minister should take stringent measures to control the spread in Coimbatore, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trade-unions-call-for-better-vaccination-coverage-for-workers/article34672504.ece

29 May 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court stops quarrying operations to protect hillock||Mountains, forests, hills, hillocks and rivers were nature’s gift and they must be protected for future generations, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed while restraining quarrying operations in Thiruppani hillock in Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district. Justice G.R. Swaminathan said the government and the people had a constitutional obligation to protect the environment and ecology - not only for the benefit of the present but also for the future. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by farmers who sought a direction to the authorities to restrain rough stone quarrying in the hillock. The government submitted that no rules or norms were violated and the quarrying operations were carried out in a scientific manner. Taking note of the submissions, the court observed, “The government of the day cannot arbitrarily give away hills and hillocks for exploitation. Merely because the process of issuance of mining lease was conducted in consonance with the statutory procedure, that would not confer any immunity against judicial scrutiny. Unless there are supervening public interest considerations, hills and hillocks cannot be given away for mining”. Permitting quarrying operations to continue would lead to total destruction of the hillock , the court said and restrained quarrying operations in Thiruppani hillock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-stops-quarrying-operations-to-protect-hillock/article34672273.ece
29 May 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Fix a timeline for execution of AIIMS project, says MLA||The Union government should fix a timeline for the series of works planned for the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) project in Madurai and appoint a Special Officer with adequate financial and administrative powers, said Tirupparankundram AIADMK MLA V.V. Rajan Chellappa here on Friday. In a letter addressed to the Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan, he said that two years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the AIIMS at Thoppur in the presence of then Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. The then AIADMK government had earmarked land for the mega project. ‘Nothing tangible’ However nothing tangible had moved forward since then. With COVID-19 pandemic on the surge, the AIIMS project should be expedited. The presence of state-of-the-art medical equipment, medical experts, research and other resources in Madurai would immensely help a large number of people from southern districts and other parts of the State. The Centre should release a time-line and work accordingly. For swift clearances, a single window facility should be in place for giving approvals. The dates of initiation and subsequent progress should be spelt out to prevent cost escalation. There must be transparency on JICA loan components. Being the elected representative of Tiruparankundram Assembly constituency, which houses the AIIMS project, the Centre must involve the local representatives in the project implementation process, Mr. Chellappa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fix-a-timeline-for-execution-of-aiims-project-says-mla/article34672277.ece

29 May 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Govt. under-reporting deaths, says Palaniswami||Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday said the State government was under-reporting deaths due to COVID-19 and people would become aware of the situation only if transparent data were provided. The AIADMK co-coordinator visited the Edappadi government hospital and inspected the facilities for COVID-19 treatment. Mr. Palaniswami said, “The government is under-reporting deaths. Long queues are being seen at crematoriums, but the figures reported in news and media are low. Data should be transparent; only then will the people become aware of the situation.” He said the government should appoint sufficient number of workers at crematoriums, as relatives are forced to wait for hours for cremating COVID-19 victims. Mr. Palaniswami said patients dying while waiting in ambulances at hospitals must be tested, and if they tested positive, their bodies should be safely packed before being handed over to the relatives. While he was the Chief Minister, the cremation of COVID-19 victims was done through local body workers, he said. He said the disease was fast spreading in villages and 17 persons had contracted the infection in his village on Friday alone. Criticising the relaxation in the lockdown norms and the operation of buses ahead of the stringent lockdown recently, he said about 6 lakh people had returned to their villages from cities and they were not tested. During his regime, village officers would take people coming from other places for tests and those who tested negative were dropped back to their houses. Contact-tracing was intense then. Mr. Palaniswami said the State government should follow the measures taken by the AIADMK government. It should conduct fever camps and increase testing and the number of testing centres. He denied the charge made by Medical and Family Welfare Minister Ma. Subramanian that the AIADMK government had failed to contain the spread of the infection. He said the highest number of cases reported in June last year was 6,900, and due to the then government’s efforts, daily cases had gradually come down, and on February 26 this year, only 481 cases were reported. Mr. Palaniswami also appealed to the government to provide relief to farmers affected by the rain caused by Cyclone Yaas in Kanniyakumari. He said all oxygen beds in the district were full. He said the government should provide sufficient oxygen to government and private hospitals. He added that while there were only 3,800 beds at COVID-19 Care Centres, the government claimed that 11,500 beds were available in the district. He added that the Collector should inform about bed availability so that people could approach the facilities directly for treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-under-reporting-deaths-says-palaniswami/article34672490.ece

After inaugurating a 500-bed COVID-19 treatment centre put up on a premises belonging to the Salem Steel Plant, the Minister said 6,338 patients were undergoing treatment across Salem district, and 11,500 beds were already available in the district and 5,500 beds were additionally created. “If there are only 3,800 beds as the Opposition leader claims, are the remaining patients undergoing treatment lying on the road”, he asked. Mr. Balaji said the government was open to good suggestions. Mr. Palaniswami could have made suggestions by taking part in review meetings. While only 10 kl medical oxygen was provided to Salem district while Mr. Palaniswami was Chief Minister, 27 kl of oxygen was supplied to the district on Thursday. “Had the former Chief Minister improved infrastructure, we would not be facing hardship for oxygen today”, Mr. Balaji said. Soon after inauguration, the new centre began admitting patients. Mr. Balaji reviewed the arrangements at the facility and said works were on for an additional 500-bed facility here.

In a memorandum to Collector M.Govinda Rao, its secretary Sundara Vimalanathan pointed out that around 2,000 persons comprising of 500 families of narikuravas reside in Peravurani, Pattukottai, Budalur, Melaulooor, Pasupathykovil, Thiruvalanchuzhi, Sengipatti, Melapudukudi and on the border of Thanjavur-Tiruchi district from where they used to eke out their living by selling handicraft and other items to the people in nearby towns. Since their movement had been curtailed in view of the lockdown conditions, they were finding it difficult to make ends meet. Hence, the district administration, which had ensured free distribution of food packets to these people during the nation-wide lockdown days last year, should come to their rescue this time also by directing officials to provide food packets to the families, he pleaded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-free-distribution-of-food-packets/article34672666.ece

In a statement issued here on Thursday, TDP general secretary K.Venkatraman claimed that the efficacy of Siddha treatment for various ailments including the breaking of COVID-19 virus infection chain had been proved in the past through research and treatment. When the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the society last year, the government had turned its attention towards the use of ‘kabasura kudineer’, ‘nilavembu’ and other Siddha medicines in order to control and prevent the spreading of the COVID-19 virus infection. Expressing confidence that such treatment methods would definitely produce the desired results in the second wave or in any subsequent waves of novel coronavirus, Mr.Venkatraman urged the State government to enhance the role of Siddha treatment along with allopathy methods in controlling the spread of the deadly virus. Setting up or permitting private players to institute Siddha Medicine Colleges after instituting n University for Siddha Medicine should be considered, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-equal-importance-to-siddha-medicine/article34672654.ece

29 May 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Construct cold storage facilities: farmers||Theni District Banana Growers and Traders Association has appealed to the State government to construct cold storage facilities in Theni district. Speaking to reporters, its president R. Narayanasamy and secretary A.P. Karuppiah said here on Tuesday that with lockdown in force, plantains could not be harvested on time. Due to logistics issues, the workers could not come to the fields. So, close to plantains worth Rs. 5 crore had gone waste in Sippalakottai and surrounding areas in Uthamapalayam taluk. The farmers hoped to offset the losses they incurred during the first wave of COVID-19 by good earnings this season. But the second wave had dashed their hopes. The farmers had installed drip irrigation facility on at least 30,000 acres. If they could not get back their investments, following losses on successive years, they would desert agriculture as their vocation. So the government must construct cold storage facilities so that they could keep their produce for at least 15 days and sell it in the markets. Horticulture officials should also disseminate techniques to banana growers and help save their crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/construct-cold-storage-facilities-farmers/article34672608.ece

As for the sexual harassment charge against the teacher of a Chennai school, the police have taken up investigation. The Chief Educational Officer had sought an explanation, and anyone at fault would not go unpunished, he said. School heads had mooted the formation of institution-wise Vishaka Committees [panels to deal with sexual harassment complaints]. All suggestions would be considered for working out the guidelines, Mr. Poyyamozhi told mediapersons after inspecting a vaccination camp for government and government-aided schoolteachers at the Government Syed Murthuza Higher Secondary School in Tiruchi. At a meeting of State Education Ministers convened by the Centre, Tamil Nadu made it clear that deciding the dates for the Plus-Two examinations was the States’ prerogative. Tamil Nadu highlighted its stand from the perspective of State Board students. Public examinations would be conducted in the pen-and-paper mode, for three hours, after the Health Department signalled a decline in the rate of infection, he said. Answering a question, he said there was no compulsion on schoolteachers to get themselves involved in COVID-19 prevention activities. The School Education Department attuned its online interface for teaching and learning in sync with the shortcomings in digital connectivity in rural areas.

29 May 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||College teachers for further thrust to 2GB free data for students||Citing the inevitability of dependence on online interface for the next few months, in view of the surge of infection in the second wave of the pandemic, college teachers have exuded hope that the new dispensation will accord a further thrust to the 2GB free data per day scheme initiated by previous government during the last few months of its tenure. The Rs. 100 crore project entailed providing internet service to over nine lakh students of government and government-aided colleges to attend online classes for a period of four months from January to April. Now that the universities have postponed the semester examinations, free data was not being availed much by students. “The free data would be quite helpful for second and third year students when classes for the next academic year begins during July-August,” P. David Livingstone, Zonal Secretary of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers' Association said. After gathering inputs from students about their preference of network in their locations, the State Government had roped in four internet service providers — BSNL, Airtel, JIO and Vodafone, to provide over 9.69 lakh data card to students of all colleges, including arts and science, engineering and polytechnic colleges. The multi-purpose cards are fit for use with normal, micro and nano SIM slots, and suitable for all kinds of smart phones and in various OS versions. The 4G data SIM card is capable of supporting data usage up to 21.2 mbps speed. The project is seen as one of the major government-to-student initiatives in online education. At the time of launch, the government had announced that the project would be expanded further based on the outcome of the initiative. The extent of data is, by and large, sufficient for engineering students. But, when they attend full-day classes online, the data usage overshoots the 2GB limit, a senior professor of Anna University said. According to teachers, the 2GB data would not be sufficient if students are required to view video content in excess of seven hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-teachers-for-further-thrust-to-2gb-free-data-for-students/article34672655.ece

Further, considering the long-term effects of COVID-19, it would also be appropriate to take a decision to extend the compensation arrangement beyond July 1, 2022.” Tamil Nadu supported the proposal for extension of key IT application development projects till March 31, 2022, and welcomed the proposal to encourage the deputation of State officers to the GSTN with the aim of enrolling all stakeholders in the organisation. It also welcomed the proposed reduction in the maximum late fee for the belated filing of returns. “However, considering the present pandemic situation, the period of compliance may be extended to September 30, 2021, instead of August 31,” the Minister said. The State supported the proposal for a provision relating to the filing of annual return with self-certification of the reconciliation statement by taxpayers themselves and the proposed amendments to the return-related provisions in the GST Act. It extended in-principle support to the quarterly return and quarterly payment proposed to replace the quarterly return with monthly payment. As for the Fitment Committee’s recommendations, he said Tamil Nadu supported the recommendation for exemption relating to COVID-19 like the ad hoc IGST exemption for specified imported goods donated for COVID-19 relief and reduction in the tax on medical-grade oxygen, oxygen concentrator/generator, pulse oximeter and testing kits.

The second plant will commence operations this Sunday and with this we will have an additional 20-30 tonnes of supply,”Sterlite Copper CEO, Pankaj Kumar told The Hindu . Currently 30 tonnes are being shipped from the first plant. “Apart from liquid oxygen, we are also working on to see how we can give cylinders to hospitals who need them,” he said adding that every activity inside the plant is being monitored by a committee which comprises of officials and experts from the State government. He pointed out that the company has called for Expression of Interest (EoI) for a solution to transport around 800 tonnes (per day) of gaseous oxygen to hospitals. “We are evaluating this now,” he said. Sterlite Copper has spent over Rs. 25 crore to get these two oxygen units up and operational. The operating cost of each plant is estimated at Rs. 5 crore per month. “The plant was shut down for over three years and we ensured that we started operations after we got power supply. The government and several OEMs helped start this oxygen plant,” Mr Kumar said. The firm has currently roped in over 300 people to work at these plants, of which 150 are its own employees. Mr.Kumar said. To a query on whether this activity by the company will give them a wild card entry to resume operations at the copper smelting unit, he said that the matter is in court and the focus currently is on helping the government with oxygen and saving lives. The company was also looking for another plant outside Tamil Nadu and according to Mr.Kumar few coastal States have evinced interest and a decision regarding this would be taken soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sterlite-to-start-oxygen-generation-at-second-unit/article34672620.ece

29 May 2021||Afshan Yasmeen Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||More pre-term babies during second wave, say doctors||More pregnant women appear to be testing positive for COVID-19 and developing complications during the ongoing second wave. As a result, gynaecologists are seeing a rise in pre-term deliveries and stillbirths in the State. Although there is no State-wide data available as yet, doctors said they are seeing many pregnant women reporting with severe breathing problems. There is a rapid deterioration in the condition of such patients making urgent intervention and premature births inevitable, they said. Before 37th week Premature/pre-term delivery is the one in which the baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. The last few weeks of pregnancy (37-40) are crucial weeks as the baby’s brain and sense organs develop during this period and the baby also experiences a healthy weight gain during these weeks. If a baby is prematurely born, he/she needs intensive monitoring. “Patients and their families too readily give consent for a premature delivery, when the situation demands urgent intervention. If such patients need to be put on ventilators or require proning, anaesthetists and treating physicians recommend that the deliveries be conducted before starting the treatment. We had to do this in 45 of the 276 positive women who delivered in our hospital since March,” said D. Tulasi Devi, Medical Superintendent of Hajee Sir Ismail Sait (HSIS) Gosha Hospital. This State-run hospital, attached to Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, is the dedicated COVID19 facility for pregnant women in Bengaluru. A total of 524 pregnant women had been admitted here since March. Among these, 276 women delivered at the hospital and the rest who were in their first or second trimesters were treated and discharged. Five of the 45 women who delivered pre-term succumbed to COVID-19. The hospital has seen a total of 22 maternal deaths during the second wave so far. While five were the ones who delivered pre-term, three died after giving birth at 32 weeks. The remaining 14 mothers, who had come with severe COVID complications and precariously low oxygen saturation levels, died despite intervention. Chikkanarasa Reddy, professor of Paediatrics, Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, said although seven of the babies born to the COVID-19 positive mothers tested positive, all have recovered. “We are seeing several pre-term babies who require intensive monitoring in our neonatal ICU. Although such babies require prolonged NICU care, we have seen most of them recover quickly,” said Dr Reddy. Hema Divakar, consultant gynaecologist at Divakar’s Speciality Hospital, and former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), said entire families including pregnant women testing positive has become a common trend in the second wave. Late reporting “Most report to hospitals late with complications as strict monitoring/isolation is not done at home. While some would not want to visit a hospital, some tend to hide facts and keep postponing getting tested. Therefore, there is rapid deterioration and this makes it inevitable for urgent intervention,” Dr. Divakar explained. Pointing out that such deterioration typically happens in the seventh or eighth month, the doctor added, “No matter even if the baby is premature, rapid action for delivery is undertaken to save both the mother and baby.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-pre-term-babies-in-second-wave/article34672144.ece

29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dhaka cops alerted city counterparts about rape accused||A lead from the Dhaka police in Bangladesh helped their counterparts in Bengaluru track down the four men and two women who allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted a young woman a little over a fortnight ago. According to sources, the city police arrested the gang within two hours of receiving the information. The accused had recorded the incident and shared the video clips with their friends in Assam, spurring the police there into action. While the Assam Police posted photographs of the perpetrators on Twitter seeking information, the main lead came from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. From the video clips, they identified one of the accused as Ridoy Babu alias Tiktok, 26. His full name is Raifatul Islam Ridoy, and he hails from Moghbazar in Dhaka. They passed on his mobile number to their counterparts in India. A senior police official said, “Initially, we had some vague leads of a person from Bangladesh involved in the flesh trade at Avalahalli. As we were working on that, we were given a phone number of one of the accused. It turned out to be Ridoy. We tracked him down using the mobile tower location, which showed he was in Avalahalli.” Accused tried to escape A team was dispatched to the house of Ridoy and another accused. “One of them tried to escape by jumping off the first floor. The duo led us to the rest of the accused and the scene of the crime, which was a rented accommodation on the fourth floor of a building in Karegowda Layout. It is the residence of three other accused – Mohammed Baba Sheikh and his two wives ,” said a senior police official. Ridoy Babu was shot in the leg by police when he allegedly tried to escape during reconstruction of the crime scene on Friday morning. He is recovering at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. On Thursday evening, Dhaka Metropolitan Police held a press conference where Deputy Commissioner of Police Md. Shahidullah said Ridoy had been involved in several anti-social activities under the name Tiktok, and had fled home four months ago without informing his parents. “When we contacted him, he acknowledged that he is the man in the video,” Shahidullah said at the press conference. Bangladesh’s leading newspaper The Daily Star reported on Friday that the police there contacted Ridoy using his uncle’s WhatsApp. He allegedly not only admitted to being in the video, but also informed police about the identity of the victim, also a resident of Moghbazar. Dhaka police later contacted the girl’s family, who had lost all contact with her for the past two years, but identified her from the video. The police are gathering information on the gang, and the extent of their activities in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dhaka-cops-alerted-city-counterparts-about-rape-accused/article34672139.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||As tourism takes a dive, hotels offer isolation stay||As travel plans have been thrown out of the window due to the second wave of COVID-19, the hospitality industry is offering a different product to cater to the times – isolation packages. Many big hotels, chains and portals are coming up with ‘safe hotels’ that promise stay, meals and medical facilities for those who want isolation facilities. Most of the hotels say they have partnered with hospitals to offer medical care too. MakeMyTrip, for example, is offering ‘Safe Hotels for Isolation’, and has partnered with over 500 hotels. “Most of these hotel stays include meals, and may require a COVID-19-negative test report,” it said on the website. A MakeMyTrip spokesperson told The Hindu that the portal had launched ‘Stays for saviours’ during the first wave of the pandemic in a bid to support temporary accommodation needs of the medical frontline force fighting COVID-19. “We rolled out that initiative in partnership with hotel chains and independent hotels that pitched in to support our healthcare heroes across 26 States and four Union territories. During the second wave, as the healthcare infrastructure deals with the massive surge in cases amid a high infection rate, we have observed the need of individuals or even several family members to go into isolation until they are in the clear,” said the spokesperson. Currently, these hotels are available in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, Lucknow, Kolkata, Pune, Jaipur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh and Ludhiana, among other places. Another budget hotel chain offers “well-equipped private rooms for isolation, breakfast, lunch and dinner, 24x7 nursing assistance, one doctor visit per day, trained concierge, oxygen and ambulance available on call, and easy availability of medicines”. Columbia Asia Hospital, Yeshwanthpur has tied up with a popular luxury hotel for such packages. Its marketing manager Ankush R. said the response has been good. “The doctors, after consultation, decide if they are to be hospitalised or if home isolation is enough. Those who find it difficult to isolate at home, choose these hotel packages. The package includes medical supervision, with doctor consultation twice – tele and personal, 24 hours nursing coverage, and availability of oxygen. This also helps decongest hospital beds,” he explained. The package costs Rs. 12,000 per person per day. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Joint Commissioner Sarfaraz Khan, who is in-charge of the COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs), said as long as private players were following the guidelines to set up such centres, they are permissible. The BBMP’s CCCs are yet to see the expected demand, and the civic body recently revised guidelines for home isolation, making it mandatory for people to have certain facilities, failing which they should be shifted to CCCs. “We have requested volunteers to identify people without quarantine facilities so they can be shifted to CCCs. As for hotels, there are some that have been converted into CCCs, such as in Bommanahalli and Mahadevapura. Some companies have also done it for their employees. Dos and Don'ts have been issued for establishment of CCCs and they need to be followed. They need to have medical backup,” he said. The guidelines include daily monitoring and medical supervision, provision of nutritious diet and separate ancillary services such as garbage management, sanitation and logistics for COVID-19 patients, among others. From the business perspective, Karnataka Tourism Forum President Sanjar Imam said though such packages may offer some relief to hotels, they may not do a great deal as far as occupancy rates are concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-tourism-takes-a-dive-hotels-offer-isolation-stay/article34672133.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Video clip exposes racket in multi-State flesh trade||The brutal assault on a young woman from Bangladesh has exposed a flesh trade racket not just in Bengaluru but in neighbouring Telangana and Kerala as well. The victim, who is in her 20s, knew the perpetrators, said the police. Two of the accused were her distant relatives as well, investigations have now revealed. “The culprits brutalised the victim over financial differences,” according to a statement from the city police. The girl, hailing from Moghbazar in Dhaka, Bangladesh, had lost contact with her family two years ago when she was planning to go to Saudi Arabia. “We don’t know whether she went to Saudi Arabia, but she now resides somewhere in India,” said Md. Shahidullah, DCP, Dhaka Metropolitan Police at a press conference on Thursday. The Bengaluru Police, who tracked down and rescued the girl from Kozhikode in Kerala, confirmed that she went to Dubai in the UAE where she was pushed into the flesh trade and also worked as a bar dancer for nearly a year. She shifted to India a few months ago at the behest of her distant relative Mohammed Baba Sheikh, who was running a prostitution ring in the city. Sheikh is married to a distant relative of the victim. His wife is also an accused and under arrest. Sheikh and his associates allegedly trafficked women from Bangladesh promising them jobs in beauty saloons or as domestic helpers in India, and ran a prostitution ring in Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala. The victim joined this group, but had a bitter fallout with them, sources said. She allegedly parted ways with them and shifted to Kozhikode where she started a massage parlour. This was the source of the financial dispute between the accused and the victim. “The woman was brought back to Bengaluru under the pretext of resolving the financial dispute. As she entered the house, the men got extremely violent, physically assaulted her, sexually abused and brutalised her, recording videos on their mobile phones, all the while egged on by the two women,” said a senior police official. “Apart from the video that has gone viral, we have recovered two more videos from the mobile phones of the accused. They recorded the videos to blackmail her. They allegedly threatened to upload the clips on social media if she did not pay them. One such video was circulated, which led to the case coming to light.” The victim did not approach the police. She called her boyfriend, who rescued her from the house a day after the incident. The duo went back to Kozhikode, sources said. A day later, a few men, suspected to be hired by the victim’s boyfriend, allegedly beat up the four accused. They too did not approach the police. The victim underwent a medical examination in Bengaluru on Friday night. The police are yet to question her, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/video-clip-exposes-racket-in-multi-state-flesh-trade/article34672141.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccine service charge hiked by Rs. 100 in private hospitals||Karnataka government has fixed new service charge for vaccines at Rs. 200 per dose, up from the earlier Rs. 100. The Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) had sought a revision of service charges for vaccination from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 per dose. PHANA, in a representation to the government, had sought a revision stating that unlike the earlier phases, vaccination now in private sector was through purchase of the vaccine vials from the supplier at a cost nearly 4-8 times that they paid the government earlier. “Each hospital needs to spend money on cold chain logistics, safe storage and pilferage protection. Considering the large numbers of people that need to be vaccinated in a short period of time, extended vaccination timings, on site set up of vaccination booths etc., may cost us more,” stated PHANA’s letter. The letter states: “Front-end personnel need to have proper PPE, which would add to the costs. Besides, safe distancing in vaccination sites is going to add to the money spent on physical areas, and quality of care and trained personnel to be deployed would increase costs.” Opposition leader Siddaramaiah alleged that the government is buckling to pressure from private hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccine-service-charge-hiked-by-rs-100-in-private-hospitals/article34672140.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Parallel proceedings initiated against company quashed||The High Court of Karnataka has said that the provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment (KPIDFE) Act, 2004, cannot be invoked against a company after the initiation of proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Justice H.P. Sandesh delivered the verdict while quashing the separate proceedings initiated under the KPIDFE Act against Dreamz Infra India Pvt. Ltd., a real estate company, for recovering Rs. 385 crore. The amount was collected by the firm from around 3,600 home buyers promising them flats in its projects, but it failed to deliver the flats. The court passed the order whileallowing a petition filed by the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for Dreamz Infra questioning the legality of the parallel proceedings initiated by the State government under theKPIDFE Act. The court noted that the NCLT, in August 2019, had initiated the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code based on petitions filed by home buyers and the State government had invoked the proceedings under the KPIDFE Act, 2004. Pointing out that the apex court had held that IBC prevails over the State enactments and there cannot be any other civil proceedings when the matter is sub judice before the NCLT, the High Court said that in the present case the home buyers had invoked the IBC. However, the court made it clear that the State authorities, if the need arose, could proceed against the company after the conclusion of the proceedings before the NCLT. The court declined to accept the claim made on behalf of the company that it was not a financial institution for invoking provisions of the KPIDFE Act. It pointed out that the company itself had not disputed the fact that it had collected the money but then neither refunded the money nor allotted the flats to the home buyers who investedtheir money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parallel-proceedings-initiated-against-company-quashed/article34672156.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 800 crore in last year’s package reached no one, says Cong. MLA||Karnataka Congress has termed as an “eyewash” the Rs. 1,111.82 crore package announced by the State and said the government’s performance was poor in the implementation of last year’s package announced for people impacted by the lockdown. Nearly Rs. 800 crore announced in last year’s package was not given to farmers, weavers, construction workers and other poor sections impacted by COVID-19, said former Minister and MLA Krishna Byre Gowda. The State government had announced a package of around Rs. 2,300 crore last year. Though the fiscal position of the State was better compared to other States, the BJP government did not provide relief to thepeople who needed it most during the crisis, he said, demanding a minimum compensation of Rs. 10,000 to the people impacted by the lockdown. In last year’s package, out of Rs. 137 crore announced for horticultural farmers, only Rs. 58 crore was released in the package. For flower growers, the government promisedRs. 31 crore but released Rs. 15 crore,said Mr. Gowda. The government said Rs. 5,000 compensation would be given to people of Savita Samaj. About 2.3 lakh members were expected to benefit, but only 55,466 beneficiaries received the relief in the package, he claimed. Out of 7.75 lakh autorickshaw drivers, only 2.14 lakh drivers received the relief of Rs. 5,000 each. With regard to the construction workers, the Congress leader said that out of 16.48 lakh workers, only five lakh received the relief from the cess collected under the construction workers’ fund. It was decided that 1.25 lakh weavers would get the relief, but only 49,745 benefited in last year’s package, the former Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-800-crore-in-last-years-package-reached-no-one-says-cong-mla/article34672159.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 13,200 crore transferred in three years through DBT||In the past three years, Rs. 13,200 crore has been transferred to the bank accounts of various beneficiaries of government schemes in Karnataka via the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The benefits of 117 schemes across 20 departments were disbursed through the DBT platform. At a virtual press conference on Friday, Rajeev Chawla, Additional Chief Secretary of DPAR (E-governance), said that DBT has enabled government schemes to reach the right beneficiaries as the money is deposited directly in their accounts, seeded with Aadhaar numbers. Farming sector Emphasising its benefit in the agricultural sector, he said the State has a database of 70 lakh farmers with details such as ownership of farmland, type of soil, crops grown, and more. The database has been named FRUITS — Farmer Registration and Unified Beneficiary Information System. On how the platform has brought more transparency, he said, “Farmers in the State are availing the benefits of government schemes by just providing their farmer ID. For example, the payment of Minimum Support Price is done after verifying the details available in the database supported by Bhoomi, farm survey and others. Earlier, people who did not have agricultural land used to receive MSP by selling crops of other farmers. Middlemen too exploited the system by procuring produce from farmers and selling it at the MSP centre. Now, all the payments are done after verifying the records.” Of the total schemes, 37 pertain to the agricultural sector, including the PM-Kisan Samman, incentive for milk producers, COVID-related relief packages, and more. The platform is also being used to deposit honorariums to the bank accounts of Accredited Social Health Activists, anganwadi workers, and pourakarmikas. In the past three years, 320 lakh transactions amounting Rs. 10,000 crore have been made to them using the DBT platform. The department has already introduced a DBT mobile app that helps track the status of Aadhaar and bank account seeding and the payment details under various government schemes. Facial recognition   Mr. Chawla said that tobring in more transparency, the department is contemplating introducing a facial recognition system for people who want to claim ration. On the second COVID-19 relief package announced by the government, he said on the first day (May 27) for receiving applications from auto, taxi, and maxi cab drivers, close to 45,000 drivers applied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-13200-crore-transferred-in-three-years-through-dbt/article34672164.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State begins consultations with paediatric experts to prepare for third wave||With experts cautioning that the third wave of COVID-19 may hit children the most, Karnataka has begun preparations to equip itself to tackle an imminent outbreak. State Health Director Om Prakash Patil, who held consultations with 17 experts and members of the state unit of Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP) on Friday, said the State will come out with guidelines on handling paediatric COVID-19 infections. “We discussed on what can be done to prevent spread among children and how we can ramp up our infrastructure and train manpower to handle paediatric cases, if at all the projections come true,” he said. Shivananda, former director of the State-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, who attended the meeting, said what the State needs is more manpower trained in handling child cases as the existing number of paediatricians may not be adequate. “Only a fraction of the infected child cases may require ventilators. Most of the new ventilators come with settings that can be adjusted for paediatric use. What the State may require is more paediatric BIPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines and paediatric ICU beds,” he said. “Also, as home isolation of infected children is very difficult without parents’ supervision, we have asserted that vaccination of parents should be given priority. If they are immunised, the risk of getting infected while handling positive children will be minimal,” he added. V. Ravi, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), who first cautioned the State about children likely to be the most hit during the third wave, said the focus should be on having separate COVID-19 beds for children at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. “Whether the third wave comes or not, this is the time to invest on our paediatric health infrastructure and it will not go waste,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/consultations-with-paediatric-experts-begin/article34672147.ece

The device, designed and developed by Cardiac Design Labs in Bengaluru is a monitoring system that can record all vital parameters such as ECG, heart rate, respiration rate, SpO2 (oxygen saturation), body temperature and BP without the cuff. The firm has given the institute 50 devices for free. Jayadeva director C.N. Manjunath said the device called ‘Padma Vitals’ has been developed by Anand Madanagopal, founder of Cardiac Design Labs, and S. Jayaprakash, electrophysiologist, and their teams. “It is a versatile device that needs to be strapped around the chest at the level of the heart. We are using it on 50 patients in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards in our institute. It can also be used to monitor home isolation patients,” he said. “The device is connected to the mobile phones of doctors and the readings can be monitored remotely on the phone,” Dr Manjunath said. “As a vitals trend report is generated for the duration of monitoring, we can identify early signs of cardiac issues,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jayadeva-uses-wearable-device-to-remote-monitor-icu-patients/article34672145.ece

The All India Agarbathi Manufacturers’ Association (AIAMA), which represents more than 800 agarbathi manufacturers, has said that despite the COVID-induced restrictions such as lockdown and several logistical hurdles, the industry has managed to maintain its sales volumes. “We have already regained nearly 90% of our pre-pandemic levels,” the association said, reiterating its commitment to supporting around four lakh of its employees in challenging times. The agarbathi industry is a labour-intensive sector and manufactures have been extending support to the ecosystem players to tide over the crisis, as per the apex body. Arjun Ranga, president of AIAMA, said, “As soon as the pandemic hit the industry, we rallied to keep the demand-supply chain intact both in the domestic and export markets. This, coupled with the consumers’ growing preference for yoga, meditation and well-being, helped the industry sail through the difficulties and recover from the slowdown fast. It also helped the industry retain jobs and sales.” Vaccination The industry is currently busy holding vaccination drives for its employees. India’s agarbathi sector, pegged at Rs. 8,500 crore inclusive of exports worth Rs. 1,000 crore, has been growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 3.6% in the past many years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/agarbathi-industry-posts-good-sales-volume/article34672150.ece

Meti while in power. On Thursday, Congress leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Bommai on the charges of giving protection to former Minister and BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi in the alleged sex-for-job scam. On Friday, Mr. Bommai said Congress leaders had no right to preach morality when the former Congress regime had handed over the case to the CID and “given a clean chit” toMr. Meti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommai-hits-back-at-cong-leaders/article34672157.ece

29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Demand has dipped 40%||The chief procurement official of a leading retail grocer in Bengaluru said the overall volume of trade in vegetables and fruits has dipped by at least 40%, whereas the demand has almost been wiped out in the case of flowers. “We are working only in a small window of four hours every day. In several districts, this window is now being offered only three days a week. Moreover, there are neither hotels nor any public gatherings such as weddings. We have reduced the procurement volume,” the official said. Umesh Mirji, managing director of HOPCOMS, acknowledged the drop in demand in the market and said the society was trying its best to maintain procurement volumes, but disruption of transport networks had hit farmers and the market hard. This has led to a price crash in the wholesale market, though the same cannot be said of the retail market, which is seeing a price inflation owing to the lockdown and scarce supply because of disrupted transport networks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demand-has-dipped-40/article34672160.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Connecting farmers and bulk buyers||To help farmers find a good market for their produce, the State government is coming out with a plan to connect them to bulk purchasers and supermarkets such as Big Basket and More. Under the ‘E Sahamati’ project, with the consent of farmers, details of the crops, vegetables and fruits they are growing will be shared with the purchasers. According to Mr. Chawla, the initiative will help farmers directly contact bulk purchasers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/connecting-farmers-and-bulk-buyers/article34672161.ece
29 May 2021||Bengaluru/Hassan/Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Farmers left high and dry by lockdown||Chandrakanth Rama, a small farmer in Kalaburagi district, had two acres of onion and ladies finger yet to be harvested when the lockdown was imposed in the last week of April. As a result, while transport costs skyrocketed, prices crashed so severely that he decided not to harvest the crop at all. The price offered was not even the quarter of what he would need to meet the costs. “If I sell at these rates, I will incur heavy losses considering what it costs to harvest and transport. So I am feeding the ladies finger to my cattle. As for the onions, I have asked the labourers to harvest and take home as much as they want for free,” Mr. Rama told The Hindu . Produce dumped This is the story of many farmers across Karnataka. A video clip of a watermelon grower in Sagar, Shivamogga, destroying his crop in frustration was widely shared. There was another of a jasmine grower dumping his harvest on the streets in the district, cursing the administration for the lockdown. Many tomato growers in Kolar and Chickballapur recently protested by throwing their produce on the street. “A kilo of tomato was selling at less than Rs. 2, which wouldn’t have even recovered my transport cost, leave alone my investment. So I abandoned the crop at the market and returned,” said Adi Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar. The fall in demand for vegetables, fruits and flowers, the disruption of transport networks, and high transport costs following the Statewide lockdown imposed for the past three weeks have hit these farmers hard.  Despite the lockdown guidelines clearly allowing free movement of all cargo, transport networks have been disrupted, especially inter-district and inter-State ones. “For two weeks, vegetables were not being sent out of the State. This has now been resolved. The price of tomatoes improved to Rs. 7 to Rs. 9 a kg only after the supply to other States, including West Bengal and Bangladesh, resumed,” said G. Srinivasan, a farmer from Nandi and a member of HOPCOMS. He also said transport operators were charging several times more than usual, citing the lockdown, police harassment, and skyrocketing diesel prices. “Diesel prices have touched an unprecedented Rs. 90 a litre. This has also added to the farmers’ woes,” he said. ‘Inadequate relief’ The State government sop of Rs. 10,000 a hectare (Rs. 4,000 an acre) for vegetable, fruit and flower growers has been dubbed “woefully inadequate” by farmers and farmers’ unions. “The amount they have promised to grant us does not compensate for the loss we are facing every day,” said Ganesh, a farmer from Hassan. Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said, “Not only is Rs. 4,000 an acre inadequate, the total outlay for this sop is less than Rs. 100 crore, which evidently shows not all farmers will get this relief as well.”  (With inputs by K.V.

Eshwarappa and BJP legislators have come down heavily on Minister C.P. Yogeshwar for his comments on the functioning of the B.S. Yediyurappa-led government in the State. Mr. Eshwarappa, speaking to presspersons in Shivamogga on Friday, said that if Mr. Yogeshwar was upset with the party, he could quit his Ministerial post and leave the party. “The government is functioning well while handling COVID-19. He [Mr. Yogeshwar] went to Delhi to meet party leaders. The BJP gives opportunities to its members to express their differences, if any. The party’s senior leaders will take them into consideration, if there is any truth in such opinion,” he said. BJP senior leader and MLC Ayanur Manjunath said that Mr. Yogeshwar was a migrant to the party. He could not win elections on his own. He has no moral right to speak about a change in leadership. “If he has no confidence in the Chief Minister, he should quit the Cabinet. The Chief Minister should remove him from Cabinet,” he said. In Hassan, BJP MLA Preetham Gowda also commented that party workers will not give importance to Mr. Yogeshwar’s comments as he has no role in building the party. “The party gave him B Form in the last Assembly polls. He could not win. Yet, he was made an MLC and inducted into the Cabinet. He should understand his limits. He should stop talking about Mr. Yediyurappa and party office-bearer B.Y. Vijayendra,” he said. Kateel meets Ravi Meanwhile, BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel met party’s national general secretary and Chikkamagaluru MLA C.T. Ravi in Chikkamagaluru on Friday. During his visit to the city, he told media persons that there is no question of effecting a change in leadership. “All elected representatives of the party should concentrate on protecting people from COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eshwarappa-senior-party-leaders-come-down-heavily-on-yogeshwar/article34672184.ece

29 May 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Early rain ushers in farming activities in twin districts||Notwithstanding COVID-19 lockdown, farmers in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi have commenced farming activities encouraged by pre-monsoon showers augmented with rain brought by Tauktae and Yaas cyclones. As has been the convention, farmers are transporting manure from their cowsheds and manure pits to their paddy fields, initially to prepare Agedi (small field to raise paddy shoot saplings) and later, to paddy fields. “We used pick-up vans to transport the manure amid the 10 a.m. deadline under COVID-19 restrictions,” said Gulabi, a farmer in Padukone village of Udupi district. “While going back home, we use the by-lanes instead of the main road to avoid enforcement officials,” she said, narrating the restriction woes affecting farming activities. Large tracts of farm land in many villages can be seen dotted with dumps of cowshed manure, while farmers are using power tillers to prepare land for paddy shoots. Some of them also use pairs of bullocks or buffaloes for the purpose. Narasimha is one such farmer helping his neighbours with his bullocks to till land in Padukone village. More than 90% of paddy seeds out of the about 2,000 quintals estimated for paddy crop in Udupi has already been distributed, said H. Kempe Gowda, Joint Director of Agriculture in Udupi district. About 1,700 quintals of MO4, 175 quintals of Jyoti and 50 quintals of Uma varieties have been distributed to farmers so far, he said. The district has more farm land meant for paddy cultivation (36,000 hectares) compared to Dakshina Kannada (10,000 hectares). The target for paddy cultivation in Dakshina Kannada is about 10,000 hectares this season, said M.C. Seetha, Joint Director of Agriculture in Dakshina Kannada. About 300 quintals of paddy seeds have been distributed so far out of the estimated 1,000 quintals. As in the previous year, the department expects more extents of land getting cultivated for two reasons — initiative to cultivate barren paddy fields and those returning from cities getting engaged in farming activities — this year too. With the South West Monsoon expected to hit the coastal region by May-end or first week of June, farmers are hopeful of a bountiful paddy crop this year. Last year too, farmers did raise a good crop with monsoon bringing in adequate rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/early-rain-ushers-in-farming-activities-in-twin-districts/article34672179.ece

Asked how young he was, Narasimha smiled, while his neighbour, Gulabi, whose land he was tilling, said he must be 75 or more. “He is the only farmer in the entire village who has a pair of bullocks for tilling land. He helps his neighbours in their work. Everyone else has opted for power tillers to get their land tilled,” she said. Asked how he manages to till land at his advanced age, a beaming Narasimha replied that he will do it till he has energy left in his body. “I do not want to depend upon others for my work or earning,” he said. The only thing he was finding difficult this season was that the paddy fields have become a little more marshy due to continuous rainfall. “I cannot easily drive the bullocks in this knee-deep slush,” he said, while continuing ploughing land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/at-75-he-is-raring-to-go/article34672178.ece

The journalists were pushed and shoved aside by a policeman on duty while another looked on. The mobile from which the scene was being recorded, by a woman journalist, was snatched and the journalists pushed out of the venue. Sources said that there was a long queue, nearby 1 km long, and hundreds of ex-servicemen were awaiting their turn to make purchases from the army canteen. The rush was attributed to the small window for purchase (from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.). It is said that many had been in queue since the crack of dawn. Sources said this could have been avoided had the authorities in charge of the canteen issued tokens and mentioned a timing, based on which the potential customers could get to the store without creating a gathering. The Kodagu District Journalists’ Association and the local press club members have condemned the incident. A police complaint has been lodged to identify and nab the person who manhandled the woman journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/scribes-roughed-up-by-police/article34672152.ece

The National Highways Authority of India is identifying the location in each city to help the DRDO set up the plants at the earliest. At Mysuru, the plant will either be set up on the premises of K.R. Hospital or the district hospital, both of which have been treating COVID-19 patients since the last wave. In Bengaluru, the two plants are proposed at Command Hospital Air Force and ESIC PGIMSR and Model Hospital, Rajajinagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drdo-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-in-six-cities/article34672151.ece

They brutalised the victim over financial differences,” a statement from the city police said. It is yet to be ascertained whether the accused and the victim have valid travel documents, sources said. The case received wide attention across South Asia, prompting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai to personally monitor the case, sources said. Mr. Yediyurappa termed the crime “a brutal inhuman act” which the government will not tolerate. “Those who have perpetrated this crime have already been arrested and the State will ensure they will get the most stringent punishment,” he said. All the six accused have been remanded into 14-day police custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-police-trace-victim-to-kerala/article34672142.ece

29 May 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Few vaccine takers at Vattavada||Many are queueing up in front of COVID-19 vaccination centres all over the State. However, in Vattavada, Idukki, health workers have been struggling to convince the panchayat’s residents to get vaccinated. A Health Department official said very few people had turned up at vaccination camps. The health workers are now persuading the ‘Oorumooppans’ (chieftains) of settlements to bring the residents to the vaccination centres. Reluctance in testing Vattavada has a population of around 7,500, and only 972 vaccines have been administered so far. The reluctance is evident not just in being inoculated, but also in undergoing COVID-19 tests. With a recent spike in cases, it has become difficult for health workers to visit homes and subject residents to tests. Shortage in Kanthallur So far, 820 positive cases have been reported in Vattavada, with 189 active cases. The Samiyarala settlement has the largest number of live cases now — 33. In nearby Kanthallur, there are 52 active cases. An official of the grama panchayat said that Kanthallur began to witness a spurt in positive cases only recently. He attributed it to the delay in taking preventive measures. The official said there was a shortage of vaccines and the administration had requested 500 vials for immediate delivery. Both Vattavada and Kanthallur are vegetable growing villages where the tribespeople and local residents follow a community system of living with the farmlands lying away from their residential areas. Campaign in Marayur In Marayur grama panchayat, officials have been campaigning at the Thayannankudy tribal settlement on the need for taking COVID-19 vaccines and for conducting tests on those showing symptoms of the disease.  So far 820 positive cases have been reported in Vattavada, 189 of them active cases||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/few-vaccine-takers-at-vattavada/article34672632.ece

The programme, being organised in association with the Tribal Development Department, is aimed at ensuring vaccination against the pandemic to all tribespeople above 45 years old. The district administration has set up special vehicle facilities to bring tribal people from their hamlets to the nearby primary health centres for vaccination. According to the data of the Tribal Development Department, 43,992 tribespeople are identified as above 45 years old in the district. Of them, as many as 13,994 persons were provided the first dose of the vaccine, while 5,323 persons got the second dose. The remaining 29,998 persons would be vaccinated in the drive. If anyone showed reluctance to attend the camp, they would be vaccinated at their hamlet itself in the coming days, District Collector Adeela Abdulla said. The vaccination drive will conclude on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccination-drive-for-tribespeople/article34672311.ece
29 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||TPR over 50% in two panchayats in Ernakulam||The COVID test positivity rate (TPR), calculated as a seven-day average, remains over 50% in two panchayats in the district — Chellanam and Manjalloor. Going by figures available on Friday morning, Edavanakkad, Elamkunnapuzha, and Mulavukad have a TPR between 40% and 50%. Kumbalanghi, Keezhmad, Alangad, Njarakkal, Kadamakudy, Kavalangad, Payipra, Vengola, and Chengamanad were among panchayats with a TPR between 30% and 40%. The Kochi Corporation and Maradu, Thripunithura, Eloor, Kalamassery and Thrikkakara municipalities have TPRs in the 20% to 30% range. Chellanam has a total of 549 active cases, as per figures recorded on Thursday. The District Surveillance Unit, which collates data and prepares an estimate of the expected situation every two weeks, cautions that TPR is not the only factor that determines the severity of the spread of the infection. Officials pointed out that the TPR fluctuates depending on testing in a particular area on any day and must be considered along with other factors, including case fatality rate, and number of seriously ill patients and active cases. In terms of the number of active cases, the Kochi Corporation has the highest with 6,667 cases. While the district’s TPR had fallen to a figure below 20% on Thursday, ICU admissions have seen only a slight dip. The number of patients in ICUs has seen a fall from 554 on May 20 to 507 patients recovering in the ICU as of Friday morning. Of those admitted with COVID in the ICU, a majority (129 people) were in the 61 to 70 age bracket, followed by 110 patients between 51 and 60 years. A total of 138 patients are on ventilator support. A total of 2,807 patients were hospitalised as of May 27, a fall from 3,081 hospitalised patients on May 23. Between April 23 and May 7, the district recorded 64,308 new cases, followed by 61,709 from May 7 to May 21. In the two weeks since then, the surveillance unit estimates a fall in new cases. Its estimates peg the total number of cases between May 22 and June 4 to be between 30,000 and 40,000. Considering the high TPR in Chellanam, a special vaccination drive will be organised in the area from Monday onwards, going by a release from the district administration. The high TPR can be attributed to the spread of the infection among people who were displaced due to sea incursion, the release noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tpr-over-50-in-two-panchayats-in-ernakulam/article34672305.ece
29 May 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cong. for review of Lakshadweep reforms||Congress leaders led by AICC secretary P. Vishwanathan submitted a memorandum of opinion to Ankit Agarwal, Administrative Officer of the Lakshadweep Administration’s Kochi and Mangaluru offices, on Friday, demanding a review of the recent “anti-people regulations” implemented in the islands and their revocation. “Lakshadweep was a place where people and the administration were in complete harmony with each other. This congruence may not exist any further, as your administration seems to betray its people by introducing various draconian and undemocratic reforms,” the memorandum said. The discriminative decisions include the ill-conceived Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation 2021 in the ecologically-sensitive area. It will contravene the integrated island management plan formulated as per a Supreme Court order. There is no scope for “town planning” in Lakshadweep, and real estate development schemes contemplated in the regulations will be highly destructive of the environment, culture, and ethos of the island. Forcible dispossession of the native inhabitants from their land to facilitate real estate projects is unconstitutional. It is clear that the real intention behind the regulation is land-grabbing, dispossession of natives from their land, and thrusting an unsustainable development model for the island. The invoking of the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation, 2021 (Goonda Act) in Lakahadweep, where crime rate is next to nil may lead to misuse of its clauses. The ban on beef where 100% population is non-vegetarian is against their cultural and religious customs. The decision permitting liquor in hotels and resorts in the name of tourism promotion goes against the ethos of the Muslim majority island which remained a non-alcoholic zone. The dismissal of casual and contractual workers has left them with an uncertain future. Decisions like changes in quarantine standard operating procedures  resulted in the first COVID case in the isles on January 18. This led to its rapid spread and death of over two dozen people, said the memorandum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-for-review-of-lakshadweep-reforms/article34672309.ece
29 May 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Centuries-old structure emerges along Fort Kochi beach||A laterite underwater foundation, possibly part of the 1503 Portuguese-built Fort Emmanuel, has emerged along the Fort Kochi beach reviving enthusiasm among history buffs on the city’s ancient structural remains. “Nearly eight rows of the foundation consisting of laterite stones became visible two days ago. The underwater structure emerged after seawater receded following low tide,” says Taha Ibrahim, a history enthusiast, who was part of a team that retrieved 11 pieces of granite and one of laterite of historical value from the seafront in February. “The foundation may be the remains of a signal tower located near Fort Emmanuel,” he says. K. Harikumar, documentation assistant with the State Archaeology Department and in-charge of the museum at Bastion Bungalow, says further studies are required to ascertain whether the laterite foundation is part of the signal tower. “But it can be possibly connected to Fort Emmanuel,” he says. Fort Emmanuel was the first fort made by a European power in Asia. It was overrun by the Dutch a hundred years later. The British later used these buildings for housing and military purposes. E. Dinesan, Director of the Archaeology Department, recalls that similar laterite structures were spotted in Fort Kochi two years ago. “However, we could not carry out further investigation, as the remains were underwater and strong waves hampered the research,” he says. Suggesting that the region demanded research based on marine archaeology, Mr. Dinesan says the period to which these structures belonged can be confirmed only after further research. “We have plans to take up a detailed study on the remains emerging along the Fort Kochi beach,” he says. The pieces of granite and laterite slabs and stones recovered from the site in February had been shifted to the garden of the Bastion Bungalow Museum. History enthusiasts had joined hands to retrieve the remains after a few historically important buildings were razed to the ground for the Water Metro work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centuries-old-structure-emerges-along-fort-kochi-beach/article34672339.ece

The Administrator is duty-bound to act in accordance with the aspirations of the local population. But the present Administrator has set at rest precedents and has usurped powers that were enjoyed by the district panchayat, challenging the peaceful living of the islanders. Efforts are on to unilaterally impose laws that infringe on the fundamental freedoms of people, including on food, travel, and jobs. The move to divert cargo ships from the isles, which used to call at Beypore, to Mangaluru is an example. They are also at odds with India’s federal structure, said KSSP State president A.P. Muralidharan. There is every reason to suspect that efforts are under way to cause division on the basis of religion, Parishad general secretary Radhan K. said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-rules-at-odds-with-federal-structure/article34672307.ece

The festival, which grew in stature and popularity since its first edition in 2016, would continue through the rest of the year on YouTube and elsewhere on social media. The sixth edition was scheduled to be held in January this year, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to cancel it. For the book-lovers of Kozhikode and the Malabar region, the decision had come as a disappointment. The KLF has been very much the annual cultural highlight of Malabar and thousands would come to the Kozhikode beach for four days to listen to some of the brightest minds in India and overseas speaking on a wide variety of subjects. “We thought we could do a festival online,” said A.K. Abdul Hakeem, general convenor, KLF. “We have planned a series of events, including talks and discussions by eminent personalities from literature and other fields, which will be streamed every first and second Saturday from June. Among the confirmed speakers are historian Romila Thapar and novelist Arundhati Roy.” Poetry session The inaugural day, though, belonged to poetry. About 50 poets, from nine countries, recited their poems. Among them were Asmaa Azaizeh and Amir Or, respectively from Palestine and Israel, two countries very much in the news these days. A poet from Lakshadweep was also there.

Mr. Rajeev questioned the change in diet in schools and the ban on slaughter of cows and buffaloes and sale and storage of beef on the island. He termed them an intrusion into the traditional eating habits of the islanders. BJP councillor Rineesh said there was no ban on beef, and that political parties in Kerala were trying to create a religious divide in Lakshadweep.

If the weather permitted, the dredging would begin on Saturday, Mr. Cherian said Friday. Several small fishing boats had met with accidents at the point on Tuesday night, leaving three people dead. Only a timely, night-time rescue mounted by the Coast Guard and the police had saved the lives of several others. Local fishermen had alerted Mr. Cherian and Transport Minister Antony Raju about the sand accumulation when they visited Vizhinjam. Danger to fishers The channel leading from the harbour to the sea is 93 metres wide. Wave action deposits sand in this area. As this phenomenon posed danger to fishermen, a study had been initiated for finding a lasting solution, the Minister said. With the southwest monsoon at the doorsteps, Mr. Cherian urged fishers to exercise caution while going out to sea. They were directed to use life-saving equipment, including life jackets. Mr. Cherian and Mr. Raju visited the homes of Davidson, Joseph and Xavier alias Shabariyar, the three fishermen who died in Tuesday's mishap, and handed over an interim relief of Rs. 10,000 each to their kin. Several fishing boats had met with difficulties and capsized near the harbour mouth in the lashing winds and rain on Tuesday night. Six fishermen were rescued by the Coast Guard, while two others swam to safety. The body of Davidson was found on Wednesday and those of Joseph and Xavier on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-remove-piled-up-sand-at-vizhinjam/article34672267.ece

29 May 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tiny harbinger of rains widely sighted||Sightings of Little Bloodtail, or Lyriothemis acigastra , a small, colourful and elusive dragonfly whose life cycle is tied to the southwest monsoon, has been widely recorded in the State. Large numbers of the dragonfly are known to emerge from aquatic larval stage with the first rain of June. They disappear as the southwest monsoon wanes by September. In 2015, a colony of this species of dragonfly was discovered by Jeevan Jose from Kadavoor village in Ernakulam. Over the years, dragonfly enthusiasts have sighted it from various locations across the State. Over a span of six years, Little Bloodtail had been spotted from Kasaragod, Kannur, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki. Dragonfly enthusiasts have recorded the observations in the Facebook group 'Dragonflies of Kerala'. A note on their behaviour, ecology and distribution was published in the May 2021 issue of Journal of Threatened Taxa . Historically, the species was known to be found in Tibet, Myanmar, Bangladesh and northeast India, but was first spotted in the State only in 2013 at a few locations in Kannur district. The diminutive insect measures less than 4 cm in length, and the male is blood-red in colour with black marks. In the female of the species, the red is replaced with yellow. The wings are transparent. Mystery survival "It remains a mystery how the eggs or larvae of this species survive the dry period as the irrigation canals of Kadavoor, in which it was observed laying eggs, run dry by January,” says Muhamed Sherif, who compiled the observations of the Little Bloodtail. "This dragonfly appears to show high microhabitat specificity, laying eggs in stagnant or semi-stagnant waterbodies with good algal cover. It shuns bright sunlight, preferring to feed in the evenings or on overcast days,” says Vivek Chandran, a researcher who was part of the study. The research team is part of the Society for Odonate Studies (SOS), an NGO formed for the study and conservation of dragonflies and damselflies in the State. SOS is hopeful of finding the Little Bloodtail from more localities in the coming days in the State. Dragonflies and damselflies are indicators of environmental health, and their diet primarily consists of mosquitoes and agricultural pests, thus calling for their conservation, says Mr. Chandran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tiny-harbinger-of-rains-widely-sighted/article34672629.ece

The allies met to analyse the failure and cool coalition anxieties that manifested as public spats in the aftermath of the electoral defeat. However, the spectre of infighting seemed to dog the UDF. Notably, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran was “conspicuously” absent. He had earlier told the AICC that he was willing to quit taking responsibility for the front’s poll debacle. Revolutionary Socialist Party leader Shibhu Baby John, who had lost in Chavara, stayed away from the meeting. Mr. John had vehemently blamed “Congress factionalism and organisational frailty” for the debacle. By some accounts, former Chief Minister Oomen Chandy and former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala remained mainly silent. Mr. Chandy had headed the party’s Election Management and Strategy Committee. UDF insiders said G. Devarajan of the Forward Bloc and C.P. John of the Communist Marxist Party were vociferous in their criticism of the Congress. They reportedly said that the Aiswarya Kerala Yatra by Mr. Chennithala had aggressively rallied the UDF’s base. However, the Congress squandered away the advantage by making a public spectacle out of candidate selection. Leader of the Opposition V.D.

Order issued An order issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department late Thursday stated that the hike in their prices was necessary in view of the current market analysis and a host of other factors. The government informed that the public sector Kerala Medical Services Corporation is set to procure 3 lakh PPE kits, 12 lakh N95 masks, 60 lakh triple-layer masks, 2 lakh hand sanitisers and 30 lakh gloves through a process of online sealed quotations and competitive bidding.  Besides, the company is purchasing these products directly from manufacturers, thereby ensuring a price advantage. However, such rates will not be viable for private hospital and retailers who procure items in smaller volume. The decision has also been attributed to a ‘huge’ market scarcity of surgical gloves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/price-of-covid-protective-items-goes-up/article34672326.ece

The department will procure agricultural produce, especially edible cash crops, and market them through Supplyco outlets after converting them into value-added products. In his policy address at the Assembly, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan lauded the efforts made to ensure no one starved during the pandemic.

A paradigm shift in the operation of buses would be brought in by classifying the routes as trunk road, radial road, and circular road. A hub-and-spoke model would be implemented in all depots with Puthukkad in Thrissur as central hub. The Governor said the policy of the government was to incentivise public transport, including road transport, taxis and autorickshaws. Private transport modes would be dis-incentivised to reduce traffic blocks, pollution, and accidents. All heavy vehicles and public transport vehicles would be encouraged to switch over to green fuels. Installation of GPS devices would be made compulsory for all public service vehicles. The government would strictly implement the policy of “footpath for pedestrians and road for vehicles” to reduce accidents in urban areas. The number of accidents would be brought down in five years.

He said an electronic file processing system would be implemented in all government establishments to ensure timely action and more transparency. The government’s aim was to provide all services online to citizens without any applicant having to visit a government office. A project for implementing this would be inaugurated on October 2 this year. More Wi-Fi hotspots The K-FON project with a vision to ensure last-mile connectivity to government offices in the State and to provide free high-speed Internet to poor families would be expanded. More Wi-Fi hotspots, in addition to the existing ones, would be set up. Infrastructure build-up of major projects, including the Technology Innovation Zone (TIZ), Kalamassery and Village Knowledge Centre, Kannur, would be commissioned by Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited. Kalamassery would be turned into one of the biggest hardware ecosystems in the country with the launching of TIZ, said the Governor. An open-source platform was being developed by the Electronics and Information Technology Department, which would soon link all the stakeholders. This was in addition to the already existing e-market platform. This programme would create at least 1,00,000 jobs every year, said the Governor.  The government would ensure fast-track development of 481 acres of Kinfra Petrochemical Park in Ambalamugal with all supporting infrastructure for the anchor investor BPCL and 13 other units. The Kochi-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (KBIC) would be fast-tracked by developing Palakkad as a node and GIFT (Global Industrial Finance and Trade) City as the hub in Kochi. This initiative was likely to generate investments of Rs. 20,000 crore and had an employment potential of 15,000. The Kochi-Palakkad Industrial Corridor would be developed to overcome the logistic cost and hurdles of bringing goods from outside the State, said the Governor. Spices Park A Spices Park is proposed to be developed by Kinfra at Thodupuzha. Integrated Rice Technology Parks (IRTP) are planned by Kinfra at Palakkad and Alappuzha districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-new-project-citizens-will-get-all-services-online/article34672264.ece
29 May 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Ensure vaccines, CM tells Modi||Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi again, requesting him to take measures for the continuous supply of vaccines. People are apprehensive about when they can get the protection afforded by the vaccines. In his letter, Mr. Vijayan said the State had been able to cover 49% of its 1.13 crore population above 45 years with at least one dose of vaccine and only 22 % of those who received the first dose have been administered the second dose. This left more than half of the population above 45 years without even a single dose of vaccine. In the 18-44 age group, though a population of 1.5 crore had to be covered, the scarcity of vaccine meant that only a few in this age group can be given the vaccine. Though the State had tried to order one crore vaccine doses, it received only 8.84 lakh doses. The State had been administering 2.5 lakh doses of vaccines every day before vaccine scarcity hit. The vaccination drive in the State has slowed down and this was worrying people.

A new order issued by the government says those going abroad would now get vaccination certificates issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department, wherein the passport number would be recorded. With many countries insisting on a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate for travel clearance, those waiting to go abroad had been in a fix. The certificates issued through the CoWin portal did not indicate the passport number of the beneficiary, as the current settings ask for Aadhaar or other photo ID proof. Brand name Another issue affecting travel clearance was that many countries insisted on certificates with the brand name of the vaccine as Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/people-going-abroad-to-get-vaccine-priority/article34672322.ece

Special teams had been formed to find her after a video clip of the incident went viral on social media. Six people — four men and two women — have been arrested. The young woman, believed to be in her 20s, had not only been tortured and raped, but was also being blackmailed by the gang who threatened to upload the video on social media if she did not pay them, said senior police officials. The victim, who was reportedly running a massage parlour in Kozhikode, underwent a medical examination in the city on Friday night. The police are yet to question her, sources said. Two of the arrested were shot at in the leg when they allegedly tried to attack the police and tried to flee during the crime scene reconstruction early on Friday. The police fired three rounds — one in the air and two at the accused, reportedly in self defence. The two — Ridoy Babu, 26, and Sadar, 23, — are recovering at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said that one of the woman arrested is a distant relative of the victim and the wife of another accused. The two women were in the house when the victim was sexually abused and brutalised and they allegedly egged on the men and assisted them. “All the six hail from Bangladesh and are part of the same group. They brutalised the victim over financial differences,” a statement from the city police said. It is yet to be ascertained whether the accused and the victim have valid travel documents, sources said. The case received wide attention across South Asia, prompting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai to personally monitor the case, sources said.

29 May 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lockdown violators shifted to COVID-19 isolation centres||Lockdown violators in at least four districts -- Peddapalli, Mancherial, Kumaram Bheem-Asifabad and Rajanna-Sircilla -- are whisked away by the police for confinement at isolation centres for a few hours on the pretext of counselling for not heeding to the norm to stay indoors. After identifying the violators, the police were seen taking them in trucks to COVID isolation centres in the districts. This act of police has earned public wrath as violators complain that the law enforcement personnel at best can impose fines and seize the vehicles, but taking them to an isolation centre where COVID-19 positive patients are being treated is beyond the mandate given to them. The police are telling the violators that they will be kept at the isolation centre for week. “As I was going on the road, the policemen disembarked from the vehicle, came up to me, frisked and pushed me into a truck where another half-a-dozen people were huddled together,” said a youngster from Godavarikhani town. He along with ‘fellow violators’ were taken to a COVID isolation centre where dozens of positive patients were being treated and was counselled by a police officer and doctors there, who were wearing PPE kit. “They threatened to admit us in the centre if we are seen on the streets again,” the youngster said. While the police of Ramagundam Commissionerate which enjoys jurisdiction over Peddapalli and Mancherial districts started this initiative on Thursday, their counterparts in Rajanna-Sircilla followed it on Friday. When contacted, Ramagundam Police Commissioner V Satyanarayana told The Hindu that they have deployed seven COVID-19 isolation vehicles, each one at Peddapalli, Manthani, Ramagundam, Sultanabad, and two at Godavarikhani police station limits. The violators are counselled and let off. “The initiative was started on Thursday and on Friday we can see the difference. No body is coming on to the roads. From Saturday, we will restart the process and send them to isolation centres if tested positive for the virus,” he said. “We have taken up this exercise to prevent the spread of virus and show the violators how people are suffering,” Mr. Satyanarayana said. He said that other units, including Karimnagar Police Commissionerate and Rajanna-Sircilla have followed their initiative. Meanwhile, Sircilla DSP P Chandrashekar said they have resorted to this of policing to create ‘fear’ among the lockdown violators and prevent them from repeating. “It is in the interest and well-being of violators and fellow citizens. They are let off after counselling,” he said.  It is in the interest and well-being of violators and fellow citizens.

29 May 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||More voices against Lakshadweep changes||The Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation 2021 (LDAR) will destroy the delicate ecosystem of the coral isles, and the life and livelihood of the islanders, three prominent people, including former Administrator of Lakshadweep Wajahat Habibullah, who also served as Chairman of National Commission for Minorities, have said in a letter submitted to Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu and Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan. Signatories The other signatories are Mohini Giri, former Chairperson of National Commission for Women, and Syeda Hameed, former Member of Planning Commission (in charge of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep). The unique land and its ethnic community structure withstood the vagaries of ocean and weather. The carrying capacity of 22 sq km area of the inhabited isles would be stretched to their limit by the indiscriminate expansion of tourism and various projects proposed under the euphemistic title of ‘planning and development’, they said. In a nutshell, these projects would destroy the life of the people, the signatories said. The recent policy changes, proposed unilaterally and arbitrarily, had given no consideration to matters like land use, land ownership, ocean-resource utilisation, and livelihood practices of the community. The culture and traditions of people who lived there had been violated by intervention into their food ethos (beef ban, opening liquor shops etc). They would also tear apart their traditional methods of decision-making based on democratic decentralisation, the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/more-voices-against-lakshadweep-changes/article34672063.ece

29 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Demand soars for indoor games equipment||Playing indoors is the new normal. Thanks to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent 18-hour lockdown, playing outdoor games is strictly prohibited. With educational institutions shut and examinations put off, playing indoor games has turned out to be the favourite pastime for many. And this has shot up the sales of equipment pertaining to the indoor games. With the demand soaring, sports dealers are running out of stocks. Carrom board, chess board, ludo, housie, and trump cards are much sought after. Though the sale of shuttlecocks and racquets too picked up, it is not on the lines of indoor games equipment, say several shopkeepers. And, there are no takers for cricket kits at all, they add. Dealers who usually sell four or five chess boards per day are selling about 15 now. Similarly, housie sales range between 10 and 20 pieces per day. The sale of racquets is not less than 30 daily, they say. The sale of carrom boards has almost doubled to about 10 to 15 pieces a day, said Gautham Reddy and Murali Krishna of Lakshmi Ganapathi Sports Planet. “The sale of indoor games equipment has picked up. But business is as usual as there are no institutional sales (schools and colleges). Prices have been increased by 5%,” says D. Srinivas Rao, a shopkeeper at Gandhi Nagar. “Stocks have almost exhausted. Supplies from Kolkata, Meerut and Jalandhar have either come down, or stopped due to lockdown,” says Thimmaya of General Sports. The price of a chess board ranges between Rs. 100 and Rs. 2,000, while a carrom board is priced anywhere between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 10,000. “Indoor games have become the popular entertainment now. The price doesn’t matter,” says Vijayanand, who has purchased carrom and chess boards for his children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/demand-soars-for-indoor-games-equipment/article34672689.ece
29 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Towards making women empowerment a reality||To empower women by raising their status through awareness and training, the government has launched many initiatives in the last two years in the State. Reaching out to women belonging to different sections and strata of society through various schemes, the State so far has disbursed Rs. 88,040.29 crore on women development. House site pattas The control of liquor sales ushered in peace in many families, while Rs. 27,000 crore allocated for welfare programmes such as providing 30,76,000 house site pattas and the norm that the house must be registered in the name of the women in the family, contributed to financial empowerment of the beneficiaries. Be it YSR Aasara, under which 77,75,681 DWACRA women have benefited through Rs. 6,310.68 crore paid in instalments towards reimbursement of their outstanding bank loans, or the YSR Zero Interest Scheme for Women, where the government pays the interest on loan of the SHG that pays the instalment in time, they are aimed at helping the fairer sex become self-sufficient. Under the YSR Zero Interest Scheme, 98,00,626 SHG women have benefited by Rs. 2,354.22 crore. YSR Cheyutha To address the issue of self-sufficiency, YSR Cheyutha was implemented for women in the 45-60 age group from SC, ST, BC and other minority sections, who get an assistance of Rs. 75,000, at the rate of Rs. 18,750 per annum, over four years. Beneficiaries are encouraged to open grocery shop or purchase cattle. The government is collaborating with firms such as Amul, ITC, HUL and Reliance, besides banks, to enhance business opportunities to the beneficiaries through technical support, training in skills, and providing marketing assistance. Around 69,000 shops have been set up under the scheme so far. The government has so far spent Rs. 4,604.13 crore on 24,55,534 beneficiaries. Women belonging to the Kapu, Balija, Ontari and Telaga castes are covered under Kapu Nestham, and have benefited from Rs. 15,000 per annum. The government has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 491.79 crore by reaching out to 3,27,862 lakh women. Sampoorna Poshana While YSR Sampoorna Poshana focusses on prevention of malnutrition in pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children, YSR EBC Nestham is designed for the welfare of economically backward Brahmin, Velama, Kshatriya, Kamma, Reddy, Muslim and other upper caste poor women. Under Jagananna Jeeva Kranthi, women are encouraged to become self-sufficient by purchasing cattle .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/towards-making-women-empowerment-a-reality/article34672700.ece
29 May 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telugu Desam seeks Bharat Ratna for NTR||The TDP, on the second and final day of its annual conclave, Mahanadu, on Friday adopted a few resolutions, which included the one seeking Bharat Ratna for party founder-president N.T. Rama Rao. In his opening remarks after paying rich tributes to NTR on his 98th birth anniversary, TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu recalled how the former Chief Minister had left an unforgettable impression on the Telugu speaking people all over the world with his great achievements. Mr. Naidu appealed to the Central government to confer Bharat Ratna on NTR in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the country’s political space and film industry. Taking part in a discussion on organisational restructuring, Mr. Naidu stressed the need for identifying youngsters who were actively taking part in the party activities and who could effectively take on the rivals in their respective places. Irrigation projects Speaking on a resolution on irrigation projects, Mr. Naidu accused the YSRCP government of sabotaging the projects in the State and adopting anti-farmer policies such as reverse tendering, stoppage of project works and neglect of irrigation water to crops. The YSRCP government had spent Rs. 1,000 crore on irrigation projects since it came to power in 2019, he said. Mr. Naidu asserted that Polavaram and Amaravati were like two eyes. The YSRCP government had failed to provide irrigation water to a single acre additionally in the last two years, he alleged. ‘False cases’ Mr. Naidu slammed the government for implicating party leaders in false cases. He cited as examples the arrest of party State president K. Atchannaidu, Kollu Ravindra, Dhulipalla Narendra, J.C. Prabhakar Reddy, J.C. Asmith Reddy, and Chintamaneni Prabhakar. He spoke about the cases filed against YSRCP leader K. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju for questioning the government’s decisions. “Mr. Raju was manhandled despite being a Member of Parliament,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-ntr/article34672317.ece

The TSGCC’s plan to set up a Super Bazar at the two-bedroom (2BHK) Colony at Tekulapalli in Khammam urban mandal as part of its aggressive growth strategy has failed to take off due to the second wave of the pandemic. For the Joint Liability Groups (JLBs) of tribal women, the pandemic has proved a bane hitting their enterprising ventures hard. The tribal women-run soap and shampoo manufacturing unit in Bhadrachalam of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district is struggling to cope with the pandemic-induced crisis. The closure of Ashram schools had a substantial impact on the tribal women-run unit which is the main supplier of soaps and shampoos to tribal welfare educational institutions. The chilli/turmeric processing unit in Yellandu of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district and the moringa (drumstick) processing unit at Mucharla in Khammam district’s Kamepalli mandal are also hit by the pandemic crisis, sources said. However, the TSGCC-run retail petrol/diesel outlets in the Agency mandals of Gundala and Mulakalapalli are generating revenue for the corporation amid the pandemic situation. The production activities in all the self-employment units being run by tribal women groups will be resumed in a full-fledged manner once the situation returns to normal, said Kunja Vani, Manager, TGCC, Bhadrachalam division.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-hits-sale-of-giri-brand-products-in-bhadradri-district/article34672598.ece

29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eatala likely to join BJP next week||Former Health Minister and TRS MLA Eatala Rajender is in all likelihood expected to join the Bharatiya Janata Party next week in the presence of national party president J.P. Nadda and other top leaders in New Delhi. Party sources said that the former minister had conveyed his decision to join the saffron party after keeping cards close to his chest in the last few days and having discussions with various parties and individuals. The plan is that Mr. Rajender will resign from the TRS and the Legislative Assembly after which he will be escorted to the national capital by Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy for a formal entry. “Everything is confirmed and he will be our party candidate for the Huzurnagar by-election. We are expecting to do a repeat of Dubbak Assembly constituency here considering his following in the area. The consolidation of the Backward Classes and the anti-government sentiment could propel our party in the forthcoming Assembly elections, if we manage to win though we are aware it is going to be tough,” said senior leaders, not wishing to be identified. Mr. Nadda was said to have discussed with State party president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar at a virtual meeting on Thursday to decide on the strategy as the latter has been in touch with Mr. Rajender. Since the party is busy with the seventh anniversary celebrations of the formation of the NDA government on May 31, the grand entry programme got postponed by a couple of days. The former minister was being advised by some political personalities that joining the BJP would weaken his fight against the TRS leadership and the Congress too would join in the fray for the byelection but he seemed to have hedged his bets with the ruling party at the Centre. There has been speculation in some quarters about his being offered a Rajya Sabha seat or even a position in the Central Cabinet with his wife to be considered for the Assembly byelection. However, party sources said there was no question of any Cabinet reshuffle at the Centre considering the government focus on combating the pandemic second wave and in any case there are simply too many claimants for RS seat or for a post in the ministry among the existing leaders. “Our policy in the last six years is to take in whoever is interested in joining our party anywhere. Secondly, north Telangana has always been politically volatile and this development could help strengthen our party,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-likely-to-join-bjp-next-week/article34672585.ece
29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Glitches continue in e-pass site||Technical glitches haunt the Telangana police website as users of ePass find it difficult to log in and negotiate the process to submit their emergency applications. While police have made it mandatory to furnish e-pass for inter- and intra-State commute, they have not provided a hassle-free mechanism to obtain such passes which has been mandated by it. The website is down more often than not. Many applicants have complained that for most of the day the website is slow due to server problems, and in case if they were lucky enough to complete the form, the error page pops up after submitting the application. This forces the applicants to repeat the whole process. “I managed to fill the application to go to Nagarjunasagar to immerse my father’s ashes. When I hit the submit button, an error popped up and I was forced to do the entire process again,” said a city-based journalist. “Getting epass 4 my dad's last rites has been impossible. After laborious process of application, at the press of Save, the portal says Ranga Reddy district is invalid entry!! Tried again, the site crashed. Harassing public seems to be the mandate of this govt @TelanganaDGP,” she tweeted to DGP M Mahender Reddy. Tollywood actor Nikhil Siddhartha recently took to Twitter to express his agony. “Was on the way to deliver Emergency Life saving Medicines from Uppal to Kims Minister road... Inspite of providing the Prescription and patient details.. was stopped and asked to Get an Epass. Tried 9 times but the sever is down… I thought medical emergencies were allowed!!!,” the actor tweeted. Moreover, the entire process is very technical and everything is in English. People from rural areas are finding it very difficult to complete the process and were forced to take the assistance of some literate person in the village during the pandemic time. Several people are complaining that the police are rejecting their application for e-pass as they are sitting in judgment on the issues shown by the applicants for issue of e-pass. If someone wants to attend the funeral of their loved one and apply for the pass, it is being rejected for not attaching supporting documents. It is learnt that the passes sought for attending a marriage or visiting their ailing patients were also turned down by the police. It is beyond the guidelines issued for the issuance of e-pass.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/glitches-continue-in-e-pass-site/article34672588.ece
29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Introducing Gaddar to non-Telugu speakers||‘Gaddar is a life force’, is how Vasanth Kannabiran describes the balladeer in the book ‘My Life is a Song: Gaddar’s Anthems for the Revolution’, her translation from Telugu to English that is published by Speaking Tiger Books. Gaddar and Vasanth are ‘fellow travellers’ in a journey that defied odds and traversed through adverse situations. Vasanth is a poet, writer and campaigner for women’s rights. Gummadi Vittal Rao, known as Gaddar, is an artist-activist and has been the cultural face of the Naxal movement. His songs stem from his observation of the plight of the downtrodden, and his repertoire, over the years, embodied the spirit of awakening. Through the book — the first-of-its-kind selection of his songs — Vasanth introduces Gaddar to non-Telugu speakers. A job, she says, was not an easy one at all. Vasanth was in the process of translating Dakshinayana: Indian Thought Series Telugu/English Volume and she got to translate one poem by Gaddar when she realised the need to place his “brilliance” before the non-Telugu public. She chose 23 representative songs of his to translate. “It was the most difficult and challenging work I have done so far,” says Vasanth, who’s known and heard Gaddar since 1975. “I have always been fascinated by the ease with which he translates the political into sheer poetry; the simplicity and purity of his style. But I never dreamt of translating his songs,” she says. In the initial chapters, Vasanth covers Gaddar’s life — the path that made him the archetypal of the grassroots struggles in India: “Gaddar has lived with miners, railroad workers and stone cutters to capture their lives in song. Inspiring youth to join the struggle, comforting mothers and wives that the martyrdom was not in vain, celebrating the dead and immortalising them, that was his activism”. Vasanth’s translation work is rooted in her politics as a socialist feminist. “Though I have studied and taught literature, I never thought of writing or translating work as a scholar. I was a teacher and my first attempt was to teach Coleridge, Wordsworth and Milton to my Telugu medium students. My attempts to write or translate or record sprang from my feminist politics, never as pure literature” says Vasanth. However, in translating Gaddar’s works, the challenge was beyond the syntax-idiom precision. “Capturing his oral tones, the rhythms, the notes in cold print, the pauses, the roars, the grunts and the drums was impossible. It was not just a translation from a text. His voice rings in my ears,” says Vasanth. Keeping in mind the non-Telugu speaking reader, Vasanth had to footnote the Telangana dialect, the local references, the gods, goddesses, the culture, and even the Srikakulam revolutionary struggle, since she felt the people in the north have only heard of Naxalbari. Vasanth’s assimilation of Gaddar’s work comes from her close association with him and her social activism. “Gaddar has been a part of my life, a client of Kannabiran (her late husband, human rights activist and lawyer) and a comrade in a struggle I admired for its dedication and sacrifice. I have a strong sense of his work because of my association and exposure to the Naxalite movement,” she says. Gaddar would often break into an impromptu rendition, leaving many songs undocumented. “Gaddar composes and sings as he breathes. The slightest incident or remark and he breaks into song. He improvises as he sings. The important ones are revised and recorded. There must be thousands of songs imprinted on the hearts of listeners. And thousands lost. He says a song will die out when it is no longer politically relevant,” shares Vasanth. About the relevance of Gaddar and his works, Vasanth feels that one should remember every poet, however ancient, was in a ‘dialogue with God, king or society’. “Ancient poets spoke of the equality of men, of the impunity of caste and the injustice faced by the dispossessed. Gaddar is first and foremost a bard of the revolution, a harbinger of change. He must be celebrated as such,” she explains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/introducing-gaddar-to-non-telugu-speakers/article34672561.ece
29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Special vaccination drive kick-starts||A special vaccination drive for nine types of workers handled by different departments began on Friday with as many as 21,666 people receiving the jab. The State government had recently announced the drive for workers belonging to nine categories - LPG delivery staff, petrol filling staff, fair price shop dealers, auto and cab drivers, vegetable, flower, fruit market vendors, non-veg market vendors, liquor shop vendors and media persons. However, several venues which were earmarked to administer the shot to drivers were unable to go ahead. Transport department officials said that they were awaiting further instructions from the government and that all preparations were made. The Civil Supplies department began to administer jabs to over 5,700 workers. While there were teething problems in the beginning like low turnout, the numbers slowly began to increase. For instance, Erramanzil Community Hall in Khairatabad Circle saw around 130 people being vaccinated till 3 p.m., as against a planned number of 200. The drive was conducted under the watch of an assistant supplies officer, a policeman, a doctor and nurses. “We sent out text messages to LPG delivery staff, petrol filling staff and FPS dealers in advance so that they could show them in case they are stopped by police. A list of beneficiaries is already with us. Their Aadhaar cards and phone numbers are matched after which the vaccine is administered,” ASO Irfan Khan said. Five venues were earmarked for journalists – Press Club Somajiguda, Press Club Basheerbagh, MCRHRD Institute, Area Hospital Vanasthalipuram and Unani Hospital in Charminar. The turnout at Unani Hospital was low. Meanwhile, the Telangana State Taxi and Drivers’ Joint Action Committee office bearer Shaik Salahuddin suggested that the government consider giving first priority to drivers who have badge numbers. The body also opined that drivers working with taxi aggregators such as Ola and Uber should be administered vaccines at company offices or at places earmarked by them. Officers and politicians visited centres to ensure that the drive proceeds in an unhindered manner. The Telangana LPG Distributors’ Association on Friday thanked Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao as well as Ministers K.T. Rama Rao and Gangula Kamlakar. “We applaud the timely and quick decision on our request for immediate vaccination of our LPG delivery and support staff,” the Association said. The vaccination would help boost their morale and in maintaining uninterrupted LPG supplies. The association also requested that the government declare LPG delivery staff as frontline workers since such a move would ensure monetary assistance for the kin in the event of death due to COVID-19 complications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/special-vaccination-drive-kick-starts/article34672571.ece

29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||City police file chargesheet in loan-app case||Providing/offering loans illegally, collecting exorbitant rates of interest, harassing the borrowers for recovery and impersonation were some of the crucial findings forming part of the charge sheet filed by the Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad recently in the multi-crore alleged financial fraud involving app-based instant loan companies. The investigators have also mentioned about the six victims of the loan-app companies who killed themselves in the State. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior police officer associated with the investigation of the case said as the final report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory is still pending, they have fast forwarded the process of filing the chargesheet with a view to prevent the accused from getting bail. Of the 21-odd accused persons arrested by the city police, except Zhu Wei alias Lambo from Jiangxi, China, all others were enlarged on bail. They have also mentioned the names of some of the absconding accused, including Yuan Yuan alias Jennifer. “Definitely, we were in a hurry to file the chargesheet as we don’t want the prime accused Zhu Wei to get out on bail,” he said, adding that Zhu Wei was the key person behind the operations of several loan-app companies in India. He said that soon after getting the detailed and final report from the CFSL, the police would file a bunch of chargesheets clubbed together. “We must know what is in the laptops of Zhu Wei and other accused, before filing the ‘main chargesheet’. The process has slowed due to COVID-19,” the officer said, adding that a technical scientist analysing the technical evidence submitted by them is on leave. In the chargesheet, the police have also mentioned that first the money went to Virgin Island and from there to Shanghai, China, to prove the role of China-based companies in the fraud. They also mentioned that the firms used call spoofing technology in their call centres to contact the borrowers. In the last week of December, police roped in financial experts and data analysts to go into voluminous data pertaining to more than 1.50 crore loan transactions involving nearly Rs. 21,000 crore, apart from cryptocurrency.  We don’t want the prime accused Zhu Wei to get out on bail.

29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||UG aspirants of foreign varsities fear losing admission||Disruption of the academic schedule and postponement of exams in India due to the second wave of COVID is turning out to be a nightmare for students already enrolled in foreign institutions for undergraduate courses. As the deadline for submitting the pass certificate in the universities is either July-end or August first week, these students are worried they would lose admissions, which they hard-earned given the tough international competition. What if the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or the State boards fail to complete the exam and results process by July-end? “In all likelihood I will lose my admission,” says Amar Sivalinga, Class 12 student of Meridian School in Banjara Hills. He has already been given provisional admission in pre-medicine course at the University of California at Los Angeles and also at University of Southern California but he needs to submit the official pass certificate from the CBSE by August 1. Though the admissions were given based on marks obtained in 9th, 10th and 11th and also the performance in other co-curricular activities, the varsities stress on the pass certificate before the classes begin. “Getting into a pre-medical school is tough and there is no guarantee that I can manage it next year if the admission is cancelled,” he says. Amar is lucky that being a US citizen he doesn’t need to go through the visa hassles but Indian citizens are not so lucky. Like Kushal Agarwal, who is admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne in Computer Science course, is not only worried about the pass certificate but also fears losing time in the visa hassles. As of now, the visa windows are closed but he hopes that if the situation improves he may get an opportunity for visa interview in June. But with regard to CBSE pass certificate, he is not too sure given the present situation in the country. Another student from Hyderabad but educated at Benguluru was able to get her visa but she is a bit tense about the pass certificate. However, Meridian School principal and coordinator of CBSE schools in Hyderabad Usha Reddy hopes for positive picture emerging as Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal will give some clarity on the important announcement he is scheduled to make on June 1. However, Ms. Usha Reddy says US universities too, would be eagerly waiting for the Indian government’s announcement on this as a couple of thousands of Indian students’ future is at stake. She feels the varsities may give some relaxation given the pandemic. Students from majority of international schools and also top CBSE schools are increasingly showing interest in undergraduate courses abroad, particularly USA. Nishidhar Borra of Atlas Consultants says the numbers were increasing till last year but the pandemic has hit the hopefuls seriously. Punjab has always been a major UG market for US and Australian varsities though Hyderabad was also sending good numbers but this year, the situation is grim. This is more to do with disrupted academic schedules, uncertainty over travel plans and the reluctance of universities to relax norms. “The Australian market has taken a strong beating due to strict norms there,” he says. Ram of Medico Abroad that specialises in consulting for medical admissions argues that it’s a herculean task for CBSE to conduct exams and announce the results in a short span of time. Yet, it can be done with modified approach to exam process, he feels and expresses confidence that since there is uncertainty everywhere, varsities would relax their stringent norms for this year at least.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ug-aspirants-of-foreign-varsities-fear-losing-admission/article34672568.ece
29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Where is my Leg Piece’, KTR receives bizarre tweet||Bizzare tweets are not new to celebrities but asking a Minister for “Leg Piece” and “Extra Masala” in his biryani is just stretching the limits. Twitter-savvy IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao was sort of blamed by a twitter user for food delivery app Zomato not taking his Biryani preference seriously. KTR was also dragged into his disappointment with a question “Is this the way to serve people”? Though pulling KTR into the controversy was ridiculous, the tweet generated some fun on the net with trollers and others responding with their typical funny comments. Thotakuri Raghupathi, who was disappointed over the biryani he was served, tweeted to Zomato and tagged @KTRTRS along to express his dissent. Sharing the picture of the biryani, the twitter user said the supplier did not heed to his request for “extra masala” and a “leg piece.” And he ended his agony with a comment ‘I didn’t get any of them, is this the way to serve people.’ An amused KTR responded asking as to why he was tagged in the post. “And why am I tagged on this brother? What did you expect me to do?” KTR’s tweet read. And then a series of funny comments followed with some taking on Raghupathi and some requesting the Minister to answer the question raised in the tweet. Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi too, joined with a remark loaded with wit “@KTRoffice must immediately respond. “must say that @MinisterKTR & his team have been responding to the medical needs of people during this pandemic mashallah.” However, the unexpected response from the Minister and the comments seem to have unnerved Raghupathi who deleted the tweet but not before a few thousands liking it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/where-is-my-leg-piece-ktr-receives-bizarre-tweet/article34672569.ece

29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Police foisting cases on Congress leaders’||AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan criticised the government for booking cases against Congress leaders and what he called unleashing vendetta politics for raising public issues during a health calamity. At a press conference here, he took objection to Telangana police filing cases against Congress leaders on their recent visit to Urban Primary Health Centre at Khairatabad. “We followed all the guidelines and visited before the lockdown time. It is atrocious that instead of acting on the serious problem highlighted by us, TRS government has filed cases,” he said. Mr. Sravan along with Hyderabad Congress Committee president and former MP Anjan Kumar Yadav visited the UPHC on May 22.

Mr. Sravan asked the police whether they would file similar cases against those who attended the marriage function in the family of IPS officer Rajiv Trivedi flouting COVID-19 norms. He claimed that as per media reports and videos getting viral in social media more than 1,500 people have attended the marriage.

29 May 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cyber fraudsters continue to have a field day||Cyber fraudsters continue to cheat people by taking advantage of the pandemic situation and the consequent desperate need of people for medicines and other equipment for treating people affected with COVID-19 and Black Fungus. Several such cases were reported with the Cyberabad police. According to the police, the fraudsters are posting advertisements in various websites and social media on the pretext of providing medicine for Black Fungus. “They are deceiving the public by giving fake assurances of delivering drugs within hours. Believing them, people are transferring money and getting duped,” Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said. In other instances, fraudsters are tricking victims to reveal the sensitive information such as card details, OTP and are cheating them to the tune of lakhs of rupees. After receiving money, they never deliver the medicine nor do they respond to the calls made by victims, he said. On May 25, a resident of Gachibowli approached police stating that he searched online and found Emson Medical Stores contact details from IndiaMart website for purchasing injections to treat Black Fungus. Further, when he contacted the person through WhatsApp and enquired about Black Fungus medicine, he was informed that the medicine is available with the seller and was asked to initiate payment. The caller assured delivery of the medicine in Hyderabad through flight courier within three to four hours and demanded Rs. 8,32,000 for 60 vials and provided his bank account details. “Complainant transferred the money, only to realise that he was cheated,” Mr. Sajjanar said. Based on his complaint, a case was registered and a probe is on. Further the Commissioner advised people not to buy any COVID related drugs from private, unscrupulous sources.

Following unseasonal rains the paddy stocked up at many procurement centres had got soaked and started sprouting. At Chinnagottumukkala in Shivampet mandal several farmers brought the sprouted and drenched paddy to the Narsapur-Toopran road and set it on fire. With this traffic came to standstill for some time and police had to intervene and pacify the agitators. “Our paddy was held at procurement centre and was not lifted by the officials. It got soaked in rain water and got damaged. There has been no response from officials to our repeated pleas. We came on to the road as our patience has dried up and we were forced to bring our problem to the notice of officials,” said farmers at Chinnagottumukkala. Similar protests were made by farmers at Pragathi Dhararam village in Ramayampet mandal alleging that the paddy from their village is not being bought at the procurement centre. They have held rasta roko for some time and later withdrew after assurance from officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-burn-paddy-in-protest/article34672594.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||City’s poor wait for food and CM’s scheme to reach them||Gautam Giri, a resident of a slum cluster in Malviya Nagar, has been hit by the pandemic in more than one way. While he lost his job during the nationwide lockdown in 2020, the past month has been especially difficult after he lost his mother — the sole breadwinner of the family. Ensuring meals for the family has proved to be a difficult task during the current lockdown, he said. “Currently, I am dependent on my friends who have graciously agreed to help us. There is no existence of ‘cash’ in my life at this point. My mother was the sole earner in the family, but she succumbed to COVID-19. Now, I do not know how to sustain my family,” he added. ‘No milk for toddler’ “For the past month, I have not even been able to buy milk for my 18-month-old child. I cannot put into words how we are trying to sustain ourselves ,” said Mr. Giri. Over the week after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the distribution of ration to non-cardholders, several people complained of benefits not having reached them yet. Noting that over 69 lakh people who did not possess ration cards had registered last year for the scheme, the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyaan (DRRAA) in its letter to the Chief Minister on Friday said, “The guidelines state that in the initial phase of distribution, grains will be provided to two lakh beneficiaries and later as per demand and need assessment from the field, up to the maximum of 20 lakh beneficiaries. This is grossly inadequate.” While welcoming the move on May 25, the DRRAA on Friday also said it was concerning that no date had been provided as to when the scheme would be rolled out. Nazia Khatun, who works as a domestic help in the city said, “I have a family of six to feed. At present, we can eat only one meal a day. I am also required to pay Rs. 5,000 as rent. Where am I supposed to get the money from? What has the government done in this entire lockdown period for the poor?” For Santoshi Mandal, another domestic worker who has lived alone in the Capital for over a decade, meals sometimes mean only puffed rice. “I had returned from my hometown three months back. I am sustaining myself from whatever little grains I brought back at that time. The employers have said that they will not pay for the one month that we could not work due to the lockdown. If we receive aid from the government, it will ease our problems to a great extent,” said Ms. Mandal. For Rani (65), who lives with two of her minor grandchildren, depending on neighbours is the only way to ensure daily meals, she said. “There is nobody else in my family to look after us. We are completely dependent on neighbours. Whatever little they can provide, we divide it. If they don’t do that on a particular day, we have nothing to eat,” said Ms. Rani.  The guidelines state that in the initial phase of distribution, grains will be provided to two lakh beneficiaries and later as per demand and need assessment from the field, up to the maximum of 20 lakh beneficiaries. This is grossly inadequate DRRAA’s letter to CM||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/citys-poor-wait-for-food-and-cms-scheme-to-reach-them/article34672543.ece
29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 jitters in families  keep house helps at bay||With the COVID sword hanging over their heads, several house helps across the city are worried about their job security irrespective of the lockdown status. However, a majority of them believe that the current situation is significantly better than the lockdown in 2020. Savitri Devi from Shahdara’s Nand Nagri said two of her employers had told her not to come for work during last year’s lockdown. “But this year, only one of them has refused me. In the other house, I clean utensils in the gallery and water the plants as my employer doesn’t ask me to work inside the house. She has not cut my salary, but I am bearing the loss of not working in the other house,” she said. Rita from West Bengal, who stays in Seemapuri here, said all the three households where she worked have asked her not to come, and only one of them is still paying her salary. “My husband works in a small factory, due to which we were able to manage food and daily requirements. But the loss of pay is affecting my children’s needs. I hope they call me back soon. Till the time the virus is here, I don’t feel secure,” she said. Simran, a 19-year-old resident of west Delhi’s Sudhamapuri, and her mother used to work in six houses. She said three of the houses didn’t call them for two weeks when the pandemic was at its peak. “Barring two weeks, all employers called us and there was no monetary issue. However, due to COVID, the treatment has changed. I understand everyone is scared but people from our strata have been least affected by COVID then why treat us like untouchables,” she said. ‘Spending time at home’ For 20-year-old Jyoti, who lost work at two households, the lockdown is like a vacation. “Now, I am used to this. Till the time COVID exists, people may or may not call us. I hadn’t spent time with my grandmother in our village in Unnao and now I am here using this time in the best way possible,” she said over the phone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/covid-19-jittersin-families-keephouse-helpsatbay/article34672536.ece

29 May 2021||New Delhi,||St. Stephen’s student dies of COVID||A first-year student of St. Stephen’s College, Satyam Jha, died of COVID-19 on Tuesday. The 18-year-old student of the History department was a member of the college’s Gandhi Ambedkar Study Circle, debating society and the organising committee of the college’s Students’ Federation of India (SFI) unit. Following Jha’s demise, St. Stephen’s College principal John Varghese penned a note — “From Pandemic to Panacea” — on the college website. “The pandemic has brought the world to its knees. The second wave of the pandemic has been heartless in its ruthless rampaging through our country exposing our hollow claims of being prepared, of being one of the largest producers of pharmaceutical products in the world, of even being a civilization that places value on the higher things in life. But if life itself is gone, then wither all these claims?” the note read. ‘Blind leaders’ The note further read: “The claims of belligerent and blind leaders who are immune to the suffering and deaths of simple people also show that we are veering off dangerously to becoming a cruel and insensitive race. How do all those claims of power and importance matter before the death of a loved one? Nothing.” “We will not live forever. No, no one of us is eternal; but if we can pass on the wisdom of our collective experiences then perhaps, there is a possibility for redemption from the curse of arrogance. Are we willing to listen?” wrote Mr. Varghese.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/st-stephens-student-dies-of-covid/article34672548.ece

29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||NSUI holds stir outside Ministry, seeks cancellation of Class XII board exams||Student-activists of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) organised a protest outside the Ministry of Education on Friday demanding cancellation of Class XII board examinations that have been postponed due to the second COVID wave. As some students in PPE kits gathered outside the Ministry, the NSUI on social media amplified its demand to find an alternative to physical examinations. The students raised the slogan — Pehle Suraksha, Phir Pariksha [first safety then examination]. NSUI’s national president Neeraj Kundan said they had written to the Ministry that conducting an examination in such a situation could be life-threatening. “The government has already failed to procure the vaccines and there seems no definite plan for that, and now this lack of planning for the board exams will harm the academic year of these students. The only solution to save their academic year is now to promote them by internal assessments rather than wasting more time on discussing the examinations,” Mr. Kundan said. The NSUI said the government was pondering on conducting the examination in 19 main subjects and coming up with an alternate evaluation formula for other subjects. “If the government is ready to come up with an evaluation formula for other subjects, then why can’t they do the same for these 19 subjects as well?” it said. Mr. Kundan suggested that students be graded on basis of their past performances, assignments, or classroom assessments. “There might be students who are already suffering from COVID or the students who might be in trauma of having their family members infected. We don’t know if all such students will be in a condition to appear for the exam at all,” Mr. Kundan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nsui-holds-stir-outside-ministry-seeks-cancellation-of-class-xii-board-exams/article34672546.ece

29 May 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay HC comes down hard on Centre over faulty ventilators||The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court on Friday expressed displeasure over the Centre’s stand in defending the procurement of ventilators that were dysfunctional. The Assistant Solicitor General of India, Ajay Talhar, submitted an affidavit filed by G.K. Pillai, Under Secretary of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, before the Division Bench of Justices Ravindra Ghuge and B.U. Debadwar. The Centre was asked to file an affidavit after it was brought to the notice of the court that 113 of the 150 ventilators provided to Maharashtra under the PM Cares Fund were faulty. After reading the affidavit, the court remarked, “The tenor of the affidavit doesn’t show you are worried about the lives of the patients. The affidavit stated that the ventilators are not provided under PM Cares Fund but under MakeinIndia ventilators and that they are in perfect condition.” The court said, “As such there is a complete denial that these ventilators are supplied through PM Cares as announced earlier. We find such statements demonstrating insensitivity on the part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.” Mr. Talhar said teams were constituted to check the functioning and working of the ventilators. An independent team was sent on May 22. The court interrupted him and said, “What you are saying sounds superficial and without conviction.” Mr. Talhar went on to say that those operating the ventilators lacked training and did not have the knowledge and training to do so, which was why the ventilators were turning faulty. In its order, the court recorded the day-to-day report from the Government Medical College and Hospital Aurangabad that was signed by eight doctors. The report said the ventilators developed errors from the day they were installed by the company. As they were not functioning properly, patients started complaining of breathlessness within hours of ventilators being switched on. According to the hospital, 58 of the 150 Dhaman III ventilators received from Jyoti CNC were faulty and could not be used. The court noted, “You (the Centre) may think of it as a trivial issue, but we will not close our eyes to this.” The court directed Mr. Talhar to mention on an affidavit the remedial and corrective steps taken by the Centre to rectify the issue.

If the state government does not approve it till June 6, I will personally start an agitation from Raigad fort regardless of the COVID-19 restrictions,” he said. Mr. Bhosale submitted the list of demands over three weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the law granting quota to the Maratha community in admissions and government jobs. The court termed it “unconstitutional”, and held that there were no exceptional circumstances to breach the 50% reservation cap set by the 1992 verdict.  “The Supreme Court on May 5 struck down the Maratha reservation law of the government, and I had requested people to desist from any reaction. But I will not do so this time, he said. The parliamentarian had on Thursday met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar to discuss the Maratha reservation issue and urged him to take an initiative in the matter. Over the last few days, he toured parts of the State to discuss with locals from the community regarding the course of action. List of demands Mr. Bhosale’s demands include convening a two-day session of the State legislature to take some decisions that would benefit the Maratha community, and setting up of district level hostels for Maratha students.  His other demands are- empowering SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute) with efficient and active people, giving it a funding of Rs. 1,000 crore; increasing the amount of loan given by the Annasaheb Patil Economically Backward Development Corporation to Rs. 25 lakh. “I have placed these demands before the Chief Minister. I will wait for the decision till June 6,” he said.

The price of petrol on Thursday, crossed the Rs. 100-a- litre mark after the price of the fuel was increased by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 29 paise a litre. The increase — 14th this month — took petrol and diesel prices to an all-time high across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/petrol-at-rs-100-ncp-puts-up-celebratory-hoardings/article34672248.ece
29 May 2021||Washington,||Jaishankar meets U.S. NSA, private sector||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankararrived in Washington DC on Wednesday for two apparently hectic days which were packed with meetings with officials, including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai, lawmakers, and the private sector. Earlier in the week, speaking from New York City, the Minister characterised the India-U.S. relationship as one of the major relationships in the world. Mr. Jaishankar, who is on his first visit to the U.S. during the Biden administration, met with Mr. Sullivan on Thursday. Both sides indicated that there was a discussion on regional (Indo-Pacific) or global issues, with Mr. Jaishankar specifying, via a tweet, that Afghanistan came up. “Conveyed appreciation for US solidarity in addressing the Covid challenge.India-US vaccine partnershipcan make a real difference,” the tweet said. The U.S. readout said Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Sullivan “welcomed” cooperation that has resulted in the delivery of over $500 million in relief materials (state, federal and private sector sources) from the U.S. to India. “They agreed that people-to-people ties and shared values are the foundation of the U.S.-India strategic partnership that is helping to end the pandemic, supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and providing global leadership on climate change,” it said.  The Hindu had reported that procuring vaccines and sorting out issues around this, such as early Emergency Use Authorisation and liability are central to Mr. Jaishankar’s trip, though officials have been keen to stress that this is not the focus of the visit and that discussions would cover a more comprehensive list of topics pertinent to the strategic ties between the two countries. Economic recovery Mr. Jaishankar said he had “good discussions” with Ms. Tai, who recently announced that the Biden administration would support an India-South Africa initiative at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to waive intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines. “Our trade, technology & business cooperation are at the core of our strategic partnership. Enhancing them is vital to post-Covid economic recovery. Welcomed her positive stance on IPR issues & support for efficient & robust supply chains,” Mr. Jaishankar said on Twitter. Mr. Jaishankar had breakfast and lunch meetings on Thursday organised by advocacy and industry groups, the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC) and the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF). The USIBC meeting included a discussion on how the private sector, working via a consortium of 40 companies called the ‘Global Task Force for Pandemic Response’, could “support India’s health infrastructure and further ways to continue relief efforts,” said the group. Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson – both companies that manufacture COVID-19 vaccines of interest to India – are part of the Task Force. The consortium’s ongoing efforts include the deployment of 1,000 ventilators and 1,00,000 oxygen concentrators to India (35,000 of which are scheduled for delivery by June-end), the group said. Representatives of pharmaceutical firm Abbot and courier and shipping firm FedEx were among the companies present at the USISPF meeting, industry sources told The Hindu . Mr. Jaishankar also spoke on the phone with the (Democratic) Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Gregory Meeks and its ranking member (Republican) Michael McCaul. He also had a phone call with House India Co-Chairs Steve Chabot (Republican). Brad Sherman, the other co-chair, was among those present at a dinner for Mr. Jaishankar on Wednesday, at the house of Indian Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Others present there, according to U.S. official sources, included Senators Tim Kaine, Michael Bennet. Also present was Jon Ossoff, the new Senator from Georgia, a battleground state where the Indian American vote is potentially crucial. On Friday, the Minister is scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Mr. Jaishankar met with officials again on Thursday evening. These included Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and officials from the Departments of State, Energy, Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation, according to announcements made by Mr. Sandhu and Mr. Jaishankar on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jaishankar-meets-us-nsa-private-sector/article34671997.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||France and the Rwandan genocide||French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday asked for forgiveness for his country’s role in the 1994 Rwandan massacre in which about 8,00,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were killed. Speaking at the genocide memorial in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, Mr. Macron said France chose “silence over examination of the truth” for too long, but stopped short of issuing an apology. Close ties France, which enjoyed close ties with Rwanda’s Hutu-led government of President Juvénal Habyarimana, has long been criticised for its role in the killings of the Tutsi minorities in the months of April to June 1994. In May 2019, President Macron, promising a new beginning with Rwanda, set up a 15-member expert committee to investigate his country’s role in the genocide. The committee, which had access to official files and secret documents, submitted its findings to the government in March, which stated that France, which was then ruled by President François Mitterrand, bore “heavy and overwhelming responsibilities” for being “blind” to the events that led to the killings. The report blamed Mitterrand for a “failure” of policy towards Rwanda in 1994. Rwanda had commissioned a separate inquiry, which concluded in a report submitted to the Cabinet in April that France “enabled” the genocide. Hutu-Tutsi relations The majority Hutus and minority Tutsis have had a troubled relationship in Rwanda that goes back to the German and Belgian colonial period. Colonialists ruled Rwanda through the Tutsi monarchy. Tutsis were appointed as local administrative chiefs and the ethnic minority enjoyed relatively better educational and employment opportunities, which led to widespread resentment among the majority Hutus. In 1959, Rwanda saw violent riots led by Hutus in which some 20,000 Tutsis were killed and many more were displaced. Amid growing violence, the Belgian authorities handed over power to the Hutu elite. King Kigeli V fled the country. In the 1960 elections, organised by the Belgians, Hutu parties gained control of nearly all local communes. In 1961, Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared Rwanda an autonomous republic and the next year, the country became independent. Kayibanda became Rwanda’s first elected President, while the Tutsis who fled the country formed armed insurgencies. Since then, Rwanda had been controlled by Hutus, until their genocidal regime was toppled by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in 1994. What led to the killings? The crisis escalated in the 1990s when the RPF, led by Paul Kagame, the current President, grew in strength and posed a serious challenge to the regime of President Habyarimana, who was backed by France and had defence ties with Israel. In 1993, Habyarimana, who rose to power in 1973, was forced to sign a peace agreement (Arusha Accords) with the RPF. This led to resentment among Hutu militias, backed by the government, towards local Tutsi population, who were accused of collaborators of the RPF. On April 6, 1994, a Falcon 50 jet carrying Habyarimana and his Burundi counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down near Kigali International Airport. The Hutu-led government blamed the RPF for the attack on the presidential jet. The military and Hutu militias, mainly Interahamwe, unleashed violence against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Mr. Kagame has denied any involvement in shooting down the plane. The RPF says Hutu extremists ordered the attack to use it as an excuse for the genocide (which they were preparing for long before the plane downing) as well as to capture power. The killings were a pre-planned extermination campaign. The militias, with support from the government, launched a premeditated violent campaign on April 7, aimed at eliminating the entire Tutsi communities. Interahamwe militants went to cities and villages across the country, hunting down Tutsis, and asking Hutus to join the campaign, killing at a pace of 8,000 people a day. The Hutus who opposed the killings were also targeted. The militias used a radio station to coordinate the killings. Bodies were dumped in the Nyabarongo River. France, which had backed the Hutu government, did nothing to stop the massacre. Thousands were slaughtered in churches where they sought refuge. The Catholic Church had deep ties with the ruling Hutu elites – Archbishop Vincent Nsengiyumva was a member of the ruling party’s central committee. Many priests were involved in the killings. In a visit to Rwanda in 2017, Pope Francis asked for forgiveness for the Church’s role in the killings. The violence continued for three months. How did it end? The killings came to an end after the RPF, under Mr. Kagame’s command, captured Kigali and toppled the Hutu regime. While the RPF put an end to the Hutu campaign to exterminate Tutsis, the rebels were also accused of carrying out revenge killings during the civil war. When it was evident that the RPF was winning, an estimated 2 million Hutus fled Rwanda, mainly to the neighbouring Zaire (the Democratic Republic of Congo), where Hutu militias are still operating from. The RPF initially went about establishing a multi-ethnic government with Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, being the President. Mr. Kagame, a Tutsi, was his deputy. In 2000, Mr. Kagame assumed the Presidency and continues to be in power till today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-and-the-rwandan-genocide/article34672004.ece
29 May 2021||COLOMBO/NEW DELHI,||As India watches keenly, Sri Lanka seeks FDI in Port City||Sri Lanka on Friday invited international investment into the Colombo Port City that it described as a “fully Sri Lankan project”, while official sources in New Delhi said they were “keeping a close eye” on the project and its “security implications”. “If it is only a commercial venture then that is their [Sri Lanka’s] choice… We will continue to engage Sri Lanka, while watching our national interest,” said a government source in New Delhi, awaiting the final version of the Bill whose blueprint the Sri Lankan Parliament’s Speaker signed on Thursday. The ‘Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act’ is yet to be made public. Addressing concerns around the recently passed legislation on laws governing the Colombo Port City, which critics fear might be a “Chinese enclave” in the Sri Lankan capital, a team of government Ministers said the China-backed $1.4 billion-Port City, pitted as a financial hub, had the potential to create 83,000 jobs and bring in up to $15 billion in investments. Constitutional experts and opposition legislators argue that the 269-acre “financial hub”, coming up on reclaimed land adjoining Colombo’s seafront, would enjoy, besides a tax-free status, immunity from Sri Lankan law. Sections within Sri Lanka, including from the political opposition, trade unions and the influential Buddhist clergy, see it as a “threat” to Sri Lanka’s sovereignty. ‘Transparent venture’ Seeking to allay prevalent fears about the project, in a meeting titled ‘The Colombo Port City: Angel or Devil?’, senior Minister G.L. Peiris termed the venture “transparent”, and said “there is no exclusivity” in Sri Lanka’s relationship with any one country. Colombo, he said, would pursue a “non-aligned” foreign policy, amid growing public criticism over the government’s “China-centric” policies. New Delhi too will go by “benchmarks”, the government source said, pointing to “transparency, openness, and financial responsibility”. “No offshore havens…it [the Port City] should respect the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. And respect international norms,” the source said, requesting not to be named. Apart from the high geopolitical stakes in the big-ticket investment project in the strategically located island nation, the Colombo Port City has sparked a raging debate within the country over its China policy. Instances of official signage excluding Tamil, an official language, while including Mandarin, drew wide criticism from the public. China has been among the top lenders to Sri Lanka, especially since the pandemic struck, offering a $1 billion in loan and a nearly-$ 1.5 billion currency swap facility. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s Cabinet awarded a project to build an elevated highway in the capital’s suburbs — estimated cost $ 1 billion — to the State-owned China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), on a Build–operate–transfer basis, for 15 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-india-watches-keenly-sri-lanka-seeks-fdi-in-port-city/article34671995.ece

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has found himself increasingly isolated after 26-year-old journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested after his flight was forced to land in Minsk. EU leaders denounced it as a hijacking and piracy and responded by barring Belarusian carriers from the bloc’s airspace and airports and advising European airlines to skirt Belarus. The bloc’s Foreign Ministers sketched out tougher sanctions on Thursday to target the country’s lucrative potash industry and other sectors.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Turning the COVID-19 tide in Chennai||With the phones ringing off the hook and the queues of the sick becoming longer, S. Sangavi and S. Ramachandran knew better than to put their tired feet up. In their 12-hour shifts, the duo — an emergency medical technician and an ambulance pilot attached to the 108 ambulance network — took on multiple trips in Chennai, ferrying at least 10 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to nearby government hospitals each day. Though both Sangavi and Ramachandran, staff of the Vadapalani Depot ambulance, have been handling COVID-19 patients from the start of the pandemic, they soon realised that the unrelenting second wave of infections was unlike the first. With each passing day, they slowly got accustomed to the long queues of ambulances and longer waiting hours outside government hospitals, hoping fervently that the patient on board would get a bed. “It took us at least an hour or two to get a patient into the hospital ward. It became extremely difficult to get an oxygen-supported bed in the last two months,” Sangavi says. At times, their shift extended to as long as 15 hours. “There was no time to eat,” Ramachandran says. As they set out to pick up a patient, either from home or from a screening centre, they would go beyond their defined roles. “Many fear the sight of an ambulance in front of their homes. So, we would call them earlier, tell them not to be afraid, and assure them that it is going to be fine,” Sangavi says. Even as one patient was admitted, it would be time to pick up the next. “It was like working at the warfront,” says Mohamed Bilal, regional manager, GVK EMRI, which operates the 108 ambulances. “We (the Chennai team) have been on our toes since March. Each ambulance has had to cater to 20 cases a day, doing multiple trips day and night. From May 1 to 24, we handled 9,579 COVID-19 patients in Chennai alone.” The task was far from easy. With many ambulances held up outside hospitals, the team had to ensure that the vehicles reached the patients on time. “Once a call is received, the average response time for a COVID-19 ambulance in Chennai is 10 minutes 25 seconds, while the average turnaround time is 1 to 1.5 hours,” he says. Scramble for beds Chennai turned into a COVID-19 hotspot in the blink of an eye. The second wave resulted in an exponential rise in the active case load. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 2.36 lakh cases had been reported in the city, as of March 5, 2021. When the State’s daily case count crossed 500 marking the beginning of the second wave, more than 2.50 lakh persons were infected in a span of just two and a half months in Chennai. The rapid rise in cases and the fast deterioration of patients put great strain on major hospitals. Hospitals ran out of beds even as the demand for oxygen-supported and intensive care unit (ICU) beds surged. Chandru (name changed), a resident of Sithalapakkam, was one of the affected. “My father tested positive for COVID-19, and we managed to get a normal bed at a private hospital on May 14. But his oxygen saturation level dropped from 92 to 85, and nothing helped. He required ventilatory support, but no beds were available at the hospital. We had to shift him to another facility,” he says. After frantic and unsuccessful attempts to get him a 108 ambulance, Chandru managed to take his father, 74, to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance of the private hospital with oxygen support. “We waited in the ambulance. We managed to get an ICU bed only four hours later. The treatment could not save my father,” he says. While the wait and the death of his father was agonising, the number of deaths around him as they waited numbed him. Over two months, the city saw hundreds of such cases. There were desperate hunts for beds, heartbreaking moments of watching loved ones gasp for breath while waiting in ambulances and private vehicles, and serpentine queues outside counters to pick up vials of Remdesivir. Meanwhile, hospital authorities spent sleepless nights waiting for oxygen trucks to arrive. “The numbers were huge this time,” says E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, one of the largest hospitals for COVID-19. Since mid-March, RGGGH has treated 12,000 patients with COVID-19. “The 72 beds in the zero-delay ward were just not enough. So, we increased the number to 238 to immediately attend to patients who were brought in ambulances and required oxygen support, as well as to ease the ambulance lines outside the hospital. We had a maximum of 250 ambulances bringing in patients in one day, 40% of which were from the private sector,” Dr Theranirajan says. From April 24 to May 10, the hospital saw its per day oxygen requirement soaring to 40-45 metric tonnes a day. With beds in all seven floors of Tower-3 filled up, Dr Theranirajan and his team started to open COVID-19 wards in other blocks. The number of beds quickly rose from 1,618 to 2,050, with the number of oxygen beds increasing from 817 to 1,522 from May 5 until now. “In the first wave, the maximum number of in-patients we saw in a day was 1,083. This time, it was 1,658. We had over 1,600 in-patients for 15 continuous days. What made the second wave different from the first was the number of people requiring oxygen. We had 1,300 patients on oxygen therapy at a given point in time this year,” he says. The hospitals faced several challenges: decongesting ambulances on campus, starting treatment on time, stabilising patients being wheeled in, and even adding space for the dead. The doctors knew that they had to think differently. So, a team of three doctors along with technicians was deployed to triage patients waiting in ambulances and a respiratory care team was sent to assess every patient’s oxygen needs and provide appropriate dosage, he says. The surge in cases The first wave peaked on June 30, 2020 in Chennai, when 2,393 daily cases were reported. They gradually declined after that and were lower than 1,000 a day by mid-October. On February 19, 2021, Chennai saw just 136 cases. By then, the State was preparing for the Assembly elections and all the COVID-19 control measures taken during the first wave in Chennai and other places were scaled down considerably. The early signs of a resurgence in cases were noticed in the first week of March. Cases began to go up marginally. By the first week of April, when the State went to the polls, the number of daily reported cases had crossed 1,000. The number continued to rise sharply and on May 2, when the election results brought a change of government, the cases crossed the 6,000-mark. More than crowding during elections or other factors, the sudden increase was primarily due to the mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2, says Alby John Varghese, Deputy Commissioner (Health), Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). P. Ganeshkumar, Scientist D, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, says the new variants of the virus, poor adherence to COVID-19-appropriate behavior such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing, and not seeking early care for COVID-19-like symptoms were the major factors for the rise in cases. “New variants of the virus circulating in the population contributed to the higher transmissibility of the infection in the second wave. This led to higher case load compared to the first wave,” he says. The seroprevalence study conducted during the first wave showed that 44.2% of the population in Tondiarpet and 34.4% in Royapuram, two of the worst-affected zones, had been exposed to the virus. “One would have thought that the second wave would not affect these zones much. But there was a large number of cases here as well, which is likely because of the new strains. We did not expect it to be this infectious with more people becoming sick and requiring hospitalisation,” Dr Varghese says. Analysis of zone-wise data showed that while the cases were comparatively lower in these two zones than the others during the second wave, the two nevertheless remained significantly affected. The spread was more aggressive in the southern and central regions than the northern regions this time. While the northern zone accounted for 34% of all cases in the first wave, it accounted for only 28% in the second wave. By the time the new government was sworn in on May 7, it was becoming impossible for many patients to get oxygen-supported or ICU beds in hospitals. Social media was flooded with requests for beds or oxygen. It appeared as if the city was heading towards the crisis faced earlier in Delhi and Bengaluru. “We had two main challenges in the city,” says J. Radhakrishnan, Health Secretary. “People threw the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to the wind. When cases surged, the situation put the oxygen and ICU bed capacity to test. Despite having the best hospitals in both the government and private sector, this was a big challenge,” he says. Rise in fatalities The deaths due to COVID-19 kept rising in the city. A government doctor, on condition of anonymity, said it was agonising to see young persons succumb to the infection, primarily due to respiratory failure. “Some were brought dead to hospitals,” he says. The crisis began to take a huge toll on healthcare workers. “It was very stressful. Some of my friends from other departments who were posted on COVID-19 duty had to take sedatives to sleep as they had never seen so many people dying around them,” says a PG student. On May 12, when Chennai recorded 7,564 daily COVID-19 cases, the highest since the start of the pandemic, Dilli Rajan, the caretaker of Velangadu crematorium, stood beside a hearse, directing his seven assistants to work late into the night to cremate the bodies. Several hearses had lined up at the crematorium. Prior to COVID-19, cremations were held only till 6 p.m. “During the first wave, the number of cremations decreased from eight to two a day at our crematorium. During the second wave, the number increased to 32 a day,” says Dilli Rajan, who lost his aunt during the pandemic. The situation was similar in most of the 41 crematoriums in Chennai. GCC data show an increase from 150 death registrations a day to more than 350 a day during the second wave. Since the last week of March, the city has reported more than 3,300 deaths, almost close to the total deaths reported during the first wave till October 2020. However, the case fatality rate has remained low compared to the first wave. While it was around 1.8% during the first wave, it is currently 1.4%. “Under-reporting of deaths continues. Very sick patients are not subjected to RT-PCR testing. They succumb to the infection and those deaths are not counted as COVID-19 deaths. This is also true of patients with suspected symptoms of COVID-19,” an official says. Non-COVID-19 deaths have also increased by 300% in many crematoriums, which is a major cause of concern for public health officials. One of the reasons for the rise in the number of deaths during the second wave in Chennai has been the crowding of tertiary care government hospitals by patients who do not require higher-level medical care. With limited number of beds in government and private tertiary care hospitals, many patients who required emergency care were unable to get admitted to hospitals. The turnaround The situation, however, was controlled and stabilised through multi-pronged community-level strategies before it spiralled out of control. The State government imposed a complete lockdown on May 10. While this was aimed at curbing the rapid spread of infection, it also gave the much-needed breather for hospitals and time to scale up the infrastructure. Door-to-door fever surveillance to proactively identify cases at an early stage was ramped up and so were screening centres for triaging, and telecounselling centres. While these measures existed during the first wave, new ones were added to tackle the second surge. Two hundred and fifty-one car ambulances with oxygen support were introduced to address the shortage of ambulances and ensure zero-delay transfers to hospitals. Another key initiative was field triaging. With the 13 screening centres located in different parts of the city proving inadequate to handle the surge, field triaging was introduced. Two hundred and fifty-one teams, each comprising a doctor and two nurses, were formed. “The field triaging team visits every person who tests positive at their doorstep. If further examination or hospitalisation is needed, the person is taken to a nearby facility. Else, they are asked to isolate at home. Further follow-ups are done through the telecounselling centres,” Dr Varghese says. Every patient in home isolation is called at least once a day by the telecounselling centres, where final year MBBS students along with doctors are deployed. More than 12,000 fever survey workers have been deployed to visit every household to identify people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is in addition to around 400 fever survey camps across the city, mainly focusing on hotspot areas. A group of volunteers called ‘Friends of COVID Citizen Under Surveillance’ was deployed to assist those under home isolation. The members provided groceries and monitored adherence to rules. Apart from these measures, the Medical and Family Welfare Department worked on increasing the bed capacity and set up a Unified Command Centre (UCC) for bed allocation and oxygen monitoring, which was later converted to the State’s war room for COVID-19. From the day it was set up as a UCC on April 30 till May 25, more than 60,000 calls were received requesting beds and oxygen support. An official working at the UCC says that while the UCC was able to fulfil only 30% of the requests in the initial days, it has been able to fulfil more than 60% of the requests in the past one week. Dr Varghese also says technology was used both for administrative purposes (for efficient monitoring and deployment of resources) and for the public. An example is the GCC VidMed application. Given the difficulties for many to visit a doctor or a hospital, the app was launched to enable patients to consult doctors online. “While we deployed technology, we were also conscious about technology not becoming a barrier for those from underprivileged backgrounds to seek help. So, we had helpline numbers, proactively called those under home quarantine and also ensured visits by field staff,” he says. By now, a ‘Chennai Model’ had emerged. Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that he wanted other cities to emulate some features of this model. GCC Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi says the Chennai Model of COVID-19 prevention and case management has become more effective because it is “community driven”. “We have 200 mobile teams, 10 mobile units, 42 static centres, and 140 urban primary health centres carrying out doorstep COVID-19 testing with a turnaround time of 24 hours,” he says. All laboratories have to report results to residents through the single-window system adopted by the GCC, for better coordination. The civic body has “established oxygen centres, promoted a symptomatic case management system irrespective of the test results, accelerated vaccination services for the elderly, disabled and non-ambulatory elderly, and hired FOCUS volunteers for helping residents who are in home isolation,” Bedi adds. GCC’s Deputy Commissioner (Works) Meghanath Reddy says the second wave was managed through several micro-targeted interventions. “We constituted 30 zonal enforcement teams to enforce lockdown SOPs. We launched 100 mask kiosks to distribute seven lakh reusable masks,” he says. Ramping up facilities Amid the raging pandemic, government hospitals continued to ramp up infrastructure. They needed more beds, oxygen points, oxygen supply and manpower to handle the rising number of patients. “There are 6,500 oxygen-supported beds in institutions under the Directorate of Medical Education in the city. We have oxygen centres with 2,500 beds. There are 20 COVID-19 Health Centres with 3,085 beds and 24 COVID-19 Care Centres in 24 places with 16,000 beds,” says R. Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education. In the meantime, vaccination has started to pick up in Chennai. While Tamil Nadu’s overall performance on vaccination leaves much to be desired, Chennai has done significantly well compared to most other cities with around 70% of the elderly receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. GCC plans to vaccinate at least 50,000 persons a day from the present 23,000 once the vaccine supply improves. Till date, the city has achieved a coverage of approximately 19 lakh (two doses). Cases fall in city, rise in districts Cases have begun to show a declining trend in Chennai, dropping from a peak of 7,772 cases on May 12 to 2,762 cases on May 28. The burden of cases in Tamil Nadu is shifting to the rural areas. Chennai accounted for 25% of the 30,355 cases reported in the State on May 12, while on May 26, it accounted for 10% of the 33,764 cases reported. “Chennai has started showing a declining trend. The fall in cases with 30,000-odd tests a day is a welcome sign. But this is the time we need to be extremely careful,” Radhakrishnan says. There is a gradual decline in the weekly percentage change in incidence and daily test positivity observed from the reported data in Chennai. Dr Ganeshkumar says, “This may indicate to us that the spread is limited. When this current trend continues, Chennai will further limit the spread of infection.” Cases have started to rise in a number of districts. As the Health Secretary points out, “Cases are increasing in 19 districts. This included the western districts, Theni, Madurai and Tiruchi. This is definitely a cause for concern as we need to ensure that the spread does not reach rural areas. Containment and public health measures will continue with no let-up.” With inputs from Pon Vasanth B.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Democracy at stake in Nepal||Nepal is facing its severest political crisis in decades. The repeated dissolution of Parliament, from last December to May this year, is not just a manifestation of the power struggle between political parties and leaders in Nepal but also a dangerous game plan by national and international forces to dismantle the federal republican democratic Constitution and restore the old Hindu monarchical state. It is really anachronistic that the so-called Marxist-Leninist party headed by Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli is in collusion with Hindu monarchical forces in Nepal and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in India. A section of the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) led by Mahanta Thakur and Rajendra Mahato have been lured or forced to join hands with Mr. Oli, who is notorious for his anti-Madhesh tirade till the other day. Autocratic splash Even when India’s political and diplomatic culture saw a departure from best past practices, it was expected that its official regime would always support multiparty democracy, progressive political action and changing fundamentals. Contrary to this, India is being seen backing an autocratic and unconstitutional regime, surviving in ‘caretaker mode’ with the connivance of Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Mr. Oli. In helping an unpopular and illegitimate regime in Kathmandu, the game-plan seems to be to derail the Constitution and plunge the country into endless crisis. It is impossible to understand how this will benefit either India or Nepal, especially when the establishment in New Delhi is perceived here to be hell bent on turning Nepal into a Hindu state and scrapping federalism as well (ultimately disempowering oppressed Madhesis, Tharus, Janajatis, women and others). The statement by India’s Ministry of External Affairs, that “political developments in Nepal are the country’s internal matters” did not help too in changing the popular perception. If the objective is to scrap the present Constitution to undo the Kalapani-Limpiadhura map episode, why throw the baby out with the bathwater? The India-Nepal boundary issue can be resolved through serious political dialogue. There should be a trade-off between the developmental aspirations of Nepal and the strategic concerns of India, in the light of changing geopolitical dynamics in the Himalayan region. India should do course correction and should not throw its weight behind an autocratic regime; it must reassure all who care for the peace and the prosperity of Nepal by reposing faith in Nepal’s democracy and due processes. Also, India must fulfil the promises it made for COVID-19 vaccines to Nepal. The glaring gap between the promises made and delivery has been a big disappointment; people should never be kept in lurch like this. The twists and turns It is in the public domain that the Opposition alliance in Nepal filed a petition in the Supreme Court last week demanding that the Nepali Congress’s Sher Bahadur Deuba be declared the new Prime Minister and the House of Representatives be reinstated. As many as 146 members of the dissolved House of Representatives — 61 from the Nepali Congress, 49 from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), 23 from the Madhav Nepal faction of the CPN-UML, 12 from a section of the JSP and one from the Rastriya Janamorcha Nepal — have signed the petition, challenging Mr. Oli and Ms. Bhandari’s House dissolution moved late on the night of May 21 and disqualified Mr. Deuba’s claim that he be appointed Prime Minister. Representing the Opposition alliance, Mr. Deuba had presented the signatures of 149 lawmakers to prove that he commanded the majority to lead a new government in this crisis phase when Nepal is witnessing an unprecedented crisis with the novel coronavirus pandemic and an abjectly poor counter-response by the Oli-occupied regime. Without any delay in subverting constitutionally due procedures, Mr. Oli too made a ridiculous claim that he be appointed Prime Minister, while technically still being the Prime Minister, falsely claiming to have the backing of 153 lawmakers. Since the plot was scripted, he failed to name those lawmakers. After the President disqualified both claims as the most suitable possibility for Mr. Oli, he, through a dramatic midnight Cabinet meeting, recommended the House’s dissolution. The President duly obliged him and his autocratic manoeuvring that have hammered democratic principles and national interest. Alas! For the manner in which Ms. Bhandari has acted to keep Mr. Oli in power and undermining her constitutional role as the first citizen of the country, impeachment will be the easiest exit route for her. A graceful exit is not an idea tempting enough for her and Mr. Oli; so going in for the lawful provision of impeachment is a prerequisite to restore eroded faith in the presidential position and due processes. Ms. Bhandari’s role in public life has been questioned earlier too, as she, as the President of a new democracy, did all possible to weaken the system and make Mr. Oli a walking authority above the Constitution. Never ever was she deterred by fierce public criticism and continued her business as usual with Mr. Oli. In a press conference recently, Mr. Oli said, “Disrespect for the President is disrespect for the republican system. In a monarchy, there is a King, in a republic system, there is a President. The President is the symbol of republicanism and an attack on the dignity of the Office of the President is an attack on the republic system.” This makes things very clear. Ironically, Ms. Bhandari and Mr. Oli are two prominent figures who have consistently disrespected and abused the President’s high office for their shared political gains — and made it subservient to the executive whims and fancies. Mr. Oli’s sudden bout of nostalgia for the long gone monarchy is not just his bid to revisit the history but is also something in progression and from the hope he has been given by his invisible handlers and friends, in both the north and the south. He is not an original thinker. He is counting on a plan to drive the country to the brink of a constitutional crisis, stay at the helm as an authoritarian caretaker Prime Minister with an unreasonably friendly President, and force the country into elections when even the next moment is uncertain. To end their Machiavellian treachery, the Opposition alliance has to rise to the occasion and make all possible efforts to foil the unholy plan. Nepal at the crossroads Nepal’s quest should be to redeem its lost glory, and for the first time, avail its true development potential — and stop being a ‘theatre of the absurd’ and hosting the harmful advances of neighbours involved in geostrategic rivalries. On the domestic front, an increased focus should be on homework, instead of leveraging on vulnerabilities and the making of unruly partners. In a functional democracy, statecraft is not supposed to be altruistic till it relies on progressive policy and governance — with an aim to augment the mission of ‘greater common good’.  Long ago, the People’s War was over in Nepal, with a transitory accomplishment of a goal in a new republic. However, the task is still unfinished till the people-centric priorities are not driving the political agenda and action. Despite all the flaws, Nepal should protect its democracy that is now at stake because of actions by political opportunists. Politicians such as Mr. Oli and Ms Bhandari have endangered the country’s prospects. However, an accomplished democracy like Nepal will rise again. For sure, the road ahead is not easy and it is going to be one of struggle. If the Opposition alliance makes a resolve and fights back, it is likely that the new republic will gain in the long term.The big powers should take note of this.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Humanity matters, capitalism needs an upgrade||The COVID-19 vaccine crisis is another tragic instance of a clash between the needs of humanity and the principles of capitalism. Capitalists insist that private producers of vaccines must make profits because that is their compensation for investing in research and production. If the prices they charge are beyond the reach of poor people, they are not morally compelled to serve them at a loss. Then, governments must step in and buy from private producers and subsidise sales to poorer people. For which, governments need revenues of course, and taxes on private companies could be a significant source. However, if private companies also press governments for lower taxes, to make their investments more attractive; and if the government is also pushed by them, on ideological grounds, to stay out of business, viz . not having any “public sector” production enterprises, governments find both their hands tied behind their backs in crises when citizens blame them for breakdowns of public services. The Indian government is facing this crisis now. Conversion of the commons How Will Capitalism End? Ask Wolfgang Streeck and his co-authors in their book with that title. It will end, they say, when the forces that support capitalism run out. Capitalism expands by converting “the commons” into private capital. Economists justify this on practical grounds: it is the ‘tragedy of the commons’, Garrett Hardin postulated, that people will not care for something unless they own it. This is an ongoing justification for capitalist businesses owning land and forests and water resources. Businesses convert natural capital into financial capital and use it for generating profits and more capital for themselves. Over-exploitation of the earth’s resources to produce profits has contributed to the crisis of environmental sustainability and climate change. The concept of ownership of assets for creating wealth had gone too far when slaves without human rights were used in capitalist enterprises as their economic assets until moralists objected. Creation of monopolies Slavery is banned by law and the earth’s resources are limited. Therefore, capitalism has moved on to convert knowledge into private property. Modern regimes of intellectual property rights (IPR) with armies of patent lawyers help capitalists to create intellectual property monopolies. Thus, people are denied the use of their own knowledge — as they are when natural products, such as neem and turmeric are patented by capitalists. Thereby, communities whose traditions produced the knowledge must pay those who stole it from them, albeit legally. The public contributes to the creation of scientific knowledge in many ways, for example through government research and development grants and subsidies, as Mariana Mazzucato explains in her book, The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy . In fact, large public assistance in various ways has enabled U.S. pharmaceutical companies to develop their new COVID-19 vaccines at ‘warp speed’. India has been a spoiler in the global Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) regime which was promoted by the World Trade Organization in 1995 for uniform global IPR rules. TRIPS is founded on the principle of “product patents”. India had a different approach to IPR based on “process patents”. Product patents allow inventors of new drugs to have exclusive rights to produce and sell them for some years. Producers can use their monopoly to fix higher prices and make more profits for recovering their investments in drug development. Thus, the quantum of production is limited by the inventor to keep prices high. On the other hand, the process patents route forced Indian producers to invent better processes for producing larger volumes at lower costs of ‘generic’ versions of the medicine. This benefited citizens of poorer countries including India. However, Indian generic drug producers became threats to the pricing power of ‘innovator’ drug producers from the West. TRIPS does have a provision to enable governments to enforce ‘compulsory licensing’. They can demand that an innovator company must allow domestic, lower cost, producers to increase the supply of the drug in an emergency, with compensation to the inventor of course. However, western companies do not like this provision, which has been used before by the South African government, for example, to get drugs for AIDS produced by Indian low cost producers when the AIDS pandemic was raging and Africans could not pay the high prices charged by western companies. This is the provision that South Africa and India want to invoke now to enable production of the new U.S. invented COVID-19 vaccines whose prices are too high for poorer countries. There are three stakeholders involved in a system to produce adequate volumes of affordable medicines: citizens who need the medicines, governments who must ensure they get them, and private companies who produce and sell them. If the stand of private companies is that because their business must be only business, and the public good is not their responsibility, governments must step in. They must have the means to regulate the prices and also to enhance production. However, if private companies (and the economists who support them) take the view that any interventions by governments distort the market, and go even further to say that taxes must be reduced to make their investments more attractive, governments have both hands tied behind their backs when they have to step in to help people in distress. Public sector versus private Many economists do not like ‘public sector’ enterprises. Whenever governments set up ‘public sector’ enterprises, such as banks, hospitals, and schools, economists can prove that these enterprises do not produce as much shareholder returns than they would if they were ‘privatised’. If they were privatised, their owners’ objectives would be primarily, if not entirely, to maximise returns to investors. In that case, public benefits are relegated to the background, or even drop right off the table. Therefore ‘private’ will always be better than ‘public’ by the limited metric of shareholder returns.  The purpose of governments is to improve the all-round well-being of all citizens; not merely to provide products to customers who can pay good prices for them, which is the means by which private enterprises meet their objective of producing profits for their investors. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the inadequacy of capitalism to fulfil societal needs. If capitalist enterprises are not willing to fulfil public purposes, governments must create more public spirited enterprises to provide public goods equitably to all citizens. Relentless economic growth is devouring the earth that hosts humanity. With artificial intelligence algorithms in social media, capitalist enterprises are able to manipulate human minds. Their investors have become the richest people on the planet. New mRNA technologies on which some new COVID-19 vaccines are based provide the means to manipulate the composition of human bodies. Thus, capitalists can create even more wealth for themselves off human beings.  Time to reflect Money-driven capitalist values have drifted too far from human values. Money has become the supreme measure of success in all spheres: the wealth of individuals, the size of companies, and the scales of nations’ economies. The sustainable health of complex systems — which human beings and societies are — is being lost sight of. The COVID-19 crisis will not end capitalism. But capitalism must mutate to survive. Companies must rethink the purpose for their existence. It is imperative now that more human and less money values are adopted.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Timely windfall||The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to transfer Rs. 99,122 crore of surplus to the Centre comes as a windfall to the government, at a moment when the ferocious second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has likely upended most projections for the economy including revenue assumptions. The payout is almost double the Rs. 53,511 crore that the Finance Minister had budgeted for by way of dividend receipts, including from nationalised banks and financial institutions. That the RBI has generated a surplus that is over 73% higher than what it posted for the previous 12-month period ended June 2020, is also noteworthy when one considers that the bank just changed its accounting calendar from July-June to an April-March format by truncating its last financial year to a nine-month period. The RBI’s annual report, released on Thursday, shows that a sharp 63% contraction in expenditure was a major factor in boosting the surplus, especially as income fell by 11%. However, the biggest contributor in real terms was the Rs. 50,629 crore of exchange gain realised by the central bank from its foreign exchange transactions. The central bank, which admits to intervening in the foreign exchange market to smoothe volatility, clearly had a very busy time mopping up the record foreign direct investment inflows that exceeded $81 billion (at a gross level) in the last financial year, as well as the sizeable portfolio investments from overseas. Still, a 69% increase in exchange gain, over the preceding 12-month period, prompts the question as to whether the RBI’s foreign exchange transactions were all entirely aimed only at stabilising the rupee’s value. Given the magnitude of economic disruption caused by the ongoing pandemic and the lack of visibility on the costs that the economy is going to have to bear in the coming months, the RBI’s transfer surely provides a much-needed buffer to the government’s finances. However, both the Centre and the central bank need to be cognisant of the risks in making a habit of banking on these surpluses to cushion the government’s coffers. After all, just two years ago, the RBI had transferred a record Rs. 1.76-lakh crore to the exchequer. While the Reserve Bank has ensured that it maintains contingency reserves at exactly 5.5% of the overall size of its balance sheet, the level of its reserves provides little wiggle room to safeguard against a sudden, unexpected financial crisis and is at the lower end of the 5.5%-6.5% band recommended by the Bimal Jalan committee. With the government facing the likelihood of overshooting its budgeted borrowing, given the higher spending needed to bolster vaccinations, health care and direct fiscal support, the RBI’s balance sheet could swell in size this year too. It would behove policymakers to remember that the central bank is ultimately the lender of last resort to the nation as a whole and can ill-afford to be less than adequately funded to meet every conceivable contingency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/timely-windfall/article34671980.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||In two minds||Not everyone is enthused about the biggest sporting event of the world, due in a couple of months in Tokyo. Less than a fortnight ago, Roger Federer spoke about the uncertainty looming over the Olympics, saying ‘athletes need a firm decision’ and that he is in two minds about the event. There are two diametrically opposite voices emerging from Japan. As the coronavirus pandemic rages across the island nation, a BBC report stated that only 1.9% of the population has been fully vaccinated while COVID-19 infections and current deaths stand at over 7,00,000 and 12,000, respectively. Hospitals are overwhelmed and fully aware of that grim context; a majority of Japanese citizens emphasised that the Olympics should either be postponed or cancelled while their collective voice found resonance through opinion polls. As a counter, local officials and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) held firm that the Games will be conducted from July 23 to August 8. The quadrennial showpiece championship originally slated for 2020 was postponed by a year during the first wave of the pandemic, and organisers believe that an event with a staggering $15.4 billion budget cannot afford another reworking of the dates. The Olympics has always been about striving for the impossible as evident in its motto — faster, higher, stronger — which defined the Games ever since its modern version commenced at Athens in 1896. It braved past the gaps caused by the World Wars as the 1916, 1940 and 1944 events were shelved and also coped with the Cold War years when the Western and Eastern blocs took turns to boycott the 1980 and 1984 Games. But the pandemic is a bigger obstacle even while vaccination drives continue at varied speeds. People do yearn for normalcy and sport offers that illusory thrill of everything being fine with the world. Seen through that prism, the Olympics is the highest benchmark. European football, international cricket and Grand Slam tennis have all resurfaced while following COVID-19 protocols. But there are no fool-proof measures as the latest truncated Indian Premier League edition clearly revealed. Despite best practices and bio-bubbles, sportspeople are vulnerable to the virus and the Olympics with an expected attendance of 11,091 athletes, can be a logistical nightmare. The IOC is walking on the razor’s edge in its bid to conduct the Olympics in a reluctant nation, where even an event partner, Asahi Shimbun daily, sought the cancellation of the Games citing the strain on the health sector. So far, the most pessimistic of the experts have been the ones being proved right.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-two-minds/article34671981.ece

Disbursements climbed 13% to Rs. 3,305 crore. For FY21, the company saw net profit grow to Rs. 809 crore, from Rs. 724 crore in the previous year. Disbursements declined to Rs. 11,742 crore (Rs. 15,175 crore). This was primarily due to the COVID-led lockdown and associated disruptions to the overall economy in Q1 and Q2 of FY21, and the adverse impact to the automotive sector, said Rajiv Lochan, managing director. Assets under management grew 3% to Rs. 30,882 crore as on March 31. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) fell to 2.28% from 2.77%. The board recommended a final dividend of Rs. 6 per share. Deputy MD A.N. Raju said the pandemic was spurring some small operators of trucks to move across segments. “Some who operated in the large commercial vehicles (CVs) space have moved into the light CV segment.” “Four weeks back, we had hoped... for a recovery in the CV sector by the second half of this year. Wave two has pushed recovery back by about three months,” he said. “We expect tippers to remain strong this year.

29 May 2021||Porto,||Chelsea stands in City’s way||Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City is 90 minutes away from the trophy it so desperately craves but a Chelsea side transformed in recent months stands in its way in Saturday’s all-English Champions League final. It is the third final of Europe’s elite club competition to be played between two Premier League sides, and the second in just three seasons. The west London club has the experience of this stage before, having beaten Bayern Munich on penalties on its own turf in the 2012 final. It has also won the Europa League twice since then. City, though, has never made it this far but is finally here, after four previous years of disappointment under Guardiola, the man who was hired principally to win it. Similar team “We are quite a similar team to what we were in the past when we were knocked out. The margins and little details this year fell down on our side whereas before it was the opposite,” said Guardiola, who is looking to win his third Champions League as a coach, a decade after his last victory with Barcelona. City starring the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Ruben Dias is the clear favourite at the Estadio do Dragao. Chelsea, though, has beaten City twice in the last six weeks, first in the FA Cup semi-final and then at the Etihad Stadium in the league. “I could not expect a tougher opponent,” Guardiola said. Transformed side Chelsea has been transformed since Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as coach in January, even if it did finish the domestic season with three defeats in four games including the FA Cup final against Leicester City. “We have arrived here. This is an incredible achievement and once you arrive you want to be on your very best, but it’s City with Pep on the other side who are maybe at the moment the best in Europe, maybe in the world,” said Tuchel, who was given a boost as fitness concerns Edouard Mendy and N’Golo Kante returned to training on Wednesday. “It is on us again to close the gap for 90 minutes and the good thing is we did it already.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chelsea-stands-in-citys-way/article34672125.ece
29 May 2021||DUBAI,||A joint winner in case of a draw or tie||India and New Zealand will be adjudged the joint winner of the inaugural World Test Championship if their final clash in Southampton ends in a draw or tie, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Friday. According to the playing conditions unveiled by the global body, “a draw or a tie will see both teams crowned as joint winners...” The ICC has also allocated a Reserve Day to make up for any lost time during the regular days of the Final, scheduled to be played from 18 to 22 June, with 23 June set aside as the Reserve Day. The Reserve Day has been scheduled to ensure five full days of play, and it will only be used if lost playing time cannot be recovered through the normal provisions for each day. “There will be no additional day’s play if a positive result is not achieved after five full days of play and the match will be declared a draw in such a scenario,” the ICC stated. In the event of time being lost during the match, the ICC match referee will regularly update the teams and media about the way in which the Reserve Day may be used. While India plays at home with SG Test cricket ball and New Zealand uses Kookaburra at home, the final will be played with Grade 1 Dukes balls. The final will also feature the implementation of three changes to international playing conditions, which were brought into effect with the ongoing World Cup Super League series between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka: Short runs: The Third Umpire will automatically review any call of a ‘short run’ by the on-field umpire and communicate the decision prior to the next ball being bowled. Player Reviews: The fielding captain or the dismissed batsman will be able confirm with the umpire whether a genuine attempt has been made to play the ball prior to deciding whether to initiate a review for LBW. DRS Reviews — For LBW reviews, the height margin of the wicket zone has been lifted to the top of the stumps to ensure the same Umpire’s Call margin around the stumps for both height and width.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-joint-winner-in-case-of-a-draw-or-tie/article34672083.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Belgium should be everyone’s top bet||Belgium has its best chance to win its first major trophy, and underline a long-standing status as the top team in the FIFA rankings, with the European Championship set to run from June 11 to July 12. An impressive array of talented players, many at their peak, are available to coach Roberto Martinez as Belgium is expected to ease past Russia, Denmark and Finland in Group B and become the team to avoid in the knockouts. Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois are world stars while Romelu Lukaku’s impressive scoring form this season helped Inter Milan become Italian champion and extended his record as Belgium’s top marksman to 59 goals. The right mix The rest of the team is populated with a mix of vast experience and exciting, emerging talent. Captain Jan Vertonghen, 34, in defence has 126 caps, midfielder Axel Witsel 110 and Napoli forward Dries Mertens 96 while 24-year-old Youri Tielemans, who scored Leicester City’s FA Cup final winner, is cast as the team’s future talisman. But despite his heroics at club level this term, Tielemans is not guaranteed to start for Belgium such is competition for places in a polished outfit that won all 10 games in its Euro 2020 qualifiers, scoring 40 goals — more than any other country. Extra motivation There is also the extra motivation for the Belgians of making up for their bitter loss to France in the World Cup semifinals three years ago when they felt they let a chance for glory slip. Far from certain But Martinez has warned that winning the Euros is far from certain.  “It’s a bit of a bizarre tournament because we as the top seeds in our group have no protection. “It has never happened in the history of the Euros, or the World Cup for that matter, that we play against two home teams. Most strange,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/belgium-should-be-everyones-top-bet/article34672085.ece
29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||Tokyo hopes end for Saina and Srikanth||The confirmation by the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Friday that no further tournaments will be played inside the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifying window has effectively dashed the hopes of London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal, former World No. 1 K. Srikanth and leading women’s doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy. “The Olympic qualification process is in effect closed as there are no additional opportunities for players to earn points,” said BWF secretary-general Thomas Lund. The BWF also stated that while the qualification period officially closes on June 15 as per the revised Tokyo 2020 qualification system, the current ‘Race To Tokyo’ rankings list will not change. The Indian shuttlers were unfortunate to see cancellation of the India Open and the Malaysian Open and also miss the Singapore Open because of quarantine rules. World champion and Rio silver medallist P.V. Sindhu, World championship bronze medallist B. Sai Praneeth and the lead men’s pair of R. Satwiksairaj and Chirag Shetty will now spearhead the Indian challenge in Tokyo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tokyo-hopes-end-for-saina-and-srikanth/article34672070.ece
29 May 2021||MUMBAI,||BCCI SGM to discuss IPL, T20 WC||Representatives of each of the 38 full members of the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI’s) will, on Saturday, explore the options in resuming the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) and the venues for the T20 World Cup in a virtual Special General Meeting (SGM). With the COVID-19 breaching the IPL bio-secure bubble, the IPL was suspended with 31 matches remaining in the tournament. It has led to doubts over India’s ability to host the T20 World Cup in October-November. With the International Cricket Council (ICC) scheduled to discuss the T20 World Cup venues, the BCCI hierarchy is hoping to get its members on board in case the tournament cannot be played in India. Venues shortlisted Despite earmarking the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as an alternate venue for the World Cup, the BCCI apex council last month shortlisted nine venues for the marquee event. The Hindu understands that the members will be presented with two options that the BCCI intends to propose to the ICC on June 1. The first is to host the tournament in the “west zone corridor” with Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad as venues to minimise air travel. But if the ICC Board doesn’t budge, then the BCCI members are likely to be briefed about the possible financial ramifications of the BCCI staging the World Cup in UAE. “Anyway, with very less international cricket in India over the last year, the States’ share is going to dip. It will be a bigger hit should the BCCI host the tournament overseas. How will they calculate revenue sharing with ICC? All these issues will hopefully be discussed,” said a State association official, preferring anonymity. The other inter-linked question is obviously rescheduling the IPL. At the moment, the BCCI is trying its best to squeeze in the IPL in UAE between its Test series in England (scheduled to end on September 14) and the T20 World Cup (likely to start by October 20). However, with England and Australia boards unlikely to make players available at the cost of their respective national teams’ build-up for the T20 World Cup, it will be interesting if the September window gets a go-ahead on Saturday. “If IPL has to be played without Australia and England cricketers anyway, wouldn’t it be better to schedule it after T20 World Cup?” queried another State association official. “All these issues will be discussed but I doubt if there will be any concrete decision considering the COVID-19 dynamics and the BCCI politics.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-sgm-to-discuss-ipl-t20-wc/article34672071.ece
29 May 2021||Belgrade,||Djokovic reaches Belgrade final||Novak Djokovic eased into the final of the ATP tournament in Belgrade on Friday despite losing his form in the second set, beating Slovakia's Andrej Martin as he steps up his preparations for Roland Garros. The World No. 1 saw off his 119th-ranked opponent 6-1, 4-6, 6-0. It will be the Serbian's third final of the year after his Australian Open triumph and his final loss to Rafael Nadal at the Italian Open last week, but his first on home soil since 2011. "I'm super excited to play in front of a Serbian crowd. This is my home town. I'm always excited, but also nervous, coming out on the court and playing in front of my home crowd," Djokovic said. "It's a very unique feeling. You feel a lot of pressure and expectations. But I'm just happy to fight for a trophy tomorrow." After racing through the first set against Martin, Djokovic uncharacteristically took his foot off the gas and was broken three times in the second set. The 34-year-old was back to his best in the decider, though, quickly ending any thought of a surprise comeback. Meanwhile at Parma, Italian Marco Cecchinato made the finals of the Emilia-Romagna Open, putting up a fight to beat Spain’s Jaume Munar 7-6(2), 1-6, 6-1.   The results: Semifinals:   At Belgrade: Belgrade Open: Novak Djokovic bt Andrej Martin 6-1, 4-6, 6-0; Alex Molcan bt Federico Delbonis 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.   At Parma: Emilia-Romagna Open: Marco Cecchinato bt Jaume Munar 7-6(2), 1-6, 6-1 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-reaches-belgrade-final/article34672077.ece
29 May 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Sharif Mukhammed to stay on at Gokulam||One of the most memorable moments at the last I-League came in the match between Gokulam Kerala and TRAU. With 20 minutes remaining in what had become the deciding game on the final day of the league, Gokulam was trailing by a goal when Sharif Mukhammad came on to take the free-kick from just outside the penalty box. He scored with a lovely kick and the Kerala team was back in the match. Gokulam scored three more goals as it became the first team ever from Kerala to win the I-League. Sharif was undoubtedly one of the main contributors to Gokulam’s remarkable triumph. He was brilliant in the midfield right through the tournament, in which he gave 799 passes, second only to RoundGlass Punjab’s Joseba Beitia (825). Sharif is set to remain at Gokulam. The Russia-based Afghanistan star’s contract has been extended for another season by the Kozhikode-based club. Memorable experience “I am glad to renew the contract with Gokulam Kerala,” said Sharif. “Last year it was a memorable experience for me to be with the Malabarians. We want to win more titles in the upcoming year and I hope we will have another superb season ahead.” Gokulam’s Italian coach, Vincenzo Alberto Annese, is understandably delighted. “I am so happy to have Sharif for the next season also,” Annese said. “He is a top-quality player in our league. He is a strong midfielder with experience in playing in Asia Cup. He is a leader in midfield and he can balance very nicely between attacking and defensive phases. Sharif is also a good free-kick take.” Not many would dispute with that last sentence from the Gokulam coach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sharif-mukhammed-to-stay-on-at-gokulam/article34672300.ece

29 May 2021||NEW DELHI,||Iniyan joins Gukesh in lead; Adhiban trails||P. Iniyan’s four wins on the trot saw him catch up with D. Gukesh in the lead after a dramatic third day of the AICF World Cup qualifier on Friday. Iniyan, trained by Chennai-based K. Visweswaran, accounted for fellow-GMs S. L. Narayanan, Vishnu Prasanna besides International Master Soumya Swaminathan and FIDE Master Vatsal Singhania. In form In-form Gukesh started by holding second seed S. P. Sethuraman, then pulled off wins against top seed B. Adhiban, M. Vinay Kumar and Rahul Srivatshav. If Adhiban could add only 2.5 points from four rounds, much like Sethuraman, Surya Shekhar Ganguly had a forgettable day. After winning all four rounds on Thursday, Ganguly suffered three stunning defeats to Adhiban, M. Vinay Kumar and Rahul Srivatshav before signing off with a consolation win over S. Nitin. As a result, Ganguly kept Adhiban company at the sixth spot with six points. Saravana Krishnan, Narayanan, Deep and Soumya were given a bye, in that order.  The standings (after Day Three): 1-2. D. Gukesh, P. Iniyan (8.5 points each); 3-4. Rithvik Raja, S.P. Sethuraman (7.5 each); 5. S.L. Narayanan (6.5).   6-7. B. Adhiban, Surya Shekhar Ganguly (6 each), 8-9. Rahul Srivatshav, S.

29 May 2021||HYDERABAD,||We will have a base for world-class training: Aruna||The 2018 World Cup gymnastics bronze medallist, B. Aruna Reddy, believes that once the Gaudium Sportopia gymnastics centre for excellence becomes operational in July this year, it will be the hub of the sport in India. “This facility coming up thanks to the initiative of Gaudium Group on the outskirts of Hyderabad will put in place a system which every gymnast from India is looking forward to,” Aruna said in a chat with The Hindu on Friday. “Yes, well-known coach Manoj Rana will be the mentor of the gymnastics complex in Gaudium and I can tell you not many Indian gymnasts will even think of going abroad for training given the kind of facilities that are coming up there,” she explained. “We will for sure have a base for world-class training in gymnastics at Gaudium,” she said. Break for a week For someone who was the first woman medallist from India in the World Cup women’s vault in Melbourne, Aruna is currently back home for a week’s break from personal training under the guidance of Rana in Ambala where she is preparing for the Slovenia international championship scheduled in September. “With lots of cancellations, it is certainly depressing at missing exposure but since we athletes have to be ready whenever the circuit begins, I am really working hard to be a quality all-round gymnast,” Aruna said. “It is difficult to keep training without any targets, especially with the events getting cancelled because of the pandemic,” she said. The 25-year-old says she is grateful to Aurobindo Pharma’s K. Nityanand Reddy for the financial support being extended to her to continue her training on her own to realise her dream of winning medals at the highest level. Test fitness levels “I worked hard to come back from two knee surgeries and feel really good. But, again, I am also desperate to test my fitness levels in a major event,” she said. “There is a conscious effort to be mentally tough besides attaining peak fitness levels. Badly need a podium to prove my knee is okay,” says the gymnast who, like many from the less glamorous sports, is still searching for a decent job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-will-have-a-base-for-world-class-training-aruna/article34672290.ece
29 May 2021||DUBAI,||Panghal, Thapa inch closer to title||Amit Panghal (52kg) and Shiva Thapa (64kg) gave impressive performances to make it to the finals of the Asian boxing championships here on Friday. Defending champion Panghal, who had beaten Saken Bibossinov in the World championships semifinals, again showed his supremacy over the Kazakh to record a 5-0 victory. Thapa landed some accurate combinations to get the better of top seed Bakhodur Usmonov 4-0. Three women in final Three Indian women, Lalbuatsiahi (64kg), Pooja Rani (75kg) and Anupama (+81kg), had reached the finals on Thursday night.

29 May 2021||Kolkata,||Preparations not ideal: Stimac||Livid with the strict quarantine arrangements in Qatar, Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac on Friday said their preparation is “far from being ideal” for the upcoming World Cup and Asian Cup Qualifiers. Already out of contention for a World Cup berth, India will face Asian champion Qatar on June 3 before taking on Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15) in its remaining group E matches, with an aim to qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup in China. The Sunil Chhetri-led Blue Tigers, who were originally slated to reach Qatar on May 30, advanced their arrival to May 19. As per the strict quarantine, they are not allowed to train in the gym, use the meeting hall or even eat together. “If I knew that everything will be like it is today, I would never accept, to be honest. We could organise such games in such way in India also. At the end we lost possibility of playing two home games,” Stimac told reporters during a virtual interaction. “Here we are now, not in great conditions. This is far away from a proper preparation for the World Cup qualifiers, but it is what it is. This is not a proper football work which needs to be obtained before the World Cup qualifiers.” Under the current circumstances, the Indian players are forced to practice in the corridor, in front of their respective rooms, the 53-year-old Croatian World Cupper said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/preparations-not-ideal-stimac/article34672288.ece

Chikkarangappa has stepped up to lend a helping hand to the underprivileged in his neighbourhood here, much like he did during the first lockdown last year. The golfer organised a drive to give a month’s worth of groceries to 120 families. The initiative benefited migrant workers and caddies in his home course, Eagleton - The Golf Resort. “We conducted our first initiative during the first lockdown, where we gave groceries to around 250 underprivileged people. This is a similar exercise, to help migrant labourers who are currently out of work,” Chikkarangappa told The Hindu here on Friday. “They don’t have any income now. Many of them don’t have ration cards, and no way to feed their families. We also gave groceries to Eagleton addies, as the course has been shut for a month now.” Contributions from Eagleton club members and Chikkarangappa helped fund this initiative. Chikkarangappa believes that it is his duty to serve the needy. “I will continue to help others even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. There are always people who need our support,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chikkarangappa-lends-helping-hand-again/article34672119.ece

Ashwin is now back in another bubble, this time with the Indian team which leaves for a 104-day UK trip on June 2. “I couldn’t sleep for almost 8-9 days. Since I couldn’t sleep, it was really stressful for me. I was playing matches without getting any sleep. And since I found it really taxing, I had to quit IPL and go home midway. “In fact, when I left around at that time, I had thoughts on whether I will be able to play cricket thereafter. “But still, I did what was required at that point of time,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. The IPL was eventually suspended after multiple cases were found in its bio-bubble.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/couldnt-sleep-for-8-9-days-during-ipl-says-ashwin/article34672079.ece

Mr. Milkha’s appetite has also improved,” the hospital said in its bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/milkha-and-his-wife-stable/article34672075.ece
29 May 2021||New Delhi,||India women get first dose of vaccine||All members of the UK-bound Indian women’s cricket team have been administered the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine ahead of their upcoming away series against England beginning on June 16. The Indian team, which is currently in quarantine in Mumbai, will begin its UK tour with a one-off Test in Bristol from June 16. It will be followed by two T20Is on July 9 and 11 in Northampton and three ODIs beginning June 27. “All the players of the women’s team have got their first dose of vaccination. Most of them got it in their respective cities, while a few who didn’t, got their first jabs on Thursday,” a BCCI source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-women-get-first-dose-of-vaccine/article34672080.ece
29 May 2021||Paris,||Media made us what we are: Nadal||Rafael Nadal said on Friday that without the media “we will not be the athletes that we are today” as Naomi Osaka became increasingly isolated over her decision to boycott all French Open press commitments. Nadal, the 13-time French Open champion, said that even though he respected Osaka’s decision, media coverage has driven the success of the sport. “I understand her, but for me, without the press, without the people who are writing the news and achievements that we are having around the world probably we will not be the athletes that we are today,” said Nadal, a 20-time Major winner. “We won't have the recognition that we have around the world, and we will not be that popular.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/media-made-us-what-we-are-nadal/article34672084.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Warriors against wastage||Mahabaleshwar’s farmers harvest strawberries in February. In Himachal Pradesh, apple farmers fill their baskets with glossy red, orange and green globes to be shipped across the country. This year, gripped by the second wave of the pandemic and strict lockdowns, vendors are struggling to reach customers. Wastage is a concern; especially in searing summer months. Vendor G.V. Murthy in Kondapur, Hyderabad, was forced to dispose of nearly 40 kilograms of tomatoes and 10 kilograms of lady’s fingers in the second week of Telangana lockdowns alone. “Usually I sell produce worth Rs. 8,000 on a good week. But now I am barely making Rs. 2,000. I can’t refrigerate all of this produce and so much is going to waste,” he says. This issue has been on the minds of Bengaluru-based qZense’s team:Rubal Chib, an electronics engineer, and Srishti Batra, a PhD scientist, who met at Entrepreneur First’s first cohort. Srishti has always been fascinated by olfaction, and Rubal combined this interest with an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor to create Q-scan. This handheld device identifies a fruit and then detects if it is edible. It also predicts, using algorithmic data, how much longer a given fruit will stay fresh. Soon, Rubal and Srishti got numerous requests from retailers to bring in Q-scan and Q-log — olfactory loggers for storage — to prevent food loss. Rubal believes that investment into such technology has to happen at the grassroots level. “Retailers and sellers have been early adopters of qZense’s tech on a large scale. Farms use it in clocking harvest times.” QZense is operating largely within metro cities, but their tech has been adopted in Himachal by apple farmers and suppliers, as well as orchards in and around Maharashtra and Bengaluru. “Though the agrarian community has been resilient (during the pandemic), the food value chain needs to be more agile,” AgNext’s CEO Taranjeet Singh Brahma insists, “so the demand for low-cost and real-time AI assessment has been high.” AgNext’s Artificial Intelligence platform Qualix offers instant and on-field chemical, physical and ambient assessments for food safety, security and quality from farm to store. As an example, he points to the frequent problem farmers need to resolve — that of moisture in grains. The quality of grain reduces if the moisture content is too high, whereas if the humidity is too low, it leads to excessive drying. The Punjab-based company is currently testing a low-cost cold storage solution that is in line for a patent. “We can give it to farmers as a corporate social responsibility or as a rental to prevent wastage from the start,” says Taranjeet. Meanwhile, Pune-based Ecozen has been mobilising to leverage green energy for cold storage for the agrarian community, especially during restricted transportation during lockdowns across India. “Lockdowns pushed us to work at a larger scale,” shares Vivek Pandey, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder, adding, “and leasing cold storage became a demand all of a sudden. We ramped up production to adapt.” Despite being so agriculturally diverse, Indian farming is hampered by an antiquated and inefficient supply infrastructure that leads to the wastage of at least 25-30% of fresh produce. “It happens at three points: the farm, inefficient supply-chain management where produce can get damaged during handling or transport, and at the retail level,” says Shobit Gupta, co-founder, and CEO of Superplum, the Silicon Valley-backed startup based out of Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Currently working with 230 farms in over 15 states, Superplum has more than 320 stores in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. “Cold transport plays a big role in our operations. We don’t store much, except in the farms, but our whole transport system is refrigerated, right up to the distribution level. That’s how we ensure freshness and quality,” says Shobhit. Its low-cost Fresherator cold chain transport solution controls high-temperature, humidity and ethylene levels of fresh produce, by automatically adjusting to ideal settings depending on the fruits being carried from point A to point B. “While cherries and strawberries are traditionally the most perishable, mangoes are most difficult to transport because they keep ripening, and we have to manage the process until delivery,” he says.  For companies like Superplum, data science is invaluable; quality supervision, prediction models and using more advanced technology such as IoT is mandatory. Superplum’s cloud-based management system enables shoppers to cross-check lab test reports, the temperature the fruit was transported at as well as farm-level quality parameters. Similarly, analytics tech has been integral to Ecozen. “In Shimla, it is cherry season and they are typically sold off to a middleman,” says Vivek. “But with our cold storage transportation and shelf-life prediction tech, farmers can aggregate good quantities and send directly to a market, making the most out of the produce’s lifetime.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/warriors-against-wastage/article34672222.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Vials of hope||Over the course of the pandemic, many family historians have unearthed old albums filled with sepia-tinted photographs that unveil an assortment of personalities and experiences. These photographs cut a swathe through time; like the one of my great-grandfather, a veterinarian in a tie and sola topee examining a cow sometime in the 1930s, in a livestock hospital in a hill station. My search took me to the Pasteur Institute of India (PII), Coonoor, one spring morning in April before lockdown closed the narrow window of travel in Tamil Nadu. An autonomous institute under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, PII stands near Sims Park, reminiscent of the British Raj. Outside its main gate is a statue of Louis Pasteur, the French scientist who developed the principles of vaccination and pasteurisation, holding aloft a replica of the jar containing the spinal cord of a rabbit infected with rabies, which he used to develop a vaccine against the disease. At a time in the 19th century when viper’s venom and the liver of a mad dog were considered cures for rabies’ fatal symptoms in Europe, Pasteur’s vaccine earned him a place in history and the gratitude of generations to come, when in 1885 it saved the life of young Joseph Meister who had been bitten by a rabid dog. In 1902, Lily Pakenham Walsh, an Englishwoman in India infected with rabies died because she could not get the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) in time. It set in motion a series of fundraisers and events that led to the establishment of the institute in 1907. Set up with Rs. 1 lakh donated to Viceroy Lord Curzon by American philanthropist Henry Phipps, the vaccine manufacturing unit was opened in Coonoor on April 25 as the Pasteur Institute of Southern India. In 1977, it became the autonomous Pasteur Institute of India. The world of labs With a staff strength of 303 and a sprawling campus of 16 acres scattered across the hill with enviable views of tea gardens, PII is presently helmed by veterinarian Dr. S. Sivakumar. “Initially PII manufactured ARV from inactivated sheep neural tissue. In 2001, it was replaced with in-house developed inactivated, highly purified vero cell-derived ARV. From 1982, the DPT [protects against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus] DT and TT vaccines were manufactured,” says Dr. Sivakumar, the director, as we walk down a winding road to where the state-of-the-art labs, which are under qualification, are located. PII has mice and guinea pigs to test vaccine safety and potency. “There are seven new and two modified GMP facilities equipped with automated and semi-automated equipment established with a budget of Rs. 137.02 crore funded by the Union government and taken over by PII in 2019,” he adds. “PII can produce 80 to 100 million DPT group of vaccine doses per annum once the facility, equipment and process is validated. The government has recently approved 30 acres in Coimbatore for PII to set up new BSL-2 and BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level) facilities for the manufacture of viral, bacterial, conjugate and r-DNA vaccines to strengthen the nation’s health and vaccine security,” he says. As we climb back up, the main building with its green-gabled roof and gold topped Baroque domes stands framed by PII’s beautiful garden flush with lilies, bougainvillea, roses and a jacaranda tree. It lends the modern facility an old-fashioned charm. The pioneering research inside its walls inspired many like my great-grandfather to pursue genetics and work on newer trends in veterinary science. “The building, designed by government architect GTS Harris, now has the director’s chamber, the library where rare books are housed in glass cabinets, purchase and quality assurance departments and a host of administrative offices. Earlier, it also had the production facility of neural tissue ARV and the quality control division,” says Dr. Sivakumar. The building bears the plaque 1906 on its portico and is well preserved with an impressive teak staircase and taciturn portraits of every man and woman who has contributed to PII. In the foyer, also hangs a framed banner of the institute with words from Alfred Tennyson’s poem, Ulysses, emblazoned on it — To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield — that have inspired its work for over a century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vials-of-hope/article34672223.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Now, login for dabbawalas||Mumbai’s well-loved dabbawalas are back in action. Only this time, instead of delivering home cooked lunches to office goers, their bicycles are loaded with cheeseburgers, tiramisu and frappes. The many lockdowns since March 2020, to combat COVID-19, combined with most people working from home, had left them out of work. A unique lunch box delivery system, the network transports freshly cooked meals from homes to offices in Mumbai, via bicycles and trains. What makes the dabbawalas special is the fact that the empty boxes are returned in the afternoon, and despite serving 2,00,000 people with a network of about 5,000, mistakes are rare. Recently, Mumbai-based Impresario Handmade Restaurants launched a collaboration with Mumbai’s dabbawalas, recruiting them as delivery partners to facilitate direct ordering from restaurants. The company has 57 restaurants across 16 cities across the country, including SOCIAL, Smoke House Deli and Salt Water cafe in (a total of 20) Mumbai. In the first week of its pilot project, about 30 dabbawala s were engaged to make between 600 and 1,000 deliveries every day from the group’s restaurants in the Lower Parel, Bandra (West), and BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex) areas.On the phone from Mumbai, Riyaaz Amlani, CEO & MD Impresario Handmade Restaurants, says, “Dabbawalas are the original backbone of Mumbai’s food delivery system. The food industry has now come together with the dabbawalas to form a symbiotic partnership to empower and enable each other over the next few months. The association will roll out more phases over the next few months, each employing more dabbawalas.” Ulhas Muke, president, Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, a part of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association, says, “When the first lockdown was introduced, it was the toughest time we’ve ever faced; our members were left with little to no money in their bank accounts. Although there are many restaurants and hotel chains in our city, in the past we’ve only catered to office-goers at their workplace. Now that work from home has become the norm, it’s important to go where the customer is.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-login-for-dabbawalas/article34672220.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Board games||What’s this year taught me? Another question. Like I don’t have enough in my term paper already. So... hmmm… lemme think — don’t watch me while I’m thinking — go away! Games. Totally what I’ve learnt. Duh, not video games — you sound like my mum. Enter Mum. Extends neck like giraffe to peer into my screen. ‘Playing?Again?’ No, of course not! I show her a word document on my screen. The cursor has stayed on the same line for the last three days, ha! She doesn’t realise that a click of her heel outside my door leads to a click of the mouse and a click of a game window disappearing. Mums are cute, no? ‘Do you know how bad it is for your (insert any body part: eyes/ back/ intestines/ nostrils/ brain) — you are ruining your health.’ Whatevva… my nostrils… my problem. Go away! Anyway, much as I love gaming my mum, that’s not what I meant. So I’ve learnt ball games in lockdown — by being the ball. My life is so kicked around. First, zigzag like soccer — perhaps online class for a month, or not, or three or forever. For a bit, I was a cricket ball on a sixer — a flash of hope, of sailing through the blue sky. Then a few months of Me, the Basketball. Bouncing between Yays and NoWays. We get to go to school? Yay! And now that we’re suitably exhilarated (see how I’ve been studying my vocab, Mum?) — tada! Wave 2 — sorry, loser, go get locked up again. Right now, it’s underwater diving. Who waits longest, breath held, without going Boom! Will months of studying end anywhere? In Board exams? Will the state or the states decide? (Civics teacher, proud of me?) Not until we’ve been jabbed. Just not safe! The wave 2 is hitting kids. And they say wave 3 (get out the surfboards!) is on its way. Hold the exams? Or hold back? Online, maybe? Shorten them? Cancel them? Or postpone deciding about them (agaiiiin?) And they say teens can’t make up their minds. Look at this video, guys! Wise old adults (who did their own studying in peace a few light years ago) are discussing what’s best for us. Who is missing? Us! No one asks us. And all the while, we’re wobbling on that diving board on a plane flying higher, wondering when to jump, knowing the chute may not open. There’s the click. Mum on the prowl. She goes, ‘They’re saying on the parent WhatsApp group that…’ Then she says, on cue, ‘What — you’re playing again?’ And I say — for once — truthfully — ‘Yeah, Mum. Wanna join?’ And she squeezes in near me, and we play this stupidly awesome game where zombies keep popping out from nowhere and we gotta whack them down. And she gets that it’s the most honest and closest thing to what we’re all going through now. We play. And it’s less basketball now, and more piano. Where Jane De Suza, author of Flyaway Boy, pokes her nose into our perfect lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/board-games/article34671919.ece

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||More than w o r d s||I once stumbled on two wide-eyed children poring over a picture book in their classroom. While they were discovering the details of the story together, one was narrating it to the other in her own words. I knew they couldn’t read yet, which made it all the more fascinating to watch them understand the story through the illustrations alone. They were straying from the original plot, which is exactly why I remember it 11 years later: the vivid memory of them making the story their own, unfettered. As someone who has worked with children’s books for over a decade, I’ve met many parents and teachers who seem mildly baffled with wordless books. “No words?” they ask. With a steady and growing emphasis on teaching reading, we tend to neglect the vast potential of illustrations in developing a child’s understanding of the world. Wordless books offer infinite possibilities for children to interpret stories and decode images. In recent years though, the popularity of Ammachi’s Glasses , a wordless book by Priya Kuriyan, has been encouraging. The book captures the hilarious events that occur when an old woman is unable to find her glasses one morning, and any text would have been a distraction to its many clever details. “The feeling that a picture evokes is immediate, that gut impact, the pleasure. Sometimes, words can’t create that impact,” says Kuriyan. Beyond language This makes me think of David Wiesner’s almost-wordless book, Tuesday , in which frogs fly through the sky and float through houses in the dead of the night. Strange and mysterious, it’s easy to imagine how a fantastical book like this can shape a child’s view of the night. Earlier this year, Canato Jimo won an award for his book, Snip, at the Publishing Next Industry Awards under the best children’s book category (ages 0-8). Set in Nagaland, it follows two mischievous siblings as they play with a pair of scissors. Snip is special not only because of how relatable it is, but also because of how accessible it is without the constraints of a language.  Stormy by Guojing and Time Flies by Eric Rohmann also work as a reminder of how vital it is to give illustrators more opportunities and freedom to tell their own stories. Kuriyan, who has won multiple awards for her art, has collaborated with numerous authors over the years. So what was it like to create a narrative entirely on her own, and be both the author and illustrator? “It feels more personal because you can choose the context and take inspiration from characters that you’re familiar with in real life,” she says, adding, “You can revisit things you like, things you find funny, and even genres. You can put inside jokes. It’s your voice, it’s who you are.” Freedom for illustrators  As one of theeditors who worked on Snip and a guest editor for Ikru’s First Day of School , I know that telling a compelling story using illustrations alone is no easy feat. It requires illustrators to have a very nuanced understanding of sequential visual narratives. “In a wordless book, building the relationship between each frame has to be cohesive. And it’s important to have a sense of movement to engage the reader,” says Jimo, an art director at Pratham Books. This dynamism that Jimo suggests runs through 1986 A Visit to the City Market by Manjula Padmanabhan. You are briefly transported to the bustling streets of the market, past the mangoes and watermelons, chickens, and buckets of flowers. Priya Krishnan, a senior editor at Tulika Books, says, “Wordless picture books can cross borders more easily, leaving behind the politics of language. They then become windows to different cultures.” But somehow, there seems to be this notion that wordless books are meant only for children who aren’t able to read fluently. You only have to look at Shaun Tan’s The Arrival (an immigrant’s experience) and Peter Van Den Ende’s The Wanderer (a paper boat’s adventure) to know this is untrue. Wordless books — or perhaps we need to start referring to them as word-free books — are for anyone who enjoys visual storytelling. In a world that is fixated on a child’s ability to decipher the written word, I hope that wordfree books find more of an audience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/more-than-w-o-r-d-s/article34671893.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Is the jab the new black?||My mother-in-law is 80 and refuses to be vaccinated. Her argument? She is old and ready to “go”, so why waste a vaccine? When I mention this to people, responses range from ‘Oh you must try to persuade her’ to ‘Well, what can you do if she’s made up her mind.’ So far, nobody has suggested forcibly dragging her out for jabs. A friend, in his 50s, also refuses the vaccine, saying he would rather wait for the very best vaccine to come along, with no side-effects whatsoever. Listening to him, some of us argue, some shrug. Notice, however, how responses change when people discuss a cook, watchman or driver refusing the vaccine. ‘Cut her pay.’ ‘Threaten to sack him.’ ‘Refuse to let them in until they get jabbed.’ In fact, if it weren’t for the minor hitch of the country running massively short of vaccines, I am certain the impossibly self-righteous members of those residential welfare associations would have already issued directives banning entry to the unvaccinated. The zeal to spread good health notwithstanding, there is an obvious classist and exclusionary underpinning to these conversations that’s hard to miss. After the first wave, the comfortable middle-classes had convinced themselves that Covid-19 was mainly confined to the unhygienic, undisciplined lower classes, and had bypassed them entirely because of their a) clean habits b) superiordesiimmunity c) the herbal concoctions they were gargling with and glugging down incessantly. But then the second wave came, ravaging the country, showing no respect for wealth, social status or potion quotient. So now it appears that they are busy anointing the very act of being vaccinated as the new Calvin Klein. It’s not so far-fetched when you remember that billionaire Bill Gates has used his global ‘health czar’ clout to insist that intellectual property rights be retained on coronavirus vaccines, which essentially means that instead of using life-saving drugs to save all of humanity, pharma companies want to hold on to patents for profits. This has partially led to the situation today where almost half the number of total vaccine shots have been used in the world’s 15 or 16 richest countries, leaving many others including India scrambling. Even as this blatant vaccine apartheid is sought to be put to rights, the Indian government — which presides over a country where the number of people in poverty was estimated to be about 360 million in 2019 — chooses inexplicably to not roll out a universal and free vaccination drive, but opts for open market competition, leading to unseemly and public jostling between central and state governments, among state governments, and between private and public sector hospitals. This comes over and above a botched vaccination project that has created an acute shortage — in May, there were 20 million shots available for 600 million Indians aged 18 to 44. So when Khushbu Sundar and Karthi Chidambaram, public figures from two ends of the political spectrum, advocate the linking of vaccination records to distribution of rations and direct cash transfers, it triggers alarm bells. Such recommendations can only come from positions of extreme privilege, where access to neither vaccines nor five-star Covid care is ever in any doubt. For the large number of Indians who live on the margins of survival, the least governments can do is not to jeopardise their meagre handouts in the guise of “health concerns”. Sundar and Chidambaram’s suggestion is meant to counter vaccine hesitancy, but threatening citizens is no way to go about this. If there are fears about vaccines, the government’s own lack of transparency, its unconscionable public support of pseudo-science, its encouragement of a busy WhatsApp universe of quack forwards must take a lot of the blame. The way to counter vaccine hesitancy is by a massive awareness drive, not by intimidation, of the kind infamously endorsed by our elites during the mass sterilisation of the poor carried out during the Emergency. Besides, it’s obvious that the poor are not the only ones refusing vaccines. Yet, as pointed out, nobody threatens upper-class doubters with drastic punitive measures. Clearly, any talk of withholding rations, bus passes or jobs is meant to create the sort of ecology where vaccination certificates become the next ticket for social credit. I cannot imagine anything worse. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/is-the-jab-the-new-black/article34671895.ece
29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Last of the shaukeen Kayasth men||The day before he came down with a fever, my dad (72) sent me a bowl of satpaita , a typical winter preparation of split urad dal and methi greens, part of our family’s rich repertoire of Avadhi cuisine. “Who eats satpaita in summer? It is too heavy,” I retorted on the phone, when he called to ask if I wanted some. “We,” my dad said, using his royal Lucknowi ‘we’, “felt like eating it,” and promptly sent it across. I ate much of it with enthusiasm that afternoon, warm weather notwithstanding, and then stowed away some in the fridge. The next day, dad tested positive for Covid-19, as did my mother and brother, and the world changed irrevocably. For a few days after, however, I still believed all was well. That dad was only mildly ill. In fact, it was a delusion the entire family remained under till that last evening when he boarded the ambulance and went into the ICU unescorted — never to come back. The bowl of satpaita sits in my refrigerator; now a memory to be preserved.  Passion forward  As a finely-worded obit emailed to me described him, my dad was a bon vivant , the last of a line of shaukeen Kayasth men, belonging to the liberal community of medieval scribes, known to patronise the arts and culture, and who liked to live life king size. Generous to a fault, fond of cooking and music, dad was happiest when sharing these passions. Before the pandemic made physical gatherings impossible, he and some relatives and friends had been regular with their musical baithaks held once a month, soirées organised in each other’s homes in which all participants would sing carefully-rehearsed songs, accompanists having been hired for the occasion. The baithaks would end inevitably in a lavish repast prepared by the host, and when my dad’s turn came, there would be demands for his bhuna meat or badam parsinde , recipes going back centuries that he had perfected. Music and food have been twin legacies of a larger composite Kayasth culture and way of life that I have repeatedly written about. That world is now lost. The legacy lived in dad. My interest was always that of an outsider, of someone examining a slice of life.  Parsindefor the win  Through all of last year, as the pandemic took over and he stopped going to office, instead letting my brother lead his engineering consulting business, he cooked more and more. Treats of dum ka kathal , made with tender jackfruit, bhuna meat, takey paise (besan‘coins’), and bathua would arrive at our house regularly, along with gifts of the finest mangoes, chocolates, even gin and wine. I often posted it on Instagram, and they received enthusiastic responses. Truth be told, I cannot cook even a fraction as well as him. No one could. At least his style of UP-ish food. Or his Rajasthani lal maas . You had to eat what he cooked to believe in “ haath ki baat ” — shorthand for expertise at spicing and bhunoing (browning to concentrate flavours). The fact that he cooked to approximate the memory of an older tradition, and to match his keen palate, made his food impossible to replicate. That’s why some dishes I will never eat again. Like badam parsinde . A Delhi Mathur dish, parsinde (from pasand , or choice, connoting the choicest cut of goat meat) doesn’t get made often, even in homes. You need to know the best cut, how to score and flatten it, and cook it well. Dad had picked up the recipe from Gopal Pande, a wedding cook, who catered at all my grandparents’ functions. Then he tweaked the recipe — which is the version in my book, Mrs LC’s Table . Despite the recipe, neither I nor any of an impressive list of chefs with whom I collaborated for various pop-ups have been able to cook it satisfactorily. Like all passionate cooks, dad loved to cook for others. He cooked the toughest and intricate dishes at the many food festivals I put together across hotels in India from 2010 to 2012. They were rigorous affairs, where dad, my aunt Minoo and I cooked for 10 days each in hot kitchens. I got bored and impatient. Dad never did. Finally, I had to stop because the format was too physically demanding. Those who ate his food remembered it for years after, including chef Manjit Gill, who came for our first festival. He sent me a condolence message: “Your father left an indelible impact”. Dad would have been happy to hear it from the country’s senior-most chef. But he would have grandly announced, “I only cook for my children”. And so it was. Food, that was an extension of his love for us and for life in general.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Venice Architecture Biennale 2021: Lost in tokenism||Bold questions about architecture find a natural home in Venice: the city has long both defied and embodied the dogmas of urban planning, with its ancient stones seemingly floating on the lagoon waters and its pedestrian-only narrow streets intersecting with a capillary network of canals. But there’s bold, and then there’s inconsequential. Much of the twice delayed 17th Architecture Biennale, which has just opened in the northern Italian port city, often crosses over into the latter. Participants from 46 countries tackled the arduous, vast question asked by Hashim Sarkis, the Lebanon-born dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who curated this edition: “How will we live together?” “We are asking architects… because we’re not happy with the answers that are coming out of politics today,” Sarkis said. “We need a new spatial contract because we can’t have a social contract. Irrespective of the huge problems that we’re facing, we can’t bring society together.” But the terms of the question are so general that they transcend the boundaries of the discipline. Even the specification the curator added — living together among diverse beings, as new households, as emerging communities, across borders, as one planet — expand the remit of the Biennale to pretty much all aspects of reality. This flaw has an upside, however, because it acts as a sophisticated poll to gauge contemporary worries. The visitor is left with an impression of pending doom, with many of the pieces and installations tackling the unprecedented challenges facing Man on the planet. Climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and overpopulation form a red thread that innerves the exhibition that is taking place at the Giardini park, the Arsenale grounds, and Forte Marghera. In the Giardini’s Central Pavilion, a metal box the size of a truck produces thundering outbursts of noise at random intervals, giving frazzled visitors a reliable proxy for what it sounds like when the ice pack cracks in Antarctica. Nearby, drips fall from a mock-up of the Alps hanging upside down from the ceiling, a not-too-subtle reminder of the breakneck speed at which glaciers are melting. Missing the point A tradeoff between width and depth is inevitable, and the world’s largest architecture exhibition prides itself on leaving the reins loose on the architects’ necks, freeing them — albeit momentarily — from the omnipresent constraints they face with budgets, space, taste. But the purpose of architecture must remain to organise space inhabited by humans, and tasking it with universal concerns results in tokenism. In the Corderie, the 300-metre-long factory where workers braided ropes for Venice’s vessels, visitors look puzzled as they stride by ‘Maternity Mensware’, a garment that explores non-female and transgender pregnancy, and ‘Catalog for the Post-Human’ an ironic series of objects designed to enhance productivity for the gig workers of the future. The issues raised here are certainly relevant, but the context makes them pointless. One wouldn’t certainly expect the Biennale to stick to too narrow a focus: a building material trade fair it is not. At the same time, however, presenting the flaws of contemporary urbanisation as “the product of the dominant capitalistic dogma that promotes endless growth and wealth concentration” risks eluding one of architecture’s main missions: finding practical solutions to practical problems. Meanwhile, at the pavilions National pavilions show that architects can make bold political statements while sticking to their very own domain. A large room filled with round tables laid out for lunch reminds visitors that in Singapore — one of the world’s richest countries — more than 80% of the population lives in government-owned buildings where sharing space is the norm. The Japanese pavilion celebrates reuse and renovation, offering the story of a postwar house that was dismantled and transported to Italy. As it celebrates the beauty of humble materials — scaffolding pipes, mesh, blue tarpaulin, a bath tub — the exhibition ultimately questions with pertinent grace the sustainability of architecture. India doesn’t have a pavilion, but there’s a small room in the Arsenale, which approaches the issues connected to the country’s tumultuous urbanisation. The video pits renderings of shiny skyscrapers and immaculate footpaths of the smart cities the government plans to build against the reality of the fast, disorderly, organic growth of small cities such as Sriperumbudur, in Tamil Nadu, or Chakan, in Maharashtra. Showing footage of poor migrant workers making their way back home during the first pandemic lockdown last year, it implores urban planners to take into account their needs, instead of pursuing the chimera of monumental world-class cities. India’s cursory, minimal contribution has the merit of showing — by its sheer existence — that architects and planners have still a lot of work to do.

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||K-pop on the wall||Whenever he walks into a room, Narresh Kukreja notices the walls first. “Consciously or unconsciously, your eyes always [go to] the largest surface area, more than the furniture or rugs,” says Kukreja, one half of Delhi-based designer duo Shivan & Narresh. It is no surprise then that following a line of table linens last year, the two now have a series of 10 art wallpaper prints. Drawn from five of their collections, namely Seoul, Araki, Edomer, Patu and Wilding 20s, it echoes what Kukreja had shared with The Hindu Weekend in January, that “2021 is going to be a tale of individuals wanting to tell a personal story through their homes — stories of their work, their travels”. Seoul vibes to Japanese art The wallpapers feature an eclectic mix of designs, from Renaissance art (Ballerina Carlotta Chabert as Venus on the Dame wallpaper) and Seychellois elements in a distinct Edo Art aesthetic on the Praslin wallpaper, to a seven-coloured print inspired by Korean pop culture on the Mujigay wallpaper. “We’re fortunate to have a collection of signature prints. So, it essentially came down to choosing which prints would work and deciding the right scale for it to be used as interior design,” Kukreja says, confirming that the material used is non-woven, high-quality paper. Mujigay (meaning rainbow) came from their 2020 Seoul Series, which was inspired by a 2019  visit to South Korea. “It is called so because of the strong K-pop vibe the city has,” he continues, recommending the energetic print for a child’s bedroom, a gym, or a lounge where people mingle. “Other prints like the Hututi is inspired by the traditional folk arts of Korea. You’ll see hand-painted birds and temples in the backdrop. There is a sense of traditionality to the wallpaper; it would be nice in a formal space. At the same time, they almost look like vintage stamps.” The Palmera features palm leaves and black panthers, a very Indian aesthetic, but here “inspired by a famous Japanese photo artist called Araki”. Break the white rule Kukreja adds, “As a rule of thumb, if you have a small space, there’s no point in painting it white and trying to make it larger. Instead, take the space and make it impactful.” Reiterating that the collection will provide a window to the world, Kukreja shares, “Even if people are stuck at home and not travelling, it will always be the first thing on their minds. That’s how important travel is going to be this year and probably the next as well. So to look at the wall, and get lost and discover new elements, is a very good way of escaping”.  Starts at Rs. 15,950 per roll, shivanandnarresh.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/k-pop-on-the-wall/article34671925.ece

On May 28, Marriott International introduced the concept of ‘Mood Diet’, a curated menu of mood-enhancing dishes that will be available via Marriott on Wheels, the hotel group’s direct food delivery service. Eat and stay calm Chef Himanshu Taneja, Culinary Director – South Asia at Marriott International says that the menu focusses on ingredients that have a longer-term effect on our mood — fermented foods that help with our digestion (more than 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut). Other foods included in the menu are fatty fish like salmon that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids (which have been shown to reduce anxiety) and nuts and seeds (which contain tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin). While Taneja has not collaborated with a nutritionist to devise this menu, he says he dipped into his vast experience as a chef and his food science studies at Harvard University.  On the plate Dishes are categorised by mood, with crowd favourites like mezze boxes, guac and chips grazing board,nasi goreng, a DIY-style poke bowl, etc. It’s a short menu with under a dozen dishes, each listing ‘mood element’ ingredients, along with a little write-up on why it’s good for you. There’s some focus on well-being, with healthy grains like quinoa making an appearance. Overall, the menu is not wildly inventive but promises comfort in these times.    The Mood Diet will initially roll out across 13 properties in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/food-for-your-mood/article34671917.ece

29 May 2021||May 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A gooseberry summer||Prerna Sood has begun her day with a shot of amla for as long as she can remember. Her grandmother had ensured everyone at home joined in — a tradition Sood continues to this day with her own family. The Noida-based architect, food lover, and fermenting addict sources her amlas from a local farmers’ market. Since the lockdown began last March, with doctors highlighting the importance of good immunity, many have rediscovered this commonplace powerhouse of vitamin C. Our days now begin not with tea or coffee, but with a shot of this bitter-sour juice, with its final rush of sweetness, packed with nutrients and immunity boosters. But even before the coronavirus came calling, amla has been a vital ingredient in most Indian homes. It would be boiled with salt water,hingand turmeric, to make an oil-free pickle; ground and stirred into a thokku ; grated and added to curd for a raita ; or cooked with dal for a deeply-flavourful side dish. Amla has also been a part of native medicine, and its dried and candied versions have come in handy as digestives. For many of us, no wait at the school bus stop was ever complete without buying large amlas with crinkly skin, soaked in glass jars filled with salted yellow-red water redolent ofhing. Long after the soft fruit was eaten, we would delight in the saltiness of the seed. Now the world is discovering the Indian gooseberry — different from its cousins in the Americas and the Continent that are smaller, grow on spiky bushes, and are perhaps a tad less sour. According to recent news reports, KoreaShop 24, which facilitates trade between India and the South Korean market, closed a deal for Nature Factory, a company based in Seoul, to export amla extract worth Rs. 85 lakh. With the growing demand for immunity-boosting Indian gooseberries in Korea, the order is expected to go up, based on the reception. Meanwhile, back home, as demand continues to grow, we take a nostalgia break with farmers, bloggers, writers and homemakers about their memories of the gooseberry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/a-gooseberry-summer/article34671958.ece

29 May 2021||New Delhi,||1,141 fresh COVID-19 cases in Delhi; positivity rate continues to plunge||Delhi reported 1,141 new COVID-19 cases, out of 71,853 tests, in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,23,690, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Friday. At the same time, 139 deaths were reported, which takes the count to 23,951. Of the total cases, 13,85,158 people have recovered and there are 14,581 active cases. As many as 2,799 people recovered in the past 24 hours. The test positivity rate fell to 1.59%, which means only one to two people out of 100 people taking tests are positive. The TPR had peaked at 36% on April 22 but has been coming down since then. Out of the total 25,032 hospital beds for COVID-19, 75.88% of beds were vacant. At the peak of the second wave in April, only 5-6% of beds were vacant on many days. Oxygen bulletin There was no vaccine stock for the 18-44 age group for the fifth consecutive day, according to a bulletin by the government. Also, there is no stock of Covaxin left for vaccinating people of 45 years of age and above, healthcare, and front-line workers, the bulletin said. The Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was a “scam” in COVID-19 vaccines and the Central government was favouring only Bharat Biotech and SII and was supplying vaccines only to private players who are immunising people at “expensive rates”. “How are vaccines available in private hospitals, which are vaccinating youth at expensive rates, but not available for State governments? Centre is answerable for this vaccine scam. Private hospitals giving vaccines at Rs. 1,000-Rs. 1,350 are getting huge stock, but not the State governments,” AAP leader Atishi alleged. The AAP leader said an artificial scarcity of vaccines has been created by the Central government as they did not approve other vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, which have been approved by WHO and other countries. “Lakhs of lives have been lost in the face of the second wave of COVID-19, religious and social organisations are coming forward to aid people, but the Centre continues to play dirty politics at the cost of people’s lives. The lives of so many young people would have been saved if the Centre had not done such a downright vaccine scam,” Atishi said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/1141-fresh-covid-19-cases-emerge-positivity-rate-continues-to-plunge/article34672243.ece

Mr. Gehlot pointed out that as many as 1.63 crore people had been vaccinated in Rajasthan as of May 26. “Of them, 3.38 lakh doses have got wasted, which is just 2% of the total number of vaccines. This is much lower than the national average of 6% wastage, while the Centre has set the limit at 10%,” he tweeted. Mr. Gehlot accused the BJP of indulging in “politics of lies and deceit” during the pandemic and said the party was making “deliberate attempts” to mislead the public at large. He asked BJP leaders in the State to instead put pressure on the Centre to supply more doses to make the vaccination drive successful. Referring to the issue of vaccine wastage raised in other States, Mr. Gehlot said it was alleged earlier that 30.2% vaccines in Chhattisgarh and 37.3% in Jharkhand had been wasted, while the Chief Ministers of the two States had reported wastage of only 0.95% and 4.65%, respectively.  ‘Ensure supply’ Mr. Gehlot once again urged the Union government to ensure the supply of vaccines in sufficient quantity for the people of 18 to 44 years of age to avoid repeated closure of vaccination centres in different States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gehlot-rubbishes-bjp-charge-on-vaccine-wastage/article34672527.ece
29 May 2021||Chandigarh,||BKU(U) begins protest in Patiala||The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer outfits in Punjab, on Friday started a three-day-long sit-in protest in Patiala against the Congress government over its alleged failure to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had asked the outfit not to go ahead with the protest, apprehending the event would turn into super-spreader of COVID-19. Farmers associated with the BKU(U) demanded the State government take effective steps to control COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, farmers also urged the Congress government to rally round to strengthen the farmers’ struggle against the three new farm laws and other demands made to the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre. Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of BKU(U), said the protest was being held with all COVID-19 precautions in place. Mr. Singh said the State government had failed to control the situation arising out of COVID-19 pandemic. “There is a shortage of doctors and health workers in the hospitals and people are not getting proper treatment. In the absence of staff, ventilators and other equipment in government hospitals are not being put to optimum use. Medicines and oxygen are being black-marketed in the State,” he said. Mr. Singh demanded that new recruitment should be done immediately in the Health Department and vaccines should be made available to all free of charge. Free COVID-19 tests should be arranged in every city, town and village. “All large private hospitals should be brought under government control. The rates of treatment of corona patients in small private hospitals should be capped. We want the State government to resolve all the issues,” he added.  ‘Lift restrictions’ Mr. Singh said that amid the lockdown restrictions almost all sections of the society were suffering, and therefore the restrictions should be immediately lifted. “The State government should ensure adequate financial support for the livelihood of the people as they have been adversely impacted by the curbs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bkuu-begins-protest-in-patiala/article34672531.ece

29 May 2021||New Delhi,||Apollo begins antibody cocktail for mild cases||The Apollo Hospital on Friday said they have started an “antibody cocktail treatment” for COVID-19 patients, who have mild symptoms and comorbidities. These are people who have the risk of developing a severe illness, the hospital said. A 65-year-old man from Delhi, who has multiple comorbidities, was the first COVID-19 patient to receive “monoclonal antibody therapy”. “Apollo Hospitals begins offering the antibody cocktail [Casirivimab and Imdevimab] to patients with mild and moderate COVID and at high risk of developing severe COVID,” the hospital said in a statement. Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director of Apollo Hospitals Group, said: “We are glad to launch a pan India programme for advanced treatment, comprising neutralising monoclonal antibodies for our patients with COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies bind to and ‘neutralise’ the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are confident this treatment option will significantly boost our efforts to bring the pandemic under control and help prevent progression of the disease in those with mild to moderate COVID-19”. Rajesh Chawla, Senior Pulmonologist at the hospital, said the reason this therapy is termed as an antibody cocktail is because it comprises a mixture of more than two biological drugs (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) that mirror the human antibodies in the immune system. ”This consequently help fight the infection, similar to the natural antibodies produced when one gets infected with COVID. Both strengthen the immune defence system. This drug is said to restrict pathogens and virus from entering the patient’s body, from where they otherwise would have derived nutrition and multiplied,” Dr. Chawla said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/apollo-begins-antibody-cocktail-for-mild-cases/article34672241.ece
29 May 2021||Guwahati,||‘Ensure humanitarian aid for Myanmar refugees’||A civil society group in Manipur has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide specialised humanitarian agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, unhindered access to Myanmar nationals who fled military repression in their country and crossed over to India. In a memorandum to the Prime Minister on Thursday, the Citizens Committee Manipur (CCM) also resented the indifference of the Manipur government to the plight of the Myanmar nationals who took refuge in the State, unlike its Mizoram counterpart that took a “natural and culture-bound decision” to help the refugees. More than 16,000 people living in areas close to the 1,468 km India-Myanmar border are estimated to have crossed over into Mizoram and Manipur since the military takeover of the country in February. Clashes between the Myanmar army and pro-democracy protesters and militias have claimed scores of lives.  ‘Historic, cultural ties’ CCM chairman and former Manipur Chief Minister Radhabinod Koijam said the people on either side of the international border have a long historical, demographic and cultural links. “Keeping these in mind, we formed a humanitarian sub-committee under the chairmanship of former Manipur University Vice-Chancellor Amar Yumnam toward mobilising financial and material support for the refugees,” he said. NGOs and local activists have been providing food, medicine, clothes and other essential items to more than 500 refugees in border villages, the CCM said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ensure-humanitarian-aid-for-myanmar-refugees/article34672528.ece
29 May 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab govt. reduces domestic power tariff||Ahead of the Assembly election due early next year, the Punjab government has announced a cut of 50 paise to Rs. 1 per unit for domestic power consumers. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said the cut would provide relief to domestic consumers, especially the poor, already reeling under financial problems due to the pandemic.  Regulator’s move hailed While pointing out that the decision of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) to reduce the domestic tariff would bring relief to the tune of Rs. 682 crore for 69 lakh domestic consumers, the Chief Minister appreciated the decision of the regulator not to increase tariff for commercial consumers as well as small and medium industry amid COVID-19. The hike in tariff for industrial users was quite marginal, he said, adding that this would also come as a relief to industry, which had also been severely impacted by the lockdown and demand crisis. He said the reduction in domestic tariff for load up to 2 KW (Rs. 1.00 per unit and 50 paise per unit for consumption slabs of 0 to 100 units and 101 to 300 units respectively) and 2 KW - 7 KW (75 paise per unit and 50 paise per unit for consumption slabs of 0 to 100 units and 101 to 300 units respectively) works out to 22.30% cut in tariff for the first slab up to 2 KW load. This would benefit the poor and vulnerable sections the most, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-govt-reduces-domestic-power-tariff/article34672530.ece
29 May 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Cyclone Yaas-induced rain floods areas in Odisha||Thousands of people were marooned in four Odisha districts following the rise in the water level in two rivers which were in spate due to Cyclone Yaas-induced heavy rain. While the Subarnarekha river caused limited scale flood in Balasore district, the overflowing waters of the Baitarani river contributed to the floods in Bhadrak, Keonjhar and Jajpur districts. About 20 panchayats under Baliapala, Jaleswar and Bhogarai blocks of Balasore could face flood due to the rising water level in the Subarnarekha. The district administration has urged people living in low lying areas to move to safer places. “Jharkhand has released water from the Galidih barrage due to which the flow has increased in the Subarnarekha river,” said P.K. Jena, Special Relief Commissioner. Many villages in Korei, Dasrathpur, Jajpur and Binjharpur blocks in Jajpur district were affected by flood in the Baitarani. People were taking shelter on the river embankment. A breach has occurred on the embankment of Kani river, a distributory of the Baitaraini, at Malikapur that led to submergence of a vast area. The Baitarani also caused flood in several villages in Bhadrak district. Two units of the ODRF were deployed for rescue operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cyclone-yaas-induced-rain-floods-areas-in-odisha/article34672236.ece
