09 November 2020||Washington,||Joe Biden pledges to unite America||Pledging to be the President of all Americans, President- Elect Joe Biden has sought an immediate end to the “grim era of demonisation” in the deeply-polarised nation, as he and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris celebrated their historic triumph over Republican President Donald Trump in a bitter and closely-fought election. “I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify; who doesn’t see red States and blue States, only sees the United States,” Mr. Biden, 77, said in his victory speech before a drive-in audience in his hometown, Wilmington, in Delaware on Saturday night, nearly ending the uncertainty over the outcome of Tuesday’s election. Wide support Mr. Biden, who has succeeded in his third bid to the White House, thanked his supporters, saying he had earned votes from the “broadest and most diverse coalition in American history”. “I am humbled by the trust and confidence you’ve placed in me,” said Mr. Biden, who will be the oldest U.S. president when he is sworn-in on January 20, 2021, amid applause and cheers from the audience. “The people of this nation have spoken, they’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for ‘We the People’,” he said, referring to the more than 74 million voters who backed him. Mr. Biden criticised Mr. Trump without naming him in his nearly 15 minute address. “Let this grim era of demonisation in America begin to end, here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control,” he said. Mr. Biden also reached out to Trump voters, saying he would act as their President as much as he would for those who voted for him. “I understand your disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple times myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance,” he said, adding that, “This is the time to heal in America.” Mr. Trump has so far refused to concede the election. He has announced the filing of multiple lawsuits against the election results in key battleground States such as Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden was born, and gave him the crucial 20 electoral votes needed to cross the magic figure of 270. He struck a familiar chord in his speech, calling for unity and implicitly rebuking president Trump for his divisive politics. In her address, Ms. Harris, who scripted history as she broke the glass ceiling in the world’s oldest democracy to be elected as America’s first Black and Indian-origin woman Vice-President, said, “You chose hope, and unity, decency, science and yes, truth”. “You chose Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” she said. “Joe’s a healer,” Ms Harris said. “A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us as a nation reclaim our own sense of purpose.” “You ushered in a new day for America,” the 56-year-old Senator from California said before introducing Mr. Biden. “We are not enemies. We are Americans,” Mr. Biden said. The mandate of this election, he said, is that Americans have called on them to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/joe-biden-pledges-to-unite-america/article33054754.ece

09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||No relief for Delhi from ‘severe’ air quality||Air quality in the Capital remained in the ‘severe’ category for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday as farm fires continued to burn in neighbouring States, contributing to 29% of the total air pollution in the National Capital Region. The average 24-hour Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday was 416 in Delhi, 434 in Gurugram, 456 in Ghaziabad, 440 in Greater Noida, 428 in Noida and 426 in Faridabad, according to data by the Central Pollution Control Board. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said the situation was unlikely to improve unless there was a drastic reduction in stubble fire counts. “Surface winds have become calm, which were moderate so far, and are forecast to stay low in magnitude for the next two days. This is the major factor due to which no quick recovery is expected,” said SAFAR. The total stubble fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood at 3,780 on Saturday; it was 4,528 on November 6. SAFAR further stated that boundary layer wind direction is favourable for fire-related intrusion in Delhi-NCR. “Stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air is estimated at 29% for Sunday,” it added. The AQI in Delhi is likely to be in the upper end of ‘very poor’ category on November 13 and 14 (Deepavali), and ‘severe’ on November 15 and 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-relief-for-delhi-from-severe-air-quality/article33055232.ece
09 November 2020||New Delhi,||Open to SC to initiate suo motu contempt case against Jagan: A-G||Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal has said it is “open” to the Supreme Court to initiate suo motu contempt proceedings against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy for his October 6 letter to the Chief Justice of India containing allegations against sitting Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana. “The very crux of the alleged contempt lies in the contents of the letter written by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to the Chief Justice of India, and thus it is open to the Supreme Court to take up the matter of contempt suo motu as provided by the Contempt of Courts Act, and the rules made thereunder,” he wrote to Supreme Court advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay on November 7. Mr. Venugopal was replying to Mr. Upadhyay’s request to re-consider his earlier refusal on November 2 to permit contempt action against Mr. Reddy and his Prinicipal Adviser Ajeya Kallam for the letter and the act of releasing it at a press conference on October 10. Mr. Venugopal stood firm by his decision to refuse consent. He reiterated that the CJI was already “seized of the matter”. The Attorney-General wrote that contempt was a matter between the court and the contemner. No person could, as a right, insist upon the initiation of contempt proceedings. However, Mr. Venugopal said his refusal did not stop Mr. Upadhyay from exercising his “right” to take the matter directly to the judges for suo motu action. “You may exercise this right by way of information placed on the administrative side or by bringing it to the attention of the court during the hearing of the case where you are already a petitioner-in-person,” he wrote. Mr. Upadhyay is the petitioner-in-person in a case seeking quick disposal of criminal cases against legislators across the country. He has alleged that Justice Ramana’s order on September 16 to try these cases expeditiously may have prompted Mr. Reddy to write the letter on October 6 and release it to the media a few days later. Timing of the letter Mr. Venugopal, too, in his earlier reply on November 2, had concurred that the timing of the letter was “suspect.” In this context, the Attorney-General referred to Mr. Upadhyay’s statement that Mr. Reddy had 31 criminal cases against him. In this second communication to Mr. Upadhyay on Saturday, Mr. Venugopal however said the letter could not be described as a “private missive”. “Nowhere is the letter marked confidential,” the Attorney-General wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-g-stands-firm-in-plea-against-jagan/article33054750.ece
09 November 2020||Srinagar,||Army officer killed in bid to stop infiltrators||Four security forces personnel, including an Army officer, and three militants were killed near the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district on Sunday, in a major operation to push back a large group of infiltrators. According to the Army, contact with the batch of infiltrators, attempting to sneak in from Kupwara’s Machil Sector, was established around 1 a.m. Suspicious movement “A Border Security Forces (BSF) patrol noticed a suspicious movement near the anti-infiltration obstacle system (AIOS) near a fence, about 3.5 km away from the LoC. A firefight ensued in which one terrorist was killed. A BSF jawan was also killed in action,” Srinagar-based Army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said. The gunfight stopped at 4 a.m., as more troops of the Army from two flanks of the mountain range were rushed to the area for sanitisation. The movement of other terrorists was tracked by surveillance devices. “A second contact was established at 10:20 a.m., when heavy fire was drawn by our own search parties approximately 1.5 km from the LoC. In the ensuing firefight, two more terrorists were killed. Our own troops suffered three casualties and two more were injured. The injured were evacuated to a hospital,” Mr. Kalia said. The Army said it had recovered one AK-47 assault rifle and two bags from one of the slain militants. The search operation continued till late on Sunday evening. A BSF spokesman said the remaining militants may have managed to hide in the undulating terrain. “At the same time, Pakistan posts started ceasefire violations in support of the infiltrating militants,” the spokesman said. Sources in the security agencies said Sunday’s incident was a major infiltration bid. “There are apprehensions that many may be still hiding in the area and many might have returned (to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir),” official sources said. Sunday's infiltration is the second biggest bid since March 31 this year, when a group of five militants killed five soldiers in the Keran Sector of Kupwara. It comes just days ahead of the forecast of a snowfall in upper passes in north and south Kashmir. The BSF identified the deceased jawan as Constable Sudip Kumar. J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha paid tribute to the jawans killed in the encounter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/army-officer-killed-in-bid-to-stop-infiltrators/article33054755.ece

09 November 2020||Patna,||Bihar counting in 55 centres||The Election Commission has made elaborate arrangements for Tuesday’s counting of votes of the Bihar Assembly election. The commission said it had set up 55 counting centres with 414 halls spread across all 38 districts that voted in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7. East Champaran (12 Assembly constituencies), Gaya (10), Siwan (eight) and Begusarai (seven) districts have three counting centres each. The rest of the districts have either one or two. With the novel coronavirus is raging in the State, steps have been taken to ensure that COVID-19 guidelines are strictly followed during the counting. Masks will be mandatory for entering the counting centres, which will stock hand sanitisers in adequate quantity. In the State capital Patna, votes cast in all the 14 constituencies will be counted in just one centre at A.N. College. State Chief Electoral Officer H.R. Srinivasa said the Election Commission had established a three-tier security system for strong rooms (housing the electronic voting machines) and the counting centres. The inner core is being guarded by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), then there is the Bihar Military Police (BMP) and then the district police, he told presspersons. 19 CAPF companies “We have deployed 19 companies of the CAPF just for the security of the strong rooms and counting centres. Besides, we have 59 CAPF companies to ensure law and order during and after the counting process,” he said. One CAPF company comprises around 100 personnel. The CEO said the commission would strictly deal with “anti-social” elements who indulged in “hooliganism”. Additional Director-General of Police (Headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said CCTV cameras had been installed in the control rooms. After the counting starts at 8 a.m., the postal ballots will be opened first followed by EVM votes. In Bhagalpur district, which has two counting centres, preparations are being made for the results for seven Assembly seats. Display screens are being set up and two tents being erected at each counting centre for presspersons and security personnel. Arrangements are being made to put seven tables in all 14 halls. In Bhojpur district, the votes for all the seven constituencies will be counted at one centre set up at Bazar Samiti Godown, Arrah. Prohibitory orders Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) have been imposed in and around the counting centres to prevent gathering of people. A majority exit polls suggest that the Tejashwi Yadav-led Grand Alliance have an edge over the National Democratic Alliance in the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-counting-in-55-centres/article33054710.ece
09 November 2020||Washington,||Biden may relax curbs on H-1B, job-based visas||U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will work towards providing a road map to American citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, including over 5,00,000 from India, and will also establish a minimum admission number of 95,000 refugees annually. He also plans to increase the number of high-skilled visas, including the H-1B, and eliminate the limit on employment-based visas by country. Mr. Biden is expected to reverse the move of the outgoing Trump administration to revoke work permits to the spouses of H-1B visas, which had adversely impacted a large number of Indian families in the U.S. As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know first-hand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the U.S., said a policy document issued by the Biden campaign.  “He [Biden] will immediately begin working with Congress to pass legislative immigration reform that modernises our system, with a priority on keeping families together by providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants — including more than 500,000 from India,” it said. The Biden administration will support family-based immigration and preserve family unification as a core principle of the U.S. immigration system, which includes reducing the family visa backlog, it said. Mr. Biden will also restore and defend the naturalisation process for green card holders, the document added.   “He [Biden] will increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration based on macroeconomic conditions and exempt from any cap recent graduates of Ph.D. programmes in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields,” it said. “He will support first reforming the temporary visa system for high-skill, speciality jobs to protect wages and workers, then expanding the number of visas offered and eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian families in waiting for too long,” the document stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/biden-may-relax-curbs-on-h-1b-job-based-visas/article33054701.ece
09 November 2020||Kozhikode,||IUML slams arrest of party MLA||The State unit of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has defended its beleaguered MLA M.C. Kamaruddin, who was arrested in connection with the Fashion Gold Jewellery investment scam on Saturday, saying that the government’s move to implicate him in the case was “politically motivated.” IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, told the media after the party’s high-power committee meeting on Sunday that there was no logic in the demand for the resignation of the legislator from Manjeswaram in Kasaragod district. ‘A business activity’ All that Mr. Kamaruddin did was to engage in a business activity, which failed to take off. It was unfair to arrest him, Mr. Kunhalikutty pointed out. The State government was trying to dodge the corruption allegations against it by targeting Mr. Kamaruddin. The IUML was not aware of his involvement when the party made him its candidate during the Assembly bypolls in the Manjeswaram constituency last year. The investors had been assured of repayment of their money and the party had nothing to do with it, he said. ‘Arrest unfair’ The meeting noted that the arrest of the MLA was unfair as the probe into the complaint had not been completed as yet. Some of the provisions charged against him would not stand legal scrutiny. There were political games behind the action of the special investigation team of the Crime Branch. The MLA was asked to appear for questioning in the morning. The special investigation team announced in the course of the investigation that the arrest would happen. Then he was arrested in the evening. Mr. Kunhalikutty asked if the police would arrest all those whose business ventures had collapsed. That would lead to action against many legislators. There had been no comprehensive inquiry against the scam as well, he pointed out. ‘Money must be repaid’ The grouse of the investors was a serious issue and their money should be repaid. The party had made it clear when the issue was brought to its notice some time ago, Mr. Kunhalikutty said. That stand was reiterated on Sunday’s meeting as well. “Whatever may be the business that failed, timely repayment of the investors’ money is a must. Same is true with the Fashion Gold Jewellery case too. The arrest and later developments may delay the repayment,” Mr. Kunhalikutty said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iuml-slams-arrest-of-its-mla/article33054680.ece
09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Kamala will speak out on rights, says uncle||Kamala Harris will speak out on issues that are important to her, said a close relative of the Vice-President-elect of the United States. Speaking to The Hindu , G. Balachandran, policy commentator and technology expert, said Ms. Harris was raised by her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who participated in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, and she may choose to speak out on human rights-related issues in India. “She will speak out if she is moved by something. You may not want her to say that but she will say, ‘I am sorry but I will have to say this’,” said Mr. Balachandran, maternal uncle of Ms. Harris. He pointed out that Ms. Harris will not keep quiet if she finds something happening in India that she disagrees with. Mr. Balachandran maintained that Ms. Harris draws from the rich legacy of civil rights championed by her mother Shyamala, a biomedical scientist, who left a strong impression on her daughter. “Shyamala contributed immensely to the legacy of human rights in the United States. Her contribution on that front is much greater than that of Kamala’s,” said Mr. Balachandran, who worked as a consultant at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. He maintained that the election result has sent a message of hope to the world. The Biden-Harris campaign had maintained that India should restore civil and political rights in Kashmir and Ms. Harris had indicated her disapproval after the August 5 decision last year on ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. When asked about the issue, Ms. Harris had said, “We are all watching.” Mr. Balachandran hinted that his niece could speak on the present situation in Kashmir as well. “Do not think that just because India has done something ... she will keep quiet on that. She has spoken on issues like Kashmir earlier,” he said. Speaking out on issues of global relevance will be the hallmark of the Biden-Harris administration as the election mandate is for bringing the U.S. into the global mainstream, as opposed to the policy of President Donald Trump, who had withdrawn the country from many of the international and multilateral obligations. “The result is inspiring a lot of people all over the world because it indicates that the United States will return to the global mainstream, which is a good thing,” said Mr. Balachandran, who said the entire Indian part of Ms. Harris’s family is planning to attend the swearing-in ceremony on January 20. “I attended the swearing-in ceremony when she became a Senator and I will be in Washington DC this time as well. All of us will be there when she takes the oath of office,” Mr. Balachandran said. He is the brother of the Chennai-born Shyamala, who passed away in 2009.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kamala-will-speak-out-on-issues-says-uncle/article33054703.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,||Kamala Harris is made for great things, says aunt||“We were glued to television, and the whole family was ecstatic when the news broke,” said Sarala Gopalan, when asked how the family reacted when her niece was announced as the U.S. Vice-President-elect on Saturday. In her nomination acceptance speech earlier this year, Kamala Harris had mentioned her chithis, or aunts, in particular. Dr. Gopalan is the younger sister of Ms. Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, and lives in Chennai, where the Senator from California had visited her grandfather P.V. Gopalan and others of the family quite a few times. “She last came with her sister Maya soon after their mother passed away [in 2009]. It was my sister’s wish that her ashes be immersed in Chennai, and they made a trip for that,” Dr. Gopalan said. “We are overjoyed that she has scripted history,” she said, referring to the fact that Ms. Harris is the first woman and Indian American Vice-President-elect. Stating that Ms. Harris had always been capable in whatever she set out to do, Dr. Gopalan said the whole family had always been confident about her going on to achieve great things. “Kamala has largely been inspired by her mother. My sister always had it in her, that she should go on to achieve big things, and this is what I feel Kamala too has taken after,” she said. “If we’re a family of strong women, the credit goes to my father. In the 1950s, when my sister Shyamala secured a scholarship to study in the U.S., he immediately encouraged her and asked her to go. Other families would have been hesitant in those times to send an 18-year-old girl alone to study abroad,” Dr. Gopalan recalled. Ms. Harris has spoken about the bond she shared with her grandfather. Dr. Gopalan headed the Department of Gynaecology at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education (Chandigarh) and worked with the Voluntary Health Services hospital in Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kamala-harris-is-made-for-great-things-says-aunt/article33054705.ece
09 November 2020||New Delhi,||Victory for Indian-Americans: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday congratulated United States President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. In separate letters to them, Ms. Gandhi said their election would work to heal the division among the people, and hoped for a close partnership between the U.S. and India. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, and expressed confidence that Mr. Biden “will unite America and provide it with a strong sense of direction”. In another tweet, Mr. Gandhi said, “Congratulations, Vice-President-elect @KamalaHarris! It makes us proud that the first woman to serve as Vice-President of the USA traces her roots to India”. Hailing Ms. Harris’s election as a victory for the African-American and Indian-American communities as well as the values enshrined in the American Constitution, Ms. Gandhi said India was waiting to warmly welcome the Vice-President-elect as “a beloved daughter of India”. In her letter to Mr. Biden, the Congress president said Indians, like millions around world, had followed with great interest the course of the U.S. presidential election during the last 12 months. “We were greatly re-assured by your measured speeches, stress on healing divisions among the people, and promotion of gender and racial equality, global cooperation and sustainable development of all countries. The Indian people share these concerns and we are confident that India and the United States will continue to work together, as in the past decades, for the welfare of the people of both countries,”she said. ‘Strong bonds’ The Congress leader said India and U.S. shared strong bonds in the areas of trade and business, education, technology and defence cooperation. “Under your wise and mature leadership we look forward to a close partnership that will be beneficial to peace and development in our region and around the world,” she said. She told Ms. Harris: “Your victory is a victory for the noble values enshrined in the American Constitution — democracy, social justice, and racial and gender equality”. “It is a triumph for Black-Americans and Indian-Americans, and for the humanity, compassion and inclusiveness that you have stood for throughout your public and political life. I admire the unwavering courage with which you have fought for your convictions — the beliefs and values you imbibed from your remarkable mother!” Ms. Gandhi said. Hoping that Ms. Harris would work towards uniting a bitterly divided nation, strengthen the ties of friendship with India and support democratic values and human rights, the Congress chief said the party was looking forward to welcoming her soon. “We hope we will have the opportunity soon to welcome you to India, where you will be warmly hailed not just as a much-admired leader of a great democracy, but also as a beloved daughter,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/victory-for-indian-americans-sonia/article33054708.ece
09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Note ban curbed black money: PM||On the fourth anniversary of demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the move helped in reducing black money, increase tax compliance and formalisation of the economy. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi blamed it for “destroying” India’s economy that allowed even Bangladesh to “surpass” India. “Demonetisation has helped reduce black money, increase tax compliance and formalisation and given a boost to transparency. These outcomes have been greatly beneficial towards national progress,” Mr. Modi tweeted with the hashtag #DeMolishingCorruption. On his Twitter handle, the Prime Minister also shared graphics on how demonetisation has ensured better tax compliance, improved tax and GDP ratio, made India a lesser cash-based economy and gave a boost to national security by tackling counterfeit notes and cutting the source of terror financing. On November 8, 2016, Mr. Modi had announced his government’s decision to ban all currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from midnight. But the Congress observed the day as Vishwasghaat Diwas (Betrayal Day) and launched the party’s online campaign “SpeakUpAgainst DeMoDisaster”. In a video, released as part of this campaign, Mr. Gandhi held demonetisation responsible for Bangladesh doing better than India in terms of economic growth and alleged that the move “destroyed” India’s economy and only helped Mr. Modi’s “crony capitalist friends”. Talking on Bangladesh “surpassing” India, Mr. Gandhi said, “The government says the reason is COVID but if that is the reason, there is COVID in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world also. The reason is not COVID, the reason is Notebandi [demonetisation] and GST.” “ Pradhan Mantri ji said it was a a fight against black money. This was a lie. The attack was on you, Narendra Modi wanted to snatch your money and give it to his two or three crony capitalist friends. You stood in lines, not his crony capitalist friends. You put your money in banks and PM Modi gave that money to his friends and gave them a loan waiver of Rs. 3,50,000 crore,” he alleged. ‘Assault on economy’ “Four years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began an assault on the Indian economy. He hurt farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers. Manmohan Singh ji said the economy will lose 2% and that is what we saw,” the former Congress chief said. The Congress leader claimed that the Modi government’s “faulty” goods and services tax destroyed small, middle-sized businesses and “cleared the way for his three or four crony capitalist friends”, and now the government was targeting to “finish off” the farmers with the new farms bills. “Narendra Modi ji destroyed the pride of India — our economy. Now, we have to get together to rebuild it,” the Congress leader said. At a separate press conference, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken accused the government of changing its narrative to explain the rationale of demonetisation — from countering black money and corruption, to stemming “counterfeit,” to making India a “digital or cashless” economy, to bringing back idle savings into banks. Asserting that 99.3% of the demonetised currency came back to the system, Mr. Maken alleged, “As far as corruption is concerned, we have seen a surge in the use of immense money power in poaching MLAs and destabilising non-BJP led State governments.” Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, as part of the campaign, said,“The first lesson every ruler and every government must learn is that — even if you do not do good to the people, do not do harm. The BJP-led NDA government did great harm to India’s economy on November 8th, 2016.” Senior Congress leaders including Mallikarjun Kharge, Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid also targeted the government as part of the party’s online campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/note-ban-curbed-black-money-pm/article33054721.ece
09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||When Defence College faced fire in early days||Just two years after being set up in 1960, the National Defence College (NDC) was almost shut down in 1962 after the then Defence Minister, V.K. Krishna Menon, got furious when participants suggested during a discussion at the institute that there could be a war with China. It was another visit later in 1963 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru which ensured that the institute continued, said Air Marshal D. Choudhury, Commandant of the National Defence College (NDC) recalling the early days. The institute is now much sought after across the world and is set to increase its intake from 100 to 120 course members by 2022 with most new slots going to friendly foreign countries, Air Marshal Choudhury said in an interview to The Hindu as the premier institute celebrates its 60th anniversary. “In 1962, then Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Menon visited NDC for a talk. It’s there in our book called the Lamp of Wisdom . There was a heated discussion and people brought out that there could be war with China. He was furious that NDC was encouraging such kind of thoughts which was not in sync with what was happening in the world apparently,” Air Marshal Choudhury said. Later, India and China fought a short but brutal war. In 1963, there was actually no course for six months, he said, till Lt. Gen. Bahadur Singh, the founding commandant met Mr. Nehru somewhere and requested him to come and visit the institute. Nehru visited NDC along with the Defence Minister and during the course of the visit, it was mentioned to him that NDC had actually predicted the war and it had put up the whole thing to the government, which turned out to be a fact later, Air Marshal Choudhury said. “That’s when apparently the PM made a comment to the Defence Minister that is why the NDC must continue. That is how we had a second lease of life,” he said. Last week the institute celebrated its diamond jubilee virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has conducted most of the course this year virtually. A series of changes have been undertaken recently to qualitatively improve the syllabus. To have institutional continuity, Air Marshal Choudhury said the President of India is going to announce a Chair of Excellence on November 11 which will allow them to get one member who will become a sort of resident mentor and ensure continuity in the syllabus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/when-defence-college-faced-fire-in-early-days/article33054712.ece
09 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala’s test positivity rate remains over 11%||Kerala tested 48,798 samples and reported 5,440 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday. Public health experts were worried about the upcoming Sabarimala pilgrimage, when people from other States would also congregate, possibly causing the case graph to rise again.

09 November 2020||New Delhi,||Not taking chances, Congress deputes two leaders to Patna||tweA day after exit polls predicted the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) to be ahead of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar Assembly elections, the Congress on Sunday sent two senior leaders to Patna to “prevent any attempt at poaching.” Party president Sonia Gandhi stationed general secretary Randeep Surjewala and senior leader Avinash Pande in Patna to oversee the counting day developments on Tuesday and coordinate with all the candidates. Sources claimed the move is to avoid a repeat of Manipur and Goa Assembly elections in 2017 in which Congress MLAs switched sides soon after results and ‘helped’ the BJP form governments in these State despite the Congress emerging as the single largest party in the elections. A source said the Congress’ plan in Bihar is to summon the winning candidates from their respective constituencies soon after the results and put them in a Patna hotel. “A hotel in Patna has already been identified where we will keep our MLAs together,” said the source, adding that Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Punjab are also being considered to keep the MLAs depending on the situation. Of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress is contesting in 70 seats as part of the grand alliance and is expecting to win 40-45 seats. Following the encouraging exit polls, the RJD cautioned its party workers to behave with retstraint on the day of the results. “All the workers should remember: irrespective of the outcome on November 10, the results have to be accepted with restraint, humility and courteously. Improper fireworks, celebratory firing, rude behaviour with opponents or their supporters will not be acceptable at any cost,” said the RJD’s official Twitter handle. “Irrespective of the outcome, your politics should be defined by public welfare and their uplift,” another tweet from the party said.  Chidambaram tweets The exit polls also prompted former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram to tweet that people of Bihar will send a clear message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that issues like jobs, inflation, healthcare are important electoral issues. “I believe the people of Bihar will send a clear message that they are more concerned with jobs, food, healthcare, inflation, fair prices for farmers, infrastructure and industrial development. Will the PM hear their voices?” asked Mr. Chidambaram. “Mr. Modi believes that he can win every election on Hindutva, Ram Temple, Pulwama, repeal of Article 370, CAA, and branding every opposition party and opposition leader as anti-national,” he added. Comparing India’s political discourse with that of United States, he said every Indian Prime Minister should speak the way U.S. President-elect Joe Biden spoke in his victory acceptance speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wary-of-poaching-bid-cong-deputes-two-leaders-to-patna/article33054719.ece
09 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. issues advisory on crowding at Sabarimala||Considering the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Kerala, the State Health Department has issued an advisory emphasising the importance of restricting the number of pilgrims and preventing crowding during the coming Sabarimala pilgrimage season, so as to prevent a potential spread. The advisory pointed out that religious congregations and church choirs have led to major superspreading events of COVID-19 in the West and that it was imperative that people do not congregate even temporarily at Nilakkal or Pampa. According to the government directives, the number of pilgrims will be strictly limited. Pilgrims and others accompanying them, such as drivers or cooks, are expected to maintain all COVID-19 safety protocols. Maintaining physical distancing as far as possible, avoiding crowded and closed spaces, and frequent handwashing/sanitising are a must. Pulmonary fitness The government has also advised people who have had a recent exposure to COVID-19 to avoid the pilgrimage. People who have recovered from COVID-19 will have to undergo a graded exercise programme and pulmonary rehabilitation, spread over weeks, to ensure physical fitness before attempting to go on the trek to Sabarimala. As it is possible that there could be pilgrims who have had an asymptomatic infection earlier, pulmonary and cardiac fitness is desirable for all pilgrims, it has been pointed out. All pilgrims will have to produce a COVID-19 negative certification taken 24 hours prior to reaching Sabarimala. As the rapid antigen test is not foolproof, a negative antigen test should not be seen as an excuse not to wear masks or maintain physical distancing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-govt-calls-for-avoiding-overcrowding-at-sabarimala/article33054686.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Karnataka HC directs Centre to restore medical college to RGUHS||The High Court of Karnataka has set aside the Union government’s order transferring the city-based Rajarajeswari Medical College and Hospital (RRMCH) to the Dr. MGR Educational and Research Institute, a Chennai-based deemed-to-be university. The court has also directed the Centre to restore the medical college to Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), Bengaluru. Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while allowing a petition filed by the State government challenging the February 14, 2019 notification issued by the Centre including RRMCH under the Chennai-based deemed university on the recommendations made by the University Grants Commission. The court also dismissed a petition filed by the city-based Moogambigai Charitable and Educational Trust, which was managing RRMCH, challenging the May 16, 2019 order of the State government and the June 29 decision of RGUHS of not allowing disaffiliation from the State health university. Though the court held that the deemed university could not have admitted students to undergraduate and postgraduate courses without securing disaffiliation from RGUHS, it asked the State and RGUHS to protect the students admitted by the deemed-to-be university as the students were not at fault. The court held that the UGC could not have recommended to the Centre to include the college under the deemed university without considering the objections of the State government, whose opinion was sought as per the regulations. The State government had categorically objected to the inclusion of RRMCH under the Chennai-based deemed-to-be university while pointing out that the college was recognised as a Tamil linguistic minority institution to serve Tamil minority candidates in Karnataka. Noting that the UGC regulations allowed for the inclusion of institutions under the same management into a deemed-to-be university, the court said that RRMCH was managed by Moogambigai Trust, Bengaluru, while the deemed-to-be university was managed by the Dr. MGR Educational and Research Institute Trust, Chennai, even though the two had some common trustees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-high-court-directs-centre-to-restore-medical-college-to-rguhs/article33054949.ece
09 November 2020||Hyderabad,||Finally, great banyan tree breathes afresh||Pillalamarri , the great banyan tree of Telangana, has got a new lease of life and is now back in healthy germination thanks to the tireless efforts of the Mahabubnagar district administration, whose ‘modern-organic’ treatment boosted the immunity of the centuries-old giant. By turning a new leaf in conservation, the officials demonstrated how the dramatically decaying process of the termite-infested tree could be reversed and put back on the growth path. As a result, it has now started sprouting new leaves. It is a phoenix-like moment for this banyan tree, District Collector S. Venkat Rao told The Hindu . “Micromanagement conservation efforts of the massive banyan tree by the Forest officials had yielded great results and it is now put back on the growth trajectory,” he said. Spread over three-and-half acres, the 700-year-old ficus tree, one of the oldest and largest on the planet, is situated around 4 km from Mahbubnagar town. With truck-sized prop roots growing all over the compound, the officials couldn’t identify the mother root yet. In December 2017, one of the termite-infested branches of the tree, which was neglected by officials and vandalised by tourists for decades, came crashing down. A month later, the then District Collector Ronald Rose decided to give a new lease of life to the tree and chalked out action plans in coordination with the officials of the Forest Department. “To contain the termite attack, we sprayed chlorpyrifos on the tree. Starting few months, we sprayed on the branches, and later realised the practise was not effective, as the solution was seeping inside the trunk, so we drilled holes into the branches and stem and injected the chlorpyrifos,” District Forest Officer Chukka Ganga Reddy said. Later, the officials started injecting chlorpyrifos through ‘saline drip’ and the bottles were spread all over. “As the branches were falling, green shoots were a rarity. But now we can see new leaves, which have a reddish tinge, sprouting at many places. The tree is sending a message of revival,” Mr. Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finally-great-banyan-tree-breathes-normal/article33054690.ece
09 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Antibiotic residues make cholera drug-resistant||Laboratory studies and whole genome sequencing of vibrio cholerae, the organism which causes cholera, done by a team of researchers at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology ( RGCB) here has identified a mutation in one of the strains which makes it resistant to doxycycline, one of the mainstay antibiotics and the drug of choice to treat cholera. The V57L mutation in the RpsJ protein of the organism was identified to be important in rendering it resistant to doxycycline. Importantly, researchers found that this mutation in the V. cholerae strain can be triggered spontaneously in the environment too because of long-term exposure to antibiotic residues, indicating that stricter controls need to be brought in to prevent the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The study, ‘Adaptive laboratory evolution of Vibrio cholerae to doxycycline associated with spontaneous mutation,’ by Lakshmi Narendrakumaret.al, was done at the Cholera and Biofilm Research Laboratory, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, here Pathogens usually acquire resistance to antimicrobial compounds by accumulation of spontaneous mutation or horizontal gene transfer. “Although the emergence of antimicrobial resistance by accumulation of spontaneous mutation is less common in V. cholerae, we hypothesise that long-term exposure to antibiotic residues in the environment can alter the microbial community structure and function and cause spontaneous mutations which make V. cholerae more resistant,” Sabu Thomas, Scientist, RGCB and principal investigator of the study, said.  Doxycycline is used to treat cholera patients in India. “The ALE experiment proved that sustained exposure to the antibiotic can lead to the strain developing resistance to it and that a similar scenario is possible in the environment,” Dr. Thomas said. Researchers also illustrated for the first time that the doxycycline stress induced co-resistance to different classes of antibiotics, including colistin, a last-resort antibiotic to treat extensively drug-resistant bacteria, which should sound the warning bells on the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Interestingly, the same doxycycline resistant strain showed collateral sensitivity to azithromycin and kanamycin antibiotics. In this study, 97% of the V. cholerae isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant While the reduced susceptibility of V. cholerae strains to doxycycline over the years has been observed in earlier studies too, the ALE experiment revealed that the reduced susceptibility was a result of the RpsJ V57L mutation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/antibiotic-residues-make-cholera-drug-resistant/article33054909.ece
09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Experts want more U.S. action on climate||United States President-elect, Joseph Biden has committed to getting his country back into the 2015 Paris Climate Change Treaty, which commits countries to prevent a 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature by the end of the century. However, experts in India say the U.S. ought to be doing more. The U.S. formally left the Treaty on November 2 after a four-year withdrawal period. Emissions targets Several developed countries and regions including the United Kingdom, Japan, and the EU have committed to achieve ‘net zero emissions’ by 2050. China, too, has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2060 with a greenhouse gas levels peaking by 2030. The U.S. — the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases — is exceptional in not committing to a deadline. “It’s clear that Biden won in part because of climate voters. He got significant donations from the climate community and young people turned out in unprecedented numbers to vote for him. He has a strong mandate to govern on this issue, and given how much the campaign focused on climate, I know he will prioritise it,” Leah Stokes, Assistant Professor, University of California, Santa Barbara, said in a statement. India on track India has consistently maintained that it was doing more than its fair share towards achieving Paris targets and other developed countries ought to be stepping up. “We are asking world leaders to comply with the Paris Agreement. Our Prime Minister is passionate about climate change. India’s emission share in the world is only 6%. India is taking care of nature and doing well. We have increased our tree cover, converted vehicles to BS-VI standards, reduced our emissions, prepared land restoration plan besides other actions,” Minister of Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar said last week. “India should urge the Biden administration to adopt climate change goals that place it on a path to a less than 2°C warming target. At present, India is the only G-20 country whose Paris pledges for 2030 place it on a 2°C pathway,” said Ajay Mathur, Director-General of The Energy Resources Institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-want-more-us-action-on-climate/article33054713.ece

09 November 2020||LUCKNOW,||Businessman’s kin want bounty on IPS officer||The family of Mahoba businessman Indrakant Tripathi — who died in September after being found shot in his car days after he had accused an IPS officer of threatening to kill him — on Sunday demanded that a bounty be announced against the absconding officer Manilal Patidar who continues to evade arrest. While an FIR under murder and conspiracy charges was lodged against Mr. Patidar and others initially on the complaint of the family of Tripathi, the charges were downgraded to abetment to suicide following a probe by a Special Investigation Team. The pressure mounted on Mr. Patidar ever since the Allahabad High Court on November 2 dismissed his plea seeking protection from arrest and quashing of the FIR against him. Ravikant Tripathi, brother of Indrakant, alleged that the police were ‘complicating’ the investigation by not arresting the officer and ‘protecting’ him. He demanded that the suspended IPS officer be declared a fugitive, his property be seized and he be arrested at the earliest for “safeguarding of evidence and our safety”. Mr. Ravikant asked how was he able to file pleas in the HC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/businessmans-kin-want-bounty-on-ips-officer/article33054716.ece

We are Americans,” Mr. Biden said. The mandate of this election, he said, is that Americans have called on them to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. “To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of this time. The battle to control the virus.... The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family’s health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot,” he said. “Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses. It is time for our better angels to prevail, he said. Mr. Biden assured Americans that his first task as President-elect is to get the pandemic under control with a definite plan. The pandemic has killed more than 2,37,000 Americans and infected over 9 million others and Mr Biden has repeatedly attacked Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic. Team on Monday “On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help take the Biden-Harris Covid plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January 20, 2021,” Mr. Biden said. “That plan will be built on bedrock science,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/joe-biden-pledges-to-unite-america/article33054695.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy to the Chief Justice of India, and thus it is open to the Supreme Court to take up the matter of contempt suo motu as provided by the Contempt of Courts Act, and the rules made thereunder,” Mr. Venugopal wrote to Mr. Upadhyay on November 7.  Exercising his ‘right’ However, Mr. Venugopal said his refusal did not stop Mr. Upadhyay from exercising his “right” to take the matter directly to the judges for suo motu action. “You may exercise this right by way of information placed on the administrative side or by bringing it to the attention of the court during the hearing of the case where you are already a petitioner-in-person,” he wrote. Mr. Upadhyay is the petitioner-in-person in a case seeking quick disposal of criminal cases against legislators across the country. He has alleged that Justice Ramana’s order on September 16 to try these cases expeditiously may have prompted Mr. Reddy to write the letter on October 6 and release it to the media a few days later. Timing of the letter Mr. Venugopal, too, in his earlier reply on November 2, had concurred that the timing of the letter was “suspect.” In this context, the Attorney-General referred to Mr. Upadhyay’s statement that Mr. Reddy had 31 criminal cases against him. In this second communication to Mr. Upadhyay on Saturday, Mr. Venugopal however said the letter could not be described as a “private missive”. “Nowhere is the letter marked confidential,” the Attorney-General wrote. Mr. Venugopal said he had watched the video of the October 10 press conference. Nothing “extra” was added during the event than what was said in the letter addressed to the Chief Justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/open-to-sc-to-initiate-case-against-jagan/article33055170.ece

The verification forms were distributed in the past two days in Muslim-majority areas of Gujjar Nagar, Sunjwan and Bathindi. “The forms have induced anxiety among the locals. The form is seeking details which are unheard of. It seeks pictures of the owner of a house, family members and age. Beside asking for mobile numbers, it seeks information on how old the construction is and the place of migration,” Jammu’s prominent advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed said. He said the form seeks even details of vehicles owned and their numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-rectify-tenant-form-in-jammu/article33054717.ece
09 November 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Arnab, two others shifted to Taloja jail||Republic TV managing director and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, along with two of the co-accused in the case of abetment to suicide, has been shifted to Taloja Central Jail by jail officials citing security reasons. Mr. Goswami who was arrested on November 4 has been in judicial custody since then and was lodged in the Alibag jail-quarantine centre which is a school run by the Alibag Municipal Council. “The shifting decision was by jail authorities. On Monday, we have a hearing on our revision petition before Alibag sessions court and if we are granted police custody, he will have to be brought back,” Raigad Superintendent of Police Ashok Dudhe said. Mr. Goswami was shifted to Taloja jail along with Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda after their quarantine period in Alibag was over. The Alibag Superintendent Jailer had written to the superior authorities to shift the three to Taloja jail after they completed their quarantine period for security reasons and for the reason that it was a high-profile case. Police inspector Jamil Shaikh, Local Crime Branch (LCB), Raigad, said that Mr. Goswami was found to be using a mobile phone from the quarantine centre. The police found that he was active on social media and wrote to the Alibag jailer asking about the same. “We have initiated an inquiry into how he was using the mobile phone as his personal mobile was seized by us during the arrest,” Mr. Shaikh said. After reaching near Taloja jail when he saw media persons, Mr. Goswami starting shouting, “I am not allowed to speak to my lawyers, my life is under threat. My life is in danger, please tell the courts to help me.” Groups of people against Mr. Goswami and in support of him had reached outside Taloja jail shouting slogans. The jailer from Alibag said, “Being a COVID-19 quarantine centre, we had permitted the inmates to use a phone to get in touch with their lawyers. We have a record of the calls made by the inmates and the time. We are investigating if Goswami had used any phone beyond the time which was permitted.” Somaiyya meets jailer “I met the jailer and requested that since Goswami is scared, he should be taken care of and should be given medical assistance if required and make sure that he is not assaulted. Jailer assured me that he will be taken care of,” BJP leader Kirit Somaiyya said. “I have been trying to reach out to many government officials but no one is reachable. A person at an editorial post is being treated like this, this is a condemnable act by government. I was worried about Goswami and hence I decided to meet the jailer,” he added. The Alibaug sessions court on Saturday heard the pleas of Mr. Goswami’s advocate in the revision petition filed by police. Since the hearing in the habeas corpus writ by Mr. Goswami was still going on at the High Court, the sessions court gave the next date for the order for November 9.

09 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||Elderly COVID survivors with no home find warmth at hospital||She shrieks in pain every time caregivers at the Gandhi Hospital try to lift her back to make her sit. But ask 100-year-old Nagendramma her age, she chuckles and says, “I am as young as a kid”. Hearing her response, doctors and patient care providers on duty make no attempt to hide their laughter even as her wrinkled face breaks into a tender smile. The centenarian is among the many elderly patients to have recovered from COVID-19 and admitted to the ‘Dependants Ward’ of Gandhi Hospital, for the past five months. Also at the ward are two other elderly women, Laxmamma (82) and Annapurna (86, who waged a successful battle against the disease, but they are reserved, unlike Nagendramma. Only one of them is able to talk. A lot in common Apart from the fact that the three women cannot eat, sit, walk or clean themselves up without help, a common thread binding them is that they have no home to return to. They all used to stay at old-age homes. The management of the home where Nagendramma used to stay has not been responding to calls. Hospital authorities are also trying to trace the address of the facility where the other two women stayed. Gandhi Hospital superintendent M. Raja Rao said that apart from the elderly, patients with disabilities, mental illnesses and malignancies, who are in a mostly bed-ridden condition, are admitted to the ‘Dependants Ward’. The State-run hospital is designated as a COVID-exclusive facility. COVID nodal officer at the hospital T. Prabhakar Reddy said patient care providers take care of the patients in the ward. Some of the patients who cannot even muster energy to ask for food are fed regularly at a particular time, he added. “Since the patients cannot function on their own, the hospital staff feed them, change their diapers, clean them up and help them move around,” he shared. Till date, 117 patients, who are COVID survivors with no home to go back to, have been admitted in the ward. Dr Raja Rao said patients are given food of their choice, adding Nagendramma, for instance, prefers hot coffee and puris or dosas. Shut out There are also some aged patients who despite being able-bodied are forced to stay back at the hospital as their family members or children hesitate to take them home right after recovery. Hospital officials said during treatment, family members used to regularly call to enquire about the health of the patient. However, post recovery, many have requested the administration to delay the discharge date citing safety concern of children or the lack of a person to take care of the recovered patient at home, among other reasons. Some such patients had had to stay back for more than 50 days, said officials.  Since the patients cannot function on their own, the hospital staff feed them, change their diapers, clean them up and help them move around. T.

Nagaraju ended his life inside Chanchalguda jail of Hyderabad following his arrest by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in a corruption case, another accused connected to the case, Dharma Reddy, 77, ended his life at Kushaiguda here on Sunday triggering harassment charges by his family members. Body of the septuagenarian was found hanging from a tree in an open place in Vasavi Shivanagar of Kushaiguda. No suicide note was found. ACB officials arrested Tahsildar Nagaraju along with three others on this August 14, after an unaccounted sum of Rs. 1.10 crore was seized from his house. Along with him, land developer Chowla Srinath, land broker K. Anji Reddy and Rampally VR assistant Bongu Sairaj were arrested. Investigators took Nagaraju into custody from judicial remand for further interrogation and sent him back to Chanchalguda central prison. “During the investigation, we received a report from V&E wing that Nagaraju transferred ownership of nearly 96 acres to Dharma Reddy and the latter’s family members illegally,” the investigators said. Based on this, the ACB officials registered a second case of corruption against Nagaraju (who was in prison), Dharma Reddy and others. They arrested Dharma Reddy, his son Srikanth Reddy and others. Meanwhile, the ACB secured custody of Nagaraju for three days in the second case. On completion of the first day of interrogation, he was sent back to the prison. He committed suicide by hanging to the window grills of the barrack in the prison on October 14. Meanwhile, Dharma Reddy came out on bail, having spent 33 days in prison. “He appeared dejected since his return from prison. He used to be angry frequently and say he would commit suicide,” Dharma Reddy’s wife Venkatamma told reporters. Dharma Reddy had to appear in ACB office before the investigators twice a week in the case. With his son still in prison, he had none to accompany him to the ACB office. “He was more upset about being compelled to go to the ACB office. He was disturbed over this and used to point out that his daughter had to accompany him to the ACB office with no one around to help him,” Venkatamma said.

09 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Lobbying intensifies for Cabinet berths||Lobbying for ministerial berths intensified over the weekend, close on the heels of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s announcement that he intended to visit Delhi immediately after the bypoll results on Tuesday to get the high command’s clearance for Cabinet expansion. In fact, some of the aspirants are learnt to have gone to the national capital to consult with the central BJP leaders. It has been a long-pending exercise and the Chief Minister has not been able to get the high command to allow him to expand/reshuffle his Cabinet for several months now. During his Delhi visit in the third week of September, when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president J.P. Nadda, he failed to achieve the desired result, triggering speculation that the central leaders were thinking of a leadership change in Karnataka after the Bihar Assembly polls. “The exit polls predicting an upset defeat for the NDA government in Bihar seems to have only made the Chief Minister more assertive. This is evident in how he has announced his intent to visit Delhi to get clearance for a Cabinet expansion/reshuffle. A defeat [for the BJP] in Bihar will only strengthen the credentials of a regional satrap like Yediyurappa who can deliver poll wins for the party,” one of his close associates said. While campaigning for the bypolls, Mr. Yediyurappa had confidently announced that Munirathna, BJP candidate in R.R. Nagar, would be a Minister after the polls. Push for reshuffle With C.T. Ravi’s resignation from the Cabinet being accepted, the number of vacancies has gone up to seven. “The Chief Minister is likely to push for a Cabinet reshuffle, drop some Ministers, and accommodate more new faces. Some of the north Karnataka MLAs have held meetings of legislators and openly declared their dissidence over the last few months,” a strategist close to Mr. Yediyurappa said. While the party circles are abuzz with speculation about who might be dropped in case of a reshuffle, sources close to the Chief Minister said he was holding his cards close to his chest. Whether the high command will permit him to undertake a reshuffle or only clear an expansion exercise is to be seen. Mr. Yediyurappa has already made public commitments to make R. Shankar, N. Nagaraj (MTB), Munirathna, and Umesh Katti Ministers. He is expected to keep his word, in the case of Munirathna, only if he wins, sources said. Meanwhile, several others, including A.H. Vishwanath, Arvind Limbavali, C.P. Yogeshwar, and Raju Gowda, have been lobbying hard for a ministerial berth. “Balancing the aspirations of several ministerial aspirants will be a challenge any day. While the Cabinet expansion/reshuffle is pitched as a medicine to put a lid on political dissidence, it may also end up opening a can of worms,” a senior Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lobbying-intensifies-for-cabinet-berths/article33054682.ece

09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Plea on draft West Ghats notification||A Kerala-based NGO for farmers moved the Supreme Court on Sunday to declare unconstitutional a draft notification of the Centre demarcating 56,825 sq. km spread across six States as the ‘Western Ghats Ecologically Sensitive Area’. Karshaka Shabdam (Voice of Farmers) said the draft notification of October 3, 2018, covered Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The petition has also sought a direction to the government not to implement the Madhav Gadgil and K. Kasturirangan committees’ reports on the conservation of the Western Ghats and the demarcation of ‘no-go’ zones. The petition, represented by advocate Suvidutt M.S., said the draft notification would affect 22 lakh people and cripple the economy of Kerala. The draft notification to declare “123 agricultural villages in Kerala as ecologically sensitive area [ESA] villages and the recommendations based on the Kasturirangan report [and earlier the Gadgil report] on land use, farming practices, animal husbandry, forestry, industries, infrastructure development, power generation, transport, tourism, etc., would convert the semi-urban villages in the region into forests with no facilities and roads,” the petition said. The plea said the Centre had wrongly branded people who had been residing in the Western Ghats area, following government norms on agricultural practices, as the “destroyers of the biodiversity and agents of ecological damage”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/declare-unconstitutional-draft-on-western-ghats/article33054694.ece

BJP spokesperson Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the partnership between the two countries is the future of democracy in the global political order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indo-us-ties-will-progress-says-bjp/article33054699.ece

09 November 2020||GUWAHATI,||Stones thrown at Assam Cong. leaders||Miscreants from across the Assam-Mizoram border allegedly used slingshots to attack an Assam Congress team with stones and marbles when it visited a flashpoint on Sunday. The governments and people of the two north-eastern States have been caught in a border row for a month with a brief lull in hostilities in between. The two States share a 146.6 km border. The Congress delegation said the Mizoram police had erected barricades near a bridge about 3 km inside Assam and used aggressive locals to prevent the members from advancing further. “We had intimated the Assam government in writing about our visit but the Mizoram police prevented us from reaching the trouble spots. The Mizos also pelted stones and marbles at us and the Assam police personnel,” said All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev a former MP from southern Assam’s Barak Valley that borders Mizoram. She criticised Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for failing to resolve the border problem despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah holding talks with leaders of both States. Assam’s Opposition leader Debabrata Saikia, who accompanied Ms. Dev, said the “aggression” by people of Mizoram was within Assam. “Mizo villagers joined their State police in preventing us from advancing. They pelted stones at us with slingshots and shouted slogans,” he said, adding that Mizoram occupied large swathes of Assam’s land while the Bharatiya Janata Party-led State government turned a blind eye. In Mizoram’s capital, Aizawl, Chief Secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo said three companies of the Border Security Force would soon replace the Mizoram police at three flashpoints and trucks stranded in the State would be released as soon as Assam calls off the economic blockade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stones-thrown-at-assam-cong-team-near-border/article33054715.ece

09 November 2020||Mumbai,||Wife of film producer Firoz Nadiadwala arrested by NCB||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday arrested Bollywood producer Firoz Nadiadwala’s wife after ganja was found at their residence in Juhu, officials said. NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede told PTI that Mr. Nadiadwala was summoned by the anti-drugs agency earlier in the day, but he failed to appear. “We have arrested Mr. Nadiadwala’s wife under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

09 November 2020||Hassan,||Siddaramaiah again predicts leadership change in BJP, but after Bihar poll results||Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has reiterated that there will be a change in leadership in the State government. However, this time he said the change would be effected after the Bihar election results. Speaking to presspersons during his visit to Shivamogga on Sunday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he had information that two or three factions within the BJP had been making efforts to bring about a change in leadership for the past six months. The allegations of corruption against the BJP government could be one of the reasons behind this, he said. To a query, he said he was confident of the Congress winning Sira and R.R. Nagar seats. “I have travelled to both constituencies. The people are in favour of the Congress,” he said. On the issue of bringing about a law to stop religious conversions, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the choice of religion was the right of every individual. “Others have no right to interfere,” he said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa again expressed confidence that the BJP would win in both Sira and R.R. Nagar. “The results of the byelections will show that people are with the BJP, despite criticism from the Opposition parties,” he said. He claimed that the BJP would win the Sira seat by a margin of 25,000 votes and the R.R. Nagar one by a margin of over 40,000 votes. Relief after decades Furthermore, the Chief Minister said he had instructed officials to provide relief to the people displaced because of the Sharavathi Valley project, implemented in the 1950s. “For many years, the affected people have been waiting for proper relief. A meeting with officers and elected representatives was held in Bengaluru. I have told the officers to provide relief to the affected people soon,” he said.  Two or three factions within the BJP have been making efforts to bring about a change in leadership for the past six months.SiddaramaiahFormer Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/siddaramaiah-again-predicts-leadership-change-in-bjp-but-after-bihar-poll-results/article33054681.ece

Surendran has accused the Assembly of overreaching its authority to summon officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and questioning the investigation carried out by the agency. Talking to mediapersons at Aranmula on Sunday, Mr. Surendran accused Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan of misusing the Assembly to protect smugglers. “The Speaker used to have a very close relationship with Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, and details of their phone conversations are out in the public domain. His attempt to misuse the Assembly for vested interests will only weaken democracy,” Mr. Surendran said. He launched a scathing attack on the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leaders for defending Manjeswaram MLA M.C. Kamaruddin in the Fashion Gold Jewellery investment scam and called for the legislator’s immediate resignation. “Mr. Kamaruddin had earned several crores of rupees through fraud and purchased assets using this money through benami transactions. Although delayed, his arrest was prompted by strong opposition from the public as well as the rank and file of the IUML,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-alleges-authority-overreach-by-assembly/article33054684.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Poor maintenance taking sheen off pedestrian plaza||Next Saturday, which happens to be Deepavali Day, the Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza will celebrate its first anniversary. The transformation of the market place which had an assortment of shops, some of them spilling on to the road, with a sliver of footpath that was used up by vehicles, was magnificent. People made trips to make sure that the impossibly crowded stretch had indeed become orderly and fanciful. Pondy Bazaar had been converted into an upmarket walkway with colourful lights and a pleasant location to spend time. But all good things must come to an end. In several places along the plaza, stone slabs have come undone. Walkers point out that the maintenance could have been better. A walker, who owns a shop on Venkatnarayana Road, said the officials could provide contact details of the project managers to register their complaints. “Now, we don’t know to whom we should complain,” he said. Work revived After the COVID-19 induced lockdowns were lifted, workers set about completing the improvement work in the neighbouring arterial stretches such as G.N. Chetty Road, Venkatanarayana Road, besides a few interior streets. The work was slow but steady. Once the bollards were in place, motorists did not ride on the pavement. But the burden was shifted to smaller interior streets, it turned out. The renovation work had been on for over three months on these streets and is far from complete. With no dedicated car parking facility, the new pavements on Sivagnanam Street, Raja Street and Prakasam Street had turned parking lots and pedestrians were forced to walk on the road. Construction debris and material are languishing in many places, even within the pedestrian plaza stretch. The multi-level car parking facility that was planned in the middle of the stretch was supposed to solve the parking issue. But it is yet to be inaugurated, though civil work is reportedly nearly complete. “They have not completed the work. There is a gaping hole near the junction of Venkatnarayana Road and Sivagnanam Road for laying cables. The hole is filled with debris and garbage,” said a resident of Venkatnarayana Road. “I used to drive down the stretch between Sivagnanam Road and Thanikachalam Road since Theagaraya Road became a one-way. But now I cannot drive as people park cars on both sides of the road,” he said. Footpath construction Footpaths on Gopalakrishna Road and Muthukrishnan Street on the northern side of Theagaraya Road are being renovated. A resident of Gopalakrishna Road said: “They have been laying the footpath for the last three months. The whole road is a mess. Already, cars are parked on the footpath. We were better off before they started the work. There appears to be no urgency to complete the work either,” he said. As a regular walker on the pedestrian plaza, he said he had noticed an increase in the number of people asking for alms. Prakash Galada, another long-time resident of T. Nagar who uses the plaza regularly, said transgenders were harassing the public demanding money. Officials said the plaza was a success story that would be emulated elsewhere in the city. Greater Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) Meghanatha Reddy said the pedestrian plaza had inspired a series of such interventions in various parts of the city. More plans afoot “We will start work on 30 km of similar projects under Chennai City Partnership. T. Nagar's Pedestrian Plaza is the trigger. But the challenge is to maintain it well. We are collecting fines from people who litter the place. Work on roads such as Usman Road, G.N. Chetty Road, Burkit Road, and Venkatnarayana Road will be completed shortly. The multi-level car parking facility on Thanikachalam Road will be completed in December. More than 270 cars will get parking space after inauguration. More on-street parking will ease congestion,” Mr. Reddy added.  We will start work on 30 km of similar projects under Chennai City Partnership Meghanatha Reddy Deputy Commissioner (Works), Greater Chennai Corporation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-maintenance-taking-sheen-off-pedestrian-plaza/article33055201.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 6,000 retired transport employees await benefits||As many as 6,221 retired employees of the eight State Transport Undertakings (STUs) are awaiting settlement of terminal benefits since May 2019, according to trade unions. The lockdown, which brought bus operations to a grinding halt in the State, and the limited operations thereafter, did not just lead to a drastic fall in revenues, but dampened the hopes of retired staff and kin of those who died in service (after April last year) of getting provident fund, gratuity and commutation and leave encashment. According to trade unions, non-settlement of retirement benefits has remained an issue in the transport sector since 2013. However, the dues were settled by the State government, intermittently, following protests by employees’ unions. Besides operating losses, union leaders say the reason why terminal benefits are not disbursed to retiring staff is because the PF deducted from salaries is not credited to STU’s PF trust. The number of retired staff who died or fell sick rose during the pandemic. “This is a service sector, where the motto is to serve and not make profits. While other departments also provide services at subsidised rates, the State allocates sufficient funds to compensate the losses. We are operating at a loss of Rs. 12 per km — accumulating to Rs. 12 crore a day — but there is no budgetary allocation to compensate this loss,” said K. Arumuga Nainar, State office-bearer of the Centre of Indian Trade Union. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporations also operate buses to the rural pockets, benefiting farmers, students and daily wagers. According to S. Sampath, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Government Transport Corporation Staff Federation, there were no retirements after May, since the State increased the retirement age from 58 to 59. Though the Transport Department was better placed to settle terminal benefits, the pandemic came as a blow to bus operation and revenue generation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-6000-retired-transport-employees-await-benefits/article33055210.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Former IAS officer to join Congress today||Former IAS officer S. Sasikanth Senthil, who quit the civil services last year, will join the Congress party on Monday. Mr. Senthil, who was at the forefront of the anti-CAA-NRC protests, said the time had come for people in India, including political parties, to put aside their minor differences and fight for the larger cause of protecting democracy and fight the majoritarian spirit that was already dividing people. “I came out of the service (IAS) seeing the fascist attack on the entire country and on its basic tenets. I am on a quest to fight against this. After all my experience on the ground, I can say that the forces standing for love and brotherhood must unite. They can be individuals, NGOs or political parties — they all have to unite and that unity can be brought in by people like me who have worked everywhere,” Mr. Senthil told The Hindu . He said it was time that a political solution was found against majoritarianism, in the interest of everybody. “Even among political parties, small differences have to be put aside,” he added. The 2009-batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer, who resigned from service when he was the deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, said he was joining the Congress as the party understood the challenges of the 21st century and stood for the founding ideologies of the Constitution of India. His decision to join Congress follows interactions with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi thinks about issues from the lens of the people of the country,” he said. “The time has come for people to unify. This is not the time to harp on differences. We have new challenges and we need to find new solutions. The Congress understands these challenges and is ready for them,” he said. In a letter posted on his Twitter account, Mr. Senthil said the country had come a long way since he resigned in September 2019, protesting against the totalitarian attack on the country. “Many of those who were complacent and surprised at the time have now started understanding that India is under the attack of an anti-democratic, anti-pluralistic system in power,” he said. He said during the last one year, he had the opportunity to travel to many places, participate in various protests and interact with young and courageous students. “I was able to contribute my bit to the great anti-NRC/CAA movement, which proved to me that people in this country are ready to stand for one another,” he said in the letter. Mr. Senthil said he would campaign for the Secular Progressive Alliance and for progressive candidates in Tamil Nadu during the upcoming Assembly election. “Tamil Nadu is the final frontier of these divisive forces and I have a responsibility to help in the fight against this. I strongly believe that the people of the State have always believed in social equity,” Mr. Senthil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-ias-officer-to-join-congress-today/article33054803.ece

09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Now, a foldable, portable shelter||The CSIR-Structural Engineering Research Centre (CSIR-SERC) has designed a portable, foldable temporary shelter with a roof, doors, windows and lighting using steel and insulation material. The shelter with 180 sq ft floor space can be used at construction sites, remote areas or to create makeshift hospitals. The special and multifunctional structural laboratory of the CSIR-SERC in Chennai has designed this 2.8-metre tall module that can be folded into just one-foot making it easy to transport. “It has tubelights inside and can be folded with the lights. There are fixtures for fans,” said Saptarshi Sasmal, senior principal scientist, who led the team in designing the module. One module weighed about a tonne and can be made lighter if the roof is removed, provided it is to be used indoors. The fully folded modules can be taken to the site and erected after levelling the site and each module can be installed within 30 minutes. The CSIR-SERC recently signed an agreement for licensing of technology of the portable lightweight module, called PoliTal-M, with Larsen & Toubro Ltd. The agreement was signed in the presence of Shekhar C. Mande, Director General, CSIR, Santosh Kapuria, Director, CSIR-SERC, and M.V. Satish, Whole-time Director and Senior Executive Vice-President, L&T. Sources in CSIR-SERC said that this technology was available for licensing to other industries as well and that the institute was committed to promote this technology for its wider use and reach. L&T sources said the idea was to utilise it at construction sites or at sites like those affected by the calamities where construction might not be possible within a short time. “The immediate idea is to utilise these shelters in setting up of COVID-19 facilities,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-a-foldable-portable-shelter/article33055214.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veeramamunivar’s Thevaram for Christians||Veeramamunivar, the Jesuit priest, is known in the Tamil literary world for his epic Thembavani . However, few are aware that the Christian missionary also wrote minor literary works including a Thevaram , on the lines of hymns sung by Saivaite saints. “A few know about his achievements in other genres of Tamil poetry because they deal with religious and more specifically Christian themes. Moreover, these works are confined to the Christian hymns,” said retired English professor M. Dominic Raj, who had translated Thembavani into English.   Veermamunivar, whose 140 birth anniversary falls on November 8, was attracted by the Bakthi movement that flourished in Tamil Nadu and the singing of the hymns of the Nayanmars and Azhwars , and composed a Thevaram . 25 editions “There are only 12 pathikams (stanzas). They are being preserved till now only because it finds a place as the last hymn of the most used prayerbook of the Catholics, namely, Thirukkutumba Bakhthi Malai ,” said Mr. Dominic Raj. The book is found in the house of almost every Catholic family. It has been sold by Nobili Book Store, Madurai, for nearly a hundred years taking it to 35 editions till 2018, he said. “The hymn deals with the merciful and loving nature of the God who provides everything for mankind, and yet there exists the pitiable situation in which people do not adore Him. Each verse ends with the words: paniyavarenno karunambaram (what kind of sad state is this in which Your feet are not worshipped? Divine Mercy!),” explained Mr. Dominic Raj, who has translated the stanzas. His another work is Annai Azhungal Anthathi , a poetic form in which the last word of a stanza becomes the first word of the next stanza. This poem has been written in the pulambal or oppari — a genre dealing with the ‘Lamentation of Mary’ after the death of her Divine Son. Yet another work Thirukkavalur Kalampakam was composed in various metrical formats like venpa, akaval , and kalippa as an ‘Ode to Mary’ (as the Refuge of sinners). It is in praise of Adaikkala Madha, the deity of the Church at Thirkkavalur, built by Veeramanmuivar, whose original name was Constantine Joseph Beschi.Another work is Kitheri Ammal Ammanai . This poem has been composed in the genre of the Ammanai — sung as a song by girls playing with balls thrown at one another.  A few know about his achievements in other genres of Tamil poetry because they deal with religious and more specifically Christian themes. Moreover these works are confined to the Christian hymns M.

09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. finances on recovery path||The Tamil Nadu government’s finances, especially the collections through the State Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), appear to be on the path of recovery, if the pattern of revenue generation in the last two months is any indication. The collections through the SOTR, constituting around 60% of the overall revenue receipts, turned positive in September and October. The rate of growth was around 7% in September; the figure for October, too, was in the positive, though it has not yet been finalised, says a senior official. In July too, the SOTR growth rate was around 6%, but the revenue included the settlement by the Centre of the arrears due for March and the subsequent months. The State’s finances had taken a blow after the lockdown was imposed soon after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in late March. This was illustrated by the growth of the SOTR collections. In April, the growth rate was -76% compared with the corresponding month in 2019; in May, -60% and in June, -18%. In August too, the rate was in the negative with about -21%. The growth rate for the first half of 2020-21 (April to September) over the corresponding period of 2019 was -26.71% When the pandemic started, the government expected that the SOTR at the end of the current financial year would be short by around Rs. 35,000 crore, which would have been 25% of the originally estimated figure of collections. But the developments in the recent months have given room for hope that the fall will be around 15%, the official points out. Apart from the indications of recovery, the saving grace in the first half of the current year was that the State received around Rs. 3,000 crore more from the Centre under the component of ‘grants in aid’ than what it got in the same period of 2019. The present calculations of revenue collections may have to be revised in the event of another wave of infections, the official cautions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-finances-on-recovery-path/article33054801.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Court raps HR&CE Dept. for failing to protect temple land||The Madras High Court criticised the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department for having failed to protect temple properties which were either encroached by private individuals or used by the government for other official purposes. Justice R. Mahadevan said, “Such callous attitude on their part cannot be countenanced.” He made the observation on Wednesday after ruling against the government’s move to construct a Regional Transport Office on lands in possession of Kottai Mariamman temple in Omalur taluk of Salem district for more than 80 years. Passing common orders on a batch of cases, the judge also ruled against the move by the Fisheries Department to construct a modern fish market and fish eatery on lands in possession of Sakthi Muthamman temple at Neelankarai near Chennai for more than 70 years. The judge ordered that the temple lands should be protected and not alienated at all. “This court has time and again observed that temples in Tamil Nadu are not only a source of identification of the ancient culture but also a testimony of pride and knowledge of the talent in the field of arts, science and sculpture and a conduit for spiritual activities as well,” he said. “The properties of the religious institutions, more particularly the temples, have to be maintained properly in order to derive more income to spend for their betterment,” the judge said. He agreed with the petitioner’s counsel V.B.R. Menon, T. Kokilavane and B. Harikrishnan that the government had taken away the temple lands without HR&CE Department’s consent. Justice Mahadevan recalled that the Supreme Court in A.A.Gopalakrishnan Vs Cochin Devaswom Board (2007) had impressed upon the need for the government, members or trustees of boards/trusts, and devotees to be vigilant and prevent usurpation or encroachment of properties belonging to religious institutions. The apex court had also observed that courts were duty bound to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-raps-hrce-dept-for-failing-to-protect-temple-land/article33055209.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai-based group launches job portal for LGBTQ, veterans, disabled||Chennai-based Avtar Group has come up with an exclusive job portal for women, people from the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, millennials and veterans. Called ‘myAvtar.com’, the portal currently features more than 500 job opportunities from sectors such as information technology, manufacturing, healthcare, fintech and logistics among others. “Diversity hiring is increasing at most firms — there has been a 33% increase. And a lot of organisations are keen on hiring people from the LGBTQ community. This portal will help employers find the right candidates especially from under-represented communities who have immense potential,” Saundarya Rajesh, Founder-President, Avtar Group, told The Hindu . According to a report titled “2020 Working Mother and Avtar Best Companies for Women in India,” 39% of all positions closed in 2020 at 100 best companies were diversity positions. “This is a re-affirmation that best companies are pro-actively seeking out diversity in talent, including women on breaks,” Ms. Rajesh said. Diversity hiring is most prevalent in the consulting sector where almost 44% of all hires are diversity hires, followed by the IT/ITES Sector with 39% and the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector which hires 36%. The percentage of diversity hires is going up in industries such as manufacturing and pharma. In manufacturing, 29% of hires are diversity hires and in pharma, it is 18%. The portal will help women find work-from-home jobs. It will give special focus to veterans — the talent pool of ex-personnel from India’s armed forces. “For the valour, grit, resilience, focus and leadership qualities of this talent pool, we observe an increasing intent among companies to engage with this talent pool. At present, there is no portal catering to this segment of people,” said Ms. Rajesh. “This portal will focus on such women. There is an estimated size of 70 lakh women who are on breaks as per data available with us,” she added.

09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC to hear plea to disqualify Thirumavalavan today||A public interest litigation petition seeking initiation of disqualification proceedings against Chidambaram Member of Parliament Thol Thirumavalavan, for his speech on ancient scripture Manusmriti, has been listed for hearing before the Madras High Court on Monday. The case has been listed for admission before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha. S. Kasiramalingam, a 69-year-old advocate from Saligramam here, had filed the PIL petition through his counsel R.C. Paul Kanagaraj. According to the petitioner, the MP had addressed a webinar on Periyar and Indian politics in September this year. The webinar was organised by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades Federation. It was aimed at worldwide audience and the excerpts were also shared on social media. Wrong interpretation In his address, the MP had “misinterpreted" the ancient Hindu scripture Manusmriti and claimed that it objectifies all women as objects of sex and that their status was less than that of a man. Stating that the MP was not a scholar in Sanskrit, the petitioner said he ought not to have made such an interpretation. The litigant claimed that the MP’s speech had created unrest and led to “disgust and provocation among various sections of people”. He said the MP did not stop with making the speech but also went on to hold State-wide protests demanding a ban on Manusmriti which was penned over 2,200 years ago. The litigant also accused the MP of having done so with the intention of defaming Hindus, creating social unrest and destabilising the integrity of the nation for his own political gains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-to-hear-plea-to-disqualify-thirumavalavan-today/article33054794.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro invites bids for underground stations||By this time next year, the city may be witnessing the construction of many underground stations for Chennai Metro Rail’s phase II project. Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has invited bids to initiate the construction of 29 underground stations on the 26.7-km Mahavaram-Taramani stretch. Instead of floating a single tender for the work, the officials said it had been divided into five sections — Madhavaram to Perambur, Ayanavaram to Kellys, KMC to Royapettah, Radhakrishnan Salai to Adyar junction and Adyar Depot to Taramani Link Road. Officials said one of the reasons for splitting the work into five tenders was to ensure that they did not depend on a single contractor. “In case a contractor fails to meet deadlines and the pace of work is slow, the whole stretch should not get affected. Hence, we decided to float five package tenders. That way, the work in one stretch doesn’t have a bearing on the others,” an official said. The tenders may be finalised in seven or eight months and then chosen firms would be awarded the contracts. CMRL has floated tenders for the tunnelling work along the stretch and is in the process of choosing a contractor. This work is only a part of the 118.9-km phase II project that comprises three corridors — Madhavaram to Sholinganallur, Madhavaram to SIPCOT and Light House to Poonamallee. The building of these 29 stations falls under the Madhavaram to SIPCOT stretch. CMRL has been preparing to simultaneously start construction in some sections of the project as well and float tenders one after another, sources said. Meanwhile, land acquisition from government and private landowners had been on for over a year now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-invites-bids-for-underground-stations/article33055197.ece

On Saturday, many areas in and around Chennai experienced intermittent showers throughout the day. While this helped bring down the day temperature at Nungambakkam to close to the normal of 30.1 degrees Celsius, the weather station received only a trace of rainfall till 5.30 p.m. But Meenambakkam recorded nearly 2.3 cm. The presence of light to moderate northeasterlies and easterlies over the lower atmospheric level influenced the spell of rain over the region. However, thunderstorms will be restricted to a few places in the State and Puducherry after Monday. Tamil Nadu has received an average of 13.2 cm of rainfall, 43% less than its seasonal normal, since October 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-likely-in-southern-districts-today/article33054974.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘COVID-19 has transformed healthcare provision forever’||The COVID-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on several new areas in Tamil Nadu. From learning to deal with the unknown to investing in facilities and taking steps to curb the infection and maintaining the mental well-being of the infected persons, healthcare providers are learning to stay ahead in the game. On Sunday, three experts — Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, Girdhar J. Gyani, director-general of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India, and Preetha Reddy, vice-chairperson, Apollo Hospitals — spoke about their experience during the crisis. They were participating in the first of a series of conversations hosted by The Hindu . Sunday’s discussion focussed on the theme of evolving patient-centric healthcare systems post-COVID. “We have faced challenges such as swine flu, dengue, ebola, nipah and zika,” said Dr. Radhakrishnan, in the webinar titled ‘Putting the patient back at the centre of health care systems’. Yet, none of those challenges had been as intense as the SARS-CoV-2 infection that resulted in the government increasing testing facilities, bed strength, oxygen supplies and ventilators. In seven months, the State ramped up its facilities from just one testing centre and 20 beds to round-the-clock testing, 203 laboratories and 1.4 lakh beds, Dr. Radhakrishnan said. The pandemic presented challenges unlike others — people not only needed clinical care but also psychosocial support. “People felt quarantined from society,” he said, and this propelled the government to introduce a support system for those undergoing treatment for the infection at hospitals or care centres. Credit to govt. Ms. Reddy said the State government had shown the way in treatment. So much so that she had sent clinicians to the government’s dedicated COVID care hospital “to learn from them”. Healthcare providers had to deal with the fear of the unknown. This meant that not only patients but also healthcare professionals and front-line health workers needed hand-holding. The pandemic had shown that hospitals had to be more responsible. “If mortality has come down, it is only because of collaboration. We have come a long way from being afraid,” she surmised. Only an empowered patient, one who has the knowledge of the treatment process, would facilitate a patient-centric treatment, said Dr. Gyani, who called for transparency in treatment cost and provision of information to all patients. The government should bill all patients, even those covered under the State health insurance schemes. This would inform patients of the concern the State has for its citizens. The government should also bring in an independent regulator to assess healthcare facilities. This would help to make informed choices when it came to treatment, Dr. Gyani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-has-transformed-healthcare-provision-forever/article33054791.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Industries violated air pollution norms: study||A study by the Chennai Climate Action Group of six large and red-category polluting industries in the Manali and Ennore regions has revealed that none of them complied with air pollution norms. These major polluters violated the prescribed norms for 59% of the year, said the report that analysed stack emission data for 2019, obtained from the Care Centre of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). The report said the thermal power plant cluster in Ennore operated in violation of the air pollution norms for 49% of the year and the petrochemical cluster in Manali 26% of the year. Tangedco’s NCTPS Stage-I operated in violation of the air pollution norms for 58% of the year; NTECL, Vallur, 41% of the year; Madras Fertilizers Limited 77% of the year; Manali Petrochemicals Ltd. 9% of the year; the Tamilnadu Petroproducts Ltd. 24% of the year, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited 65% of the year, the report stated. Nithyanand Jayaraman, one of the authors of the report, “Poison in the Air: The Regulatory Black Hole Over Ennore Manali Industrial Zone,” said the issue should be looked at from a health perspective, and before more planned activities were permitted, the pollution load had to be brought down. “We need a network of real-time pollution monitors that would help issue health advisories and provide better data to the government,” he said. In the report, Sharadha Narayanan, Kanishk Gokul and Karthik Gunasekar have urged the government to act against industries for having violated the norms. They have urged the government to put in place a time-bound plan to make industries compliant and shut down repeat offenders. K. Karthikeyan, former member secretary, TNPCB, said the issue of ambient air quality had to be addressed since aerosols trapped viruses. A coal-based thermal power plant in the State had addressed the issue of sulphur through desulphurisation and others must follow suit, he said.  The issue should be looked at from a health perspective, and before more planned activities are permitted, the pollution load has to be brought down Nithyanand Jayaraman An authors of the report||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-violated-air-pollution-norms-study/article33055205.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GCC to facilitate loans for street vendors||The Greater Chennai Corporation has started work on facilitating bank loans for businesses run by street vendors to protect their livelihood after the relaxation of lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Deputy Commissioner of the Corporation Meghanatha Reddy said the civic body had started uploading applications for bank loans. “The banks have to give loans for all street vendors who have applied for loans. The Corporation has uploaded applications for more than 7,000 street vendors in the city,” he said. According to estimates, more than 25% of street vendors had left the city for rural areas during the pandemic. Of the 23,000 street vendors in the 15 zones of the city, around 17,000 street vendors had been traced by the civic officials. However, the civic body has estimated that more than 10,000 street vendors were yet to start business after the relaxation of the lockdown norms. The Union government had written to the Corporation to facilitate disbursement of bank loans for street vendors. Initially, the street vendors will get Rs. 10,000 as loan. They are expected to get additional funds later. Civic officials will hold meetings with bank officials to facilitate disbursement of the loan shortly. Meanwhile, the Corporation will identify 50 street vendors to supply food to residents through the online platform Swiggy. The Centre had already identified Swiggy for street food supply in the country. “We will conduct a meeting next week. There are 3,000 food business operators among street vendors in the city. We will select 50 vendors to onboard them,” said Mr. Meghanatha Reddy. The vendors would be selected based on their track record. Public health officials and food safety officials will guide the street vendors before the launch. The number of street vendors onboard the system will be increased later. The street food offered via Swiggy will include all varieties that showcase the city’s uniqueness, an official said. The Corporation officials will also take steps to support street vendors to improve the quality of the food, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-corpn-to-facilitate-loans-for-street-vendors/article33054788.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Radiology holds key in tackling the pandemic||The Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital celebrated a rare achievement on Sunday, the International Day of Radiology (IDoR). It has performed over 17,000 CT scans and 16,000 X-ray scans on persons with COVID-19. The IDoR, first introduced in 2012, is celebrated on November 8 and coincides with the anniversary of the discovery of X-rays. The theme for the current year is ‘Radiologists and radiographers supporting patients during COVID-19’. Dean R. Jayanthi said the government installed an exclusive CT scanner for the post-COVID care centre within a fortnight. “Ever since this hospital was declared an exclusive COVID care hospital for the State, we have in place stringent measures to prevent infection to staff and doctors and to mitigate cross-infection among patients. We strictly follow zero-contact techniques,” she said. “Radiology has assumed enormous significance in diagnosis and prognostication in the present pandemic. Though the simplest and most basic modality X-rays have been largely useful, chest X-ray can pick up only gross lesions and may not be useful in detecting early and mild infection,” said B. Suhasini, head of the radiology department. On the other hand, the CT scan is useful in early diagnosis and disease stratification as mild, moderate and severe, thereby determining the prognosis. Widespread use of CT scan during the pandemic has led to the introduction of Covid Reporting And Data Systems (CORADS), similar to BIRADS, a scoring tool for breast lumps, she said. The CT severity score is given on a scale of 25 to 40, based on an analysis of the extent of involvement of the lungs. At the hospital, while 12,770 scans showed less than 25% lung involvement, in 1,709 scans it was 75%-100%. The wide use of the CT scan has given rise to new terms such as ground glass opacities, crazy paving, halo and reversed halo signs and tree-in bud appearances to describe CT patterns, Dr. Suhasini said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/radiology-holds-key-in-tackling-the-pandemic/article33055191.ece
09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Indane unveils new number for cylinder booking||Further simplifying booking of refills of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders, Indane has introduced a missed call service. Consumers can dial 8454955555 from their registered mobile number (RMN) to book a refill cylinder and they will get a confirmatory text message. “If it is not from their RMN, they will get a message saying the booking could not be made. This new system is under trial and yet to be formally launched,” said an official of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., whose LPG brand is Indane. The company that has around 1.20 crore active LPG consumers in the State, recently launched a new IVRS system for booking refills. It has teething problems since it does not recognise alternative numbers. The earlier system allowed around five registered numbers to make bookings. “When they dial the IVRS number, the preferred language still remains Hindi for many consumers. Many did not get the payment link and had to pay cash. People are not getting confirmatory text messages. Customers are impatient and yelling at staff if they don't get text messages,” said a distributor. With Deepavali a few days away, the public sector oil majors Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, have asked distributors to ensure supplies reach consumers. “They worked on Sundays too this month. During the lockdown due to government restrictions, they could not do so,” said an industry source. Usually, there is a 10% spike in bookings in the run up to the festival and industry insiders said that this year too the bookings were heavy for 10 days now. Commercial cylinder sales too were witnessing an increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/indane-unveils-new-number-for-cylinder-booking/article33054821.ece

09 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schedule disrupted||The best laid plans came undone when the COVID-19 forced people to stay indoors, say officials involved in improving the T. Nagar neighbourhood. “We had planned to roll out the on-street and off-street parking management across the neighbourhood soon after the inauguration of the plaza. But then the COVID-19 crisis hit Chennai and it took a toll on the plan to upgrade the streets around T. Nagar,” said Aswathy Dilip, senior programme manager, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, India Programme. “The Pedestrian Plaza is one of the few truly public spaces for citizens to step out. It is a place where the elderly citizens, young families and women can use as a social space,” she pointed out. “The enforcement of parking management is critical for liveable neighbourhoods across busy spaces such as T. Nagar. In this regard, discussions are being organised with other departments such as traffic police to support the same,” she added. The bicycle sharing system had been put on hold due to the lockdown. Once safe intersections on arterial streets and traffic calming measures were implemented in the neighbourhood cyclists’ safety would also improve, Ms. Aswathy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schedule-disrupted/article33055202.ece

Ramadoss on Sunday said that Perarivalan, a convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, should be released immediately on health grounds as he has already spent 30 years in jail. In a statement, the PMK leader said the health of Perarivalan and his father had deteriorated and he should be released immediately. “Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had promised Arputhammal that her son would return home. The present government has a responsibility to ensure it,” he said. “Perarivalan, who has been released on parole, was advised by a private hospital in Villupuram that he needs further treatment and therefore has to be hospitalised. His father has issues in his spinal cord and he is unable to sit or stand without any help. His mother Arputhammal has spent all her life to bring back her son from jail and he is her only medicine at this age,” he said. ‘Agony of family’ Dr. Ramadoss said Perarivalan’s release had been expected for the last six-and-a-half years without any result and it had only added to the mental stress and agony of the family. While Jayalalithaa announced that all seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case would be released in 2014, the Central government had placed several obstacles. “The legal protest by Perarivalan who went to the Supreme Court resulted in the court saying that there was no issue with the State government releasing them using powers vested in it by Article 161,” Dr. Ramadoss added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/release-perarivalan-on-health-grounds-ramadoss/article33055207.ece

It has ruled that since the project has been promoted on a ‘no profit, no loss’ basis, the association has no right to retain any flats for their use for any purpose without collecting any sales consideration and any surplus in the project should be credited to the Association of allottees. Twelve allottees from the project named SBIOA Unity Enclave, Medavakkam Road, Mambakkam, had moved the authority stating that the possession of the apartment was handed over to them in an incomplete state. The club house and commercial complex had not been completed and a permanent electricity connection had not been obtained even though the construction began in 2014. The TNRERA noted that the real estate project had not been completed as on May 2017 and it is an ongoing project which should be registered under the Act. It also said the allottees were free to move the Adjudicating Officer of the TNRERA seeking compensation for the delay. The Authority directed SBIOACC to complete all the common amenities in all respects and hand it over to the allottees before December 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnrera-directs-sbioacc-to-register-its-housing-project-under-the-rera-act/article33055208.ece

Therefore, the public should remain safe, vigilant and follow safety guideline, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam told newsmen after holding a review meeting at the Collectorate on Sunday. The everyday COVID-19 positive count that was around 500 in October had now come down to 200 – 220. But it was not the time to let down the guard. Officials should increase vigil, educate shopkeepers and salespersons on COVID-19 safety guideline and also ensure that it was followed in the shops. Use of mask helped reduce the infection spread by 40%. Officials should ensure that the members of the public wore mask.

09 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Virudhunagar-Kanniyakumari highway in a bad shape||National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that has collected around Rs. 822 crore till August 2020 by way of toll on Virudhunagar - Kanniyakumari section since May 2011 has not relayed the road for nine years.The stretch of this road is part of the four-way highway on Kanniyakumari - Chennai / Bengaluru section. After Madurai Bench of Madras High Court intervened and imposed a cut on toll collection at Kappalur toll gate following complaints of poor quality of road, the NHAI had relayed the highway for 50 km between Madurai and Virudhunagar in 2018. Still, NHAI has not given a clear reply as to when the 180 km stretch of highway between Virudhunagar and Kanniyakumari would be re-laid. In a reply to a Right to Information Act application sought by social activist R. Pandiaraja of Tenkasi on various details about the Madurai-Kanniyakumari highway, the NHAI has said that the maintenance of the highway was being done by M/s. CDR and Co. “Overlaying of the road has been included under the scope of toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model is all the NHAI reply says to a question on plan to relay the road,” said Mr. Pandiaraja. Similarly, the NHAI official has not disclosed the details of how frequently these four lane roads need to re-laid. Toll fee on all the four plazas located at Kappalur (Madurai), Etturvattam (Sattur), Salaipudur (Kayathar) and Nanguneri (Tirunelveli) has been revised every year on April 1 from the date of commencement of the toll collection. “Though NHAI Project Director V. Saravanan has said that there was no immediate plan to stop collection of the toll fee on these stretches of the road, he has not revealed the plan to re-lay the road that is in a poor condition,” Mr. Pandiaraja said. The end date for toll collection has not been decided as it depended on capital cost, expenditure incurred during operation and maintenance and others, the RTI reply has said. However, as part of maintenance, no road relaying has been taken up till date which has led to lot of wear and tear in the last nine years. “The road has lot of potholes leading to frequent accidents,” Mr. Pandiaraja said. Stating that though vehicle users were paying toll over and above the road tax paid while buying the vehicles, the NHAI was neglecting maintenance of this important road that connects Chennai and Bengaluru with southern districts, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/virudhunagar-kanniyakumari-highway-in-a-bad-shape/article33054809.ece

09 November 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Shoppers throw COVID-19 cautions to the wind||With less than a week left for Deepavali, shoppers thronged South Masi Street and Vilakkuthoon region on Sunday, with a total disregard for COVID-19 safety precautions. But, despite the huge crowds, there is about 30% dip in sales this year, mainly owing to financial distress caused by COVID-19 induced lockdown, say traders. Sunday being a holiday, there were big crowds inside big textile outlets across the city. The huge number of hawkers on the roadside in the core city area also did a good business with the bargain hunters. G. Periya Muniraj, a hawker on Netaji Road selling mats who was earlier working as an operator in a cinema house, says financial distress caused by the pandemic pushed him into selling mats ahead of Deepavali. “During the initial days of the pandemic, many people who lost their jobs started selling vegetables and essential commodities. Now they sell garments to make some good money before Deepavali,” he says. But the sales volume is low this year, says G. Mohan, a street vendor. “Most people have not received their Deepavali bonus or have received only half of their salaries. Hence, they cannot splurge on Deepavali shopping,” he says. Ashraf Tayub, secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association, says there is a major dip in the number of people who used to buy Deepavali clothes for their workers. “But, on the brighter side, the sales have picked up on Sunday,” he says. “But the traders, anyway, anticipated 50% fall in sales. Since the wedding season coincided with Deepavali festival, sales is marginally better,” says Mr. Tayub. There was a mild drizzle for some time on Sunday afternoon, causing concern for the hawkers. “We pray for clear skies in the next few days as a downpour will severely affect our business,” says Dinesh Kumar, a street vendor who has come all the way from from Uttar Pradesh to sell garments ahead of Deepavali. COVID-19 safety precautions went for a toss across the city. Many people did not wear face mask, and there was a total disregard for personal distancing norms. A police personnel on Netaji Road says people do not care to follow safety precautions despite repeated instructions over the public address systems. “Many think they will no longer contract COVID-19 infection,” he says. Mr. Mohan says though the government has issued standard operating procedures for commercial establishments, there is no mechanism to check whether they were followed. Nitesh Kothari, a trader, says commercial establishments have bought hand sanitisers and the premises are regularly disinfected. “But the shopkeepers are not insisting the customers to follow the precautions as they fear that it might affect the sales,” he says. Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says fine is slapped on those not wearing face masks in public places and against commercial establishments that violate norms. “It is a challenging situation as thousands of people do Deepavali shopping. We have instructed the officials to be vigilant,” he says.

Puducherry has accounted for 82% of the 601 deaths in the U.T. and 81% of the cumulative COVID-19 case load with a tally of 29,239 cases against the aggregate of 35,838 cases. As of Sunday, the Union Territory had 258 patients in institutional care and 514 patients in home isolation. Small pockets While the numbers have been coming down in the region as a whole, some areas have been reporting relatively higher numbers. Among these areas are Reddiarpalayam, Sultanpet and Villianur. “Thankfully, the spread is not rampant and volumes not abnormally high to qualify these areas as clusters. We have sent in mobile testing teams apart from deploying a two-pronged approach of strengthening information, education and communication campaigns and enforcement of safety norms,” T. Arun, Health Secretary, said. In Sultanpet, for instance, seven of the eight new cases that were reported in a 24-hour span, were traced to a nearby shopping locations. Following this, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi had recently instructed the District Collector to instruct traders to comply with safety protocols. According to the official, ramping up testing has been critical in controlling the pandemic and reducing deaths through early hospitalisation of symptomatic patients. “We have been able to do this by taking testing closer to the location of the residents by forming mobile teams. The completion of over 3 lakh tests roughly translates to having at least one member of every family undergo a test,” Mr. Arun said. Stopped referrals At this stage of the pandemic curve, Puducherry has stopped referrals to the additionally inducted COVID-19 hospitals, including the Government Dental College and the six private medical colleges. “Currently, about 90% of oxygen beds and 95% of regular beds at the two COVID-19-designated hospitals are free,” the Health Secretary said. Officials are keeping their fingers crossed though with the Deepawali festival looming near. The festival, which is exuberantly celebrated in these parts, will be a marker of how the public has assimilated the safety messaging, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/localised-measures-help-limit-covid-19-spread-in-puducherry/article33054972.ece

09 November 2020||RAMESWARAM,TAMIL NADU||Sri Lankan courts’ order on boats shocks fishermen||The directive from the Sri Lankan courts that 121 mechanised boats, which were seized from Indian fishermen, shall either be destroyed or sold through public auction has come as a big blow to the fishermen here. Speaking to The Hindu about the development here on Sunday, fishermen association leader Sesu Raja said the Central government should take steps to bring the boats back to the Indian shores as they were still worth several crores. He said that over the last five years, Sri Lankan Navy personnel had arrested 1,300 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and seized close to 300 boats from them for alleged violations. Release of fishermen Several demonstrations held by the fishermen associations here and the representations made by the government with the Centre had resulted in the release of the arrested fishermen, who were languishing in various prisons there. They had also released 173 boats in August 2018. Again, when the fishermen pressed for the release of the remaining boats, a team led by a senior officer from the government, technocrats and Mr. Sesu Raja visited Sri Lanka for an on-the-spot inspection of the condition of the boats. On its return, the team submitted a report to the government that 47 boats could be brought back. However, only 35 boats were retrieved after spending Rs. 48 lakh, Mr. Sesu Raja said. Under such circumstances, efforts to release the remaining boats through the diplomatic channels did not fetch any desired results. Due to the pandemic, normal activity had come to a standstill everywhere. The fishermen in Sri Lanka, who had just commenced activities, had made a representation to the authorities that the seized boats from Indian fishermen posed problems to them. They could not anchor their boats at Mannar, Jaffna ports. Taking this opportunity, the authorities moved the courts in Sri Lanka, which directed them to either destroy the boats or bring them to auction. The fishermen associations here, on hearing the development, appealed to the Tamil Nadu government to immediately take it up with the Centre and help them retrieve the boats at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sri-lankan-courts-order-on-boats-shocks-fishermen/article33054825.ece

Manufacturing of silver jewellery, especially silver anklets, is one of the major businesses in Salem and over one lakh persons are involved in it. The silver anklets manufactured here are exported to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra and to foreign countries as well. However, though the manufacturing units have reopened, production is yet to improve despite it being the festival season. C. Srianandarajan, secretary, Salem district kolusu manufacturers kaivinai sangam , said the production at present was only 30-40% compared to pre-COVID-19 times. “The pandemic had a severe impact on the trade. Despite relaxations, about 20% of manufacturers continue to remain shut,” he said. K.V. Chandrapal, president, Salem Silver Leg Chain Manufacturers’ Association, said the recent hike in silver price had hit the production again. “Following relaxations, there was quite good business till Navarathri. However, after the price of silver per gram rose to Rs. 68, there are no orders at the moment as jewellers fear that the price may reduce post-Deepavali. The governments should consider reducing the GST for silver anklets to support the trade,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/silver-anklet-production-yet-to-resume-in-full-swing/article33054839.ece

Most days are filled with outlining, modelling and painting deities for orders coming from across the world. “This one is for the pooja room of a client in the US. Her students are making this for her,” she says, pointing at a painting depicting Siva, Parvathi, Ganesha, among other deities. Each painting is made entirely by hand, including cutting of the wooden base, pinning the canvas base, sketching, painting and even framing it. It takes nearly 200 hours to finish one piece. While Mrs. Srinivasan had a penchant for art since childhood, her family and raising her two daughters was priority. “I did not get an opportunity to showcase it in any way for most of my life but when an opportunity came to attend a year-long government certificate course in Thanjavur paintings, my husband urged me to enrol in it,” she says. I got noticed outside my family only after my daughters Aishwarya and Bhargavi created a Facebook page - My Mom’s Art Gallery - which has garnered over 1,14,000 likes. Her husband, S.V. Srinivasan shoots videos of her paintings and shares them. Since the creation of the page, seven years ago, there has been no looking back. “I have numerous orders. While the pandemic slowed things down and we were unable to procure raw material and ship orders, we continued to paint,” she says. At team of 13 people predominantly women, including students, work with Mrs. Srinivasan to complete these orders. With Deepavali right round the corner, there are some orders to be finished by then, she says, pointing at a painting of Ram, Lakshman and Sita. Mrs. Srinivasan also makes detailed kolams regularly. “My mother taught my sisters and me the art which I continue to practice. The kolams are what led to her interest in paintings,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thanjavur-paintings-add-value-to-her-life/article33054778.ece
09 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||New booking system irks LPG consumers||Changes introduced by the oil companies to book Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) have posed inconveniences to the customers, particularly those who have poor knowledge of using mobile phones and uncomfortable in English and Hindi. As per the old system, which was in force up to October 31, customers booked refill cylinders through the Interactive Voice Respondng ording System (IVRS) through the registered mobile number. Upon completion of the registration, they received booking confirmation message and the cylinders were delivered as per the tentative dates. The system, which was in force for more than 5 years, seemed to work well. Since the customers used to the system, many found it easy in completing the refill registration. Moreover, the prominence given to the regional languages including Tamil made job easy for many customers. Under the new system, which has taken effect since November 1, customers will have to dial 7718955555, a uniform number across the country, to book for refill cylinders. There is no much inconvenience for those familiar with the mobile applications, and those who can manage English communication. Customers, who are not comfortable in English and Hindi face inconvenience. Both English and Hindi have been made as primary communication mode in the new IVRS method. Customers will have to dial the preferred number to switch it on to Tamil or others. If the customers happen to get answers in English, they then relatively find it easy to select Tamil or other regional languages. The problem is that many customers get answer in Hindi by dialling 7718955555. It is posing a problem in choosing the preferred language. “I do not understand the functioning of the new system. I could not follow the instruction in the new booking system. I had to seek the help of my neighbours to book refills. It would have been better if local languages were made given prominence,” says K. Kannan of Kumaran Nagar. Many customers are of the view that it is not the right time to bring in new changes when the people are getting prepared to celebrate Deepavali. It is during the festive season, the usage of gas cylinders will go up. There are customers, who still seek the help of others to book new cylinders. Since the introduction of the new system, the number of customers, who visit the offices of dealers in the city to book for refill cylinders, has gone up in the city. Some enter into arguments with the staff by pointing out the problems they face while booking for new cylinders. A LPG dealer of Indian Oil Corporation in the city admitted that they bad been facing the wrath of customers. The staff had been advised to exercise restrain and help them facilitate the booking.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-booking-system-irks-consumers/article33054781.ece

Scores of vendors, who had arranged their products, including clothing, jewellery, footwear and food items along Singarathope, Big Bazaar Street, NSB Road and Nandhi Koil Street drew shoppers looking for a good bargain. While vendors were apprehensive about the sales following the pandemic and its economic impact, they were relieved to see customers turn up in large numbers. “We did not expect such a turnout. With Deepavali falling in the second week, many would have received salaries this week and would have brought their families to shop for the festival. The surging crowds also caused traffic to remain at a standstill in front of Mainguard Gate, Chathram Bus Stand, Salai Road and Singarathope.

He would inspection from Thanjavur Junction and halt at several places en route to check electrical installations up to Mayiladuthurai Junction. He would also conduct a speed trial run later travelling in the same special train from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur Junction. The Mayiladuthurai - Thanjavur stretch is the last leg to be electrified on the 228-km mainline section from Villupuram Junction to Thanjavur via Cuddalore and Chidambaram. The RVNL which was entrusted with the task of executing the overhead electrification project on the mainline section had completed the works in phases: from Villupuram to Cuddalore at first and from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai later. Mandatory inspections by the Commissioner of Railway Safety were carried out separately in both portions and separate clearances obtained for operation of electric loco passenger trains up to Mayiladuthurai from Villupuram. The final portion of the electrification project from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur suffered a setback due to the lockdown. The work gained momentum a few months later following relaxations announced by the State government. A trial run was conducted in mid-October by deploying a single locomotive to run on the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur energised stretch. Relevant documents were submitted to the CRS inviting him to inspect the last portion of the electrified stretch. Late last month, the Southern Railway operated an electric loco hauled freight train transporting fertilizer on the Mayiladuthurai - Thanjavur electrified stretch up to Thanjavur for the first time after obtaining approval from the Southern Railway General Manager. However, clearance from the CRS is mandatory for operating passenger trains on the Mayiladuthurai - Thanjavur - Mayiladuthurai energised stretch. The clearance would enable operation of electric loco hauled express trains on the entire mainline section on both directions up to Chennai and from that city to Tiruchi via Thanjavur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crs-to-inspect-electrified-railway-lines/article33054782.ece

09 November 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic leads to spike in price of Ooty potatoes||The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted potato cultivation in the Nilgiris, leading indirectly to a price increase. Farmers and vegetable traders say the price of potatoes, popularly called ‘Ooty potatoes’ for their unique taste, has increased in the last few weeks, with one kg going for Rs. 45-Rs. 55 at the vegetable market in Mettupalayam. Horticulture Department officials say potato is grown on 1,500-1,800 hectares each year in the district. While they are unsure of the exact acreage of the crop since the pandemic started, they have noticed a few farmers with larger landholdings staying away from extensive potato cultivation this year owing to the uncertainty. G. Venkat, a vegetable farmer from Muthorai Palada near Udhagamandalam, says that after the lockdown was announced in March, many farmers decided to switch to vegetables that can be cultivated with minimal input costs. “As many were unsure of when the lockdown would be lifted and because of the problems in the transport of vegetables to other districts for a few weeks after the announcement, many farmers decided to grow low-maintenance crops,” he said. Vegetable traders supplying potatoes to Coimbatore and neighbouring districts say COVID-19 has played a part in the price increase. R. Hariharan, a trader from Ketti Palada near Coonoor, says the farmers’ decision led to the demand for potatoes outstripping the supply, pushing the price up in the last few weeks. “Many traders expect the trend to continue well after Deepavali, till the next crop is sown,” he says. S. Muthuraj, a farmer from Ketti, says that before the lockdown, farmers were getting around Rs. 30-Rs. 35 a kg. “As the price of potatoes has increased over the last few months, many have started sowing potatoes during this crop cycle itself, expecting the price to stay high till Christmas,” he said.

Instead, the police department can secure bank guarantee from the offenders of the vehicles value till the disposal of the case. If the case ends in favour of the department, it can redeem the bank guarantee. The vehicle can be put to productive use.

The new market that has come up on an one acre land alongside the Bengaluru-Pune National Highway has 16 shops and 10 temporary sheds for auctioning and sales. It has been developed by the Department of Horticulture and the city corporation at a cost of around Rs. 2 crore. The demand for a spacious and well-equipped wholesale horticulture market was long pending. The Department of Horticulture approached the city corporation more than a decade ago. The market functioned in the Gandhi Nagar till recently. Wholesale merchants organised auctions in the morning and bought flowers from growers in lots on open ground with only a few facilities available. The small space used to be congested and commuters inched their way through frequent traffic jams. The city corporation handed over some land to the department and entered into a memorandum of understanding with it. The flower auction centre was built last year and infrastructure, including roads, water and power supply, canteen and resting places, was completed recently. The process of allotment of shops got delayed, reportedly because the two government agencies did not communicate properly. Some merchants also alleged corruption and politicisation in the allotment process. All these issues were addressed and the allotments were made in a transparent manner. “We also got a functional revenue agreement with the city corporation that enabled us to open it,” said Deputy Director of Horticulture Ravindra Hakati. “We have allotted a quarter of the number of shops to farmers. However, merchants are demanding more. We will start temporary shops now, and then expand the outlets in future,” he said. Mr. Benake said that the market would boost the income of flower farmers. “A committee headed by Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath will be in charge of the functioning of the centre, including the auction process. We will improve the facilities at the centre in stages and make it one of the best in the State,” he said. He urged merchants to avoid trading at other places and to make the maximum use of the existing facilities. Horticulture Department officers Kiran Kumar Upale, H.V. Lengde, merchants and members of the district horticulturists association were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-gets-new-flower-market/article33054852.ece
09 November 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Shiv Sena leader accused of abetting suicide||Some residents of Bapat Galli complained to the city police on Sunday that Bandu Kerwadkar, Shiv Sena district unit vice-president and private moneylender, drove Vijay Gawani, a weaver, to commit suicide. Vijay Gawani had taken a loan from Bandu Kerwadkar and had repaid most of it, including the 10 % per month interest. However, Bandu Kerwadkar continued to torture him and insult Vijay Gawani in front of his friends, family and acquaintances. This forced Vijay Gawani to end his life, they said and requested the police to investigate.

09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Demand up in firecracker hub||In an unprecedented year when muted celebrations are the order of the day, the firecracker hub on the Karnataka–Tamil Nadu border saw demand pick up during the weekend. This is despite the State government’s guidelines for Deepavali, which includes bursting of only “green crackers”, which has also attracted skepticism from citizens and environmentalists. A firecracker stall owner on this side of the border on Hosur Road said this weekend, the one last before Deepavali, demand picked up considerably.“Prices have not increased. But the recent guidelines have confused people and many still think there is a blanket ban on firecrackers. But as this was the last weekend before the festival, sales picked up, especially on Sunday. People are also asking for green crackers specifically,” he said. N.S. Mukunda, former president of the Citizen Action Forum (CAF), said manufacturers of firecrackers would have already produced huge quantity of firecrackers and most of their stock would be in the market by now. “Hence, regulating their sales is impossible now. People with asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases are already at a high risk owing to the prevalent COVID-19 pandemic. I have asthma and the problem increases during Deepavali,” he said. Many civic associations have been advocating a “cracker-less” Deepavali in the city. D.S. Rajashekar of the Federation of Bangalore North East Residents’ Welfare Association pointed out that a ban on crackers was not an issue to be discussed and implemented a few days before the festival. “The government should first stop the production and transportation of crackers. It is a chain and the approach should be top to bottom and not the other way round,” he said. He also said they were requesting their association members and neighbours not to burst crackers and discourage people from bursting crackers too. ‘An eyewash’ On the other hand, many questioned whether “green crackers” were environmentally friendly. Environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy said there could not be anything like “green crackers” and all such things were just an “eyewash and attention-diversion tactics”. “The so called green crackers might have low-emission when compared with traditional crackers. Both are two sides of the same coin,” he said. Mr. Reddy also pointed out that the enforcing agencies such as the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the police and the civic bodies did not have the necessary manpower to enforce the use of “green crackers”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demand-up-in-firecracker-hub/article33055181.ece
09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Experts for review of testing strategy only after December||Although the State’s test positivity rate (TPR) reduced to 3.3% in the last seven days prior to November 7, experts have said it is now vital to maintain a TPR below 5% at least till December-end. This means, for every positive patient, the State should test 20 persons. The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which discussed this at its recent meeting, has recommended that the State should continue the same momentum of testing at least for the next two months. After that the testing strategy can be reviewed, allowing testing of those who report with symptoms, the TAC has recommended. Despite a fall in the State’s TPR in the last seven days, at least eight districts still have a TPR higher than the State average. At 5.8%, Vijayapura has the highest TPR followed by Kolar where the TPR is 4%. While Tumakuru has a TPR of 3.9%, the rate has stood at 3.7% in Bengaluru Urban. At 0.8%, the lowest TPR is in Bidar followed by Gadag, Bagalkot, and Yadgir where the TPR is 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Seroprevalence survey According to the findings of the first round of seroprevalence survey conducted by the State in association with various stakeholders, the surge is yet to occur in four districts apart from BBMP’s Mahadevapura zone. The four districts — Dharwad, Gadag, Chickballapur, and Bagalkot apart from Mahadevapura zone have been found to have the lowest estimated prevalence. Experts said testing should be ramped up in these districts so that positive patients are identified and isolated at the earliest. V. Ravi, senior professor and head of the Department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is part of the State’s TAC, said the low positivity rate was a clear sign of decline in the number of cases. “It is, however, important that we maintain the same testing levels at least till December-end,” he said. “It is very important to sustain a TPR of below 5% for the next two months which means for every positive person, we should test 20 persons. We have recommended that the testing strategy can be reviewed after that. Maybe after that we can start testing only those who report with symptoms,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, who is the nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said it was essential to maintain the current testing levels of over one lakh per day to ensure that the TPR was below 5% for the next two months. “If that is done, we can review our testing strategy after that,” he said. Asserting that aggressive testing should be done in all colleges that are slated to reopen soon, he said, “We had recommended aggressive testing in the constituencies where bypolls were held, which the State has taken forward. Now, a similar approach should be followed on college campuses for early tracking and tracing of cases so that further spread can be prevented.” “Similarly, testing should be ramped up in the four districts and Mahadevapura zone where the estimated overall prevalence is low. The low TPR should not make us complacent, especially because a second wave of the outbreak is expected in February–March. Strict enforcement of precautionary measures now is all the more important,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/experts-for-review-of-testing-strategy-only-after-december/article33055186.ece
09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Congress leaders censured for statements on ‘next CM’||Despite the general elections to the State legislature being more than two years away still, followers of Congress leaders projecting Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar as the “next Chief Minister” has not gone down well with the party. The disciplinary committee has asked leaders and workers not to engage in such talks publicly as it might hurt the party. In the run-up to the byelections recently, former Minister B.Z. Zameer Ahmed had pitched Mr. Siddaramaiah, while Jayanagar legislator Sowmya Reddy had backed Mr. Shivakumar as the next CM candidate from the party. “The KPCC disciplinary action committee has noted with concern the differing views expressed by leaders of the party on the question of future leadership of the legislature party. The committee feels it would be advisable to leave the matter to the time when the question of leadership would arise, and requests all elected representatives, leaders, office-bearers and workers of the party to desist from [making] such statements,” said a statement from the committee on Sunday. The committee met to discuss the matter on November 5. Party sources said it was a general advisory and no individual leader has been served notice. Sources also said the stern committee statement came after such talks diverted and divided the attention of party workers and leaders during the recent bypoll campaign. “Every leader wants to become Chief Minister, but these statements were unnecessary with the elections still far away. It is not the time to engage in such talks,” a party source said. Referring to BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel mocking the Congress leadership, another source said, “It is giving unnecessary fodder to the BJP. The disciplinary committee’s statement is an exercise of damage control. With two major communities — Lingayat and Vokkaliga — currently not backing the party well, Mr. Siddaramaiah’s clout over backward classes cannot be ignored. These statements might cause confusion.” The source also said that while the Congress has not projected any leader for the CM post, traditionally the KPCC president would be a front-runner. “Ultimately, the high command will decide.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-leaders-censured-for-statements-on-next-cm/article33054963.ece
09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Increase in water tariff inevitable, says BWSSB||The recent hike in power tariff has put the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) in a position where a tariff hike for water, it says, will be inevitable. The board says the power tariff hike will have a negative impact on its expenditure, increasing its financial stress. According to a senior BWSSB official, even with a hike of 25 paise, the BWSSB would have to bear Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 15 crore extra per month just on paying towards electricity. “The electricity bill, including that for pumping water, takes up a third of the revenue. The average domestic charge is Rs. 7 per kilolitre up to 8,000 litres and Rs. 11 from 8,001 to 25,000 liters,” an official said. “Earlier this year, we had proposed to the State government a revision in tariff and we are awaiting a decision on it. The last time we revised tariff was in 2014. We had then revised the tariff by 20%. Operational costs since then have increased a lot with various new projects in place, and internal revenues have stagnated,” the official said and added, “Since we work on no-profit, no- loss basis, any amount of loss would be an extra burden on us and the burden just piles up.” The BWSSB raises around Rs. 120 crore from consumers every month and around Rs. 30 crore goes for operational costs and around Rs. 12 crore for payment of salaries, and most of the rest of the amount goes towards electricity. While the BWSSB bears the operational costs, project costs are borne by the government. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) recently approved a revision of electricity tariff with an average increase by 40 paise per unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/increase-in-water-tariff-inevitable-says-bwssb/article33055180.ece

09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kidnapping: Rohingya families approach UNHCR||In the backdrop of the recent kidnapping of seven Rohingya youths, families of the victims have approached the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) seeking intervention. The letter on behalf of the families by NGO Law and Policy Research Institute states that there are 40 Rogingya families living in constant fear, anticipating backlash from the accused after they approached the police. Zia Nomani, programme head of the NGO, said the families comprising 60 men, 52 women, and 13 children were living in a slum at Dasarahalli sharing the space with refugees from Bangladesh for the past seven years and were working as ragpickers. The Rohingya families also have ID cards issued by the UNHCR, many of which have expired. They are subjected to harassment and forced to pay money to stay in the slum and work as ragpickers. Refusing to pay would end in physical harassment which some times takes serious turns like the recent kidnapping of seven youths, the letter states. Though six out of seven youths returned after paying the ransom of Rs. 40,000, Dil Mohammed, 22, is still missing and efforts are on by the police and the members of the NGO to trace him.  Protection sought The NGO has requested the authorities to provide protection to ensure that harassment of the refugee families stops. They have also urged the authorities concerned to renew the ID cards which have expired as the card-holders could not get them renewed owing to the pandemic. The attack is not new and the Rohingya families are victims of constant assault and harassment from the group that demands protection money, the NGO has alleged, citing the example of a 17-year-old girl abducted and raped in 2014 after her father refused to pay the “protection money”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kidnapping-rohingya-families-approach-unhcr/article33055183.ece

09 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police open fire||The Banasawadi police on Sunday opened fire at a 22-year-old habitual offender who allegedly attacked the police party in a bid to escape during recovery of a weapon he had used in committing a series of robberies in the last seven months. The accused, Arbaaz Khan, a resident of Pillanna Garden, had allegedly robbed a bakery owner after threatening him with a dagger in daylight on October 20 and escaped to Attur in Tamil Nadu where he was hiding. The Banaswadi police registered a case and tracked him down and arrested him. He was brought back to the city and on Sunday the police took him near a water tank in HRBR Layout to recover the dagger he had hidden. The police said as soon as Arbaaz picked up the dagger, he charged towards the police and attacked them. Inspector Jayaraj H. warned him twice before opening fire. Arbaaz sustained bullet injuries in his left leg and was shifted to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar hospital along with the injured sub-inspector of police. Robbery cases Deputy Commissioner of Police, East division, S.D. Sharanappa, who visited the spot, said Arbaaz was involved in over half-a-dozen robbery cases in the past seven months, creating fear psychosis among residents. He would move around the area armed with the dagger and attack people who objected to it. On October 20, he stabbed a shopkeeper in K.G. Halli after the shopkeeper demanded money for the cigarette he had bought. According to the police, Arbaaz allegedly robbed bakery owner Sharath on October 22 on Kacharakanahalli main road after threatening him with the dagger and took away Rs. 4,500. Arbaaz has allegedly robbed people in HRBR Layout, Hennur, Amruthahalli, and Bagalur police station limits, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-open-fire/article33054961.ece

09 November 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Self-less Manpade always fought for issues concerning masses’||Many leaders and activists representing different streams of activism recalled the contributions of Communist leader Maruti Manpade, who passed away recently, to the people’s resistance movement in the State and beyond. In a condolence meeting held at S.M. Pundit Rangamandir here on Sunday, Nityananda Swamy of Karnataka Prantha Krishi Koolikarara Sangha, B.R. Patil and Sharan Prakash Patil of the Congress, U. Basavaraj of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), retired professor T.R. Chandrashekhar, Nasir Hussein of People’s Forum and other leaders shared their experiences associated with Manpade and his un-compromised struggles for unprivileged people, especially farmers and unorganised workers. “With the untimely demise of Manpade, we have lost a great force who lent his voice for the poor and marginalised sections of society. The people in power are introducing anti-people policies and enacting draconian laws to snatch the hard-earned rights and livelihoods of the people. As life is going to be harder and tougher in the days to come, so would be the fight for retaining the rights and better life. Manpade’s absence would be strongly felt in such struggles. Continuing Manpade’s legacy of the un-compromised fight for people’s rights and fighting for realising his dreams would be the best homage we can offer to the great leader,” Mr. Nityananda Swamy said. The former Aland MLA Mr. B.R. Patil said that the Tur Board established in Kalaburagi was the result of Manpade’s consistent efforts. “There had been a demand for establishing a Tur Board which was expected to bring positive changes in the lives of red-gram growers and the dal industry. The government had firmly refused to form the board. However, Manpade did not give up. His consistent struggles forced the government to establish the board. Manpade had a government job with a decent salary. He quit it and became a full-time activist to take up people’s cause not just in Kalaburagi but across the State since he had a strong belief that only un-compromised struggles can change the lives of people for better,” he said. The former Minister Mr. Sharan Prakash Patil said that Manpade had never raised issues concerning individuals but always fought for those concerning the masses. “He never came to me or the government with issues involving individuals. The issues he raised and fought for were concerning the toiling masses and their rights. A few days before he contracted COVID-19 infection, I had advised him to be cautious against the pandemic. Yet, he roamed the State mingling with suffering people and organising them in the struggles for their rights. For, he considered people’s lives more important than his own and died of the infection. He fought for the people throughout his life and died for them in the end,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/self-less-manpade-always-fought-for-issues-concerning-masses/article33054854.ece
09 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Redevelopment of Kadri, Kankanady markets in doldrums||The redevelopment of Kadri and Kankanady markets in the city is in doldrums due to an issue related to the funding pattern. However, a solution to the issue appears to be on the cards now about two years after the foundation stones for the projects were laid. Mangaluru City Corporation laid the foundation stone for building the Rs. 12.30 crore modern market-cum-commercial complex at Kadri in March 2018, while the foundation stone for the Rs. 41.50 crore modern market complex at Kankanady was laid in February 2019. The projects were launched after fixing the funding pattern for both the projects at the ratio of 50:30:20. It meant that the projects were to get 50 % of the estimated cost as loan from the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) and 30 % of the total cost as loan from any nationalised bank. The corporation would have had to bear the remaining 20 % cost. Whip in the city corporation council Premananda Shetty told The Hindu that the then administration in the civic body launched the projects in a hurry when there was no clarity on the availability of funds. None of the nationalised banks had committed their loan as the interest rate for the bank loan had been fixed at 7.90 %. While the interest rate for the KUIDFC loan had been fixed at 6.50 %. “No bank came forward to sanction loan as the interest rate was very low,” he said and added that it forced the present administration to revise the funding pattern which is now awaiting the approval of the government. In the revised funding pattern, no loan from any nationalised bank will be taken. As per the funding pattern revised for re-building the Kadri market, 70 % (which is Rs. 8.60 crore) of the total project cost will be borrowed as loan from the KUIDFC at 4.65 % rate of interest. The balance 30 % (Rs. 3.70 crores) will be borne by the city corporation from its enterprises fund. According to the funding pattern revised for Kankanady market 70 % loan (Rs. 29 crore) will be taken from KUIDFC and 30 % (Rs. 12.50 crore) will come from Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. as its margin money, including from its enterprises fund. He said that the major financial issue to complete the projects will be addressed once the government approved of the revised funding pattern. Mr. Shetty said that the total project cost of the Kankanady market might go up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/redevelopment-of-kadri-kankanady-markets-in-doldrums/article33055308.ece
09 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four more biodiversity heritage sites for State||The Karnataka Biodiversity Board has decided to declare four more areas in the State as biodiversity heritage sites. Chairman of the board, Ananth Hegde Ashisara, told The Hindu that the board, at a meeting last month, passed a resolution to declare Antaragange Betta in Kolar; Aadi Narayana Swamy Betta in Chickballapur; Mahima Ranga Betta in Nelamangala, Bengaluru; and the Urumbi area in the Kumaradhara river basin in Dakshina Kannada as biodiversity heritage sites. Biodiversity heritage sites are considered unique and fragile ecosystems that can be marine ecosystems, coastal and inland waters, or terrestrial areas. Mr. Ashisara said Antaragange Betta has a unique and perennial water source flowing all through the year, and Aadi Narayana Swamy Betta in Gudibande taluk, Chickballapur, had many dry-belt species protected by locals. Mahima Ranga Betta is a prominent lung space surviving in Bengaluru. Urumbi area in Kadaba taluk of Dakshina Kannada has a fragile environmental system and is located on the banks of the river Kumaradhara. There was a move by a private company to set up a 24 MW hydroelectric power project across the river in the same area a decade ago. But environmental activists, including Kumaradhara Parisara Samrakshana Samiti and Vruksha Laksha Andolana, launched a series of agitations against it and ensured that the project did not come to fruition. The Centre for Ecological Sciences, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), Bengaluru, too had recommended that the project be shelved. The IISc., in its report in April 2013, said that if the project were to be implemented, an estimated 47 plant species endemic to the Western Ghats would face the threat of submersion. Of them, three species were in the “critically endangered” list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and three other species were in the “endangered” list. Mr. Ashisara said that notifying an area as biodiversity heritage site will help protect the rich and unique ecosystem in a particular area from further destruction. Now, the Forest Department will take necessary steps, such as a survey of the areas for earmarking the borders, and documentation, before issuing the notification of declaration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-more-biodiversity-heritage-sites-for-state/article33054968.ece
09 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||GI tag recommended for Ankola mango, two paddy varieties||Karnataka Biodiversity Board has recommended that the Union government grant Geographical Indication (GI) tag to Kari Ishad, a variety of mango grown in Ankola taluk of Uttara Kannada, the Gajani Kagga paddy cultivated in Kumta taluk in the same district, and the Rajamudi variety of paddy grown in Hassan district. The decision was taken at the meeting of the board last month, according to its chairman Ananth Hegde Ashisara. Ishad mango is unique to Ankola taluk. It has two variants — Kari Ishad, which has a thin skin, more pulp and is sweeter, and Bili Ishad, which has a thick skin and has less pulp and sweetness. According to Hichkad cooperative society, Ankola, the pulp of Ishad mango has been extracted for over a century for making value-added products. Meanwhile, H. Kempe Gowda, a joint director in the Department of Agriculture, told The Hindu that the Gajani Kagga variety of paddy is salt-tolerant and survives in standing water. It is grown in Kumta taluk in patches of water in small quantities now. Rajamudi is usually consumed as unpolished rice. Originally it was red in colour, but with evolution, it is now available in red mixed with light white colour. Mr. Ashisara said the board had also recommended that the wildlife board declare Mundige Kere, a waterbody in Sonda village of Sirsi taluk in Uttara Kannada, a bird sanctuary as it is home to “Bellakki”, a water bird.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gi-tag-recommended-for-ankola-mango-two-paddy-varieties/article33054965.ece

09 November 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Rly. Dn. ferried bikes in 5 NMG rakes in Oct.||As part of its efforts to push its freight traffic movement, the Mysuru Division of South Western Railway loaded five rakes of two-wheelers from Kadakola near Nanjangud on the outskirts of Mysuru in the last month. The Newly Modified Goods (NMG) rakes, which have a composition of 25 coaches to carry automobiles, can transport 1,000 two-wheelers. The Division loaded five NMG rakes of two-wheelers in the last month from Kadakola, which is close to one of India’s major two-wheeler manufacturing facility. The two wheelers were despatched to different destinations like Changsari of North Frontier Railways, Sankrail Goods Terminal of South Eastern Railway in West Bengal, Nautarwa of North Eastern Railway in Uttar Pradesh and Sarai of East Central Railway in Bihar. “In total, these five NMG rakes carried around 5,500 two-wheelers, generating around Rs. 1 crore revenue to the division,” said a statement issued by the Mysuru Division Railways. Ever since the Mysuru Railway Division constituted the Business Development Unit (BDU) in July this year in line with the guidelines issued by Railway Board, consistent efforts had been made to widen its freight basket. The efforts had yielded good results, which had helped bring back the automobile traffic to the division after a gap of two years, the statement added. In addition to transporting two-wheelers, the division has also loaded ginger, arecanut, pepper and other agricultural commodities, facilitating farmers to transport their products. “Iron ore was loaded for the first time from the division to destinations like Goa and Roha,” the statement said. Divisional Railway Manager Rahul Agarwal said Business Development Units (BDU) had been constituted even at the sub-divisional levels at commercially important places like Hassan, Arsikere, Davangere, Subramanya and Shivamogga. These BDUs will comprise supervisors from the Commercial and Operations Department. This will help the Railways reach out to local markets and farmers effectively and enabling them with ease of doing business, the Railways said. The Division, aiming to double its freight volumes, had recorded a 16% increase in freight loading for October this year compared to October 2019. To push transportation of agricultural products through Kisan Special, selected agriculture commodities are given upto 50% concession. As part of its digital initiative, the South Western Railway has also launched a mobile application called SWIFT (Single Window Interface for Freight Transportation), which acts as a one-point destination for goods and parcel booking. Customers can download SWIFT application from Playstore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rly-dn-ferried-bikes-in-5-nmg-rakes-in-oct/article33054955.ece
09 November 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Palace illumination suspended again||The illumination of Mysuru palace, which was the centre of attraction during the recently concluded Dasara festival, has been suspended again. The illumination of the palace in the evening every Sunday and on public holidays had been suspended along with its closure to tourists soon after the Centre declared a lockdown due to COVID-19 during March this year. Though the palace reopened for tourists in June, the illumination remained suspended till Dasara. “The suspension was revoked temporarily during Dasara. Now, it will be reinforced,” said an official of Mysuru Palace Board. The illumination has been suspended till further notice. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, who is also the Executive Director of the Palace Board, will have to take a decision on revoking the suspension for good, said the official. Confirming this, Deputy Director of Mysuru Palace Board T.S. Subramanya said the illumination during the recently concluded Dasara saw a large number of people gathering near the gates as the entry to the palace during illumination not allowed. “There were around 500 to 1,000 people at each gate,” he said. The gathering of a large number of people is feared to facilitate transmission of the COVID-19. Also, a large number of people were also found flouting the safety precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distance when they had come out to enjoy the illumination, officials said. However, the palace will remain open for tourists from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on all days including weekdays and weekends. It draws 2,500 people on weekends and about 1,200 to 1,500 on weekdays, he said. Along with illumination, even the Sound and Light programme here is suspended. Though the Dasara festivities were scaled down this year, Mysuru palace was lit up in the evening on all the ten days of the festivities from October 17 to 26 when the approximately one lakh incandescent bulbs were lit. The illumination of the palace along with the main thoroughfares was the only major draw for the general public during the festivities this year. The district administration, however, had deployed mobile health teams at the palace to carry out COVID-19 tests for tourists visiting the palace and the zoo during Dasara. Till November 7, a total of 48,620 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Mysuru. However, the daily cases had fallen to double digits on Saturday after a long time when 79 cases were reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/palace-illumination-suspended-again/article33054956.ece

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Are family loyalties more important than party affiliations? This is a question that crops up frequently in Belagavi politics, most recently during the District Central Cooperative bank elections. Though the polls are supposed to be apolitical, BJP and Congress leaders took an active interest in them. The office-bearers of Sahakara Bharati, a Sangh Parivar affiliate, held some meetings with stake-holders. Their declared intention was to ensure a unanimous election, but polling was necessitated in three seats that had multiple candidates. When the results were declared, it was believed that the BJP-backed candidates had won 12 of the 16 vacancies on the board, while Congress-backed candidates won four. However, some people in the know argued that the loyalties of at least nine members did not lie with any party, but with the Jarkiholi clan. The five brothers from Gokak were part of the strategies leading up to the November 6 election. They acted in unison, despite their party affiliations being different. Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has declared that the DCC bank was a non-political institution and the decision he took about its leadership was only aimed at the welfare of farmers.      S. Suresh Kumar has set a record of sorts by visiting Chamarajanagar, one of the backward districts in the State, 48 times during the past one year. As the district in-charge Minister since September 2019, he visited Chamarajanagar many times during the pandemic. According to sources, no Minister in the past has visited the district as frequently. One of the superstitions associated with the district is that anyone visiting it loses power. Only a handful of politicians have brushed this aside. The district has also suffered taint as Veerappan’s backyard.

All major political fronts are indulging in hectic parleys over seat-sharing and finalising candidates. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who attended a meeting of the United Democratic Front (UDF) district leadership here on Sunday urged unity and suggested announcing UDF’s candidates by November 10. He warned that rebel candidates would be ousted from the Congress party. Mr. Chennithala said that the political climate in the State was favourable for the UDF. The LDF government was enmeshed in corruption, he said. Meanwhile, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has largely completed the seat-sharing arrangements. In 2015 polls, the LDF romped to victory in district panchayat, 10 block panchayats, 48 grama panchayats and two municipalities- Kayamkulam and Mavelikara. The UDF bagged four municipalities- Cherthala, Alappuzha, Haripad and Chengannur, two block panchayats and 23 grama panchayats. Although the BJP emerged the single biggest party in Thiruvanvandoor grama panchayat, they were later ousted from the power with the support of UDF and LDF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alappuzha-district-slipping-into-election-mode/article33054917.ece

09 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Left breathless as garbage piles up||From a temple that stands on the banks of the Kadambrayar, Manoj M.S. has a ringside view of the dumping of waste from the precincts of seven local bodies in the district at the Brahmapuram dumping yard. The temple is one of the last vestiges of a residential area that existed before Brahmapuram became the district’s dumping yard. Since it is located on the road that leads to the dumping site, and the area is frequented only by trucks carrying waste and packs of dogs, the temple, with an overgrown yard, has also mostly been abandoned save for a monthly ritual, said Manoj, a newspaper agent and the temple’s caretaker, who lives in the same ward. “The stench from waste and the mostly deserted area tend to keep people away. Only a few workers helping with segregation of waste at the plant live nearby,” he added. Hidden in the thickets behind the temple are houses that were abandoned by residents when the land was acquired for the dumping site. “My house still stands there, intact. The place was scenic, with the Kadambrayar flanked by coconut and areca nut groves and a few paddy fields. We had to give up the land for a pittance when a total of over 100 acres were acquired,” said Suresh Kumar, who moved to Kaninad in the same panchayat. Around 30 acres were taken over in 2007 through a government notification, and another 65 acres were acquired in 2009, he added. Both the Kochi Corporation and the Vadavucode-Puthencruz panchayat have done little to clear up the mess in the area, said Pradeep C.V., an autorickshaw driver, who lives at Brahmapuram. The fires and burning of waste have turned into an irritant, water in the Kadambrayar is coated in slime, and piles of waste are scattered along the way to the dumping yard. “We are only waiting to see what more can go wrong here,” he said. “Another election is around the corner, and we will be told that something will be done about the waste. Nobody is clear about what that something is,” said Manoj. “There are plans for a biomedical waste treatment plant in the vicinity, which means more truckloads and more trouble,” he observed. Residents had recently been complaining about the foul-smelling waste from the district administration’s cleaning of canals under Operation Breakthrough which was brought here, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/left-breathless-as-garbage-piles-up/article33055272.ece
09 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Concern over Kochi metro’s cost-revenue gap||The ever-widening gap between revenue and expenditure of the Kochi metro has made critics say that a four-lane flyover can be built using the monthly loss incurred by the metro rail system. The steep fall in patronage from a daily average of 65,000 passengers to approximately 10,000 due to the pandemic situation has further sent alarm bells ringing. “This is apart from the sky-rocketing operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses of the metro system, since the defect liability period/warranty of almost all components has expired or are nearing the expiry date. Even worse, spare parts will have to be procured from firms, including those who enjoy monopoly in the supply of select spares. Thus, KMRL/State government will have to meet the O&M expenses, which will keep increasing due to increased wear and tear,” said an urban transport planner who was associated with the metro project. All these will be apart from the expenses that could spring up if firms which were engaged in the construction of the metro opt for arbitration, he added.  Action sought Expressing concern over the metro not getting even a fifth of the 4.50 lakh daily passenger patronage that was projected in the ridership figure for 2020, Senior Deputy Transport (retired) Commissioner B.J. Antony, who played a key role in readying projects to integrate the metro with other commuting modes, sought action against stakeholders who readied the metro’s DPR. “No doubt the metro ushered in a fast, comfortable and reliable mode of commute in the Greater Kochi area. But it will not get 4.50 lakh footfall, even if passengers are offered free ride every day. The pre-COVID daily patronage of 65,000 commuters is wholly insufficient, since the metro covers areas falling under the Greater Cochin Development Authority [GCDA] and not just the Kochi Corporation limits. Even among them, a bulk of passengers used to board or alight at Lulu Mall at Edappally,” he said.  Meanwhile, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) said it was not in a position to reveal the revenue-expenditure disparity, neither comment on steps under way to augment revenue, till the annual report is released later this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/concern-over-kochi-metros-cost-revenue-gap/article33055385.ece
09 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Discontent brews among private bus operators||Discontent is brewing among private bus operators in the city, since the State and Central governments have not stepped in with help, although the number of private buses operating in the Greater Kochi region has fallen from 1,000 to 200, and no governmental help is forthcoming for them to retrofit CNG kits. Their common refrain is that the conversion process involves expenditure to the tune of Rs. 4 lakh, which is not affordable for most bus operators, although it is a financially viable proposition and causes less air and sound pollution. For the first time in the city, two buses operated by Josco Motors that were retrofitted with CNG kits imported from Argentina are getting ready to begin service in a week, on the Aluva-Thripunithura and Vyttila-Vyttila circular routes. Yet another bus was driven all the way to New Delhi to install the kit. The bus began service a week ago. The advantages include a difference of approximately Rs. 18 between the cost of a litre of diesel and a kg of CNG. Besides, CNG is more fuel efficient, while its contribution to air and sound pollution is less, bus operators said. “Sadly, the State government, which pays up massive losses incurred by the KSRTC, is unwilling to help private buses retrofit CNG kits. This despite 90% of the fleet in Kochi keen to shift to CNG, considering the sky-rocketing operational cost and fall in patronage,” said George Joseph of Josco Motors. “Agencies like the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board [KIIFB] are providing funds to the KSRTC at 4% interest. This must be extended to private bus operators too. A 30% subsidy to retrofit CNG kits too will help, since the entire world is shifting to green mobility. I am keen to convert the rest of my buses to CNG if government help is forthcoming. The technology has proven successful in New Delhi and Mumbai,” he added. Mr. Joseph’s buses are awaiting endorsement of the fuel-mode change in their RC books and insurance documents. An operational problem facing CNG buses is that nozzles tailor-made for heavy vehicles are available only at two CNG retail outlets in Kochi. Yet another bus operator, Nisar Karukapadath, said most owners were unwilling to spend Rs. 4 lakh from their kitty, since none is willing to risk the amount during the pandemic period, and the lifespan of buses has been fixed at 15 years. “It is tough to recover the cost, unless the government subsidises the retrofitting process,” he added. KSRTC plan Responding to the demand from bus operators to subsidise the CNG kit retrofitting process, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran said the KSRTC was keen to operate CNG/LNG buses. “The government is not in a position to extend subsidy to private buses, since the Environment Ministry does not have a scheme in this regard, unlike for e-mobility. There has been no concerted demand from bus operators either,” he added. “Diesel costs Rs. 75 a litre, while a kg of CNG costs Rs. 56. A bus that travels 250 km a day can save approximately Rs. 1,200. “Besides, fuel efficiency improves by 20%. The retrofitting cost can thus be recovered in 36 months. At least 400 private bus operators have enquired with us about the process. Government help will catalyse the process,” said Geo John Palatty, of Metro Fuels which did the retrofitting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/discontent-brews-among-private-bus-operators/article33055269.ece
09 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Boost for brackish water aquaculture||The commissioning of a seed production centre for pearl spots (karimeen), Asian sea bass, and milk fish at the government fish farm at Edakochi and the signing of an MoU between the Chennai-headquartered ICAR-Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture and the Kerala Fisheries Department for multi-species hatchery near Thiruvananthapuram are expected to give a big boost to brackish water aquaculture in the State. The new facility at Edakochi can produce around five lakh pearl spot seedlings a year, thereby helping the State realise its aim of becoming self-sufficient in both fish and fish seed production. The facility will also be utilised for farming sea bass, pearl spot, and milk fish, which are commercially important in Kerala. The ICAR-CIBA partnership with the Kerala government for pearl spot, sea bass and milk fish hatechery has set the stage for increasing brackish water fish production in the State. According to a communication from CIBA, the agency will provide scientific and technical support to the government for developing captive breeding and seed production technology for the commercially important brackish water fish varieties like Asian sea bass, milk fish, and pearl spot. The hatchery aims at seed production of these species throughout the season, enabling continuous seed production. The partnership between CIBA and the State government also aims to support critical human resource development in the niche area through regular and continuous hands-on training programmes.  Rich resources CIBA had said in an earlier review of the ground situation that Kerala produced a meagre 2,000 tonnes of pearl spot as against a demand for around 10,000 tonnes per annum. The Central agency had sought the support of the State government to boost the aquaculture production of pearl spot, which is Kerala’s State fish. Speaking at a farmers’ meet in August, the CIBA director had said that it was high time that the State prepared a road map for proper utilisation of its highly prospective brackish water resources. Kerala is endowed with rich brackish water resources to the tune of 1.26 lakh hectares, and the area can be utilised to substantially increase production. CIBA director K.K. Vijayan said CIBA’s linkage as a knowledge partner with the Kerala government would be a “game-changer”, and that the partnership would become an ideal model for transfer of technologies in a farmer-focussed manner. The establishment of the multi-species hatchery is timely and will provide stimulus for augmenting brackish water fin fish production, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brackish-water-aquaculture-to-get-a-boost/article33055277.ece
09 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||‘Corpn.’s powers over waste management bypassed’||Waste disposal is the local body’s mandate, but the State government has, through Government Orders, been bypassing this authority of the Kochi Corporation over waste management, Mayor Soumini Jain has said. “The waste-to-energy plant could have been a feasible solution to the problems at Brahmapuram. But at the last moment, the government decided to hand it over to another agency, which will now require more government-level permits. We are anxious about how long such a plant will take to materialise,” she said. P.K. Velayudhan, president of the LDF-ruled Vadavucode-Puthencruz panchayat, said the corporation had five years to deal with the problems at Brahmapuram but lacked the will to do much about the site. A composting facility for biodegradable waste is only partially functioning at Brahmapuram. A decision was taken towards the end of the council’s term to set up a new shed and machinery for compositing. “It was delayed since questions were raised about whether we need this new facility when a waste-to-energy plant is anyway in the offing,” the Mayor said. The task of laying roads at the dumping yard was also handed over to the District Collector by a Government Order, the Mayor said. “While Rs. 1.30 crore was set aside by the corporation to lay roads, the Opposition refused to allow the agenda to be passed, prolonging it needlessly,” she added. Biomining of legacy waste at the site has also been tendered by the government now, she said. On recurrent fires at the site, the Mayor said. “I had asked for a Vigilance probe , but no Government Order has been issued to this effect.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpns-powers-over-waste-management-bypassed/article33055273.ece
09 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Finalising seat-sharing in Ernakulam||Accommodating the Kerala Congress groups in a respectable manner has been the key challenge before the poll managers of both the LDF and the UDF, as the seat-sharing process for the local body polls entered the final phase in the district. Though none of the Kerala Congress factions has sufficient numbers in any local body in Ernakulam to claim the lead role, they have their representatives in a large number of civic bodies, including the Kochi Corporation and the Ernakulam district panchayat. While the LDF camp is keen to offer a decent accommodation to the Kerala Congress faction led by Jose K. Mani, the UDF poll managers are all the more willing to accommodate the faction led by P.J. Joseph. The four seats in which the Kerala Congress (M) contested in the Kochi Corporation in the last election as a UDF partner will be given to the party itself. The front partners have reached an understanding to contest the same number of seats they contested last time. However, minor changes may happen when the final list is drawn, said a CPI(M) leader who was privy to the seat-sharing process. The final list will be released in a day or two after obtaining clearance from the State leadership of the CPI(M), he added. The focus of UDF leaders has been not on “weakening” the faction led by Joseph, which has stood firm with the front. The seats that the Kerala Congress had won in the last elections when it fought as one party will be allotted to it this time too. There are a few other seats in which Kerala Congress candidates failed to post victory. They will be allocated either to the Congress or the Kerala Congress after studying the probability of winning those seats, said UDF district chairman Dominic Presentation. The front is also in the process of accommodating the RSP, Janata Dal faction, and the All India Forward Block. The NDA hopes to come up with a list by Monday afternoon, said S. Jayakrishnan, district president. It will field candidates in all seats in all local bodies. Besides the BJP, the front has Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena, Nationalist Kerala Congress, Socialist Janata Dal, Lok Jana Sakthi, and the Siva Sena as its partners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-fronts-finalising-seat-sharing-in-district/article33055276.ece

This is for the first time that this many unions have been brought together for a common cause to improve public transport and to bring about the welfare of drivers. The ongoing efforts will help auto drivers who are amongst the worst hit by the pandemic-induced stalemate. They are now better placed to operate regular and feeder services, including along the Kochi Metro corridor. The app was readied despite the pandemic situation playing spoilsport with different modes of public transport, said Simon Edapally, director board member of the society. Apart from doing away with the need for cash transactions, the app will prevent fleecing by unscrupulous drivers.

The KMRL provided initial support for the venture, while personnel of Technovia Info Solutions readied the platform for the society. Nishant Ravindran, CEO of the firm, said most other ride-app aggregators levy commission of approximately 26% on drivers. In this case, drivers do not have to pay any commission. A nominal conveyance charge like the Rs. 1 being levied at pre-paid auto counters will be collected from passengers.

09 November 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||Fathima’s kin see no progress in CBI probe||Despite the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) taking over the probe, there has been no progress in the case related to the death of Fathima Latheef, a 19-year-old student who was found dead in her hostel room at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, her parents have alleged. The Klappana resident, a bright student and a rank-holder, was a first-year student of Humanities when she reportedly ended her life on November 9, 2019. Complaint filed Her family had filed a complaint after retrieving a note from her phone, according to which she was facing harassment from some faculty members, forcing her to take the extreme step. She had joined IIT in July 2019 and was the class topper when she died. “CBI officials had called us a couple of times during the past months, but they are yet to take our statement. I have sent a mail to the CBI director sharing our grievances and I want to believe that my daughter will get justice,” said Latheef, Fathima’s father. Transferred to CBI The case was transferred to the CBI when her family and a delegation of MPs visited Union Home Minister Amit Shah and handed over a memorandum signed by 41 MPs seeking a fair probe. Her family had raised several allegations after the death as the screensaver of her phone and notes saved in it had named the persons responsible for her death. But with the Kotturpuram police insisting that they could not find any suicide note, her father had alleged that Tamil Nadu police were trying to botch up the investigation. Initial assumption The initial assumption of the police was that Fathima committed suicide since she could not score good marks in the first semester examination. But according to her family, she had scored the highest marks in her class even in her last examination. They had also alleged that IIT authorities had prevented other students from talking to Fathima’s family and suspended the classes of her batch immediately after the incident. Meanwhile, Kollam MP N.K. Premachandran has written to the Union Home Minister demanding a time-bound investigation. “The probe should be expedited as there is no breakthrough even one year after Fathima’s death. The CBI authorities also failed to respond to her father’s appeals and immediate steps should be taken to complete the probe,” he said. Mr. Premachandran also observed that the mysterious deaths of students at IITs were a matter of major concern. “The reason for the increasing number of such incidents is the failure in finding and punishing the culprits,” he said.  CBI officials called us a couple of times during the past months, but they are yet to take our statement.

He was inaugurating Janavidhi-Thaddesheeyam 2020, a discussion series organised by Kollam Press Club in connection with the local body elections here on Sunday. He alleged that the LDF government had denied the local bodies their Plan fund. “The government sanctioned only Rs. 3,887 crore from the Rs. 7,500 crore allocated to local bodies in the 2019-20 financial year,” he said. Coming down heavily on the LDF government, he said Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had the support of his father and party in all the unscrupulous dealings. ‘Not a stray incident’ “Bineesh is still an active member of the CPI(M), but the party failed to control him. Mr. Balakrishnan was living with his son, yet he could not question him about his illegal assets and deals. This is not a stray incident, the CPI(M) has several Bineesh Kodiyeris who preach ethics and engage in underworld dealings,” he said adding that the LDF government had been misusing the Assembly, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/situation-favourable-to-udf-chennithala/article33054936.ece
09 November 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||UDF finalising seats in Kottayam||Amidst the continuing indecision over the sharing of seats in the district and block panchayats, a meeting of the United Democratic Front Kottayam district unit here on Sunday decided to complete the seat-sharing talks at the panchayat level in a couple of days. The meeting, attended by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, UDF convener M. M. Hassan also decided to hold bilateral discussions between constituent parties over the seats in the district and block panchayats. Based on the decision, Senior Congress leaders Oommen Chandy and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan also held discussions with the leaders of the Kerala Congress faction led by P. J Joseph late in the day. According to sources, the discussions on the district panchayat divisions would begin upon arriving at a general formula on the number of seats to be shared among the constituent parties. At the same time, the talks regarding the block panchayat divisions will be held at the Assembly constituency level. Any dispute that will crop up during these discussions will be settled with the intervention of the UDF district leadership. The sharing of seats in the Kottayam district panchayat hit a road block after the Joseph group insisted on a status quo with regard to the division of seats to the KC(M) despite the exit of Jose K. Mani- led faction from the UDF. Earlier in the day, Mr. Chandy said the political situation in the State was highly conducive to the UDF as the public was fed up with wrongdoings of the LDF government. “The State government is plunged neck-deep in corruption. Besides the Central agencies, even the State Vigilance under the Chief Minister too have registered cases against some of the accused in these corruption cases,” he pointed out. Mr. Chandy also called upon the rank and file of the UDF to work hard and meet the expectations of the public. “We have no time to spare. We have to move ahead and to change our works in compliance with COVID-19 induced restrictions,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, UDF convener M.M.Hassan launched an attack on the LDF for inducting the KC (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani in the coalition. “The voters of Kottayam will never forget the bitter treatment of K.M.Mani by the LDF workers in the bar bribery case. All faces that represent corruption including a person who was sentenced by the court are now with the LDF,” he said, adding that the UDF would be urging the public to vote against corruption during the upcoming local body elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-finalising-seats-in-kottayam/article33054914.ece

09 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||As curbs ease, local tourism enterprises bounce back||Local tourism enterprises that faced a setback with the spread of COVID-19 are bouncing back as visitors flock to rural and beach tourism destinations in Kozhikode district. Homestay owners are now busy improving facilities at their ventures to attract more visitors and cash in on the tourist season. “We are fully back to service as tourists have accepted the new normal. There are no special offers, but we get a lot of booking enquiries,” said a homestay entrepreneur from Kappad, where the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) recently reopened the beach after a major beautification work, which won the destination the prestigious Blue Flag certification. The reopening of the beach helped improve the business prospects of nearby homestays and food joints, he added. A stringent health protocol is in place in such locations. Many entrepreneurs have roped in professional disinfection service providers. The experience of those who earlier rented out their tourism facilities for paid quarantine service has also come in handy for local entrepreneurs. The DTPC’s flexible approach towards new ventures in the sector has encouraged many Gulf-returnees to try their hand in tourism and allied businesses. One such entrepreneur from Kuttiyadi village said the preference for eco-tourism spots among youngsters was proving to be advantageous for many local ventures. “We offer village food and stay at a very competitive rate. The word-of-mouth advertising by our visitors perfectly work for widening our customer base,” he added. Romeo Thomas, an entrepreneur from Perambra taluk, said he had expanded facilities at his homestay to host more persons. “The latest addition under consideration is a small pool villa at the lowest service rate. Many entrepreneurs try to add such small attractions to their ventures to thrive in the field,” he said. Loan assistance DTPC officials said the State government order declaring loan assistance through cooperative banks for tourism ventures would attract more investors to the sector. It would help stakeholders get a loan up to Rs. 25 lakh. A one-time financial assistance too had been rolled out for approved tourist guides, but no one was found applying for it in Kozhikode district, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-curbs-ease-local-tourism-enterprises-bounce-back/article33054869.ece
09 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Parents allege flaws in ICAR entrance results||Some parents have accused the National Testing Agency (NTA) of unfair practices in announcing the results of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research All India Entrance Examination (ICAR AIEEA) for admissions to undergraduate courses in agriculture and allied science subjects. The NTA is an autonomous institution under the Centre that conducts entrance examinations for admission to and fellowship in higher educational institutions. The nationwide entrance tests were conducted in two shifts each on September 16, 17 and 22. C.A. Sureshan, a parent from Payyannur in Kannur district, told The Hindu on Sunday that the questions on the first day were very tough, the second day moderately tough, and the last day very easy. The agency published the mark cards on November 1. The counselling process was launched soon after the rank list was published on November 7, Mr. Sureshan said. He alleged that the agency had not resorted to normalisation procedures and announcement of percentile score as per norms, but published the rank list based on marks scored. A section in the handbook released by the NTA says that if the exams are being conducted in multiple shifts, the raw marks obtained by the candidates in different shifts or sessions will be converted to NTA score (percentile). The calculated NTA score for the raw marks for all the shifts or sessions will be merged for further processing for deciding the allocation. Mr. Sureshan said those who had written the exam in the final shifts might have scored high marks and high ranks due to the faulty publication of the rank list. ‘An injustice’ A.P. Padmaja, another parent, in a letter to the ICAR, said the agency had done injustice to the candidates. Calls and e-mails to the agency had not yielded results. “We are thinking of legal recourse now,” Mr. Sureshan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parents-allege-flaws-in-icar-entrance-results/article33054927.ece

09 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||LDF banks on schemes, awards||Ask Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat president V.K. Madhu about the achievements he would highlight for the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF)’s local body election campaign, and he would reel out a long list of initiatives and national and State awards won over the past five years. Along with a brute majority of 19 out of 26 divisions, it is this list that gives him the confidence that the district panchayat would not go back to the United Democratic Front (UDF), which had held it in the previous tenure. LDF’s focus According to Mr. Madhu, the focus of the past five years has been equal across various sectors, from education to health and even sports. “Under the ‘Padheyam’ project, we have been providing daily meals for 6,500 people, totalling over 95 lakh food packets in these years. We set up libraries in all of the 10,600 classrooms in government schools in the district. Sixty-two schools have new buildings. All the district hospitals have dialysis facilities now, while we spent Rs. 60 crore for improvement of hospitals. We have implemented free dialysis for all poor patients in the district. We have opened five major sports hubs. Under the Jalasree project, 2,048 farm ponds and 2 lakh rainwater pits were made. We have also entered the Guinness Records with a karate performance by 6,000 girls trained by us. Not to forget our interventions during the floods, when we sent out 90 loads of materials and during the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Mr. Madhu. Ansajitha Russel, Congress member and district panchayat president during 2010-15, says that many of these projects were merely a continuation of the work done during her tenure. Implementation issues “Many of these are based on projects we had planned earlier. Maybe, the karate scheme is their idea, but has it benefited in the long run? There are issues in the implementation of the ‘Padheyam’ project at the local level, but we did not raise it as it is a scheme to provide food for the poor. What was the need to spend crores of rupees to renovate the district panchayat building? We had implemented schemes for cancer-detection camps for women and tri-scooter distribution for differently-abled, which they stopped. We intend to restart these when we return to power,” says Ms. Russel. Supporting voice The Bharatiya Janata Party made its debut in the district panchayat in 2015, winning the Venganoor division. But V. Lathakumari, the BJP member from Venganoor is all praise for Mr. Madhu. “Though I am a BJP member, I have only good things to say about Mr. Madhu. He performed well as president and was able to implement a lot of things. We all stood united when it came to implementing various projects. I was able to do quite a few things in the Venganoor division, which is certain to help BJP in the coming elections,” says Ms. Lathakumari. She, however, says that she had disagreements on not giving enough credits to the Central government which had funded some of the projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-banks-on-schemes-awards/article33055375.ece

A Left Democratic Front (LDF) bastion, the municipality will see an intense tussle this time between the ruling LDF and the United Democratic Front (UDF), with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) adding a very interesting third angle to the fight. The LDF scooped up the 44-seat municipal council in 2015, and is confident that its development plank will catapult it to success yet again. LDF’s priorities Waste management was one of the top priorities for the LDF. “We got the Suchitwa tag for clean municipality, courtesy 20 aerobic bins, segregation of waste, and plastic recycling,” says W.R. Heeba, CPI(M) chairperson of the municipality. Toilets and electricity connections are the other major achievements. It became a tuberculosis-free municipality and bagged honours thrice for palliative care. On the education front, high-tech school project, handbook for students appearing for the SSLC exams, and model exams were implemented by the municipality. Her regret—not being able to get a crematorium for the municipality. “Work could not take off owing to COVID-19.” Ms. Heeba says she is proud to have led a corruption-free administration. “There were some allegations but none has been proved. I did not even accept the chairperson’s honorarium.” UDF’s plank Corruption, however, is one of the weapons in the UDF arsenal. Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing council A. Lalitha says the municipality used to be at the top in fund utilisation but now has utilised only 36% of the funds. Corruption started from purchase of land at Eeratinpuram in 2015-16 and continues. Graft allegations were raised from even within the CPI(M). Recently, on the pretext of pond cleaning, all the slurry was sold for crores, she alleges. “Not one aerobic bin is functioning properly. One cannot walk through Neyyattinkara town without covering the nose.” A COVID centre at the Neyyattinkara higher secondary school has not seen one admission, says Ms. Lalitha. BJP’s aim The BJP is hoping to improve its tally of five seats in 2015. The crematorium is one of the pressing needs that is yet to be realised by either of the two fronts, says Shibu Raj Krishna, BJP leader in the municipal council. Waste management and plastic recycling have also been a failure. If projects have been implemented, those are Central schemes, says Mr. Shibu Raj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/neyyattinkara-promises-drama/article33055370.ece
09 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Ban use of plastic in campaigning||The use of plastic will be a strict no-no in the campaigns for the upcoming local body elections, District Collector Navjot Khosa has told political parties and candidates. The use of plastic paper, ribbons or even cord for erecting campaign boards or hoardings was completely forbidden, the Collector said on Sunday. The choice of campaign materials should be confined to biodegradable or recyclable materials. The prohibition on the use of plastic was part of the guidelines issued by the State Election Commission as part of enforcing green protocol. Thiruvananthapuram would go to polls on December 8 in the first of the three-phased elections in December. Banners, hoardings and flags, and festoons made of plastics, PVC would be forbidden. Eco-friendly materials such as cotton cloth and polyethylene would be allowed, Ms. Khosa said. The District Collector also directed the secretaries of local bodies to ensure that election-related materials left over at the pollings stations were removed after the voting. This direction was also applicable for the counting centres, she said. Special bags would be distributed at the polling stations and counting centres for the removal of organic and inorganic wastes. Medical wastes including used masks and gloves would be segregated in separate bags.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-use-of-plastic-in-poll-campaigning-collector/article33054916.ece

09 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Skywalk project gets entangled in red-tapism||Delay in getting the nod to carry out the drone survey has hit the work to finalise the alignment and preparation of the detailed project report for the six-metre-wide skywalk proposed in the State capital. Aimed at the hassle-free movement of the pedestrians, the skywalk, to come up in pillars, is to connect the Secretariat, Secretariat Annexe, KSRTC’s bus terminal, Central Railway Station at Thampanoor, entrance of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple at East Fort, and end at the Chala market. Three routes are being considered, including through Press Road and Housing Board Junction. Arkitechno Consultants (India) Private Limited and Design Forum International, which won the bid floated by the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) for the Public Works Department (PWD), is knocking at the doors of the authorities since mid-September seeking permission to carry out a drone survey from Statue Junction to East Fort. Key stretches The key stretches of the skywalk are within the 500-metre radius of the Secretariat complex and the 1000-metre radius of Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, which are no-flying zones due to security concerns. Taking into account these aspects, the consultants have sought permission to carry out the drone Lidar Survey on top of the MG Road, Power House Road, and RMS Junction Road, avoiding directly flying over the heritage sites. However, sources in the consultancy firms say the approvals sought for the drone survey are pending and it is a challenge to work with the limited data available. The delay is affecting the road map prepared for submitting the DPR by December. The consultants have already carried out the topographic survey of the terrain and stretches of land along which the skywalk is proposed with the help of a Total Station. Since the entire stretch falls within the city limits, the point cloud of the data obtained is very limited. Using this data to plot and visualise the 3D terrain model is a challenge, they say. Buildings Moreover, there are buildings all along the MG Road and other stretches that are very closely spaced and some buildings even have protruding structures. Collection, plotting and visualisng this kind of 3D data will be a key to better plan, minimise and execute this project with minimal conflict and hindrances caused to the other projects and structures. The 3D model of the entire stretch will also give an opportunity to minimise the impact on the environment along the proposed stretches and could also aid other studies to be done as a part of the DPR. The 3D model of the surrounding, when accompanied with the 3D rendered model of the skywalk itself, will be the key in identifying the best option in all respects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/skywalk-project-gets-entangled-in-red-tapism/article33055379.ece

The finding is considered to be path-breaking, as it embraces green technology for converting heat energy into electrical energy. The present-day technology relies on semiconductor materials based on lead-telluride and bismuth telluride, according to a release from the university. The young researcher has also fabricated a thermoelectric device, which works at room temperature for generating useful voltage/current from waste heat and cooling devices in low power mode. The new device can be used to extract energy from automotive exhausts and factory chimneys and can even be used in miniaturised devices for use as small transducers. Viable alternative The raw material for this device is available in plenty in India and is considered a viable green alternative to lead-based thermoelectric materials. Extensive laboratory tests have been conducted, and the device is working satisfactorily, the release added. The researcher had also demonstrated a refrigerator based on the newly developed material. Mr. Sriram is doing research for Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. M.R. Anantharaman, UGC-BSR faculty fellow of the department of physics.

The party has since been observing the day as ‘National Betrayal Day’. Addressing the media, APCC president S. Sailajanath said Mr. Modi had then claimed that cross-border terrorism would come down as the outfits would be starved of funds. “But nothing of that sort happened. It is evident that the move is aimed at helping the corporates convert their black money into white. The fact that 99.9% of the money reached the banks vouches for it,” Mr. Sailajanath said. Farm laws In the recent past, it was the turn of the farmers to get cheated, he said. The three farm laws that were enacted again benefited the corporates, he alleged. “The farm legislations are a State subject. But the Centre has enacted the laws that have been rejected by its ally,” he said. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy went a step forward and was gearing up to fix meters to farm connections, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-decries-centres-anti-people-policies/article33055010.ece

A release issued by the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations said as per the government estimates, about 177 districts in 21 States were prone to excessive fluoride content in the drinking water sources, impacting more than 6.2 crore people. The SSSCT has been installing water purification plants and the Sri Sathya Sai National Drinking Water Mission has demonstrated economic benefit and extended life cycle of the water purification plants that remove contaminants such as nitrate, arsenic, and other heavy metals. The Sathya Sai Trust has been working in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat on self-sustaining model of water purification systems, which have been set up in 108 villages. Nimish Pandya, all India president of Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations, underscored the potential of such decentralised water purification projects in rural and tribal areas in benefitting lakhs of individuals who do not have access to safe drinking water. “The Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations propose to expand this project further through collaborative endeavours as one of its flagship initiatives for community well-being ahead of the centenary year celebrations of Sri Sathya Sai Baba in 2025.  “Through this initiative, we will be contributing significantly to India’s efforts to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-6): availability and sustained management of water and sanitation for all by 2030,” he said. After the first plant was installed in 2006, the Mission has set up plants at an approximate cost of Rs. 5 lakh each. This includes physical infrastructure such as the building, electrical and civil works and, the machinery, material required for the plant. For the long-term maintenance of the scheme on its own, a user fee of Rs. 60 per month per household is sufficient, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sathya-sai-mission-sets-up-water-purification-system-in-108-villages/article33054993.ece

He gave us education and did all that was possible, within his limited means as a fisherman, and ensured that we all settled down in our lives,” says V. Das, a constable in the Armed Reserve (AR) Police. Mr. Das got a COVID-19 screening test done for his father, when he fell ill on July 23. He hadtested negative. “He died of heart attack in front of our house on August 3. I got his bust erected at the same place and converted the place into a temple,” Das said in a voice choked with emotion. His brothers and sisters came home and offered prayers at the bust of their father during Dasara. His mother lights a lamp every morning and evening at the statue. The fisherman, Vasupalli Demudu, was only 10-year-old, when he lost both his parents. He got married at the age of 18 and had four daughters and three sons. One of his daughters had died, and he brought up his other children well with his limited resources. “Me and my brothers used to accompany him on his boat, when he went for fishing. On three occasions, the boat capsized and we all escaped from the jaws of death. Later, he asked us to stay back at home and concentrate on our studies,” recalls Mr. Das. “My father was out at sea in his boat, when the Pakistani submarine Ghazi was sunk at the mouth of Visakhapatnam harbour by the Indian Navy in 1971. He saw life jackets floating on the waters a little while later. He rushed to the harbour and informed other fishermen about it,” he says. Mr. Das, who studied Intermediate, had joined the Police Department, when he was just 18. A self-taught photographer, his services were utilised by the police, when he was posted in the PR wing. He put up photographs that he had taken of his parents in happier times, on the walls of the temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-builds-temple-to-his-father/article33055396.ece

09 November 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rail coaches to be monitored online||The in-house team of South Central Railways (SCR) Coaching Depot here has developed a software prototype for integrated online monitoring of LHB coaches while on the run. It ensures safety of train movements and helps avoid detachment of coaches en route. The system continuously measure and record data points for online monitoring of axle box bearings and Wheel Slide Protection Device (WSPD) by making use of data analytics. WSPD, a combination of electronic cards fitted to electrical control panel units connected to cables, is meant to control the adhesion during brake applications. The failed bearings in axle box may lead to safety risks and hot axle potentially causes derailment or fire.

09 November 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||IoT pilot projects to be launched in MSME units in all districts||The State government is going to launch the Internet of Things (IoT) pilot projects in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in all the districts for studying energy efficiency measures with the support of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). With the success of the first pilot project in an MSME unit in East Godavari, the BEE has agreed for more such projects and sanctioned funds for them. Now, the AP State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM) will take up the project in five MSME units in each district with the support of the Department of Industries. Energy efficiency SECM CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy stated in a press release that the BEE was impressed by the sustainable efforts of the State government to improve energy performance in the MSME sector and responded to the proposal to implement the IoT project in selected MSMEs across the State. Chief Secretary and SECM chairperson Nilam Sawhney thanked the BEE for clearing the line for the pilot projects, which facilitate the installation of IoT-enabled power control devices in the MSMEs. The initial pilot project that was taken up in Padma Ceramics in East Godavari district gave excellent results. The IoT devices were found to have helped in saving about 11,000 units per annum in the whole cluster with an annual monetary benefit of Rs. 80,000. Real-time monitoring The devices support real-time monitoring of various electrical parameters and give information on voltage fluctuations continuously through mobile phone communication, which would enable the entrepreneurs to take steps that save energy. Energy-intensive sectors such as foundry and forgings, glass and ceramics, brick, textile, dairy and food processing were identified as big gainers from the IoT project. The distribution companies (Discoms) estimated that the MSME sector had energy saving potential of around 400 MU per annum at the rate of at least 10% per energy savings out of total consumption of 5,125 million kilo volt amperes an hour. Special Chief Secretary (industries) R. Karikal Valaven and Energy Secretary N. Srikant are monitoring the IoT initiative in the MSMEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/internet-of-things-to-help-cut-power-use-by-ap-msme-units/article33054688.ece

Chandrababu Naidu alleged on Sunday. The State government should own up moral responsibility for the incident, he said in a statement. “The YSRCP members had humiliated and insulted Legislative Council Chairman Sharif on the floor of the House. He was not allowed to conduct the proceedings in a dignified manner. A bid was made to molest a 10-year-old Muslim girl in Rajamahendravaram. When a case was filed, the local YSRCP leaders started bringing pressure on her father to withdraw the case, which ultimately forced him to attempt suicide,” Mr. Naidu alleged. “Abdul Salam’s family was pushed to the brink as the authorities forced it to confess to a crime it had not committed. The government, which was boasting of having control over law and order, owes an explanation to the people,” Mr. Naidu said, and demanded deterrent and exemplary action against the persons and officials responsible for the tragedy.

For the first time, TDP senior leaders like MLCs Dwarapureddi Jagadish and Gummadi Sandhya Rani took the initiative over the MANSAS Trust which has become a burning issue in the State with the proposed privatisation of MR College which is being run the trust. Former Union Minister and TDP senior leader P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju was removed from the trust which controls more than 12 educational institutions and properties worth Rs. 50,000 crore. The government appointed former MP Pusapati Anada Gajapathi Raju’s daughter Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as the chairperson of the trust which recently mooted privatisation of MR College, leading to widespread protests in the district. Round-table In this background, ‘Save Mansa-Save Education’ round-table conference was organised where Mr. Jagadish and Ms. Sandhya Rani alleged that the YSR Congress government was interfering in the trust to grab its properties and weaken Ashok Gajapathi family politically. They urged people to join hands and express their views in the month-long agitational programme. Member of Legislative Assembly Pakalapati Raghuvarma and Lok Satta Party State executive president Bhisetti Babji said that stalling admission process in MR College deprives the students of poor and middle class sections of pursuing higher education. Party parliamentary in-charge Kimidi Nagarjuna lauded the active participation of many organisations in the struggle for the protection of MR College. Aam Admi Party leader K. Dayanand felt that there should not be any political involvement in MANSAS affairs since the trust was created to ensure overall development of the North Andhra region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/parties-join-hands-to-step-up-struggle-on-mansas/article33055000.ece

09 November 2020||Adilabad,TELANGANA||CCI slashes support price||The Cotton Corporation of India’s decision to slash the Minimum Support Price, has rattled the cotton farmers in erstwhile Adilabad district, who are already saddled with high natural moisture content due to foggy weather and pink bollworm infection in the crops. Starting Monday, the CCI said that it would lift the produce at Rs. 5,775 per quintal as against Rs. 5,825 per quintal for which the cotton was purchased till Saturday. The decision was taken as the strength of the cotton ball is reportedly less than 30 mm length this season due untimely rains. “Even the farmers, who got quality produce with strength more or less 30 mm length have to sell their produce for the new price,” an official said. Moreover, farmers can get Rs. 5,775 per quintal only if the moisture content is up to 8 %. If moisture is more than 8 %, the CII deducts the price per quintal and the farmer ends up getting less money. So, to bring down the moisture content, farmers in several villages in the district are drying their produce in front of the houses, before it is taken to the market yard to get good price. M Sudarshan of Khodad village in Talamadugu mandal said that for the past few days he has been drying the crop in front of his house as the moisture content was very high.“This year, I got less produce due to bad weather conditions, and adding to that CCI has slashed the MSP,” he said. Every year, Mr.Sudarshan gets at least 80 quintals of cotton from his eight acre, but this time he ended up harvesting only 30 quintals due to untimely rains. “Most of it was damaged due to rains and many have destroyed the crop due to pink bollworm infection,” he said while drying the ‘white gold’ in front of his house. Satish, another farmer from Bela mandal said that they have to sell the cotton to CCI, as private cotton traders, who colluded with Ginning and Pressing factory owners are taking undue advantage of the high moisture content and exploiting them and offering low prices. “If CCI rejects the product, we are forced to sell it to private traders and ginning factory owners at a very low price,” he said. Caught between mounds of cotton on one side and staring at less net realisation, the farmers are thrown into the debt trap. Earlier, small and medium ginning and pressing enterprisers alleged that they were not getting sufficient orders from the CCI to process cotton ‘kapas’ into bales, as most of the cotton was sent to a few big ginners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cci-slashes-support-price/article33055260.ece

09 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||2 killed as car rams unipole||In a suspected case of drunk driving, two youngsters, including a techie, were killed and two others suffered severe injuries after the car they were travelling in rammed a unipole in Secunderabad late on Saturday night. The youngsters were going towards Neredmet after partying in a pub at Jubilee Hills when the accident took place at 12.35 a.m. between Secunderabad Club and Trimulgherry under Karkhana police station limits. When they passed Secunderabad Club, G. Sai Kiran Reddy (25), an IT employee from Neredmet, lost control on the wheel and hit an electric pole in the road median before crashing into a uni pole. The sedan further rolled over and turned turtle before coming to a halt, Karkhana inspector P. Madhukar Swamy said. Sai Kiran Reddy and Goshika Sahil (24), an interior designer from Keesara, who was sitting next to the former, died on the spot, while two — Sai Charan Reddy and Preetam Roy — who occupied the rear seats, suffered severe injuries in the crash and are battling for life at a corporate hospital in Secunderabad. Even the air bags that opened after the crash could not save Sai Kiran and Sahil, Mr. Swamy said, and added that the car was zooming at at least 102 kmph. He said that the victims were going to Roy’s restaurant in Neredmet for dinner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/techie-among-2-killed-as-car-rams-unipole/article33055267.ece
09 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘BJP gives flood relief to Karnataka but not TS’||TRS working president and Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao has accused the Central government of ignoring Telangana in providing flood relief but promptly helping States where the BJP is in power. At a press conference here on Sunday, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prompt to release the money to Karnataka within four days of a letter seeking assistance whereas there is no sign of help to Telangana. He said Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 15 explaining the losses suffered in floods in Hyderabad and requested for release of Rs. 1,350 crore as immediate relief. At the same time, Rs. 669 crore was released to Karnataka within four days of its Chief Minister B.S. Yeduirappa writing a letter to the Centre. Taking a dig at the Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy, he said the Minister was not of any assistance to the State while their leaders make tall claims that were nothing but lies. “The State BJP leaders should introspect and get assistance from the Centre as a responsible party rather than making silly claims or take-up programmes to hamper the government’s assistance to flood victims,” he said. “After their utter failure to get any assistance from the Centre, they are now taking up a programme ‘Mana City Mana BJP’ (Our city Our BJP). What right do they have to go to people with their failures?” he asked. ‘No misappropriation’ Mr. Rao brushed aside the allegation of misappropriation of money in the flood relief distribution of Rs. 10,000 to the affected families and said Congress and BJP were making baseless allegations. “The government has account of each and every penny distributed with Aadhar numbers of telephone numbers of beneficiaries recorded and available with the GHMC officials,” he said. “However, some parties are provoking people when the assistance was going on smoothly. Where were they when Ministers and Telangana Rashtra Samithi MLAs were visiting flood-affected families every day?” he asked. The Minister justified distribution of cash, stating that bank passbooks of majority of people were either washed away in the floods or soaked. “We couldn’t ask people to get their bank account numbers as placing cash in their hands was more important,” he said. “The Chief Minister was kind to release Rs. 554 crore immediately for relief measures and Opposition parties are making politics out of such a gracious step. If any people are left out for any reason the government will cover them. If there is a need we will ask the CM to release another Rs. 100 crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-gives-flood-relief-to-karnataka-but-not-ts/article33055258.ece
09 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Kin allege ACB harassment||Rachakonda police are yet to reconstruct the sequence of events in Dharma Reddy’s ‘suicide’ case, even as his family members alleged that harassment of ACB officials drove him to resort to the extreme step. Dharma Reddy is the second person to end his life in corruption cases linked to seizure of Rs. 1.10 crore from Keesara Tahsildar E.B. Nagaraju. His body was found hanging from a tree in an open area close to a place of worship at Vasavi Shivanagar of Kushaiguda. “Our father left home around 11 a.m. on Saturday. He did not return home since then,” his daughters Uma Devi and Suchitra told the media. What happened after he left his home before being found dead on Sunday is yet to be ascertained. “Where had he gone after leaving home, whom did he meet and other precise details are being found out,” Kushaiguda police said. “He was visibly disturbed after coming out on bail, having spent 33 days in prison after being arrested by the ACB,” his wife Venkatamma said. According to her, he felt humiliated and often complained that he was being harassed by ACB officials. Two days ago, he left home but returned late in the night. “When he stepped out on Saturday also, we hoped he would come back albeit a bit late. But he was found dead,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kin-allege-acb-harassment/article33055263.ece
09 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP favours open debate||BJP State vice-president and former MLA N.V.S.S. Prabhakar on Sunday once again challenged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Minister K.T. Rama Rao to a "debate" on the funds released by the Centre for Telangana and the flood relief activities taken up in the twin cities. He claimed that the Centre had already released Rs. 224 crore for repairs to the national highways and Rs. 202 crore had been released from the disaster management funds. A high-powered delegation of officials had already toured the flood-hit areas and had been patiently waiting for a comprehensive report from the TS government. "The TRS government has neither submitted a proper report to the team nor has made adequate arrangements for them to meet the affected farmers. The BJP leader said the TRS leadership was more keen on getting land for party office in Delhi rather than lobbying for sufficient funds from the Centre. "Here the government just addressed a letter to the Prime Minister seeking help for relief measures and later washed its hands of the need to provide better relief to the affected persons," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-favours-open-debate/article33055254.ece

Mishra has assured the real estate industry and the builders’ fraternity of all possible support to address various issues concerning them. The bank would continue to strive for being the “banker of first choice to builders”, he said. He was speaking at a meeting with the CREDAI-Hyderabad to strengthen the relationship between the bank and developers and to discuss issues relating to home loan sanctions, project tie-ups and project funding. He said the pain points arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic had been addressed to a large extent through relief measures like moratorium on EMIs, charging of simple interest during moratorium period and extending emergency line of credit to builders. Loan book contribution Real estate segment was the main focus area for the bank and this portfolio was the major contributor to its loan book. Only 60% of the builders availed the COVID Line of Credit from the bank in Telangana while the turnaround time for home loan sanctions from projects approved under the bank tie-up was five days. The SBI was extending quick, prompt and hassle-free services in sanction of housing loans which had been acknowledged by many customers. The bank had recently opened a new RACPC (retail assets central processing centre) at Kompally to provide easy reach/access to customers, taking the total number of these centres in the city to nine. The bank was promoting use of digital platform for retail loans and offering concession of 0.05% interest rate in addition to waiver of processing fee for loan applications through YONO. He favoured meeting with builders and the industry at frequent intervals so that various aspects concerning them could be discussed and action initiated. He assured that other issues which required the intervention of the corporate centre would be taken up. CREDAI-Hyderabad president P. Ramakrishna Rao and general secretary V. Rajasekhar Reddy represented the organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sbi-assures-all-support-to-real-estate-industry-and-builders/article33055248.ece
09 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CPI criticises BJP govt.’s ‘vindictive’ attitude||The State council of CPI has criticized the BJP-led Central government for adopting “vindictive” attitude towards Telangana in extending financial assistance to the State which is hit by COVID-19 pandemic and natural calamities. The BJP-led Central government’s administration appeared politically motivated as could be seen from the manner in which attempts were being made to usurp the rights of the States and create problems to States ruled by other parties, CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said. In a statement, he faulted the Central government for not responding to the State’s request to extend financial assistance to bridge the deficit in revenue due to COVID-19 and tackle the situation arising out of the recent heavy rains/floods.Mr. Venkat Reddy said the State suffered property and crop losses in excess of Rs. 10,000 crore due to the recent heavy rains, but the Centre remained unmoved in extending assistance to the State on humanitarian grounds. He expressed concern that there was scope for steep cuts in the budget for welfare and developmental programmes going by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s announcement that there could be revenue deficit in excess of Rs. 52,000 crore on account of COVID-19 and natural calamities this financial year. He urged the Chief Minister to take the initiative to mount pressure on the Centre and secure funds required for the State. BJP MPs from the State led by Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy should take responsibility of convincing the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpi-criticises-bjp-govts-vindictive-attitude/article33055255.ece

09 November 2020||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Paddy farmers stopped from entering Miryalaguda||“CM KCR said sannalu (fine variety paddy) commands good rate, but now we are forced to sell at Rs. 1400 and even less per quintal. MSP for grade A variety is Rs. 1,888. Why can’t the government procure at the price it advocated?” asks an aggrieved farmer, among several others, who were stopped by the police from entering Miryalaguda on Sunday. Another farmer, among the protesting group on Chillepalli-Musi bridge, requests police to allow farmers to market yards in Miryalaguda instead of rice mills, so that the produce that would get damaged soon could be sold at least at Rs. 1000 per quintal. Miryalaguda, the centre for rice industries, has been witnessing inflow of fine variety paddy like never before. Since the start of procurement by rice mills last week, already thousands of vehicles have been cleared and several more are in queue, following the token system. Procurement bandh According to farmers, it took about four days to reach the selling point – the day of arrival, two days to get the token and another day or two till the tractors are unloaded and considered. As a result, the grain shows discoloration and develops other signs of damage, and the low rate per quintal. In the wake of the record paddy inflows, storage silos at all the rice mills in Miryalaguda were filled to the maximum. And farmers were advised to harvest their produce only on the day of bringing the load to the mill, to avoid grain blackening and damage. “There are already hundreds of vehicles in queues, and it would take about four days to clear the pendency and arrange storage. Farmers should note procurement will commence on Wednesday, it is a bandh till Tuesday,” Karnati Ramesh, president of Nalgonda District Rice Miller’s Association – Miryalaguda (NDRMA-M), had earlier issued a statement. And hence, police camps on the several routes to Miryalaguda to bar the entry of farmers, leading to protests and criticism of the government for regulated farming system, particularly fine paddy variety. In view of the situation, the district administration has been monitoring the situation closely, reviewing procurement status with rice millers and advising farmers on harvesting. On Sunday, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy met officials and leaders from Nalgonda and Suryapet, to discuss and issue guidelines on the procurement. He said the major problem at Miryalaguda was paddy inflow beyond the capacity of the rice mills. “On a single day about 4, 500 tractors had reached Miryalaguda, while the actual capacity is 1, 500 tractors per day. As discussed, farmers will be issued tokens at market yards, only after which they should harvest their produce and bring it to rice mills,” he said, addressing media persons. Mr. Reddy advised farmers not to hurry, but to ensure quality of the paddy as millers were ready to offer more rate per quintal, and soon fine variety paddy would fetch better rates in the market, he said. He said action would be initiated if centres bought paddy at less than prescribed rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/paddy-farmers-stopped-from-entering-miryalaguda/article33055257.ece

He was saved by other farmers present there. According to sources, Nakkal Bapu Reddy of Peddagundavelli village in Dubbak mandal cultivated fine variety (Sanna Rakalu) paddy in three out of the five acres. In addition to heavy rains, attack by mosquitoes damaged crop there by reducing the crop yield incurring huge loss for farmers. As crop loss was huge, he put fire to the crop and tried to jump into it. Neighboring farmers prevented him from doing so. Many of the farmers said that they have cultivated fine variety as suggested by the government but now it has been rejecting to come to their rescue. Farmers’ plea Meanwhile, G.

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Chief Minister’s wife in media glare||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s wife Sobhamma who had always kept herself away from media glare could not help attracting attention on Sunday as she sent an aid of Rs. 1 lakh to a poor family at Tirumalapur village of Ramadugu mandal in Karimnagar district. She sent the money to the local MLA of TRS S. Ravishanker and asked him to hand it over to the family of K. Tirupati who died of illness recently. After the death of Tirupati, his family of wife, two children and aged parents took shelter in a community hall because their house had collapsed in recent rains. Touched by their plight, Ms. Sobhamma called up the MLA requesting him to hand over the money on her behalf to the family. The MLA pooled another Rs. 2 lakh from his side and donors to help the affected persons. He also promised them a double bedroom house and admission of children in a residential school.   After the unprecedented floods, it is now politics centred around the relief works. The government, as an instant relief, released Rs. 570 crore and started distribution of Rs. 10,000 each to families whose houses were inundated. The initiative however was marred by complaints that relief was reaching only select few as was evident from the dharnas staged by residents in some affected areas. The opposition parties picked up the thread alleging several irregularities in the manner in which the relief 'is being distributed by the ruling party leaders and cadre'. Minister K. T. Rama Rao was quick to respond claiming that the opposition parties are indulging in politicising the relief measures.     Rise in corona cases in schools in Andhra Pradesh that opened them recently and the subsequent political outrage the Telangana government seems to be adopting a very cautious approach. Officials are in a dilemma even to propose opening the schools though there is some discussion on colleges and universities. Opening the schools, going by the present thinking in the government, may the last priority and they are unlikely to be opened for this calendar year at least. The reasons are obvious. It is difficult to monitor the school kids once in school while bringing them to schools itself will be a tough task given the transport issues and the consent of the parents. And Andhra Pradesh experience has put the officials on the defensive in taking a positive decision.   At a time when the World Health Organisation and other experts re advising the governments world over to observe utmost precaution for the next three months to prevent another bout of COVID-19 pandemic, all sections of society including the administration in the State appear to have thrown caution to the winds. In spite of slow increase in the cases, the norm of social distancing is being given the go-by at all places where it is supposed to be maintained. Except for body temperature checking, there is no social distancing in shops, malls, restaurants and other public places. The travel in TS RTC buses is most care-free as no norms are followed.  (N.

09 November 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana CM does U-turn on cracker ban in the State||In a U-turn over ban on firecrackers in the State, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Sunday announced that a two-hour window would be allowed to sell and burst crackers on Deepavali. In a tweet from his personal twitter handle in the evening, Mr. Lal said that two-hour relaxation would be allowed on Deepavali to sell and burst crackers. He said the decision was taken in adherence to the National Green Tribunal’s directions in view of increase in air pollution. Earlier, Mr. Lal, on November 6, had said that there would be complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers in the State. Mixed response Though the traders welcomed the decision, environmentalists and citizens expressed shock over the about-turn saying that they were left “disappointed”. Ashok Kumar, a firecrackers dealer in Gadauli Khurd village here, said the traders had already suffered huge loss during the lockdown and now the complete ban on crackers would have spelt a doom for them. He welcomed the decision saying that it would help the firecracker dealers to make good the losses, adding that they all had green crackers adhering to the norms. “But the directions from the Chief Minister are not clear. The administration is in doubt whether to allow sale of firecrackers for two hours daily till Deepavali or only on the day of the festival,” said Mr. Kumar. Expresses shock Neelam Ahluwalia, Aravalli Bachao Campaigner, said: “We were hoping to see tough decisions being taken by the government to control air pollution by sending notices to all RWAs and market associations on firecracker ban. Instead, we are shocked to see the Chief Minister make a U-turn on his earlier decision to ban sale of crackers. How can the Chief Minister and the Haryana administration ensure that people will burst crackers only for two hours on Deepavali?” “North India is a gas chamber right now. Delhi, Gurugram, and NCR’s air quality is in ‘severe category’. With AQI of above 450, my eyes are burning sitting inside the house. Why do we want to add more toxicity to the already poisonous air by burning firecrackers?,” asked Anu Prasad Dhawan, a concerned Gurugram citizen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/haryana-cm-does-u-turn-on-cracker-ban-in-the-state/article33054940.ece

09 November 2020||Mumbai,||Uddhav hints at reopening of religious places after Deepavali||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday appealed to people to exercise restraint this Deepavali and avoid bursting firecrackers. He hinted at the reopening of religious places after the festival. “Everyone has been asking about the reopening of temples, let me assure you that we will open them soon. However, we will have to let Deepavali and the following 15 days pass,” he said. ‘No ban on crackers’ Mr. Thackeray praised the public for cooperating with the government over the past eight months. “Over the last few days, COVID-19 cases in Mumbai, Pune and across the State have reduced. This has been possible with all your efforts. However, cases are rising in the country. I have been told the surge in Delhi is due to pollution. That’s why we need to avoid bursting crackers. While there is no need to ban them, I want people to believe that we can celebrate the festival without imposing the law,” he said. The Chief Minister appealed to people to continue to support the government in preventing a second wave of COVID-19. “For this, I once again look forward to your cooperation. What we have achieved so far should not be wasted in just four days. I urge you not to burst crackers in public places,” he said. Mr. Thackeray said the State government is in talks with the Centre on restarting local trains. “Classes IX to XII will be starting after Deepavali as per the government’s standard operating procedure. It is our duty to take care of our elders and the decision has been taken keeping their health in mind. Even if I am portrayed unfavourably, I assure you all that I shall forever stand for the people of Maharashtra and will do everything in my capacity for the betterment of the State,” he said. On bringing the economy back on track, Mr. Thackeray said MoUs worth Rs. 17,000 crore were signed in June despite “Maharashtra-haters” running a campaign to malign the State’s image. “Even last week, we signed an MoU worth Rs. 35,000 crore. Many local and foreign companies are ready to invest in Maharashtra and we are proud of that,” Mr. Thackeray said. He said the State has received a loan of 545 million Euros from Germany’s KFW for the Metro project “at a very reasonable interest rate and will benefit the city”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uddhav-hints-at-reopening-of-religious-places-after-deepavali/article33054874.ece

09 November 2020||Pune,||NCP sees similarities in Biden, Pawar’s ‘rain rallies’||With the Democratic Party’s candidate and U.S. President-elect Joe Biden set to capture the White House after a hard-won electoral contest, the politically influential Pawar clan has been quick to spot similarities between Mr. Biden’s Florida rally in pouring rain last month and Mr. Pawar’s eye-catching rally in Satara before the Assembly polls last year. Mr. Pawar’s daughter, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule, and his grand-nephew, MLA Rohit Pawar, put up pictures on their respective Twitter accounts detailing Mr. Biden’s and Mr. Pawar’s ‘rain-rallies’. “How does it matter if you are older, their energy to work for the people will give even the youth a run for their money. That is why they are always victorious. They have strong faith in their values and they fight for it. We saw this happening in Maharashtra and now it is happening in America as well,” tweeted Ms. Sule. ‘Determined men’ The caption of the photo posted by the Baramati MP, which shows Mr. Pawar’s Satara rally in pelting rain in 2019 alongside Mr. Biden speaking in Florida on October 29 this year, read thus: “One determined man showed how it could be done [Mr. Pawar in Maharashtra]…and so did another [Mr. Biden in the U.S.].” Rohit Pawar, a first-time legislator from Karjat-Jamkhed, went even further to suggest that like Mr. Biden’s win against the Trump government in the U.S., winds of change were in the offing in Bihar. The younger Mr. Pawar was making a subtle comparison of Mr. Trump to the Nitish Kumar-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance, which is pitted against the Mahagathbandhan led by Lalu Prasad’s son, Tejashwi Yadav, of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, supported by the Congress and the Left parties. All eyes on Bihar results “This is a victory against the dictatorial government in the United States and a change for American voters for their bright future. Congratulations to the newly elected President of the United States, Joe Biden and best wishes for the future,” tweeted Rohit Pawar. In a thinly veiled jibe at the BJP, he said: “We expect a similar change in Bihar’s results.” Senior NCP leader and Maharashtra Minister Dr. Jitendra Awhad, too, chimed in, posting the same picture while tweeting: “Pawar Saheb Factor Works in US too…Hard work, commitment, integrity leads to victory.” The NCP chief’s much-publicised, eye-catching pre-Assembly election speech in Satara in October last year had become a visual shorthand for the Opposition’s fight against the BJP in the Assembly polls, and did much to rally public opinion behind the NCP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ncp-sees-similarities-in-biden-pawars-rain-rallies/article33054878.ece

09 November 2020||WILMINGTON,||Biden steers pandemic politics to victory||Joe Biden was fresh off winning the Michigan primary and effectively capturing the Democratic presidential nomination, a prize he had sought for the better part of three decades. Instead of plotting a strategy to build momentum, he was contemplating an abrupt halt. As the coronavirus began to explode across the U.S. that March, Mr. Biden asked a question that would ultimately guide the campaign’s thinking for months: “What should I be modelling?” The health experts recommended the 77-year-old Biden step away from campaigning as soon as possible, both for his safety and that of staff and supporters. Mr. Biden agreed. He decided that he and every staff member would work from home starting that weekend. All field offices would be closed. It was a decision without precedent in modern American politics. Barack Obama and John McCain returned to Washington in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign to respond to that year’s financial collapse, but only briefly. In an era when voters are accustomed to seeing their presidential candidates constantly, the idea of a complete withdrawal was unthinkable. That was especially true for Mr. Biden, whose tactile approach to politics is legendary. “It was a hard call,” said Jake Sullivan, a senior Biden adviser. “If there’s no pandemic, he gets a chance to get out and do what he does, which is retail campaigning, meeting people where they are, having the opportunity to sit with folks and speak to crowds and walk down the street. That’s what he would have preferred, obviously.” For Mr. Biden, who has been elected the 46th President of the United States, perhaps no decision was more consequential to his victory, making it possible to flip States such as Arizona and Wisconsin, where coronavirus infections and hospitalisations spiked the week of the election. Still, the cautious approach prompted ridicule from President Donald Trump, who constantly teased Biden for “hiding in his basement” and returned to large in-person events much sooner than his rival, and with far fewer precautions. Some Democrats also worried. Several State party chairs and down-ballot candidates privately urged the campaign to resume in-person events and canvassing. Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa warned that Latino turnout could suffer. The lack of personal outreach has been blamed for contributing to Mr. Biden’s poor showing with Latinos in Florida, a battleground that Mr. Trump won. Difficult choices But Mr. Biden refused to change course, defining himself early on as a responsible foil to Mr. Trump, someone who could make difficult choices and serve as something of a role model to a country facing a historic set of crises.  This account of Mr. Biden’s rise to the presidency is based on interviews with more than a dozen people who hold senior positions in the Biden and Trump campaigns along with strategists and donors in each party. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the turbulent campaign with candor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-steers-pandemic-politics-to-victory/article33054669.ece
09 November 2020||WASHINGTON,||After defeat, Trump mulls how to keep up the fight||President Donald Trump never admits defeat. But he faces a stark choice now that Democrat Joe Biden has won the White House — concede graciously for the sake of the nation or don’t — and get evicted anyway. After nearly four tortured days of counting yielded a victory for Mr. Biden on Saturday, Mr. Trump was still insisting the race was not over. He threw out baseless allegations of voter fraud, promised a flurry of legal action and fired off all-caps tweets falsely insisting he’d “WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT.” Mr. Trump is not expected to ever formally concede, according to people close to him, but is likely to grudgingly vacate the White House at the end of his term. His ongoing efforts to paint the election as unfair are seen both as an effort to soothe a bruised ego and to show his loyal base of supporters that he is still fighting. That could be key to keeping them energized for what comes next. “He intends to fight,” Mr. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. Would Mr. Trump ever concede? “I doubt it,” said Mr. Trump’s longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, whose prison sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump in July. Mr. Stone asserted that Mr. Biden, as a result, will have “a cloud over his presidency with half the people in the country believing that he was illegitimately elected.” Allies suggested that if Mr. Trump wants to launch a media empire in coming years, he has an incentive to prolong the drama. So, too, if he intends to keep the door open to a possible 2024 comeback — he would be only a year older then than Mr. Biden is now. There are many in his inner circle egging him on, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. The former New York Mayor has been promising to provide the President with evidence of voter fraud but has produced little, including during a press conference he held Saturday in the parking lot of a small Philadelphia landscaping company next to an adult bookstore. Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also urged their father to keep fighting and challenged Republicans to stand with them. Other political allies and White House officials, however, have pressed Mr. Trump to change his tone and commit to a smooth transition. They’ve emphasized to him that history will be a harsh judge of any action he takes that is seen as undermining his successor. And they have advised him to deliver a speech in the coming week pledging to support the transition. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has told others that he has urged the President to accept the outcome of the race — even if Mr. Trump won’t come to terms with how it was reached. Smooth transition At Fox News, where prime-time hosts wield enormous influence over Mr. Trump, Laura Ingraham gave voice to the President’s belief that the election had been unfair, while also pleading with him to keep his legacy in mind — and preserve his status as a GOP kingmaker — by gracefully leaving office. “If and when it’s time to accept an unfavorable outcome in this election, and we hope it never comes, President Trump needs to do it with the same grace and composure that he demonstrated at that town hall with Savannah Guthrie,” she said on Thursday. “President Trump’s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward.” This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen of Trump aides and allies, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. ‘Never accept defeat’ That the peaceful transfer of power was even in doubt reflected the norm-shattering habits of the now-lame duck President, who even in victory never admitted that he had lost the popular vote in 2016. Most aides believed the President would take the weekend to decide on a plan, which will most certainly involve more legal action. But some aides believe the legal skirmishes are more about putting up the appearance of a fight than producing results. There were some indications Mr. Trump was moving in a less contentious direction, even as he continued to angrily complain to aides, reviving old grievances about the Russia investigation that began under President Barack Obama, In a statement on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested he would avail himself of every avenue under the law to challenge the election’s result. Allies interpreted it as a begrudging acknowledgement of the likely outcome.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/after-defeat-trump-mulls-how-to-keep-up-the-fight/article33054675.ece
09 November 2020||Washington,||As Trump refuses to concede, top Republicans stay mum||As President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat on Saturday, top Republican congressional leaders followed suit, refraining from releasing the customary statements congratulating the victor that have been standard among senior lawmakers in both parties when a presidential election has been declared. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declined Saturday to acknowledge Biden’s victory, with an aide instead pointing reporters to a generic “count all the votes” statement McConnell released Friday before the results were known. His silence on Saturday came as other Republican leaders also kept mum about the results and some openly questioned it. “The election isn’t over until all legal votes are counted and certified,” Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican, said on Twitter. “There are still serious legal challenges that have been made, and until that process is resolved, the election is not final. The American people deserve a fair and transparent process.” The reactions suggested that Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent four years clinging tightly to Mr. Trump or at least have avoided publicly countering him for fear of provoking an angry tweet, were sticking to those approaches even after his loss. In the weeks leading up to the election, as Mr. Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, some Republicans, including Mr. McConnell, gently pushed back without directly rebuking the president, making it clear that if he were to lose, they expected him to abide by the results. But Mr. Trump’s reluctance to accept his defeat and his angry and false insistence on Saturday that he had in fact won raised questions about whether any senior Republican would be willing to contradict him. Only a handful of rank-and-file Republicans, including some who are not likely to face voters again, offered their good wishes for Mr. Biden. Several Republicans, who are regarded as rising stars in the party, said any congratulations were premature, portraying the results as a creation of the news media and alluding to the possibility of legal action that could change them.NY Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-trump-refuses-to-concede-top-republicans-stay-mum/article33054673.ece
09 November 2020||Tehran,||Next U.S. govt. must make up for past mistakes: Iran||Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday said the next U.S. administration has an opportunity to “compensate for its previous mistakes” following Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. “Now there is an opportunity for the future American administration to compensate for its previous mistakes and return to the path of adherence to international commitments,” Mr. Rouhani said, in a statement on his official website. U.S. President Donald Trump has applied a “maximum pressure” policy and crippling sanctions against Iran since his 2018 withdrawal from a landmark nuclear agreement with Tehran. The reimposed sanctions targeted Iran’s vital oil industry and banking ties, among other sectors. This U.S. “administration’s harmful and wrong policy for the past three years was not only condemned by people all around the world, but was also opposed by the people of (the U.S.) in the recent election,” Mr. Rouhani said. He added that the Iranian people’s “heroic resistance against the imposed economic war” by the Trump administration “proved that America’s maximum pressure policy is doomed to fail.” Mr. Biden has said during his campaign that he plans to embark on a “credible path to return to diplomacy” with Iran, and raised the possibility of returning to the 2015 nuclear deal, negotiated when he was vice president under Barack Obama.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/next-us-govt-must-make-up-for-past-mistakes-iran/article33054671.ece

Mr. Abiy’s office did not give reasons for the personnel changes, which come as he is pursuing a military campaign against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), a powerful ethnic faction that led the ruling coalition for decades until Abiy took office in 2018. Mr. Abiy’s office said in a statement that Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen had been appointed Foreign Minister while deputy Army chief Birhanu Jula was promoted to Army Chief of Staff. Temesgen Tiruneh, who was President of the Amhara region, was appointed as the new intelligence chief. Amhara regional state forces have been fighting alongside their federal counterparts in Tigray. Countries in the region fear that the fighting could spark a civil war in Africa’s second most populous nation and destabilise the Horn of Africa region. Tigrayans dominated Ethiopian politics for decades until Abiy reorganised the ruling coalition into a single party which the TPLF refused to join.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tigray-crisis-abiy-replaces-top-officials/article33054664.ece

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||COVID-19, climate and carbon neutrality||History is divided into two periods: Before the Common Era or BCE and Common Era or CE. But given our experience this year, BCE could well stand for Before the COVID-19 Epidemic and CE for the COVID-19 Epidemic. To say that 2020 has been cataclysmic is to state the obvious and actually make an understatement. Our lives have been turned upside down. The COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath can be seen either as a longish pause on the button of economic growth or as an opportunity for reset, recalibration and rethink. Ecological disequilibrium COVID-19 is undoubtedly a public health catastrophe and certainly calls for enhanced investments in research and development that impinges directly on public health. But more fundamentally, the pandemic reflects fundamental ecological disequilibrium. Evidence has accumulated that loss of biodiversity and ever-increasing human incursions into the natural world have contributed heavily to the outbreak and spread of epidemic diseases. Understanding the three Es — evolution, ecology and the environment — will be key to identifying potential pandemics. COVID-19 also reinforces the need to pay far greater attention to the biosciences that underpin agriculture, health and the environment that are going to be profoundly impacted by the current pandemic. There is also now robust scientific evidence to show, for instance, how air pollution exacerbates the impacts of COVID-19. Public health science and environmental science are two sides of the same coin. In fact, I have been saying for over a decade now that our environmental problems — such as air pollution, water pollution, chemical contamination, deforestation, waste generation and accumulation, land degradation and excessive use of pesticides — all have profound public health consequences both in terms of morbidity and mortality and hence demand urgent actions. The traditional ‘grow now, pay later’ model is not only unsustainable in the medium- to long-term but also dangerous to public health in the short term. We live in a world where climate change is a reality. No longer can we argue about uncertainties in the monsoon, the frequency of extreme events, the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers and the increase in mean sea levels. A recent report of the Ministry of Earth Sciences called ‘Assessment of climate change over the Indian region’ is an excellent and up-to-date analysis that deserves wider debate and discussion. It also points to the need for making our future science and technology strategy in different areas anchored in an understanding of the impacts of climate change caused by continued emissions of greenhouse gases. This scientific understanding is essential for what may be a solution at one point of time but becomes a problem at another point and may even become a threat in a different context. Take the example of HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, that were at one time seen as the panacea to fix the depletion of the ozone layer. The depletion of the ozone layer has been fixed more or less, but HFCs are a potent threat from a climate change perspective since their global warming potential is a thousand times that of carbon dioxide. In September 2018, the American State of California — the world’s fifth largest economy in itself — was the first to commit itself to carbon neutrality. The aim was to achieve this by 2045. In December 2019, a few weeks before the world became aware of the COVID-19 catastrophe, the European Union followed California’s example but with the year 2050 in mind. In September 2020, China stunned the world by declaring its goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. And just a few weeks ago, Japan and South Korea joined the club by announcing their intention to do so by 2050, like the EU. India too has to begin thinking very seriously about its level of ambition in this regard, especially since this will have public health consequences as well. We cannot always hide behind the fact that our per capita emissions will continue to be low — that is obvious given the continued increase in the denominator. At the Paris climate change conference in December 2015, we committed to having 40% of our electricity-generating capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by the year 2030. I have no doubt that we will reach this level. A bolder, more worthwhile goal However, carbon neutrality is something different. Definitions vary but in simple terms — and I am deliberately not getting into complications introduced by instruments like offsets — it should mean that for a country, carbon emissions are equal to absorptions in carbon sinks, of which forests are one. Both sides of the equation are important and have to be addressed simultaneously. At Paris in December 2015, we made a commitment on carbon sequestration through forests but I have serious doubts on its credibility. To my mind, this is a matter of overriding priority. We will definitely become a $5 trillion economy in a few years. That is an arithmetical inevitability — give or take a few years. Carbon neutrality, on the other hand, is a far bolder and worthwhile goal, the attainment of which has to be consciously engineered. It will involve massive scientific invention and technological innovation especially when it comes to removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. But let me add one note of caution here based on our disappointing experience with nuclear energy: there is simply no silver bullet waiting for human ingenuity to harness. Every solution being put forward these days, the most recent of which is what we refer to as geo-engineering, is riddled with complications that are not easy to resolve. Of course, renewables are an integral part of the solutions we seek but they have to be seen as more than just devices: they open up avenues for re-architecturing systems as a whole. This has happened, for instance, in the German electricity sector over the past decade and a half. Post-COVID-19 world The post-COVID-19 world is an opportunity for us to switch gears and make a radical departure from the past to make economic growth ecologically sustainable. Much of the infrastructure we need for the future is still to be put in place — one estimate widely quoted that something like 70% of the infrastructure required in India by the year 2050 is waiting to be established. GDP growth must, without doubt, revive and get back to a steady 7%-8% growth path. However, in this post-COVID-19 world, we should make efforts to ensure that the ‘G’ in GDP is not ‘Gross’ but ‘Green’. In fact, some years back, Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor at Cambridge University and one of the world’s greatest environmental economists, had prepared a fairly detailed framework for this. India can and should show to the world how the measurement of economic growth can take place while taking into account both ecological pluses and minuses.

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||The U.S. vote is about building back better||The 2020 U.S. presidential election has been one of many firsts. It witnessed the highest ever voter turnout numbers for the winner, Democrat and former Vice-President Joe Biden, whose tally has soared past 74 million, compared to 71 million for his rival, Republican and incumbent President Donald Trump. The victory of Mr. Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris, whose pick by Mr. Biden as running mate likely galvanised a phalanx of minority voters to their side, marked the first time in U.S. history that a woman and a woman of colour has been elected Vice-President. After he turns 78 years of age later this month, Mr. Biden will also be the oldest person sworn in as President. On the Republican side, Mr. Trump will be the first U.S. President since 1992, the third elected President since World War II, and only the 11th President in U.S. history to lose a re-election bid. He is also only the second U.S. President in history, and the first since Benjamin Harrison in 1889, to lose the popular vote yet successfully nominate at least three Supreme Court justices. The fact that the 2020 election enters the history books for all of these reasons says something profound about the democratic exercise itself: it was one of the most fiercely fought presidential contests in recent memory, mirrored in intensity perhaps only by the 2008 election that saw the U.S. elect its first ever African-American President, Barack Obama. While the 2020 election came after nearly four turbulent years under one of the most unconventional, controversial and divisive Presidents that the country has ever seen, in many ways it was unexpectedly close, both in terms of the margins in the swing States and the popular vote. The Trump years This begs the question: if indeed Mr. Trump was seen as the President who shredded not only every norm and tradition of the Oval Office, but also the very fabric of the Republican Party itself, why did north of 71 million voters put their faith in him, many possibly for the second time? To answer that question, it is first worth recalling the highlights of the Trump presidency, particularly the events that were seen as breaking with history in terms of the conduct of the Commander-in-Chief. Mr. Trump set the tenor for his time in office early on, flagging even before he became a formal nominee in the 2016 presidential race the ideas that would resonate through his term and shape his policy paradigm. At the heart of his ethos, if it could be described as such, was an apparent compulsion to veer toward unhinged nativism. He was an early proponent of the ‘birther’ movement and his shrill calls for Mr. Obama to produce his birth certificate and prove he was not a Muslim from Kenya revealed the colour of his political reasoning. The lines that Mr. Trump sought to draw to define his core constituency came into clearer focus during the campaign months, when he vowed to ban Muslims from certain countries entering the U.S., build a wall along the southern border that Mexico would pay for, reshape the judiciary, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), cut corporate taxes, repudiate the Paris climate accord, take on China for currency manipulation, reject trade deals that were not in U.S. national interest, bomb the Islamic State, raise military spending and bring the troops home, reshape the judiciary and deport all illegal immigrants. In parallel, his campaign against Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was scathingly acerbic, and his views on minorities of different kinds and women could only be described as bigoted and misogynist. Yet, and this is where troubling questions arise that impinge upon the very character of America’s democratic soul, there was no full-throated admonishment of this maverick candidate and no collapse in his overall performance in opinion polls; quite the opposite. Indeed, each of the agenda items that he voiced during that campaign signalled something about those whom he claimed to fight for — whether it was blue collar workers feeling disenfranchised by their jobs being shipped offshore, the upper classes vying for tax breaks, or just your garden-variety white supremacist who nurtured a deep hatred of minorities. While many or all of those policies might have appeared objectionable to some voters, it would be hard to deny that sufficient numbers of Americans were persuaded by specific aspects of his worldview that Mr. Trump was able to win the presidency via the electoral college in November 2016. He went on to deliver on some of his goals, a few with a high degree of success, notably nominating three justices to the Supreme Court who were confirmed mostly along partisan lines. The devastating consequences for liberals of that court being overwhelmingly packed with conservative justices will be felt for decades to come, possibly in terms of threats to fundamental freedoms such as women’s reproductive rights. Through a series of executive actions that bypassed the need for Congressional ratification, Mr. Trump tightened the screws on the immigration system, which included everything from condemnable family separations at the border to halting green card and skilled visa issuance in the wake of spiralling job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the foreign policy realm, his rejection of the multilateralism in favour of bilateralism or isolationism has already reshaped global forces toward the vision that Mr. Trump, Brexiteers, and a melange of proto-nativists across Europe and not-so-soft authoritarians in Asia have gleefully veered toward. The Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear freeze agreement, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) treaty, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and a host of UN organisations including the World Health Organization have been hobbled by the Trump administration’s actions in this regard. Where Trump stumbled However, he failed to live up to his campaign promises in significant measure, including thwarted attempts to hollow out the ACA, blowback from China and other nations in response to his tariff manoeuvres, a lack of funding for the border wall with Mexico. The lowest points of his term in office came, arguably, when he was impeached in the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and over his silence on the deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement that periodically ripped apart what social harmony remained. Ultimately, his administration’s failure to respond effectively to the pandemic was his undoing. With the U.S. performing worse than any nation, having nearly 10 million cases and 234,000 fatalities, Mr. Trump paid the ultimate price for this at the hustings. For the new team Looking back at this aggressively nativism-driven agenda, and the fact that more than 71 million Americans voted to put him back in office and carry it forward for another term, there is only one governance lesson for Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris to consider: to not underestimate or ignore the other side. The ‘other side’ in this case goes well beyond the likes of Mitch McConnell and obstructionism of his Senate colleagues, who will no doubt seek to whittle away the Democrats’ hopes of undoing the damage done by Mr. Trump to the economy and American society. Given the diversity of the personal and collective ethos of diverse subcultures across the U.S., there will always be fringe elements and those fundamentally opposed to the liberal, pluralistic vision that Team Biden-Harris have so eloquently persuaded voters on. They can be safely ignored. Yet between them and committed progressives is a vast sea of disgruntled middle America, mostly white, and seething with anger and helplessness at the socioeconomic changes happening across their country. Just as Mr. Biden gradually shifted to a harder line on China as a sense of American outrage took over the campaign through the summer months of the pandemic, he may find that the views that he held fast to as a committed mainstream Democrat for 48 years in politics may have to be transmogrified into something else, something new and more accommodative of the millions of Americans that chose a darkly antagonistic demagogue over business as usual. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-us-vote-is-about-building-back-better/article33054655.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Turning the spotlight on America’s election custodian||The presidential election in the United States has seen millions the world over glued to their TV screens as they watch the peregrinations of this important and dramatic election unfold. There have been cliffhanger moments when State results were declared, interspersed with premature announcements claiming victory, as well as increasingly legal meanderings that have occasionally rendered some moments in the election process of arguably the most powerful nation on earth as the theatre of the absurd. Yet, no commentator, anchor or the clutch of experts that gather around them, or editorial or erudite commentator seems even to have noticed that the normal umpire that conducts elections in most democracies, the Election Commission, is singularly missing. And, in a country all too often described as the oldest democracy in the world. I for one have keenly observed that there has not been even a single order or intervention passed by the American counterpart of the Election Commission of India (ECI), the Federal Election Commission of the United States of America. Having been the Chief Election Commissioner (when I presided over the 2009 general election) this has struck me as a strange vacuum. In India, our constitutional fathers had debated in the Constituent Assembly itself the necessity of imbuing the ECI with enormous power, of course to be exercised during the course of elections, and strictly on other election-related matters. By virtue of being the custodian of the electoral roll, all matters related to keeping the roll updated, fall under the ECI’s domain. Indeed, so vast are the powers accorded to the ECI during the election process that even the higher judiciary does not interfere during the course of the election process. Thus, the question arises. Why is the Federal Election Commission of the United States almost invisible? A comparison For a start, the Federal Election Commission has a much narrower mandate than its Indian equivalent. Moreover, the Federal Election Commission (https://www.fec.gov/) was established comparatively recently — it ‘opened its doors’ in 1975, with the special mandate to regulate campaign finance issues. As a watchdog, it is meant to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the law regarding campaign contributions, and oversee public funding of the presidential election. But, so far, I have not seen any report on such oversight either. The reason is astonishing. The Federal Election Commission is led by six Commissioners. The six posts of Commissioner are supposed to be equally shared by Democrats and Republicans, and too have to be confirmed by the Senate. But at the time of this most critical presidential election, there are vacancies. In fact the Commission has hardly been able to function in the last year because of resignations, with the result that barring a brief two months, from May to July this year, the Commission has effectively passed no orders at all since August 2019, because it has lacked a quorum — for which at least four members are needed. As a result, several hundred matters lie pending before the Federal Election Commission for want of members. I do recollect that when I was Election Commissioner, I paid an official visit to the Federal Election Commission in Washington DC. At that juncture there were just two Commissioners in the saddle, one each from the two parties. I sensed an undercurrent of tension and that even then, decision making was often divided on partisan lines. During the course of this election, perhaps the most divisive in American history, the President has not mentioned even once about appealing to the Federal Election Commission, but only to the U.S. Supreme Court. In sharp contrast, our Constitution’s fathers decided to limit the role of the judiciary in India to the post-election period, when election petitions may be filed. The founding fathers were clear that if election-related petitions were entertained during the course of the election process, it would impede the process and delay election results interminably. These delays and the acrimony, so adroitly avoided in India during the election process, is precisely what we are seeing now in the U.S.. Widening postal ballots base However, India would do well to take a leaf out of the U.S. system’s book when it comes to postal balloting. In the 2016 U.S. election,almost a quarter of the votes counted arose from postal and early balloting. In India we have confined postal ballots to only a few categories, of largely government staff (for example those on election duty) as well as the police or armed forces. In these difficult times of the novel coronavirus pandemic, we need to widen this base to include all senior citizens and anyone else who may find it convenient to cast their vote early. We will need to add more foolproof systems. For example, postal ballots to the Indian Army have at present to be sent to a central post box or two, i.e., 56 APO, but before they can reach the destination where our jawans or officers are stationed, or return to be counted, the small window of the actual polling period gets over. Accepting change Let me conclude by saying that I have been an official observer in many countries. Wherever the final verdict has angered a section of voters, I have seen Opposition parties protest for weeks and months by sitting on dharna , often blocking whole avenues. Elsewhere I have heard the beating of utensils by those who are disgruntled for up to half-an-hour in the evenings. And now the world is watching the turbulence in the U.S. election despite Joe Biden crossing the majority mark and President Trump reluctant to acknowledge the numbers. In sharp contrast, and ever since our first election in 1951-2 and every single election since, our political parties, losers and winners alike, have invariably accepted the results declared by the Election Commission of India, with the result that the baton has passed on in a graceful and smooth manner.

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Defending differences||The Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year in 2016 was ‘post-truth’, an adjective defined as ‘relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief’. Earlier, I could not grasp the full import of this hyphenated word. But last week, a couple of missives from sceptical readers brought out the full meaning of the word for me and helped me understand the world in which it operates. For the sake of brevity, I am paraphrasing the questions posed to me: Where were the votaries of the liberal media and the warriors of the freedom of expression when the Maharashtra government launched its punitive action against Republic TV chief Arnab Goswami? Is the concern restricted only to liberals? What is the justification for the silence surrounding the difficulties faced by conservatives? Coming together as one I was astonished to receive such complaints. Most journalists, editors and publishers have been consistent in their demand for a free press and have never used an ideological lens to condone the excesses of the government. I became a journalist in 1984 and have been a witness to the consistent stand taken by professional journalists since then. I remember how the Anti-Defamation Bill of 1988, which was introduced by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and passed by the Lok Sabha, was later withdrawn due to sustained protests by the journalistic community. Journalists came together irrespective of the differences among them. In Tamil Nadu, where I have spent most of my journalistic days, I saw how the fraternity rose as one to defend S. Balasubramanian, editor and publisher of Ananda Vikatan , when Speaker P. H. Pandian invoked a breach of privilege motion against the magazine for carrying a cartoon in 1987. This defence continued when the breach of privilege issue was invoked against K.P. Sunil of the Illustrated Weekly of India in 1992 and journalists of The Hindu in 2003. In defamation cases filed by governments against various media outlets, there was a unified call demanding that critical and adversarial voices should not be stifled. Let us examine The Hindu ’s coverage of Mr. Goswami’s brush with the powers that be in Maharashtra. The newspaper has constantly tracked the story since the breach of privilege motion was moved against him. The last story on this subject appeared on November 7 on the front page (“SC relief for Arnab in privilege case”). The story continued on page 14 under the extended headline, “SC relief for Arnab in breach of privilege case”. Mr. Goswami is also battling an abetment to suicide case. He was arrested on November 4. On November 5, the newspaper carried many reports. There was a page 1 report (“Arnab Goswami held in 2018 suicide case”), which continued on page 8. There were two reports on the political fallout of his arrest, published on page 9: “Arnab’s arrest triggers verbal clash between BJP and Sena” and “Law will take its own course: Congress”. In a fair journalistic tradition, the newspaper also reported the views of the victim’s family (“Arnab, others threatened victim, say kin”, page 9). The coverage on November 6 consisted of two reports on page 11 — “Court rejects request for Arnab’s police custody” and “Plea before Bombay HC challenges arrest” — as well as an editorial titled “Arresting Arnab”. The editorial explained not only the newspaper’s stand on the issue but also the high-handedness of the Maharashtra government. On November 7, the newspaper reported the happenings before the Bombay High Court in a report headlined “No relief for Arnab, hearing continues today” (page 15). The November 8th issue carried two reports: “Arnab fails to get relief from Bombay HC” (page 1) and “Bombay HC seeks police response in Naik case” (page 11). Vindictive actions against journalists I am also reminded of the many examples of vindictive actions that have been taken against journalists over the last three decades and the impunity with which the perpetrators have gone scot-free while journalists and media organisations pay a huge price because the ‘process is the punishment’ in these cases. I  hope that courts act as swiftly in the case of other Indian journalists as they did in Mr. Goswami’s case — journalists who figure in various indices compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists, including the impunity index that documents the number of journalists killed. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/defending-differences/article33054661.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||India and Biden||While U.S. Democratic Party contender and former Vice-President Joseph Biden still needs to tie up some loose ends for an official seal to his victory, it is clear that New Delhi is now preparing to work with a new U.S. administration. The win is a mixed bag for the government. On the one hand, Mr. Narendra Modi invested considerably in the Trump administration, which included the Houston and Ahmedabad rallies with Mr. Trump, that indicated a virtual endorsement for his re-election. The External Affairs Minister’s snub to the Democrat-led House Foreign Affairs Committee and the invitation to senior Trump officials, for “2+2” talks just before the U.S. elections, also played into the impression of New Delhi expecting a Trump win. On the other hand, Mr. Biden, a long-time supporter of the U.S.-India relationship, brings to his presidency both the comfort of his understanding of foreign policy and the promise of future strategic ties. Foreign policy itself may not be his immediate priority, given the U.S.’s battle with the coronavirus pandemic, and the President-elect’s goal, which he articulated on Sunday, to “heal” rifts in its polity and “restore the soul of America”. However, it is clear that he will make moves to reverse some of the Trump-era policies. For India, these could include the U.S.’s return to the Paris climate accord, which would help with its energy transformation, and a return to Iran nuclear negotiations, which will facilitate its regional connectivity ambitions. He is unlikely to reverse the Afghan pullout and instead might make it a more measured exit. On China, he is likely to adopt a less confrontational attitude while maintaining a pushback. Where he will no doubt press a hard nerve is on the issues of human rights, Jammu and Kashmir, and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, given a policy paper his campaign released in June 2020 that quoted him as being “disappointed”. But these are more likely to be areas of engagement, and New Delhi should be prepared to hold its own in tough conversations on these sensitive issues. Mr. Biden’s presidency promises a change in leadership style, with broader powers to advisers and process-driven decisions. His belief in building up U.S. traditional trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific alliances might be at odds with America’s more transactional trends. No sudden moves such as Mr. Trump’s withdrawal of India’s GSP export status may be expected, and policy consistency is likely to be preferred to a more personalised summit style. Above all, as New Delhi prepares to adjust its responses to the new dispensation, it would welcome Mr. Biden’s stated intention to re-energise the multilateral global order, and to restore the U.S.’s position in “leading not by the example of [its] power, but by the power of example”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-and-biden/article33054647.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Walk the talk||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent address at a virtual global investor round table was delivered, as is his wont, with inimitable energy and trademark alliterative phrases. Pitching India as the ideal destination, he stressed that the country offered a gamut of benefits spanning “returns with reliability, demand with democracy, stability with sustainability and growth with a green approach”. He also underscored the country’s planned $1.5 trillion National Infrastructure Pipeline and other public works projects as an immense opportunity for trust fund managers looking to reap the ‘best’ and ‘safest’ returns over a longer term for their principals. Seen in the context of the pressing need to revive investment, his exhortations tick all the right boxes. As the RBI noted in its latest monetary policy report last month, investment, already in contraction mode since the July-September quarter in 2019, suffered a further massive pandemic shock. Fixed investment, which almost halved in the first quarter of the current fiscal, continues to face an uncertain outlook given the weak consumption demand and excess capacity in most industries, especially when coupled with stretched balance sheets that cramp businesses’ ability to borrow and invest, according to the RBI. And the government’s ability to apportion more funds for growth-spurring capital projects is hamstrung by a widening fiscal deficit amid a protracted border stand-off, the health crisis and a debilitating revenue shortfall. Asserting that all sectors of the economy were looking up in the wake of the government’s resolute tackling of the pandemic, Mr. Modi cited a 13% increase in FDI flows in the first five months of the financial year as reflective of the global investor community’s confidence. However, what he likely overlooked was that with almost three-fourths of the $27 billion of FDI equity inflows in that period being accounted for by stake acquisitions in a single large telecom company, a bulk of this investment is unlikely to manifest as new job-creating factories or businesses. As a former Chief Minister of Gujarat, who aggressively solicited and won industrial investments, Mr. Modi is surely only too well aware that what investors crave most is regulatory certainty. The Prime Minister needs to ensure that his assurance of stability is buttressed by actions that dispel investors’ concerns over policy flip-flops. Even as the Centre is yet to clarify whether it will accept or challenge the tossing of its tax claim against Vodafone by an international arbitral tribunal, it separately last week enacted an ordinance to retrospectively amend the arbitration law, ostensibly to deal with contracts that may be underpinned by ‘fraud or corruption’. The rule changes in wholesale and online trade are another example of shifting goal posts. Mr. Modi has his task cut out: make sure that investors see him walk the talk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/walk-the-talk/article33054648.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Strategic comfort’ with the Maldives||The visit of Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla to the Maldives is significant for taking forward bilateral relations. Under Maldivian President Ibrahim Solih, bilateral cooperation, especially on the economic front, has become a ‘model’ that New Delhi can adopt to make Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ a sustained success. India and the Maldives have had bilateral relations for centuries. Technology has made connectivity easier for everyday contact and exchanges. Maldivian students attend educational institutions in India and patients fly here for superspeciality healthcare, aided by a liberal visa-free regime extended by India. Tourism is the mainstay of Maldivian economy. The country is now a major tourist destination for some Indians and a job destination for others. Given the geographical limitations imposed on the Maldives, India has exempted the nation from export curbs on essential commodities. Through the decades, India has rushed emergency assistance to the Maldives, whenever sought. In 1988, when armed mercenaries attempted a coup against President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, India sent paratroopers and Navy vessels and restored the legitimate leadership under Operation Cactus. The 2004 tsunami and the drinking water crisis in Male a decade later were other occasions when India rushed assistance. At the peak of the continuing COVID-19 disruption, India rushed $250 million aid in quick time. New Delhi also rushed medical supplies to the Maldives, started a new cargo ferry and also opened an air travel bubble, the first such in South Asia. It has promised more, as and when required. Protests from the Yameen camp Abdulla Yameen was in power when the water crisis occurred. Despite early strains in relations, India rushed help on a humanitarian basis. Now, the Yameen camp has launched an ‘India Out’ campaign against New Delhi’s massive developmental funding for creating physical, social and community infrastructure, and incumbent President Solih’s government retaining two India-gifted helicopters and their operational military personnel. Maldivian protesters recently converted their demand for early release of Mr. Yameen — sentenced to five years of imprisonment in a money laundering case, pending appeal — into one asking the Solih administration to ‘stop selling national assets to foreigners’, implying India. They forget that massive supplies of drinking water came only aboard Indian Navy vessels and the COVID-19 medicines were delivered aboard an Indian Air Force aircraft. Such assistance helps all Maldivians, including Mr. Yameen’s supporters. Likewise, the Yameen administration too had deployed the helicopters for humanitarian operations. It is against this background, given also Mr. Yameen’s tilt towards China and bias against India when in power, that the Solih administration’s no-nonsense approach towards trilateral equations provide ‘strategic comfort’ to India. Some concerns Yet, India should be concerned about the protests as well as the occasional rumblings within the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) of Mr. Solih. Mohamed Nasheed, who was the nation’s first President elected under a multiparty democracy, now Parliament Speaker, continues to head the party, and had also named Mr. Solih as presidential candidate in 2018, but there are apparent strains between them. Mr. Nasheed’s going public on issues, including corruption charges against ministers, that should have been raised at the highest-level could affect the MDP during the run-up to the 2023 presidential polls. Also, Mr. Nasheed’s on-again-off-again call for a changeover to a ‘parliamentary form of government’ can polarise the overpoliticised nation even more. Despite this, India can take respite in the ‘strategic comfort’ of the ‘India First’ policy of the Solih government. Given this background and India’s increasing geostrategic concerns in the shared seas, taking forward the multifaceted cooperation to the next stage quickly could also be at the focus of Mr. Shringla’s visit.

But its policy on the whole unfortunately is not such as to promote the friendship between the two countries”, Mr. Gujral added.

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Ask Us||Gold bonds Q.I started working a year ago. I want to start saving for my future. I really don't have any idea about where to invest. I got to know about RBI issuing sovereign gold bonds and bought 16 gm valued at Rs. 74,832. Is that a good move? Gold prices have been increasing during the lockdown. Is it the right time to buy these bonds? Arun J.P. Aarati Krishnan replies: A.While Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) are a good vehicle through which you can add gold to your portfolio, investing all your savings in one asset is not a prudent course of action as poor performance or lack of liquidity in that asset can materially affect your financial position. In future, it would be best for you to save and invest your earnings in line with a well thought-out financial plan. While it is good that you are thinking about saving so early in your career, investing requires a bit of planning first. Your first move, while embarking on your investment journey, should be to create an emergency fund amounting to about 6 months of basic expenses. This sum should be parked in FDs from leading banks for you to draw upon any time you have a need. Do get a medical insurance plan too, if your employer doesn’t offer one. Before deciding on where to invest the rest of your money, it would be advisable to map out the financial goals towards which you would like to save or invest. Do list out, with the help of your family, if need be, the key life goals you have in mind over the short term (within 3 years), medium term (3-7 years) and long term (7 years plus). Mapping out your goals in this fashion will then decide how much you should save and how you can allocate your savings between assets such as gold, fixed deposits, debt and equities. Usually for goals that are less than 3 years, bank fixed deposits are your best bet. For 3-7 years, you can consider post office schemes such as NSC, debt mutual funds, company FDs and gold. For goals that lie 7 years or beyond, you can consider allocating among equity funds (index or multicap funds), debt funds, PPF and SGBs – as they have an 8-year maturity. Despite the recent surge in prices, gold is not an asset that can generate double-digit returns for your portfolio in the long run. It is an asset that performs the role of insurance by protecting your portfolio value from drastic swings in other assets. Gold tends to perform well when other assets like equities or debt don’t deliver. We suggest investing 5-10% of your overall savings in gold in a systematic manner either through SGBs or gold exchange traded funds.  Capital gains tax Q.I have been trading in shares in small quantities, now and then, for the past 20 years. During the year 2019-20 also, I sold shares in NSE and BSE. To determine the capital gains tax liability, I need to know the purchase price of the shares. But the shares sold during the year were purchased several years ago and I am unable to trace the relevant contract notes issued from time to time by the D. P. In the above circumstances, I want to know whether I can adopt the market price as on January 31, 2018, for the purpose of calculating the tax?  N.R. Krishnaswami N. Sree Kanth replies: A.Long Term Capital Gains on sale of equity shares (STT paid) are to be determined in the following manner, the difference of sale consideration (less transfer expenses) and cost of acquisition wherein the cost of acquisition is higher of the ‘actual’ cost of acquisition and lower of the market value on January 31, 2018 and the sale price. You may contact your broker and request for a capital gains statement which should contain the relevant details for computation of capital gains, payment of tax and filing of returns. If the values are still not ascertainable, you can choose to take the values as on January 31, 2018. By doing so, the original cost gets fixed at January 31, 2018 value and if there is any real loss on account of cost being higher than the value as at January 31, 2018 is foregone.  (N.

09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Dhawan, Stoinis and Rabada fire Delhi Capitals into maiden final||Delhi Capitals entered its maiden IPL final with 17-run over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. Chasing 190, Kane Williamson’s genius was on full display (67, 45b, 5x4, 4x6) before young Abdul Samad (33, 16b, 2x4, 2x6) brought the equation down to 23 runs off 10 balls. But Kagiso Rabada dismissed Samad, Rashid Khan and Shreevats Goswami in the penultimate over to usher the end. But it was a day on which every strategic punt by Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting paid off; be it in bringing in Shimron Hetmyer for Prithvi Shaw or promoting Marcus Stoinis -- a bright spot from the defeat to Mumbai Indians -- as an opener or bowling the Aussie (3-0-26-3) in the PowerPlay. Stoinis (38, 27b, 5x4, 1x6) and Hetmyer (42 n.o., 22b, 4x4, 1x6) ensured Shikhar Dhawan’s fourth fifty (78, 50b, 6x4, 2x6) wouldn’t go to waste. Then Stoinis, bowling the fifth over, dismissed both Priyam Garg and Manish Pandey to reduce SRH to 44 for three after Rabada had bowled batting powerhouse David Warner off the pads for just two. It brought Williamson and Jason Holder together and the former was at his delightful best, hitting a six each off Pravin Dubey, Rabada, Axar Patel and Stoinis. But Jason Holder’s dismissal ended the 46-run fourth-wicket stand, leaving Williamson with a lot to do. With 77 needed off 36 balls, Abdul Samad caned Anrich Nortje for a six and two fours. But Stoinis’ dismissal of Williamson in the 17th over proved fatal for SRH. Earlier, DC spent the first two overs of its batting sizing up the conditions, scoring just 11 runs. In the third, Stoinis, on three, was dropped by Holder at short mid-on off Sandeep Sharma. It seemed to liberate Stoinis, as he hit Sandeep for two fours before smashing Holder for 18 runs, including a six over mid-wicket and a flat-batted whack straight down. By five overs, DC had racked up 50 runs. Williamson and Warner went into a huddle and decided to bring Shahbaz Nadeem on. But the left-arm spinner’s first delivery was sent soaring over mid-wicket by Dhawan, before a bad full toss was pulled past short fine-leg. The introduction of Rashid and T. Natarajan slowed things down, with the former even cleaning up Stoinis with a straighter one. Dhawan, though, eased to his half-century with a slog-swept six off Nadeem. Shreyas laboured for a 20-ball 21, but after playing out Rashid (4-0-26-1), DC seemed primed for a big score from 145 for two after 16 overs. Shetmyer didn’t disappoint, even hitting Holder for four fours in a single over. Natarajan bowled a superb 20th over (seven runs), but it was not to be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhawan-stoinis-and-rabada-put-delhi-capitals-in-maiden-final/article33054730.ece
09 November 2020||PARIS,||Medvedev triumphs||Third seed Daniil Medvedev claimed his first Paris Masters title at Bercy Arena on Sunday by battling back from a set down to beat Germany’s Alexander Zverev. The Russian was on top form in a high-quality encounter, winning 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 to secure his first trophy of the season and the eighth of his career. “It’s great, I’m really happy. As I always say, I don’t always show this after matches, but I’m always happy to win,” said Medvedev after his third Masters title. Both players will now turn their attention to the ATP Tour Finals in London, an event won by Zverev in 2018. Medvedev has had an up-and-down season, but was at his best this week in Paris, continuing his magnificent record on hard courts — all of his ATP titles have come on the surface. Overcoming agony “Before this tournament I wasn’t in great form, zero finals this year and I was crying, well complaining, to my wife, ‘Oh my God, I don’t have the level, not playing well, not even any finals’,” he said. “But now, three Masters titles, it’s great. I have had the level this week. I managed to keep the pressure on and in the end I broke his level a little bit.”  Fourth seed Zverev, who had ended top seed Rafael Nadal’s quest with a 6-4, 7-5 semifinal win, remains without a Masters title since the 2018 Madrid Open.  The result (final): Daniil Medvedev bt Alexander Zverev 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/medvedev-triumphs/article33054732.ece
09 November 2020||London,||United’s critics are jealous: Maguire||Manchester United captain Harry Maguire claims criticism of his club is often provoked by jealousy. United eased the pressure on boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a much-needed 3-1 win at Everton on Sunday. Solskjaer had been under fire after United’s spluttering start to the season hit a new low with a shock Champions League defeat at Istanbul Basaksehir in midweek. Three wins in seven league matches still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League, but England defender Maguire does not believe Solskjaer and his team deserves so much abuse. Insisting United’s critics resent the club’s past success, Maguire said: “At this club one thing I’ve noticed in my time here — I’ve been here a year and a half — is we are the most talked-about club in the world. “Why? Because we are the biggest club in the world. People don’t want us to do well. Why? Probably because of the success we’ve had in the past. “We have to live up to that, we have to react to it and don’t let the negatives get into our bubble inside the training ground. Sometimes it is difficult for the lads.” Speaking after the match in a video posted on Manchester United’s Twitter account, Maguire added: “We reacted well to two poor results. We felt we were on the right track after Leipzig (a 5-0 win) and we let ourselves down against Arsenal (last Sunday). “It wasn’t good enough as a performance. In the week again we gave them a soft goal and found it too hard to create chances to come back. “We knew this was an important game to get three points. We reacted well but it is only a start.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/uniteds-critics-are-jealous-maguire/article33054980.ece
09 November 2020||London,||Solskjaer fumes over ‘joke’ kick-off time||Ole Gunnar Solskjaer described the scheduling of Manchester United’s Premier League match against Everton on Saturday as an “absolute joke”. United eased the pressure on its under-fire manager with a 3-1 win in the early kick-off at Goodison Park but the Norwegian vented his fury at league chiefs after picking up fresh injuries. Main focus The main focus on Saturday was on whether United could bounce back after successive defeats, which raised fresh doubts over Solskjaer’s position at the club. United only returned from its embarrassing Champions League loss against Istanbul Basaksehir in the early hours of Thursday yet had to kick off at Goodison Park at 12:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. Bruno Fernandes scored twice and new signing Edinson Cavani opened his account as United came from behind to beat the early-season pacesetters.  But Solskjaer blamed the quick turnaround for injuries to Luke Shaw (hamstring), Victor Lindelof (back) and Marcus Rashford (shoulder). “How can you expect players to perform to the best of their ability when you send them out at 12:30? Absolute joke,” he said. “Our players were set up to fail today with the schedule,” he added. “I pushed my club to really fight the kick-off time on this one to give us at least half a chance but it was quashed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/solskjaer-fumes-over-joke-kick-off-time/article33054768.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||Advantage Supernovas||Supernovas and Trailblazers come face to face for the second time in three days, but the stake is higher this time around as the women’s T20 Challenge trophy is up for grabs. If their last meeting is anything to go by, there is certainly much to look forward to in the final at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday. Supernovas, champion in both editions, had won a thriller on Saturday by two runs, with left-arm spinner Radha Yadav bowling a superb last over. It was a must-win match for Harmanpreet Kaur’s team and having won the nail-biting contest, they have the momentum. But they will have to bring out their best against a balanced Trailblazers, led by Smriti Mandhana. Sri Lankan star Chamari Atapattu (43 and 67) and Harmanpreet (31 and 31) have looked the only batters in form for Supernovas. Variety in attack Supernovas has variety in attack, with seamers Shakera Salman and Ayabonga Khaka and spinners Radha, Poonam Yadav and Anuja Patil in its ranks. In the final, Supernovas would be keen to send back Smriti and her hard-hitting opening partner Deandra Dottin early. Trailblazers all-rounders Deepti Sharma and Harleen Deol — their fifth-wicket association had nearly pulled it during the chase — lend depth to the side’s middle-order. World's No. 1 T20 bowler Sophie Ecclestone, fellow left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad and experienced seamer Jhulan Goswami form a strong attack, which had dismissed Velocity for 47.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/advantage-supernovas/article33054735.ece
09 November 2020||Manchester,||City rues costly miss||Leicester City went top of the Premier League with a tense 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday in which striker Jamie Vardy scored one penalty and had another saved. Vardy made no mistake with his first spot-kick in the 15th minute but just before halftime he struck his second straight into the legs of Rui Patricio. Leicester climbed to the top of the table with 18 points from eight games, one ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, which managed a 1-0 win at West Bromwich Albion thanks to Harry Kane’s late header.

09 November 2020||Karachi,||Akram backs Babar Azam for Test captaincy||Pakistan’s pace legend and former captain Wasim Akram has backed white-ball skipper Babar Azam to also take over Test captaincy from the tour of New Zealand and urged him to be more assertive. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to announce a new Test captain on November 11 to replace Azhar Ali, who will however remain a part of the 35-member jumbo squad for the New Zealand tour, where the national team will play two Tests and three T20 Internationals. Our future “You ask me as a former player, yes, I back Babar to become Test captain because he is our future and he can continue for a long time,” Akram said on YouTube channel ‘Cricket Baaz’ “If the PCB appoints him they should for a proper time so that at least there is no confusion as to who is in charge in the dressing room.” One of the game’s greatest fast bowlers, Akram has also led the national team during his glorious international career, which included a World Cup triumph and plenty of individual accolades. “I back Babar because I don’t want to see those days when I was playing and there were around four to five captains in our dressing room. “He is our best player and people who say that making him Test captain will affect his batting, don’t buy that because he is a batsman and it is his job to score runs. “Aren’t Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson also captains and top batsmen,” the former fast bowling great asked. Akram said that the experiment to make Misbah-ul-Haq head coach and chief selector has not worked as Pakistan cricket has not seen any improvement in recent times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/akram-backs-babar-azam-for-test-captaincy/article33054762.ece
09 November 2020||Dortmund,||Kimmich injury overshadows win||Bayern Munich faces an anxious wait to discover the severity of Joshua Kimmich’s knee injury which cast a shadow over its 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday which sent it top of the Bundesliga. The Germany midfielder, who has been in great form recently, was helped off in obvious distress after twisting his knee in a first-half challenge. “He’ll fly home with us and be examined — it’s too early to say the extent of the injury,” said grim-faced Bayern coach Hansi Flick. Kimmich is also a concern for Germany ahead of the friendly against the Czech Republic on Wednesday before Nations League games against Spain and then Ukraine in the following six days. Big blow Flick admitted the potential loss of midfield dynamo Kimmich would be a blow for the European champion. “He’s a very important player for us and with his mentality, he isn’t someone you can replace like for like,” said Flick. The Bayern boss was pleased with the win which left his side two points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig. Dortmund is now third, three points behind Munich. “There were many, many chances to score on both sides,” enthused Flick. “In the end we were a little more determined, that’s why I think the victory was more than deserved. “Dortmund were dangerous when we made mistakes, which we must put a stop to.” Hard to accept Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre said it was “hard to accept” conceding three goals at home to Bayern. “All in all, we have to be positive, we did a good job — we had so many chances to score,” lamented the Swiss. Haaland was annoyed at his own performance after converting one of his four chances. “I have to score more goals, if we don’t put our chances away at this level, then we won’t win,” said the 20-year-old. “They are the best team in the world, but we have to work harder to take the next step to be as good as them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kimmich-injury-overshadows-bayerns-klassiker-win/article33054770.ece
09 November 2020||Tokyo,||Tokyo holds a one-day gymnastics meet||Japan provided a glimpse on Sunday of what the delayed Tokyo Olympics may look like next summer as fans attended the country’s first international sporting competition since the pandemic shutdown. The gymnastics “Friendship and Solidarity Competition” gathered around 30 athletes from Japan, China, Russia and the US to compete in tightly controlled bio-secure conditions. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Japanese government previously agreed to a one-year delay of the Tokyo Olympics to next summer because of the pandemic. About 2,000 fans in face masks sanitised their hands regularly, checked their body temperature and remained socially distanced at the 8,700-capacity Yoyogi No.1 Gymnasium, while being encouraged not to shout to avoid spreading droplets. Strict hygiene measures Athletes and journalists were subject to similarly strict hygiene measures and were also sprayed with a sanitising mist. The spectators resorted to polite applause and occasional murmurs as gymnasts pulled off gravity-defying routines and feats of strength. IOC President Thomas Bach said he hoped the event could demonstrate how Tokyo 2020 organisers could next year hold an Olympics that is safe for athletes, officials and fans. “With this competition, you are also setting an example that sports can be organised safely even under the ongoing health restrictions,” Bach said in a video message at the opening ceremony. Scepticism Some medical experts have voiced scepticism about whether the massive international gathering can be held safely in a pandemic, without a vaccine. For the Tokyo gymnastics event, the athletes had gone through strict sanitation rules to shield themselves from the coronavirus with at least two weeks of isolation before flying to Japan. Once in Tokyo, they were immediately placed under strict bio-secure protocols, restricted to designated floors of their hotel, and could only leave to take assigned buses to practice and competition venues. After the competition, many athletes admitted that they could not perform at their highest level but they understood the restrictions were necessary. Three-time Olympic gold medallist and local star Kohei Uchimura took part, after his positive coronavirus test turned out to be false.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tokyo-holds-a-one-day-gymnastics-meet/article33054978.ece
09 November 2020||November 09 2020 00:00 IST,||To reveal His qualities||In the Bhagavad Gita, after having told Arjuna about dharma, Lord Krishna says Arjuna should surrender to Him. Krishna says “dharma samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge — I will come in every yuga, to re-establish dharma.” Since He is dharma personified, we can say that He takes avataras, to re-establish Himself. This means that He makes it possible for people to observe His many auspicious qualities at close quarters. Because He came as Rama, we became aware of His simplicity, for He befriended people with a humble status in life, like Guha, for example. When He came as Krishna, He allowed Yasoda to tie Him up. Making His qualities known to all is what “dharma samsthapanarthaya” means, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. If He had remained in Paramapada, how would the world have been witness to His qualities like sauseelya and saulabhya? Because He was approachable, most people did not recognise His Supremacy. They thought He too was a human being. Those who did not enjoy His qualities in His vibhava avataras, can still enjoy the same in His archa form. In the first verse of chapter 4 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says karma yoga, about which He had been telling Arjuna, was told by Him to others too. He spoke about it to the Sun, who told his son Manu about it. Manu told his son Ikshavaku about it. Arjuna wants to know how Krishna could have instructed people who lived thousands of years before His time. Krishna explains that His avataras are of His will. His many avataras are not like Arjuna’s many births. The Lord had not come to earth due to His karma. He knows what He did in His previous avataras. But can Arjuna know what he did in previous births? Thus, the Lord tells Arjuna the difference between His births and that of mortals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/to-reveal-his-qualities/article33054725.ece
09 November 2020||RAWALPINDI,||Pakistan seals series with thumping win||Pakistan proved too strong for a sloppy Zimbabwe as it won the second Twenty20 International by eight wickets, to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, here on Sunday. Riding on half centuries from skipper Babar Azam (51) and 20-year-old Haider Ali (66 not out), Pakistan made short work of a modest 135-run target, achieving victory with 29 balls to spare.

The scores: Zimbabwe 134/7 in 20 overs (Ryan Burl 32 n.o., Wesley Madhevere 24, Haris Rauf 3/31, Usman Qadir 3/23) lost to Pakistan 137/2 in 15.1 overs (Haider Ali 66 n.o., Babar Azam 51, Blessing Muzarabani 2/33).

09 November 2020||Chandigarh,||Punjab CM seeks intervention of Shah to restore rail services||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday said he had spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for his intervention to ensure restoration of rail services to the State. The Chief Minister said he discussed the situation with Mr. Shah on November 7 and assured him that there were no law and order concerns to prevent resumption of the services for facilitating supply of essential commodities in Punjab and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, all of which were suffering colossal losses due to the continued suspension. Capt. Amarinder said he pointed out that the security concerns could, however, be serious for the nation if essential supplies did not reach the armed forces in Ladakh and the Valley before snowfall. He said all tracks had been cleared by the farmers for the movement of the freight trains. The situation on the ground was peaceful and conducive to safe transportation of goods. The Chief Minister pointed out that the agitating farmers had not disturbed peace in any part of Punjab over the past few weeks of their protests.  Support for RPF Capt. Amarinder said he told Mr. Shah that he had directed the Punjab police to extend all support to the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in providing security on the tracks and the platforms to enable smooth movement of freight trains, and the kisan unions had already eased their blockade. He stressed that it was the joint responsibility of the Central and the State governments to ensure that train services are resumed at the earliest. The State government, said the Chief Minister, was closely engaged with the farmers’ organisations to persuade them to lift their blockade completely to allow passenger trains also to commute so that Punjabis, including the 1.5 lakh soldiers stationed in various places, could come home for Deepavali.

09 November 2020||New Delhi,||Third wave at its peak, says Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the national capital has hit the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 and the number of cases suggests it has been the worst so far.  ‘No plan to rope in hotels’ The government has increased the number of beds for COVID-19 patients in hospitals in Delhi but there is no plan to rope in hotels and banquet halls, the Minister said. “The third wave of COVID-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon,” Mr. Jain said. The Minister attributed the increase in the number of cases to aggressive testing and contact-tracing. He, however, said laxity on the part of the people has been a major reason behind the spike in new cases. “Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don’t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for COVID-19 till a vaccine is developed,” he added.  Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don’t wear a mask. They are wrong.

09 November 2020||Ghaziabad,||AMU pensioners write to President||In an unprecedented situation, the teaching and non-teaching staff members of Aligarh Muslim University have been paid only half of their pension for the month of October. In a letter written to the President of India, the AMU Teachers’ Association said, “Pensioners, which include non-teaching staff, have received just half the pension amount this month.” To make the matter more painful, outgoing AMUTA honorary secretary Najmul Islam said, “No official communication has been issued and pensioners are shocked as the action has inflicted agony and hardship to them.” The AMUTA requested the President for help in releasing the deducted amount. The issue came to light after Aftab Alam, professor of Political Science and a member of the Executive Council of the University, wrote an open letter to his colleagues raising the issue and saying it had only compounded the woes of the retired employees during the pandemic. “Many of them have not even been paid their full retiral benefits, such as encashment of leave, gratuity for last few years,” said Prof Alam, adding those in the non-teaching staff receiving family pension were the worst affected. He reminded that the delay in the payment of pension and other retiral benefits had been viewed “by our courts with grave concern”. Matter of prestige It has also become a matter of prestige for AMU employees because the State universities in the region, such as Bhimrao Ambedkar University and Chaudhary Charan Singh University, have not faced any such issue yet. Distinguished professor Hamid Ali, who retired in November 2019, said he was yet to receive retiral benefits. “I sent my daughter to study in Italy, but now I am finding it very hard.” The two-time former AMUTA president said it was hard to understand the university’s priorities as, ironically, gates were being constructed. Mohd. Shahzad, who retired as assistant controller in 2019, said the decision was “harsh and unimaginable” at a time when the elderly are struggling to cope with the pandemic. Describing the situation as frustrating and unfortunate, Prof. Alam said, “Every time I raise the issue, I have been told that the problem lies at the UGC level.” Shafey Kidwai, university spokesperson, admitted the concerns were genuine. “This month there has been a cut of Rs. 17 crore in the salary bill. The Finance Officer and the Registrar have raised the issue with the UGC. We hope it will be resolved soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/amu-pensioners-write-to-president/article33054895.ece
09 November 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana hooch tragedy toll 21||Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday demanded financial assistance and a government job to the next of kin of those who died after consuming spurious liquor in the State. Mr. Hooda, visiting the affected families at Dhansauli village in Panipat, said many of them had no source of income and it was the moral duty of the government to help them. Meanwhile, the death toll in the hooch tragedy across Sonipat and Panipat districts stood at 21, with no death reported on Sunday. Twenty-two people have been arrested so far and 15 FIRs registered. Sonipat Deputy Commissioner Shyam Lal Poonia told The Hindu that 13 people had died in the district so far, but those in hospitals were doing well. He claimed the entire network involved in the manufacturing and supply of spurious liquor was busted with 20 arrests. The four-member committee, headed by district’s Additional Deputy Commissioner, is expected to submit its report on Monday. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Headquarters (Panipat), Satish Kumar said eight people had died in the district so far and two arrested in connection with five FIRs. Chief Minister Manohar Lal had on Saturday expressed condolences over the deaths and announced an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each to the affected families from the CM Relief Fund. Demanding a high level and speedy probe, Mr. Hooda attacked the government saying the rule of law and the government had been replaced by the “rule of the mafia” and this was the reason why scams kept coming out every day. “Even during the lockdown, the liquor scam occurred in Haryana. Till date, the investigation of this liquor scam has not been completed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-hooch-tragedy-toll-21/article33054897.ece
09 November 2020||Chandigarh,||Haryana Speaker flays Hooda for remark on House session||Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta on Sunday hit out at Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda for his remark “voice of democracy strangled” during the recently concluded Assembly session. The monsoon session concluded on November 6, after which Mr. Hooda had said the “voice of the Opposition was ignored as the Congress’ amendment on the agricultural laws was not accepted in the proceedings of the House”. Mr. Gupta said it was an ‘irresponsible’ remark and that the proceedings were conducted in accordance with the rules. “Every party and public representative has a right to speak in the House, but for this it is necessary to adhere to the rules. If the Congress was to come up with a resolution against the three agriculture Acts, it was important to adhere to the rules. But the Congress failed to do so,” said Mr. Gupta. He said several experienced Congress leaders are aware that any non-government resolution or private member Bill should be introduced 15 days prior to the session. “The Congress should have done within a certain time period. Besides, the tenor of the language of their resolution was not in sync with the parliamentary conduct. Thus, the legal representative consent could not be obtained as it failed to meet the legislative criteria,” said Mr. Gupta. Mr. Gupta said the Congress leaders had first acted contrary to the House decorum and then made pessimistic and inappropriate statements in the media. “A serious discussion was expected from senior leaders on such an important subject. However, the reasons for their non-participation in the discussion are still unknown,” he said. Unruly scenes were witnessed in the Assembly on November 6 as soon as Chief Minister Manohar Lal proposed a resolution thanking the Centre for introducing reforms in the agriculture sector. Congress MLAs insisted on voting on the resolution before a discussion and stormed the well of the House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-speaker-flays-hooda-for-remark-on-house-session/article33054888.ece
09 November 2020||New Delhi,||HC plea alleges illegal operation of path labs||A petition before the Delhi High Court has sought urgent implementation of the government’s Health Bill, 2019, or the Delhi Clinical Establishment Act, 2010, alleging that unauthorised pathological laboratories are running here without any checks and balances. Consumer rights activist Bejon Kumar Misra has contended that operations of illegal and unauthorised labs would endanger the lives of people. Mr. Misra, in his plea filed through advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, has alleged that the government “has not made any effort towards the regulation of illegal pathological laboratories/diagnostic centres being run illegally, which do not meet the norms and without having qualified pathologists”. It stated that the High Court in 2018, had directed the government to take appropriate steps in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court to contain illegal and unauthorised labs, but no steps have been taken by the authorities. According to the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories and Calibration (NABL), there are 1,000 diagnostic laboratories, out of which only 10% are NABL accredited, the plea said. “Therefore, an immediate and urgent regulation is required to regulate the illegal pathological laboratories/diagnostic centres,” it has said. The application has been filed in a petition moved by Mr. Misra in 2018 seeking closure of the unauthorised pathological labs and diagnostic centres in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-plea-alleges-illegal-operation-of-path-labs/article33054899.ece
09 November 2020||Bhopal,||M.P. government razes ashram of ‘Computer Baba’, Cong. cries foul||The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday tore down an ashram of ‘Computer Baba’ in Indore district claiming it was built illegally, days after he campaigned for the Congress in the by-election. The police took him and six others into preventive custody. Namdeo Das Tyagi (‘Computer Baba’) had reportedly encroached upon 46 acre allotted to the Jamburdi Hapsi panchayat in 2000 for the development of a cow shelter. Illegal structures were built on two acres, valued at Rs. 80 crore, said the Indore district administration. “Despite receiving notice from our side, they didn’t remove the encroachment which led to the action,” said Hatod Sub-Divisional Magistrate Shashwat Sharma. The district administration said a cow shelter would be built and a religious site would be developed there. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh alleged the ashram and a temple were being razed without any notice with a “feeling of revenge”. “This is the height of political vengeance. I condemn this,” he wrote in Hindi on Twitter. The Baba had canvassed for him during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, which Mr. Singh lost to BJP’s Pragya Thakur. Ahead of the by-election to 28 seats on November 3, the Baba undertook the ‘Save Democracy’ yatra calling upon voters to decide against the BJP’s 25 candidates who had switched over from the Congress since March. In 2018, the Baba was accorded the status of the Minister of State by the BJP government then to oversee planting and cleanliness along the Narmada river. When the Congress came to power, it gave a similar responsibility to him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mp-government-razes-ashram-of-computer-baba-cong-cries-foul/article33054891.ece
09 November 2020||Guwahati,||Guwahati zoo new home to rescued exotic animals||Non-Asian exotic animals rescued from cramped cages smuggled in from Myanmar have found a home — the Assam State Zoo-cum-Botanical Garden in Guwahati. On November 6, Assam’s Environment and Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya and departmental officials released six blue or hyacinth macaws and two capuchin monkeys in the zoo that occupies 175 hectares in the city’s Hengerabari Reserve Forest. The birds and monkeys are native to Central and South America. They were rescued in July from southern Assam’s Cachar district along with three Aldabra tortoises, one of the largest species from the Seychelles group of islands in the Indian Ocean off East Africa, and a kangaroo from Australia. These animals were packed among crates of fruits in a truck that was loaded in Mizoram. “The cages were specially built for these exotic animals belonging to a different corner of the world. We are keeping them under constant CCTV surveillance to find out if they are adapting to the conditions,” zoo’s Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Tejas Mariswamy said. The kangaroo and the tortoises were being quarantined for 45 days and examined by experts for any foreign viruses they might carry. “Special enclosures are being made for them for possible release by November 20,” he said. Mr. Suklabaidya said it was difficult to ascertain the origin of the rescued animals. “We could not get much information from two people arrested when the truck carrying them was seized. We are still investigating where the animals came from and who they were to be delivered to,” he added.  ‘Sniffed out’ Sunnydeo Chaudhary, Cachar’s DFO, said the exotic animals had been “sniffed out” from foul smell during a routine check of trucks near the Assam-Mizoram border. The seizure of these animals, said to have been destined for Kolkata via Guwahati, came less than two years after sleuths of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence busted an international syndicate of exotic wildlife smugglers whose kingpin was based in Mizoram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/guwahati-zoo-new-home-to-rescued-exotic-animals/article33054894.ece

09 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Students protest against delay in scholarships||Students across universities and from various organisations on Sunday took to social media to raise an issue with the delay in the release of scholarships. They also highlighted the digital divide in the country and the problems they face while switching to the online mode. The students demanded justice for a second-year student of Delhi University’s Lady Shri Ram College, who allegedly killed herself at her home in Telangana on November 3 due to financial difficulties. General Secretary of LSR Students’ Union, Unnimaya, said the Mathematics student was excellent in studies and a recipient of the INSPIRE Scholarship from the Ministry of Science and Technology. “Her scholarship was delayed by the Ministry since March.
