07 November 2020||WASHINGTON,||Pennsylvania lead gets Biden closer to victory||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took the lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground States of Pennsylvania and Georgia for the first time on Friday, putting him on the verge of winning the White House. Three days after polls closed, Mr. Biden has a 253 to 214 lead in the State-by-State Electoral College vote that determines the winner, according to Edison Research. Winning Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes would put the former Vice-President over the 270 mark he needs to secure the presidency. Mr. Biden would also win the election if he prevails in two of the three other key States where he held narrow leads on Friday — Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Like Pennsylvania, all three were still processing ballots on Friday. In both Pennsylvania and Georgia, Mr. Biden overtook Mr. Trump on the strength of mail-in ballots that were cast in urban Democratic strongholds such as Philadelphia and Atlanta. With his re-election chances fading, Mr. Trump escalated his baseless attacks on the results, appearing at the White House on Thursday evening to falsely claim the election was being “stolen” from him. His campaign is pursuing a series of lawsuits across battleground states that legal experts say is unlikely to succeed in altering the election outcome. The campaign’s general counsel, Matt Morgan, asserted in a statement on Friday that the elections in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania all suffered from improprieties and that Mr. Trump would eventually prevail in Arizona. In Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden moved ahead of Mr. Trump by 5,587 votes on Friday morning, while in Georgia, he opened up a 1,097-vote lead. Both margins were expected to grow as additional ballots were tallied. Mr. Biden, 77, would be the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992. In Arizona, Mr. Biden’s lead had narrowed on Thursday to about 47,000 votes, and in Nevada he was ahead by about 11,500. Crucial to race Pennsylvania, one of three traditionally Democratic States along with Michigan and Wisconsin that handed Mr. Trump his 2016 victory, had long been seen as crucial to the 2020 race. Both the candidates had also lavished enormous sums of money and time on the state. Georgia and Pennsylvania officials expressed optimism they would finish counting on Friday, while Arizona and Nevada were still expected to take days to complete their vote totals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pennsylvania-lead-gets-biden-closer-to-victory/article33044737.ece
07 November 2020||Washington,||Pennsylvania lead gets Biden closer to victory||As the counting of mailed-in ballots continued across the U.S., Democratic candidate Joe Biden appeared to be on the edge of victory, as he pushed past incumbent President Donald Trump in the crucial swing State of Pennsylvania on Friday morning. A win would make Mr. Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, the first woman Vice-President of the U.S. and the first Indian American and African American person in that position. In addition, Mr. Biden had also moved ahead in Georgia. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump addressed the media, making several unsubstantiated claims that procedural irregularities and fraud were responsible for his precarious electoral position. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger announced on Friday morning that there would be a recount due to the slim margin between the candidates. Candidates can request a recount as per State law if the margin is within 0.5%. Prize catch Mr. Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania came as he performed strongly with postal ballots in counties such as Philadelphia and Bucks, giving him over a 13,000-vote lead over Mr. Trump in the State by early Friday afternoon. Bucks County is the most conservative among Democratic counties (i.e., Mr. Trump is competitive there).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pennsylvania-lead-gets-biden-closer-to-victory/article33045368.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||India won’t accept shifting of LAC: CDS||India will not accept any “shifting” of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the possibility of unprovoked tactical military actions “spiralling into a larger conflict cannot be discounted”, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said on Friday, as India and China held the 8th round of Corps Commander-level talks at Chushul in an attempt to resolve the ongoing stand-off. “Our posturing is unambiguous. We will not accept any shifting of the LAC. In the overall security calculus, border confrontations, transgressions, unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict therefore cannot be discounted,” Gen. Rawat said at a webinar organised by the National Defence College as part of its diamond jubilee celebrations. ‘Strong response’ Speaking on the situation in eastern Ladakh, Gen. Rawat said it remained tense and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was facing “unanticipated consequences” of its “misadventure” because of the firm and strong response by the Indian forces. The Corps Commander-level talks began at 9.30 a.m., a defence source said. The Indian stand remained firm for disengagement across the entire eastern Ladakh, the source said. Following the developments on the south bank of Pangong Tso (lake) in August, when the Indian Army occupied several dominating features that were lying vacant, China has been pressing for discussing the south bank first and other friction areas later. This is the first round of talks with the Indian side being led by Lt. Gen. P.G.K. Menon, who took over as the 14 Corps Commander on October 13. He attended the last two rounds of talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-wont-accept-shifting-of-lac-cds/article33044735.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Severe pollution continues to choke Capital||Delhi’s air quality improved slightly but remained in the ‘severe’ category for the second consecutive day on Friday, with farm fires accounting for 21% of the pollution in the Capital. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 406; the AQI on Thursday was 450 — the highest so far this year. Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad were also in the ‘severe’ category on Friday, while Gurugram settled in the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category. Stubble burning The SAFAR bulletin stated there were 3,225 stubble fires on Thursday in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas — the highest so far this season. “The boundary layer wind direction is northerly, partly favourable for fire-related intrusion. Stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi's air is estimated at 21% on Friday,” read the bulletin.  SAFAR has forecast a slight improvement in air quality unless more that estimated fire-related emission takes place. “Not so calm surface winds are forecast for the next two days favouring dispersion of pollutants; AQI is likely to improve and stay within the middle-end of the ‘very poor category’, deterioration is expected by late night on November 8 towards the higher end of ‘very poor’,” the bulletin stated. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Aam Aadmi Party government is working to combat local sources of air pollution and has formed a 15-member Pusa Bio-decomposer Impact Assessment Committee to study the impact of the stubble burning solution that the Delhi government has tried out, so that next year other States may use it as a cheap and viable alternative to stubble burning. “The committee will submit an assessment report within seven days. We will then submit it to the Supreme Court where a hearing on the matter of pollution is going on,” Mr. Rai said. He added that the Delhi government has so far received around 2,300 complaints through the ‘Green Delhi’ app and has resolved around 1,346 complaints.   The Minister added that from November 9, 14 teams of the environment department will visit spots mentioned in complaints. Teams will also be formed to implement the ban on crackers. Mr. Rai welcomed the Centre’s move to set up the Air Quality Commission under M.M. Kutty and hoped that the new panel will look into the issue of stubble burning in neighbouring States and approve the Pusa bio-decomposer technique that the Delhi government is advocating for converting stubble to manure so that farmers have an alternative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/severe-pollution-continues-to-choke-capital/article33045491.ece
07 November 2020||LUCKNOW,||Should Hathras DM continue in post, HC asks U.P. govt.||The Allahabad High Court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government if it is “fair and reasonable” to allow the District Magistrate (DM) of Hathras to continue in his post during the pendency of the investigation into the case of alleged rape, and ‘hurried’ cremation of the victim, as he was in “the thick of things.” A Lucknow Bench of Justices Rajan Roy and Pankaj Mithal said, “...when he [Hathras DM Praveen Kumar Laxkar] was in the thick of things... would it not be appropriate to shift him elsewhere during pendency of these proceedings without there being any stigma attached to such an action only to ensure fairness and transparency in the matter.”  On October 12, the court said it was not satisfied with the government explanation on why it had taken action against the district police chief but not the DM on the alleged rape and “hurried” cremation of the victim, though it was admittedly a “collective decision”.  On November 2, government counsel S.V. Raju assured the court that he would convey it (question of transferring the DM) to the government and come back with a reply on the next date of hearing, November 25. Vikrant Vir, the suspended SP of Hathras, appeared before the court and submitted his version and filed an affidavit. It was the DM and he (Mr. Vir) who had taken the decision to cremate the victim’s body in the night, he said. The court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to file a status report on the investigation before the next date and indicate approximately how much time would likely be taken to complete it. Family’s plea Seema Kushwaha, counsel for the victim’s family, submitted that the family wanted to be shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi as it was apprehensive about its safety once the court proceedings were over. Ms. Kushwaha also apprised the court of an alleged promise made by the State government to provide employment to one member of the victim’s family that had not been fulfilled as yet. She stated that although a part of compensation had been received by the family, some pressure was being exerted for returning it in view of an alleged statement made by some family members that they did not want it. Ms. Kushwaha referred to a letter of the DM but could not place it on record. The government advocate, however, refuted her contention and stated that there was no such move at all. The Bench directed that a responsible officer of the CRPF file an affidavit indicating the nature of security provided and measures taken in this regard for the victim’s family before the next date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/should-hathras-dm-continue-in-post-hc-asks-up-govt/article33045495.ece
07 November 2020||K. UmashankerCHITTOOR,||Teacher’s death due to COVID-19 sparks tension in Chittoor district||The death of a teacher in a government school due to COVID-19 on Thursday led to an uneasy mood among teachers, parents and students in Chittoor district. At a time when the schools reopened after seven months, the news has only led to affecting the smooth functioning of schools. Though the official figure of the number of teachers getting affected by COVID-19 stood at over 150 and the number of students scaling up gradually, the figure is believed to be slightly higher. Some headmasters observed that almost all the students who tested positive to the virus were “asymptomatic”, thus escalating the risk of its spread. By Friday, the COVID positive cases in the district crossed the 77,000-mark with 790 casualties, with 286 cases reported in the past 24 hours. According to information, the attendance in government schools was around 40%, while it was even less in many private schools. More than 50% of the students were not willing to avail themselves of the mid-day meal scheme in schools. Mid-day meal “We are not forcing any student to take the mid-day meal, though it is prepared under hygienic conditions. We have insisted that the personnel attached to the cooking should have compulsorily tested negative to COVID,” the headmaster of a government high school in Srikalahasti mandal said, adding that the wastage of food at present was minimal as it was only the students of 9th and 10th classes attending school, and it could be much more if all the classes were functioning. A headmaster at G.D. Nellore mandal said that in the absence of personnel to maintain the toilets, “I had personally cleaned the toilet.” Seeing the headmaster cleaning the bathroom, some students volunteered to do it in shifts. Except for the municipal high schools, almost all the government schools have no manpower to maintain the toilets. “Because of this reason, the number of girls attending school remains low,” the headmaster said. It is felt that very few students would attend school in the next two months, and the numbers might pick up after the Sankranthi vacation. “I have two daughters studying high school. My parents are in their 70s. Fearing risk of virus spread, I have decided not to send the girls to school till Sankranti. After all, seven months are gone.,” a woman headmaster in Pakala mandal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/teachers-death-due-to-covid-sparks-tension-in-chittoor/article33044728.ece
07 November 2020||Hyderabad,||AWS investment largest FDI for Telangana||Leading cloud platform Amazon Web Services is setting up an AWS Region with three Availability Zones in Hyderabad, at an estimated capital investment of $2.77 billion, making it the largest foreign direct investment Telangana has attracted. “This investment from AWS is going to be the largest FDI the State has attracted since inception [in 2014] and will act as a strong anchor for attracting other technology investments,” Telangana Minister for IT and Industries K.T.Rama Rao said on Amazon.com firm’s decision. A release from the IT and Industries Departments said “The AWS Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) Region is expected to start operations by mid-2022. The Availability Zones (AZs) consist of multiple data centres in separate distinct locations within a single region that are engineered to be operationally independent of one another with independent power, cooling, physical security, and connections via a low-latency network.” AWS will establish data centers in three locations with an overall estimated capital investment of $2.77 billion (Rs. 20,761 crore). The investment would position Telangana one of the preferred destinations for other companies that are looking to set up data centres in future. “Establishment of data centres like AWS is expected to support Telangana’s digital economy and IT sector in a multi-fold way. The new AWS Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) Region will enable even more developers, startups, and enterprises as well as government, education, and non-profit organisations to run their applications and serve end-users from data centres located in India. Establishment of data centres in a region will increase the operations of sectors such as e-commerce, public sector, banking and financial services (BFSI), IT, and more,” the release said. Mr.Rao, who had met AWS leadership during his Davos visit earlier this year and subsequently to accelerate the closure of the investment, said “AWS choosing Hyderabad as their preferred destination speaks volumes about the swiftness with which the government operates and also the transparency in the system. This investment further strengthens the existing relationship Telangana enjoys with Amazon. We, at Hyderabad, are already hosting the largest office campus of Amazon.”  The release said Telangana is one of the most progressive States with policies targeted specifically towards advancing the growth of IT and ITeS firms. AWS chose Hyderabad because of the support provided by the government of Telangana, robust policy framework, and because it best met the rigorous requirements for an AWS Region. In a statement AWS, which is an Amazon.com firm, said new Region will join the existing nine AWS Regions and 26 AZs across Asia in India, Australia, Greater China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Globally, AWS has 77 AZs across 24 infrastructure regions and plans to launch 15 more AZs and five more AWS regions in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain and Switzerland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aws-investment-largest-fdi-for-telangana/article33045521.ece

Sahasrabudhe requesting him to take stringent action against GITAM Deemed to be University, Visakhapatnam, for allegedly flouting AICTE and University Grants Commission (UGC) norms. He stated in the letter that the GITAM Deemed to be University which was given Category-1 autonomy by the UGC, got certain buildings of engineering branches constructed on land that belonged to the government. The MP alleged that certain part of the land with the deemed varsity was under disputed ownership, which is in violation of Clause 7.7 of AICTE approval process and relevant regulations of the UGC. The land use certificate and building approvals were obtained from the competent authorities, but through manipulation, he alleged. An inquiry by the State government revealed that the GITAM Deemed to be University encroached 40.51 acres. The said land was not alienated to the university nor was there a lease agreement between the parties, he claimed. Intake Besides, the private university was offering technical courses without adhering to standards specified by the AICTE, he said. The intake in various branches of engineering had been dramatically increased over the years by adding new sections/divisions. For instance, as per AICTE website, the intake of B.Tech (CSE) stood at 1,140 for 2019-20, he alleged. Mr. Reddy suggested that the AICTE constitute a committee to find out whether GITAM Deemed to be University complied with its norms and possessed disputed land and what processes it followed for increasing the intake of students in different courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vijaya-sai-seeks-action-against-gitam-varsity/article33044674.ece
07 November 2020||GUWAHATI,||Will start NRC afresh after polls if apex court allows: Assam Minister||Assam will go for a fresh exercise to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) after the 2021 Assembly election if the Supreme Court gives the nod, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said. His assertion follows Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, where the former reportedly sought 10-20% re-verification of the names figuring in the complete NRC draft published on August 31, 2019. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in the State had rejected the NRC, alleging that former NRC State Coordinator Prateek Hajela had manipulated it. The list had excluded 19 lakh of the 3.3 crore applicants for failing to provide admissible documents establishing their citizenship. Addressing rallies in Udalguri district of the poll-bound Bodoland Territorial Council on Friday, Dr. Sarma said the BJP was firm on starting the NRC exercise afresh to weed out people of doubtful citizenship. On Thursday, he told presspersons that if given the opportunity, correcting the “fundamentally wrong” NRC over another five years would be enough to defeat the “modern Mughals,” a term the BJP has been using since the Congress and the Muslim-dominated All India United Democratic Front have been working on a pre-election alliance. “If the Supreme Court, which had monitored the NRC exercise, allows us, we will go for another exercise for an error-free list. We have already sought the apex court’s permission for re-verification of the names in the NRC,” Dr. Sarma said. The Assam government in July 2019 petitioned the Supreme Court for re-verification of 20% of names in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% in the other districts. The court did not accept the plea as Mr. Hajela told the court that 27% of the names had already been re-verified before the publication of the complete draft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-start-nrc-afresh-after-polls-if-apex-court-allows-assam-minister/article33045486.ece

Revanth Reddy staged a dharna in Malkajgiri Municipal Commissioner’s office demanding explanation from the Commissioner on the list of beneficiaries of Rs. 10,000 announced by government for flood victims and the mode of payment. Along with Congress workers, he sat on a protest raising slogans against the government for ‘siphoning off’ the money. He also submitted hundreds of applications of victims who have not been included in the beneficiaries list so far. He asked the commissioner as to who prepared the list and who was distributing the money. Mr. Reddy said he had given video clips of TRS leaders distributing the money rather than the officials and asked him why cases were not filed against them. He also asked the commissioner why he was not invited for cash distribution despite being a Parliament member. The commissioner remained silent. Later, speaking to the gathering outside, he said it was shameful that the TRS leaders were ‘looting’ money meant for people suffering due to unprecedented floods. Congress leader Srisailam Yadav and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/revanth-seeks-list-of-flood-relief-beneficiaries/article33045549.ece
07 November 2020||Kolkata,||Mamata has taken misgovernance to new low: Shah||Attacking the West Bengal government on multiple fronts — from law and order to non-implementation of Central schemes —, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would win more than 200 of the 294 seats in the Assembly polls scheduled next year. “Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has taken misgovernance to a new low. There has been politicisation of administration, criminalisation of politics, and corruption has been institutionalised. I do not think there is any single State where all the three developments have taken place simultaneously,” Mr. Shah said at a press conference. He said that the State government had failed on all parameters, and sought support from people to make it ‘ sonar Bangla ’ (golden Bengal). The Home Minister accused Ms. Banerjee of appeasement politics and said that there were different sets of laws for “Ms. Banerjee’s vote bank” and for common people. Earlier in the day, after visiting the Dakhineshwar Kali temple, Mr. Shah said that the “rich spiritual tradition of West Bengal has been tarnished by appeasement politics”. The BJP leader said that the State had not furnished the data on crime to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) since 2018. “I want to ask Ms. Banerjee why she is not providing data on crime. What do you want to hide?” he asked. Quoting the data from the NCRB report for 2018, Mr. Shah said that West Bengal had recorded the third highest crimes against women, second in attempts of rape, and the highest in acid attacks. The Home Minister claimed that the State had the highest number of political killings, and demanded that the CM release a white paper on the issue. Mr. Shah emphasised that the BJP under the leadership of J.P. Nadda was taking the West Bengal elections very seriously. “We will fight it and win the State,” he said. He also alleged that “Ms. Banerjee wants to make her nephew the Chief Minister next term” and said that it was for the people to decide whether they wanted dynasty politics or development. The Home Minister raised the issue of non-implementation of Central schemes like Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan, and said West Bengal was one of worst States in terms of implementation of all the 80 Central schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mamata-has-taken-misgovernance-to-new-low-shah/article33044929.ece

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Finance panel warns of rising GST dues for States||The gap between GST cess collections and the revenue shortfall faced by the States for implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) could snowball to anywhere between Rs. 5 lakh crore to Rs. 7 lakh crore by June 2022 from the Rs. 2.35 lakh crore estimated for this year, the Fifteenth Finance Commission is learnt to have projected in its report. The Commission, which finalised its report proposing a framework for sharing revenues between the Centre and the States for the next five years on October 30, is learnt to have recommended a unique fiscal glide path for each State for the period 2020-21 to 2025-26, in a separate volume dedicated to the States. Given the uncertainty created by the pandemic and the economic slowdown that pre-dated the COVID-19 outbreak, the panel has had to rely on variable growth projections for each of the five years rather than assuming a steady trend. Report The report will be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovid on Monday. The panel has also delivered on its more unusual terms of reference, including the question of creating a separate mechanism for funding defence and internal security proposed by the Centre, citing inadequate Budgetary provisions for large capital outlays needed for complete defence preparedness. “The Commission has examined and responded to the Defence Ministry’s proposal to set up a non-lapsable fund for security-related expenditure, whether it should be funded by a cess or a surcharge, and supplemented by monetisation of surplus defence land, issue of tax-free defence bonds and disinvestment of defence public sector units,” said an official, pointing to the additional pressure on the Centre’s finances due to the fall in revenues and the flailing economy. Unless there is a sustained rise in GST collections over the next 20 months (till June 2022), the Commission has projected that the gap between the GST cess collections used to recompense States and their compensation dues could accumulate to a significant sum of “between Rs. 5 lakh crore to Rs. 7 lakh crore”, said the official privy to the Commission’s assessment of States’ fiscal positions. The resolution and the modalities adopted for the payment of GST compensation dues to States would significantly impact the fiscal consolidation roadmap for India’s general government debt, the official said. While the revenue shortfall for States is pegged at Rs. 3 lakh crore this year, GST cess collections are expected to be just Rs. 65,000 crore, on account of the sharp contraction in the economy that was already slowing down before the COVID-19 pandemic and was exacerbated by the lockdowns.

07 November 2020||Kolkata,||TMC accuses BJP of insulting Bengal’s culture||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday raised the issue of Union Home Minister Amit Shah garlanding a wrong statue claiming it to be of Birsa Munda in Bankura and questioned his claims of appeasement politics made from the Dakshineswar Kali Temple premises, and said that Mr. Shah and the BJP were insulting the culture of West Bengal by such acts. On Thursday, Mr. Shah garlanded a statue at Bankura which according to locals was the statue of a tribal hunter, not Birsa Munda. When the news spread, local BJP leaders put a photograph of Birsa Munda on the statue. “Bohiragato' ( outsiders) are at it again! Union Home Minister @AmitShahis so ignorant of Bengal's culture that he insulted Bhagwan Birsa Munda by garlanding a wrong idol & placed his photo at someone else's foot. Will he ever respect Bengal?,” the TMC tweeted. Later in the evening, while addressing a press conference, TMC MP Sukendu Sekhar Roy raised the issue and said that it was unfortunate that the Home Minister had not done his homework and insulted the tribal population. The State’s ruling party also took on Mr. Shah for his remarks on appeasement politics made from the Dakshineswar Kali Temple premises. The BJP leader earlier in the day said that rich “tradition of spirituality in West Bengal has been tarnished by appeasement politics”. “Sri Ramakrishna worshipped goddess Kali at Dakshineswar, but also went to Church and is said to have practised all religions. Was Ramakrishna doing appeasement?” Mr. Roy asked. Responding to Mr. Shah’s remarks targeting the State government, the TMC issued a statement saying, “People of Bengal are ready to fight the battle. They will accept the challenge”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tmc-accuses-bjp-of-insulting-bengals-culture/article33044932.ece

07 November 2020||New Delhi,||SC relief for Arnab in privilege case||The Supreme Court on Friday took suo motu cognisance and issued a contempt notice against the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretary for browbeating Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, who came to court to protect his rights. A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, asked the Secretary to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt for “threatening” Mr. Goswami with a “penalty” just because the journalist had approached the top court in connection with a privilege motion. In an October 13 letter, the Assembly official accused Mr. Goswami of “knowingly” breaching the confidentiality of the privilege proceedings by moving the top court without taking the permission of the Speaker. The court ordered that Mr. Goswami not be arrested in the privilege case. Mr. Goswami is accused of breach of privilege for using “sharp language” against the Maharashtra Chief Minister. “He [Goswami] is in jail... He is being threatened, questioned... Case after case after case is being filed against this man. At times, constitutional courts have to see the reality and not just the smokescreen... He has been warned... They have said he will spend Diwali in jail,” senior advocate Harish Salve, for Mr. Goswami, submitted. Referring to the October 13 letter, the Chief Justice said the Secretary’s statements were a “serious interference in the administration of justice”. “How dare he [Secretary] do this? Who is this official? How can he threaten a person from coming to this court?” Chief Justice Bobde said. He recounted how the late Supreme Court judge, Justice Vivian Bose, several decades ago, took suo motu contempt action against a jail officer, who withheld a letter written by a convict to the top court. It’s the right of every citizen to move the Supreme Court to protect his fundamental rights, the CJI said. The court said the statements made in the Secretary’s letter were “unprecedented” and had a “tendency to bring the administration of justice into disrepute and, in any case, amount to a direct interference in the administration of justice”. The Bench, in its order summoning the Assembly Secretary, said “the intention of the author of the letter seems to be to intimidate the petitioner [Goswami] because he had approached this court”. The CJI said that though the Assembly was served notice on October 5 in Mr. Goswami’s petition, they chose to respond by issuing the October 13 letter to the journalist rather than entering appearance in court. The court appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar as amicus curiae in the suo motu contempt proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-relief-for-arnab-in-breach-of-privilege-case/article33044726.ece

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Coal auctions subject to our orders, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday passed an interim order saying that any action by the Centre concerning the auction of commercial mining blocks in Jharkhand will be subject to further orders passed by the court in future. “Any action you take will be subject to our orders ... We will hear this case after reopening [post Deepavali vacation],” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde told Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal in a short hearing. The court said it was adjourning the case for now after taking into account Mr. Venugopal’s earlier submission that “action on the ground would be taken only after two years”. Senior advocate Fali Nariman, for Jharkhand government, also elicited an assurance from Mr. Venugopal that there would be no cutting of trees in the meanwhile. In the previous hearing, the court had considered passing directions to freeze the e-auction of mining blocks located within a 50-km radius of ecologically fragile zones in Jharkhand in a bid to ensure that forests are not destroyed. “We do not want the development of the country to stop, but we do not also want the destruction of the natural wealth of the country,” the Chief Justice had addressed Mr. Venugopal. The court had highlighted the devastation of forests, cutting of trees and the displacement of tribal populations for which mining involved. The Bench had even suggested to Mr. Venugopal to hold the e-auction till an expert committee conducted a survey of the environmental impact and filed report in one month. The court is hearing a suit filed by the Jharkhand government against a decision of the Centre to auction coal blocks for commercial mining. Referring to the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, dealing with administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes, the State has said that six of the nine coal blocks in Jharkhand — Chakla, Chitarpur, North Dhadu, Rajhara North, Seregarha and Urma Paharitola — put up for auction fall within the protected areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coal-auctions-subject-to-our-orders-says-sc/article33045395.ece

He advised people to use only “green crackers” instead. While the Chief Minister had earlier in the day told presspersons that the government would “ban” bursting firecrackers, a communique from his office in the evening did not announce a blanket ban. It said several suggestions had been made on banning sale and use of firecrackers. “The government has taken several measures to stem the spread of COVID-19. In this context, it is appropriate to celebrate Deepavali in a simple manner in the interest of public, particularly children,” it said. Further, the Chief Minister urged people to use only green crackers. Experts’ suggestion The Health and Family Welfare Department and a panel of experts on COVID-19 had suggested a ban on firecrackers in the light of the pandemic. Health Minister D. Sudhakar had said a final decision on the issue would be taken by the Chief Minister. Already, Delhi, Odisha, and Rajasthan have banned use of firecrackers during Deepavali. The National Green Tribunal has already expanded the jurisdiction of hearing cases on pollution by use of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region and issued notices to 18 States, including Karnataka, and the Union Territories where air quality is beyond norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-seeks-to-cut-use-of-fireworks-during-deepavali/article33044666.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||Tejashwi breasts the tape in campaign miles||The 2020 Bihar Assembly election will be remembered, among various things, for the energetic and confident campaign by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Lalu Prasad’s political heir Tejashwi Yadav. Almost sprinting from one venue to the next, he addressed 247 rallies and four roadshows, the highest by any leader in this election. His campaign tours began on October 16, seven days ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first rally in the State on October 23. And in every rally, he repeated in front of a delirious crowd, “Will you give one chance to your brother? The day your brother becomes the Chief Minister, he will sanction 10 lakh government jobs.” On October 20, the first opinion poll by Lokniti-CSDS predicted a 6% lead for the NDA alliance. The very next day, Mr. Tejashwi took out 12 rallies. His highest number on a single day was 19 on October 31, when he took the battle to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s homeground Nalanda. Out of the 19 rallies, four rallies were in Nalanda alone. With roaring crowds hanging on his every word, the RJD managed to pitch the contest as an energetic Mr. Yadav versus a “tired” Mr. Kumar. The 31-year-old repeatedly exhorted the 69-year-old Mr. Kumar to retire. Mr. Yadav didn’t automatically ascend to the driving seat. Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Bihar Chief Minister and leader of the Hindustani Awam Morcha, who was initially a part of the grand alliance, was the first to raise questions about his leadership. Mr. Manjhi quit the alliance in August over demands including a consensus choice of the alliance leader, a condition which the RJD rejected outright. Partners move on In September, another ally, Upendra Kushwaha, quit. This was followed by the dramatic exit of the third ally, Mukesh Sahani of the Vikassheel Insaan Party on October 3, the day the grand alliance announced its seat-sharing arrangement. Mr. Sahani walked out of a press conference, saying he had been backstabbed over a vague promise of being accommodated out of the RJD’s share. During these campaigns by the smaller allies, the Congress also occasionally spoke out against Mr. Tejashwi’s leadership. But the rallies ended any lingering doubts. At the end of the 20-day campaign, Mr. Yadav had addressed 47 rallies for the Congress candidates. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was the most visible face of the party in the State, addressed only eight rallies. Mr. Yadav has addressed another 23 public meetings for the Left parties, mainly the CPI(ML), and is undoubtedly the face of the mahagatbandhan today with the slogan: ‘ Tejashwi tai hai !’ Even his father Lalu Prasad’s photographs were removed from posters to offload the burden of “jungle raj”, the central theme of Mr. Kumar’s campaign. Observers point out that at no point did Mr. Yadav react to provocations by the Prime Minister or Mr. Kumar. Mr. Modi called him “ jungle raj ka yuvraj ” and there was no retort from the RJD to it. Mr. Yadav insists that he is sticking to his agenda. Mr. Kumar, without directly referring to Mr. Yadav, said that development could not be expected from those who have eight or nine children just to get a son. In response, Mr. Yadav merely called the Chief Minister “mentally and physically tired”. The RJD leaders themselves are surprised by the response they got. “This was not planned. We do not have the resources to bring people to the ground in buses. The crowd that you saw in rallies was completely spontaneous. What you saw was Tejashwi being directly in sync with people,” senior RJD leader Manoj K. Jha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tejashwi-breasts-the-tape-in-campaign-miles/article33044692.ece

Measles, polio alert Meanwhile, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued an urgent call to action to avert major measles and polio epidemics as COVID-19 continues to disrupt immunisation services worldwide, leaving millions of vulnerable children at heightened risk of preventable childhood diseases. A release issued by WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on health services and in particular immunization services, worldwide. But unlike with COVID, we have the tools and knowledge to stop diseases such as polio and measles. What we need are the resources and commitments to put these tools and knowledge into action. If we do that, children’s lives will be saved.” “We cannot allow the fight against one deadly disease to cause us to lose ground in the fight against other diseases,” Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-leads-in-death-toll/article33044701.ece
07 November 2020||Hyderabad,||Win-win for health freaks, farmers and environment||There are more consumers of chemical-free food today than there were a few years ago. Beyond the organic labels, nudging consumers to think about sustainable practices that are good for farmers, soil health and the ecosystem, is Beyond Organic. A collaborative initiative by Disha Collective and Deccan Development Society (DDS), Beyond Organic (confarm.mystrikingly.com) connects 100 urban consumers with nearly 100 farmers in Zaheerabad, Sangareddy district. The initiative began in 2017. Each year, consumers invest Rs. 12,500 to Rs. 25,000, which works as an interest-free loan for the farmers. In return, consumers get grains and pulses. “Most farmers own not more than one or two acres,” says Tejaswi Dantuluri, co-founder and managing director of Disha Collective. DDS guides the farmers, mostly women, in natural farming methods. The emphasis is on biodiversity, with farmers cultivating 15 varieties of grains and pulses — jowar, bajra, ragi and other millets, horse gram, green moong, toor, urad, sesame, lobia and more. The consumer connect has guaranteed farmers an assured market. “About 98 farmers from Arjun Naik Thanda of Zaheerabad no longer depend on loans with interest. They also don’t depend on outside markets to sell their produce. As for consumers, they could get uninterrupted supply of healthy grains even during lockdown,” says Tejaswi. Beyond Organic also encourages urban consumers to visit the farms during festivals or partake in harvesting. The quantity of grains and pulses that consumers get to take home is decided based on yield and size of each grain cultivation, explains Tejaswi: “If a farm has 50% millets, 30% pulses and 20% vegetables, the consumer basket is in that proportion approximately.” Tejaswi’s interest in food and health stemmed from her father Satyanarayana Raju, who has been an avid enthusiast of holistic wellness practices. Years ago, when the family lived in Pune and lost a close relative in his 20s due to a health condition, it got them thinking seriously about health. “Gradually, our home became a place for deeper discussions on wellness; my father formed a study circle called Disha to discuss health, environment, stress factors and related topics,” says Tejaswi. Once Mr.Raju moved to Hyderabad after retirement, the interest in agroecology and health became a mainstay. Meanwhile, Tejaswi had taken up graduation in physics and enrolled into NCC’s air wing, wanting to be a pilot. In a year, she experienced what it meant to fly. When she thought she was working her way towards being a pilot, an accident grounded her. “I was bedridden for a couple of months,” she recalls. However, that too became a turning point. The family’s focus on food, health and ecology had a bearing on her. “From wanting to fly, I got more interested in soil health and people dependent on it,” she says. After completing her master’s course in communications, she began interacting with farmers when she took up a communications posting with the DDS. Looking ahead, Tejaswi says Beyond Organic is keen to have more urban consumers on board to help more farmers take up traditional biodiverse farming: “We have nearly 500 farmers ready to be supported but we don’t have enough consumers on board. We are looking at organisations, schools and IT companies who can partner with farmers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/win-win-for-health-freaks-farmers-and-environment/article33044761.ece

A civilian was also killed and another civilian and a soldier were injured. “Due to the darkness, the operation was suspended on Thursday night at Lalpora-Chatlam area,” said Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar. “It was resumed in the early hours. In the ensuing encounter, two trapped terrorists were killed. One local terrorist offered to surrender. He agreed to lay down his arms and ammunition during the live encounter.” The surrendered militant was identified as Khawar Sultan Mir of Drangbal in Pampore. “All the terrorists were affiliated with the LeT,” Mr. Kumar said.

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Campaign to amplify voices of women leaders||The U.K. in India network and over a hundred partners have come together as part of a campaign to promote gender equality. The effort focuses on taking practical steps and designing policies to empower organisations and individuals to challenge gender norms. A collective of 114 organisations have signed a “Pledge for Progress” under this campaign for five key commitments. Best practices These include amplifying voices of women leaders within organisations and beyond; seeking gender diverse representation at panels; including gender analysis in the design, implementing and evaluating activities; and developing and sharing best practices together as a collective. “The idea was to just get all of the organisations we interact with to sign up to take this pledge. This is not some esoteric project, but involves taking practical steps. It’s kind of a forum for sharing best practices for raising our collective ambition and drive up standards. We hope that we will all hold ourselves to the pledge we signed, and certainly I intend to, having put my signature to our pledge,” Acting British High Commissioner to India Jan Thompson told The Hindu . The pledge was administered on Thursday to 114 organisations, including HCL Technologies, ActionAid India, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Tata Power, Fortis Healthcare and Vistara, among others. Ms. Thompson explained that preliminary discussions were also held with these organisations on the gendered impact of the pandemic on employment and care responsibilities, among others, and that signatories to the pledge would be exploring ways to address these collectively in the months to come. Local partners The U.K. government in India also works with its local partners to generate employment and business opportunities for women as well as ensure financial and digital inclusion for them. The economic consequences of the pandemic have also necessitated tweaking of some of these interventions. “We have been trying to repurpose and find alternative sources of income. And some of them (micro-businesses) have tried to tap into new requirements that have come up like masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), sanitising, which have become a source of revenue for them. We have also tried to help them with working capital wherever we can. We heard a nice story recently about an e- rickshaw company we work with in Uttar Pradesh, where they have been upskilling their women rickshaw drivers to spread awareness and information around health and hygiene, and their sales teams are now selling health and hygiene products to curb the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable communities. So this is how they have repurposed their effort,” the Acting High Commissioner added. The U.K. government also plans to start new initiatives in the months to come, which will be specifically focused on women entrepreneurs to help them to build back their businesses better.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/campaign-to-amplify-voices-of-women-leaders/article33045405.ece
07 November 2020||Patna,||Lalu’s bail plea deferred till Nov. 27||The bail plea of Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad in the case pertaining to the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs. 3.13 crore from the Dumka treasury was deferred on Friday by the Jharkhand High Court till November 27. “Lalu Prasad has served over half the jail term in the case, so we had applied for bail. But the CBI deliberately did not file a counter-affidavit in the case and the court has asked the agency to file it by November 23 so that the case can be heard on November 27,” Prabhat Kumar, Mr. Prasad’s lawyer, told The Hindu . Mr. Prasad was awarded a five years’ jail term in the Dumka (Jharkhand) treasury case. Fodder scam He has been convicted in four of the five multi-crore fodder scam cases in Jharkhand, and has been granted bail in three. There were expectations in party circles that Mr. Prasad would get bail in the Dumka treasury case and be released from jail. Currently, Mr. Prasad is undergoing treatment for multiple diseases at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he is housed at the Kelly Bungalow on the hospital premises. He had been in the Birsa Munda central jail of Jharkhand since December 2017 after being convicted in the fodder scam cases. Recently, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi Yadav had said that his father would come out of jail on November 9 and there would be a “farewell for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar the next day”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lalus-bail-plea-deferred-till-nov-27/article33044686.ece
07 November 2020||GUWAHATI,||Will start NRC afresh after polls if SC allows: Himanta||Assam will go for a fresh exercise to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) after the 2021 Assembly election if the Supreme Court gives the nod, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said. His assertion follows Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah where the former reportedly sought 10-20% re-verification of the names figuring in the complete NRC draft published on August 31, 2019. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in the State had rejected the NRC, alleging that former NRC State Coordinator Prateek Hajela had manipulated it. The list had excluded 19 lakh of the 3.3 crore applicants for failing to provide admissible documents establishing their citizenship. Addressing rallies in Udalguri district of the poll-bound Bodoland Territorial Council on Friday, Dr. Sarma said the BJP was firm on starting the NRC exercise afresh to weed out people of doubtful citizenship. On Thursday, he told presspersons that if given the opportunity, correcting the “fundamentally wrong” NRC over another five years would be enough to defeat the “modern Mughals,” a term the BJP has been using since the Congress and the Muslim-dominated All India United Democratic Front have been working on a pre-,election alliance. “If the Supreme Court, which had monitored the NRC exercise, allows us, we will go for another exercise for an error-free list. We have already sought the apex court’s permission for re-verification of the names in the NRC,” Dr. Sarma said. The Assam government in July 2019 petitioned the Supreme Court for re-verification of 20% of names in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% in the other districts. The court did not accept the plea as Mr. Hajela told the court that 27% of the names had already been re-verified before the publication of the complete draft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-start-nrc-afresh-after-polls-if-sc-allows-himanta/article33044697.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ties with U.S. cover every sphere: India||India on Friday reiterated that ties with the United States enjoy strong bipartisan support. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said India was waiting for the result of the U.S. Presidential election and maintained that ties had become better over the years because of cross party consensus in Washington DC regarding India. “India-U.S. relations rest on strong foundation and our relation encompasses cooperation in every possible sphere, extending from strategic to defence, to investment to trade, to people to people ties. The comprehensive global strategic partnership has very strong bipartisan support in the U.S. and successive Presidents and administrations have raised the level of this relationship even higher,” he said. Mr. Srivastava laid out the extent of Indo-U.S. relationship while answering a question on how India was preparing for the arrival of Joe Biden as the next President of the United States. Significantly, India and the United States held “2+2” discussions on October 27. The U.S.-India “2+2” Ministerial Dialogue, attended by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Dr. Mark Esper on the U.S. side and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, sealed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for geo spatial information sharing. The official said that India was looking forward to the result of the U.S. Presidential election. Counting over the last two days indicated former Vice-President Biden who had played an important role during the negotiation of the India-U.S. nuclear deal, will be the next occupant of the White House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ties-with-us-cover-every-sphere-india/article33044707.ece
07 November 2020||Srinagar,||Why silence us, Mehbooba asks govt.||Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, who are touring Jammu to conduct a meeting of the Peoples Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), on Friday took jibes at the Centre and at the critics of their alliance. “If the government claims that everything is fine and normal, then why are you scared of us? You don’t allow us to protest and silence us using police and troopers. The government should allow the people of J&K to express themselves freely. Our leaders were held for holding peaceful protests against the land laws,” said Ms. Mufti. She warned that choking the voice of the people and pushing people to the wall “may not augur well”. “People are the ultimate source of power and you can’t silence them using brute force. How can you take decisions against the wishes of the people? It seems democracy is there only on paper now,” Ms. Mufti said. Speaking in Jammu, Ms. Mufti said those who supported the abrogation of Article 370 “will repent tomorrow”. She said not the Constitution but the Bharatiya Janata Party’s agenda was being followed across the country. Dr. Abdullah, who chaired a meeting of his party workers in Jammu, took jibe at those criticising him as “anti-national” for his remarks. “If they think themselves to be so powerful, why don’t they show it to the enemy on the borders? On the contrary, our party has not only shown but faced the tribals in 1947 to save Srinagar. Now, Farooq Abdullah is a Pakistani, Chinne (of China) and what not today,” Dr. Abdullah said. ‘Fight not against nation’ Dr. Abdullah said he was not afraid of anyone and would fight for the restoration of rights to the people of J&K for all his life. “The NC (National Conference) represents the ethos and aspirations of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The political environment in J&K is in a flux again, a year after the spiteful and unconstitutional nullification of Articles 370, 35A,” he said. On the Gupkar alliance, he said it had no territorial and religious bearings. “We have come together to restore what was spitefully snatched from us on the 5th of August. We are not fighting an exclusive battle. Our unity has sent the people at the helm of affairs to a tizzy, which is why they are naming us as anti-nationals,” he said. “No one can browbeat the Gupkar declaration to silence. It is reflective of the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Our fight is not against the nation, it is against the BJP that aims to divide us," he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-are-you-scared-of-us-mehbooba-asks-govt/article33044710.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,||Phase I extension of Metro likely to open early next year||Chennai Metro Rail’s much awaited north line, connecting Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar, is likely to be opened in the last week of January or the first week of February next. At a recently held high-level meeting, officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited informed the State government that the stretch would be open for operations in two months. Delay due to pandemic The phase I extension should have been inaugurated by June but the construction schedule was delayed due to the pandemic and the deadline was pushed by several months. The extension will provide better transport options for commuters residing in north Chennai. The signalling system for this project would likely be installed by mid-January. After that, the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) and his team will conduct an inspection. According to officials, the CMRS will check the construction of the stations, facilities for emergency evacuation, the quality of construction and the working of passenger-related amenities like information display systems and automated fare collection gates. All-clear certificate “When the CMRS issues certification saying that the Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar stretch is fit for operations, the train services will begin,” an official said. Sources said the existing frequency was likely to be maintained when the phase I extension is opened. While some sources said the delay in the signalling system could be the reason for the project inauguration being deferred till the end of January, others said the pace of construction of stations also contributed to it. “We are expecting a marginal increase in patronage after trains services commence in north Chennai,” another official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/phase-i-extension-of-metro-likely-to-open-early-next-year/article33044762.ece
07 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Jatha to tell stories of the working class||The COVID-19 pandemic has not just been about health and medical facilities, but also about the socio-economic impact on a large section of people. Documenting these trying times, and bringing back the tradition of cultural jathas , theatre group Samudaya has organised ‘Olithu Maadu Manusa - A Salute to the Working Class’. The group is working in collaboration with the Gram Seva Sangh. Through theatrical performances, the artistes will highlight the problems created by the pandemic and the miseries faced by labourers, migrant workers, and rural artisans, as well as the social commitment exhibited by doctors, nurses, and the paramedical staff. The three-day jatha will culminate at Charaka in Heggodu, Sagar, on Sunday. According to the group, “art is not for art’s sake, but for life’s sake.” The objective is to reach out to the masses, salute the people, and make this a confidence-building exercise for them. “At present, we are witnessing an onslaught by the pandemic, which is weakening our entire social system. Masks and sanitisers are our two weapons to face this contagion. There are also many attempts being made in the medicalfield to discover a vaccine to prevent this malady. Samudaya’s latest street play, Olithu Maadu Manusa, reflects some heart-rending incidents and the humane and inhumane reactions of our society in this period,” a statement from the group said. Shashidhar Bharighat from Samudaya told The Hindu that the plan was to stage four plays a day. “There are 12 artistes and three singers. Wherever we are travelling, we will get many taluk headquarters. So we will put on shows wherever we can. Some local activists in those places will also be joining us,” he said. He said their jathas were popular in the 1970s and ’80s. “This time, we are bringingstories around the pandemic, panning weavers, farmers, migrant workers, and the corona warriors. Social distancing has meant that even cremation is not possible normally. Many have also written poetry about these issues. So even those will be showcased,” he said. The group is in its 44th year of existence, but this will be a unique exercise, given the circumstances. “We are takingprecautions — sanitisation of vehicle, ensuring masks are worn — as the artistes are working professionals, students etc.,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jatha-to-tell-stories-of-the-working-class/article33044763.ece

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Foreigners distorted Indian way: RSS chief||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday said foreigners perceived the Indian way of life, its languages and customs from their own narrow perspective, promoted whatever interpretations suited them and subdued those who opposed it in the past. Speaking at the launch of Sanskrit Non-Translatables: The Importance of Sanskritizing English , a book by Rajiv Malhotra and Satyanarayana Dasa Babaji, Mr. Bhagwat said the use of an incorrect word could lead to erroneous communication and wrong consequences. The book was released by Swami Govind Dev Giri, trustee and treasurer of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra. ‘To keep us confused’ The RSS chief said foreigners drew conclusions based on their experience and understanding, and not from the Indian perspective, and imposed them on Indians to always “keep them confused” about their own languages and terminologies. Indians who failed to counter the adverse outside influence even started becoming a tool for the attempts to dismantle the country’s “dharma-sanskriti”, he said. Mr. Bhagwat said Indians themselves had become disconnected from their roots, which helped foreigners create confusion. Owing to all this, what had the potential to become a “vishwa-dharma” got reduced to a mere “religion” for Indians. “Dharma” did not mean “religion”, but it became so “as foreigners could not grasp the profoundness of its purport”, he said. The RSS chief said the book probed into such fundamental issues and would convey to the world the exact and deep meaning of the 54 Sanskrit words discussed therein. It would dispel confusion, correct distortions and help overcome the “colonisation of mind”.  ‘Revolutionary idea’ Terming “Sanskrit non-translatables” a revolutionary idea, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy said it was “a new way of Sanskritising English, which is now an international language”. In this context, Dr. Swamy said, the authors were advocating what they called “loaning Sanskrit words to English without a translation”. “[Sanskrit] words acquire a false meaning if brought through translation,” he said. “We have today a Sanskritisation process which Mr. Malhotra and Babaji want to accelerate,” said Dr. Swamy, adding that there were now “schools of thought that made people learn Sanskrit by memorisation, without knowing the meaning, as mere repetition of words helped develop the brain faster than in any other language”. International language He gave the example of a London-based school which had made Sanskrit a second compulsory language. “We are having today a situation where Sanskrit may become an international language. It is already now accepted as the sole international language for artificial intelligence,” he added. Among the speakers were Vijay Bhatkar, Chancellor of Nalanda University, and Madhu Kishwar, Subhash Kak, Kapil Kapoor, Chamu Krishna Shastry, Nikunj Trivedi and Arnav Kejriwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/foreigners-distorted-indian-way-rss-chief/article33045403.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||‘It is a long journey to distribute fortified rice at govt. schools’||Experts warn that a long journey lies ahead to implement distribution of fortified rice at government schools and anganwadi centres in 15 States as there is need to bring millers and snack manufacturers on board and improve quality control. However, some are also wary of its nutritional outcomes and caution that fortification of staples such as cereals may hurt local economies. The government announced earlier this week its plans to expand supply of rice fortified with iron, vitamin B-12 and folic acid on a pilot basis from 15 districts to 15 States with the aim to curb anaemia. “Fortified rice can provide 30-50% of the recommended dietary allowance of iron that adults need to consume daily, based on average Indian consumption,” says Mini Varghese, Country Director-India, Nutrition International, an organisation partnering with the government to implement a pilot project distributing fortified rice through fair price shops in 15 districts, and expand it to all anganwadis and government schools in 115 districts next year. Baseline studies “Trials in a controlled setting, giving 100% RDA of iron through tablets, have shown results within 10 months. However, in a programmatic setting, with fortified rice, a minimum of 24 months of constant exposure is needed before we can see the impact,” she said, adding that baseline studies are now being conducted in the 15 pilot districts to measure current levels of anaemia in the population. The immediate next step requires convincing food manufacturers to use the extrusion machines now used to make snacks such as kurkure or dried pasta shapes to also make fortified rice kernels, enriched with iron and other nutrients. “So far, there are about 15 manufacturers making the kernels, producing a total of 15,000 tonnes per year. The government is talking to other manufacturers and also looking at an expansion in existing capacity, so that the output can be increased to 1.3 lakh tonnes for the 112 districts,” said Suresh Lakshminarayanan, National Program Manager, Food Fortification- India, Nutrition International, who participated in a meeting with the Food Ministry on the subject earlier this week. The other immediate step is bringing the country’s 28,000 rice millers on board, to install blending machines which can mix the fortified kernels into the normal rice in a 1:100 ratio. “Millers will have to make the immediate investment, but the government may offer loans or other incentives to create an enabling environment. They are also being promised good return on investment,” said another government partner. Since the fortified kernels look and taste the same as normal rice grains, there is also an urgent need for quality control to ensure that consumers are not being cheated, and FSSAI is in talks with NABL labs to build capacity for such testing, he added. However, the most important step in the long term will be to create awareness of the benefits of fortified foods. “In order to take it to scale, there is a need to create demand for fortified rice by ensuring that it is integrated in our food system and implemented in the open market. Its distribution should not just be limited to social feeding programmes such as Mid Day Meals for government schools and anganwadi beneficiaries but expanded beyond by building on the successes of salt iodisation programme,” says Sheila C. Vir, Founder Director, Public Health Nutrition and Development Centre. Some public health experts also warn of adverse consequences of “the corporatisation of the food system” by insisting on processes that demand a centralisation of supplies. “Local economies should be protected by decentralising procurement and distribution. Since the impact on anaemia through fortification remains poorly evidenced, such processes may do more harm than good. Micronutrient supplementation can be achieved by many other means, including diversification of diets and providing better quality meals, as well as through supplements that don’t further centralise food systems,” says Vandana Prasad, public health professional associated with the People’s Health Movement, India and the Right to Food Campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-is-a-long-journey-to-distribute-fortified-rice-at-govt-schools/article33044759.ece
07 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘Jagan committed to his promises’||The Andhra Pradesh government headed by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is committed to implementing the promises made during the padayatra conducted by Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy ahead of polls. Mr. Jagan’s programme coordinator Talasila Raghuram said the padayatra conducted by the YSR Congress president had changed the course of politics in Andhra Pradesh and enabled Mr. Jagan to understand the problems of people first hand. Welfare programmes The experiences learnt during the yatra formed the basis for a spree of welfare programmes like Amma Vodi launched by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Mr. Raghuram spoke to reporters here on Friday to mark completion of three years since Mr. Jagan launched the yatra in 2017. He recalled that the party leaders were skeptical over the implementation of the promises made during the padayatra. But Mr. Jagan was firm on translation of his words into action and introduced programmes for all sections. Drawing parallels with padayatra by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu, he said while Mr. Jagan’s yatra was focused on people issues, Mr. Naidu’s yatra was aimed at fulfilling selfish interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jagan-committed-to-keeping-his-promises/article33045557.ece

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC asks for written submissions from builders in Maradu case||The Supreme Court on Friday stopped short of putting the builders of the demolished and illegal high-rise Maradu apartment complexes in Kochi on a two-week deadline to provide a “concrete plan” to compensate residents or, in the alternative, face the sale of their attached properties to cover the payments due. A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman put that course of action on hold after senior advocate R. Basant and advocate Karthik Ashok interjected on behalf of some of the builders to point out that the court should first adjudicate on certain issues. Mr. Basant referred to a September 27, 2019 court ruling that ordered the Kerala government to pay Rs. 25 lakh each to residents whose flats were demolished. These amounts were then to be reimbursed to the government by those responsible for the flats coming up illegally in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. An October 28 report filed by the court-appointed committee led by Justice K. Balakrishnan Nair said the builders were responsible for the constructions and had to pay the compensation. Mr. Basant and other lawyers appearing for the builders opposed this recommendation, saying the entire liability for the illegal constructions cannot fall upon them. The court then asked the builders’ lawyers to file their written submissions for a detailed hearing. It said it would take up all aspects of the case. The case would come up again in December. The court also appointed advocate Gaurav Agarwal as amicus curiae in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-for-written-submissions-from-builders-in-maradu-case/article33044676.ece
07 November 2020||LUCKNOW,||Should Hathras DM continue, asks HC||The Allahabad High Court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government if it is “fair and reasonable” to allow the District Magistrate (DM) of Hathras to continue in his post during the pendency of the investigation into the case of alleged rape, and ‘hurried’ cremation of the victim, as he was in “the thick of things.” A Lucknow Bench of Justices Rajan Roy and Pankaj Mithal said, “...when he [Hathras DM Praveen Kumar Laxkar] was in the thick of things... would it not be appropriate to shift him elsewhere during pendency of these proceedings without there being any stigma attached to such an action only to ensure fairness and transparency in the matter.” Hurried cremation On October 12, the court said it was not satisfied with the government explanation on why it had taken action against the district police chief but not the DM on the alleged rape and “hurried” cremation of the victim, though it was admittedly a “collective decision”. On November 2, government counsel S.V. Raju assured the court that he would convey it (question of transferring the DM) to the government and come back with a reply on the next date of hearing, November 25. Vikrant Vir, the suspended SP of Hathras, appeared before the court and submitted his version and filed an affidavit. It was the DM and he (Mr. Vir) who had taken the decision to cremate the victim’s body in the night, he said. The court sked the CBI to file a status report on the investigation before the next date and indicate approximately how much time would likely be taken to complete it. Seema Kushwaha, counsel for the victim’s family, submitted that the family wanted to be shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/should-hathras-dm-continue-asks-hc/article33044703.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Meet targets to get air pollution funds’||The Central government’s decision to release only half of its budgetary allotment for combating air pollution was because of its plan to link the money disbursed to the States achieving certain ‘performance targets’. In February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “In large cities having population above one million, polluted air is a matter of concern... Allocation for this purpose is Rs. 4,400 crore for 2020-2021 and parameters for the incentives would be notified by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change.” On Monday, however, the Centre, based on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, released exactly half — Rs. 2,200 crore — to 15 States. The States, in turn, have to release money to local municipal bodies in 42 cities to take steps to monitor and mitigate air pollution. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the recipients of the largest tranches — of Rs. 396 crore and Rs. 357 crore respectively. Second tranche in Jan A senior official in the Environment Ministry, who declined to be identified, said the funds were being disbursed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Environment Ministry’s role was to set the performance parameters. These would be decided by the month-end. “The second instalment would be released in January 2021 against performance-based outcomes in terms of year-on-year improvement in air quality.” In July, officials of the Environment Ministry, as well as the steering committee of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), deliberated on the steps to be taken on the disbursal of funds, a person who was a part of the meeting told The Hindu . “Subsequently, it was decided that the funds would be given based on certain performance targets being met.” The NCAP envisages 102 of India’s most polluted cities reducing air pollution by 20-30% by 2024 with a reference year of 2017. The States, where these cities are located, have submitted a road map on how they would go about this reduction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/meet-targets-to-get-air-pollution-funds/article33044705.ece
07 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Forest department unravels elephant smuggling case||In a breakthrough in its probe into an inter-State elephant smuggling racket, the Forest Department has received information from Bihar that confirms suspicion of forgery in ownership certificates of two elephants that were allegedly smuggled by an absconding Kollam native. While the development has provided an impetus to the investigation, forest officials believe it is only the tip of the iceberg, indicating the possibility of a larger network of criminals behind the nefarious operation. The department launched an investigation into the suspected trade and illegal transfer of 200 elephants from various States a month ago following a “revelation” made by Kollam native V. Shaji on YouTube. The probe is led by the Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry), Kollam. While Shaji, the main accused in seven cases that were subsequently registered, and four others went absconding, forest officials arrested his friend and alleged accomplice Sanal Kumar of Puthenkulam in Kollam. Two elephants were also seized from Kumar’s possession. Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar took up the matter with his counterparts in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam to ascertain the authenticity of the ownership certificates of captive elephants that were in possession of the accused. After verifying the ownership certificates of two of Shaji’s elephants – Prasad and Modi — Prabhat Kumar Gupta, Chief Wildlife Warden in Bihar, officially communicated that the documents did not match with official records. The actual ownership certificate of one of the elephants had apparently been issued to a Patna native. Besides, the original certificates contained microchip numbers that differed with those found in the documents furnished by the accused. The elephants are believed to have been brought to Kerala in 2015. Concluding that the certificates were fake, the Bihar forest authorities urged their Kerala counterparts to initiate action, official sources said. While the response from the other States is expected, the Kerala Forest Department is set to submit two complaints to the police pertaining to the alleged forgery. Prior to the ongoing investigation, the department had registered at least five cases against Shaji, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forest-department-unravels-elephant-smuggling-case/article33044670.ece
07 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Elephant rehabilitation centre work on track||The first phase of the ongoing Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB)-funded development of the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Kottoor is set to be commissioned in February. The project, being executed by the Forest Department at a cost of Rs. 108 crore, is aimed at enhancing facilities to accommodate 50 elephants at the centre. At present, the elephant centre at Kottoor can house 16 pachyderms. The project is being undertaken across 176 hectares of forestland at Kottoor. Facilities Besides setting up enclosures for elephants , the project also involves the construction of various reservoirs and check-dams in the Neyyar reservoirs, an elephant museum, veterinary hospital with superspeciality facilities, a study and research centre for nature lovers and students, a training centre for mahouts, an entrance plaza, administrative office, parking facilties for visitors, cafeteria, cottages, toilet block and a special elephant viewing facility. According to an official release issued here, other components include a post-mortem facility and a cemetery, a large kitchen for preparing food for elephants and a feeding area. The project also envisages a large convention centre and an amphitheatre at Kottoor. A unit for manufacturing paper from elephant dung, mechanism for producing biogas from waste, and special facilities for collection and disposal of solid wastes, including non-recyclable plastics. The completion of the project will create 250 jobs, including 100 elephant herders, 40 of who will be accommodated with their families and 40 others who will be provided dormitory facilities. Tribespeople hailing from nearby settlements are also likely to get employment in various capacities at the centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elephant-rehabilitation-centre-work-on-track/article33044765.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||HC seeks CBI’s response to Sengar’s plea against conviction||The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on an appeal by expelled Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar challenging his conviction in the death of the Unnao rape victim’s father in 2018. Justice Vibhu Bakhru asked the investigation agency to respond to the appeal while posting the case for further hearing on November 10. On March 13 last, a special court here sentenced Sengar and six others to 10 years imprisonment in two cases linked to the death. On March 4, Sengar was held guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). One of the cases related to the death of the victim’s father on April 9, 2018, while the other was for possession of illegal arms. As alleged, the girl’s father was assaulted following an altercation with some of the accused on April 3, 2018. He was taken to the area police station and charges were framed for allegedly possessing an illegal firearm and sent to judicial custody, during which he died. Life imprisonment On December 20, 2019, a court sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment for raping the girl in 2017. Sengar, in his appeal filed through advocate Kanhaiya Singhal, claimed that the present case was an offshoot of a long-drawn political rivalry and deep-seated animosity existing between two political factions in the State. Charge against SP The plea claimed that Sengar and the co-accused persons, who are BJP supporters, and one of the primary witnesses and his associates who, Mr. Sengar claimed, owe their allegiance to the Samajwadi Party. “It would not be preposterous to submit that in the instant case neither the justice was done nor seen to be done,” Sengar’s plea said, and added that the picture displayed by some of the prosecution witnesses and other primary witnesses “has no connection with the truth”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-seeks-cbis-response-to-sengars-plea-against-conviction/article33045401.ece
07 November 2020||Mumbai,||Maharashtra board: no Class X, XII exams before May: Minister||Maharashtra School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday said the examinations of Class X and XII conducted by the State board will not be held before May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The current situation of the coronavirus is likely to last for a longer period. We have discussed the issue of completion of syllabus and holding of exams,” she said, while speaking to reporters. “The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will not be able to conduct the exams of Class X and XII before May,” Ms. Gaikwad said. “I have also discussed the issue of how much curriculum can be omitted so that teachers can complete the remaining part. We will have to cut at least 25% of the curriculum,” she added. Maharashtra Minister Uday Samant on Friday said he will be receiving a report on the technical glitches encountered by students during the online and offline examinations of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The State government had conducted online and offline exams for students of undergraduate and post-graduate courses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of these exams were supposed to be declared by October 31, but have been delayed. Speaking to reporters, the Minister for Higher and Technical Education said, “I am expecting a report in the next eight days on delays encountered during the exams. It will be too early to call it a conspiracy, but once the report is received, I will be able to say it firmly that the ploy has been foiled.” The Maharashtra government had conducted online exams for thousands of students, but due to poor internet connection and inaccessible servers, the period of exams was extended. According to officials from the department, some students had to spend the entire day to complete their exam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-board-no-class-x-xii-exams-before-may-minister/article33044933.ece

The State government had successfully implemented several novel initiatives in the farm sector, Mr. Vijayan said. Set up with the intention of transforming Wayanad into a floriculture hub and tapping the sector’s potential in Kerala, the centre would have technical support from the Netherlands government under the Indo-Dutch Joint Action Plan. Vegetables suited to the climate of Wayanad and flowers such as orchids, chrysanthemum, gladiolus and gerbera will be cultivated at the centre which will be equipped with Indian and Dutch-model polyhouses, hi-tech nurseries, and post-harvest facilities. The Rs. 13-crore centre will also explore agri-horti tourism possibilities in Wayanad district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-centre-for-flowers-veggies/article33044766.ece
07 November 2020||PALAKKAD,||Hornbill aficionados crowd Nelliyampathy||Nelliyampathy, one of the popular tourist spots in the district, has begun to witness an influx of birdwatchers and wildlife photographers as the mating season of Kerala’s State bird Great Hornbill began. Social media have helped people get to know the presence of the majestic hornbills in large numbers. But people reaching the hill station appear to care less for the sensitivity of the birds that prefer to perch atop large trees. Carrying large telescopic lenses, binoculars, tripods and monopods, wildlife aficionados have been thronging the areas such as Victoria, where the hornbills swarm in Nelliyampathy. When most have been reaching the spot with friends sharing the same passion, there have been others with family as well. “We have had an eyeful of the large beautiful birds with their wings spread out. It was an amazing sight to watch. It’s rare too,” said Nazeema Jaffer, a social worker from Palakkad who visited Nelliyampathy with her family. As Ms. Nazeema and her folks stood watching the hornbills with admiration, a large number of shutterbugs were jostling at different corners for a perfect and timely click. Disturbing peace “It’s never good for these birds which are extremely sensitive to human presence. Such crowding of people can harm the tranquillity that these giant birds seek out in a place such as Nelliyampathy,” said Ali Malappuram, a wildlife photographer. According to Mr. Ali, it will be better if each photographer assumed it on themselves the responsibility of respecting the aloofness that the hornbills prefer. Nemmara divisional forest officer C.P. Aneesh, under whose jurisdiction Nelliyampathy falls, said that there was nothing much they could do as long as the people did not trespass into the forest. But many trespassed while in pursuit of their remote targets perched on treetops. Mahesh N., a tribal youth who guided the lensmen, had a tough time convincing them not to enter the forestland. “Some people care little for my warnings. Some even threw their waste in here. I had to collect them and dispose of them in a proper place,” Mr. Mahesh told The Hindu.  Last weekend witnessed the heaviest crowd of bird lovers in Nelliyampathy. Forest officials said more than 2,500 vehicles, mostly bikes, had climbed the hill last week. A huge turnout is expected this weekend too at Nelliyamapthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hornbill-aficionados-crowd-nelliyampathy/article33044768.ece
07 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||CPI(M) to focus on Centre’s ‘tresspasses’||The three political coalitions in the State on Friday appeared to move fast to piece together a victory for themselves in the local body elections to be held in three phases in December. The polls are viewed widely as a bellwether of the State's voting behaviour in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2021 and their importance seemed not lost on the opposing fronts. Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) district committees had completed the process of seat-sharing smoothly. The controversies surrounding the gold smuggling case would have no bearing on the polls. People would give credit to the stellar record of the government in health and infrastructure development. The State secretariat of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] reportedly weighed political and legal action to counter the ‘wilful jurisdictional overreach’ of Central agencies to unsettle the LDF government politically. The party was likely to make the “trespasses on the rights of the State by the Centre” an election issue. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has made it evident that it will fight the LDF on an anti-corruption platform. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala stated that the Pinarayi Vijayan government posed a threat to the rule of law. It has even bent the ethics committee of the Assembly to its will in an attempt to fend off Central investigations into the illegal activities of Mr. Vijayan's office. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) felt that the electorate would try the alliance for a change. The CPI(M) and the Congress had alienated themselves from the public by making overtures to Islamist forces for electoral gain, BJP State president K. Surendran said. The party has made it clear that it would campaign on a rule of law platform by highlighting the arrest of Bineesh Kodiyeri on drug-trafficking linked money laundering charges and the gold smuggling case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-to-focus-on-centres-tresspasses/article33044668.ece
07 November 2020||Patna,||Chirag keeps up the tirade on poll eve||A day before the third phase polls for 78 seats across 15 districts in northeast Bihar, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Friday said: “Bihar is going to win and a new young Bihar will be made.” This was the time to save Bihar from being “destroyed more”, he said. “Even in such a difficult time, my courage did not break … to take pride in Bihar, I did not tremble when taking the decision of contesting the polls alone but, here, there are some people who have to take support of three friends despite being in power for 15 years…with the blessings of all of you, Bihar will win and a new young Bihar will be made,” Chirag Paswan tweeted in Hindi on Friday, indirectly attacking ruling Janata Dal(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The JD(U) contested the Bihar polls in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Vikassheel Insaan Party and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular). The LJP, led by Mr. Paswan, is not a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, and the party fielded candidates against JD(U)’s candidates. In another tweet, the LJP chief expressed concern over the way bureaucrats of the State had been living. “In the past 30 years, Bihar, which has gone from infamous to worse, the family members of bureaucrats working under the Bihar government have either been living in Patna or Delhi and they themselves live away from their families in different districts. What kind of life you are forced to live… This is the time to save Bihar from being destroyed more,” he said. The LJP chief has repeatedly been attacking Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and saying, “The BJP and LJP will form the next government in Bihar.” On Thursday, when Mr. Kumar, at a public meeting in Purnia during the poll campaign, said that this was his last election, Mr. Paswan immediately tweeted to take a dig on him: “Saheb [Nitish Kumar] has said that this is going to be his last election…he did not give an account this time of his last five years and said that now he would not come next time to give an account… you should not give your right to those who would not come tomorrow for your blessings…in the next poll, neither saheb will be there nor JD(U)…then with whom will we take account?” tweeted Mr Paswan. JD(U) leaders, too, slammed the LJP leader for his statements against party chief Nitish Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chirag-keeps-up-the-tirade-on-poll-eve/article33044684.ece
07 November 2020||Kolkata,||‘Misgovernance is at a new low in Bengal’||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Mamata Banerjee government on multiple fronts, from law and order to non-implementation of Central schemes, and asserted that the BJP would win more than 200 seats in West Bengal Assembly polls. The State has 294 constituencies. “Mamata Banerjee has taken misgovernance to a new low. There has been politicisation of administration and criminalisation of politics. Corruption has been institutionalised. I do not think there is any single State where all the three developments have taken place simultaneously,” he said at a press conference. The State government had failed on all parameters, he stated and sought the support of people to make it “sonar Bangla” (golden Bengal). Mr. Shah accused the Mamata government of appeasement politics. He said that there were different sets of laws for “Ms. Banerjee’s vote bank” and for common people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/misgovernance-is-at-a-new-low-in-bengal/article33044690.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Pennsylvania lead gets Biden closer to victory||So while it is possible in theory for Mr. Trump to get ahead of Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania as more votes are counted, it will be a challenge. In Georgia, Mr. Biden led by more than 1,500 votes. Based on the arithmetic, a Biden victory here or in Pennsylvania would mean the end of the road to 270 for Mr. Trump, who is at 214 votes. Mr. Biden’s lead on Friday in Georgia — traditionally a Republican state — emerged as votes came in for Clayton County, which is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. Democrats have performed strongly in the cities and suburbs of the State. In North Carolina, Mr. Trump was ahead by a bit under 77,000 and 95% of the votes counted. In Nevada, Mr. Biden was ahead by over 20,000 votes with 92% of the vote counted. Mr. Biden’s lead in Nevada has been growing with votes coming in from Democratic counties. Trump alleges rigging “If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,” Mr. Trump said at a speech in the White House press briefing room on Thursday. His sons, Don Jr. and Eric, called out Republicans on Twitter for not backing Mr. Trump. “The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’ is pretty amazing,” the junior Trump said. “He [Trump] and the American people deserve transparency & fairness as the votes are counted. The law must be followed. We have to keep the faith that the truth will prevail,” Nikki Haley, former UN Ambassador and Governor of South Carolina, tweeted shortly afterwards. Ms. Haley, who is of Indian descent, is a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate. While many Republicans stayed silent, some others, including Senator Lindsay Graham and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy backed Mr. Trump on Thursday. The President’s campaign has gone to court in several States to either have counting stopped or to seek greater access for observers to vote counting centres. However, judges dismissed lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia. The campaign has said it is considering a recount request in Wisconsin, which Mr. Biden won but any recount will have to wait until the election is certified — the State has until December 1 to complete that process. The Trump campaign has also sought an intervention by the Supreme Court, where ballots postmarked by November 3 may be counted until Friday (the court has thus far declined to intervene but it could still step in). Twitter labelled a number of Mr. Trump’s tweets on Thursday as misleading with regard to electoral participation. In his campaign speeches, Mr. Trump had of late added “big tech” to the establishment he was running and governing against these past years. Stay calm: Biden “Twitter is out of control, made possible through the government gift of Section 230!” he tweeted in the early hours of Friday. [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 is about liability for Internet companies]. On Thursday, Mr. Biden told supporters that he and Ms. Harris had attended a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis in America. He urged people to stay calm and said every ballot would be counted. “... It is the will of the voters, no one, not anything else, that chooses the President of the United States of America. So each ballot must be counted...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pennsylvania-lead-gets-biden-closer-to-victory/article33045349.ece

Dr. Isaac also released a book encapsulating the details of the project. The project will be spearheaded by the Kerala State Coastal Area Development Corporation (KSCADC). Conceived to also provide jobs to college dropouts and migrant workforce returning home due to COVID-19, the scheme envisages a rapid improvement in the standard of living of the fisher communities by encouraging entrepreneurship. ‘Parivarthanam’ will also guarantee a fixed price to fish-catchers as a fair compensation. The State-run KSCADC, the Union government’s Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) will monitor procurement and processing of fish besides ensuring its quality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parivarthanam-to-improve-lives-of-fishers/article33044966.ece

Constant friction with two nuclear armed neighbours with whom India had fought wars, “increasingly acting in collusion, poses an omnipresent danger of regional strategic instability with potential for escalation, threatening our national integrity and strategic cohesion”. On Pakistan, Gen. Rawat said the “unabated proxy war” unleashed by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir accompanied by a “vicious” anti-India rhetoric on social media and efforts to create social disharmony within India have taken Indo-Pak. relations to a new low. “The surgical strikes post Uri terror attack and the Balakot air strikes have delivered a strong message to Pakistan that it no longer enjoys the impunity of pushing terrorists across the Line of Control under the nuclear bogey,” he said. “The new Indian template has injected ambiguity and uncertainty in Pakistan, evident in its media reports, about Indian armed forces reaction, if Pakistan sponsored terrorists cross the threshold of tolerance,” he added. Addressing the webinar, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal R.K.S. Bhadauria said the IAF’s proactive actions and strong posture were “instrumental” in dissuading China from making any further attempts to alter the status quo in Ladakh. Asked about the stand-off at the weekly briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said both sides continue to maintain close communication at the military and diplomatic levels to achieve complete disengagement along the LAC. The two sides were guided by the leaders’ consensus to jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. “We will continue to maintain the dialogue with the Chinese side to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to the current situation along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-wont-accept-shifting-of-lac-says-cds/article33044677.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||SC relief for Arnab in breach of privilege case||The Supreme Court on Friday took suo motu cognisance and issued a contempt notice against the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretary for browbeating Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for approaching the court in connection with an alleged breach of privilege motion. The court ordered that Mr. Goswami will not be arrested in the privilege case. A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, asked the Secretary to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt for “threatening” Mr. Goswami with a “penalty” just because the journalist had approached the top court. In an October 13 letter, the Assembly official accused Mr. Goswami of “knowingly” breaching the confidentiality of the privilege proceedings by moving the top court without taking the permission of the Speaker. Mr. Goswami is accused of breach of privilege for using “sharp language” against the Maharashtra Chief Minister. “He [Goswami] is in jail... He is being threatened, questioned... Case after case after case is being filed against this man. At times, constitutional courts have to see the reality and not just the smokescreen... He has been warned... They have said he will spend Diwali in jail,” senior advocate Harish Salve, for Mr. Goswami, submitted. Referring to letter, the Chief Justice said the Secretary’s statements were a “serious interference in the administration of justice”. “How dare he [Secretary] do this? Who is this official? How can he threaten a person from coming to this court?” The Bench, in its order summoning the Assembly Secretary, said “the intention of the author of the letter seems to be to intimidate the petitioner [Goswami] because he had approached this court”. The court appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar as amicus curiae in the suo motu contempt proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-relief-for-arnab-in-breach-of-privilege-case/article33044678.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Finance panel warns of rising GST dues of States||The report will be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovid on Monday. The panel has also delivered on its more unusual terms of reference, including the question of creating a separate mechanism for funding defence and internal security proposed by the Centre, citing inadequate budgetary provisions for large capital outlays needed for complete defence preparedness. “The Commission has examined and responded to the Defence Ministry’s proposal to set up a non-lapsable fund for security-related expenditure, whether it should be funded by a cess or a surcharge, and supplemented by monetisation of surplus defence land, issue of tax-free defence bonds and disinvestment of defence public sector units,” said an official, pointing to the additional pressure on the Centre’s finances due to the fall in revenues and the flailing economy. Unless there is a sustained rise in GST collections over the next 20 months (till June 2022), the Commission has projected that the gap between the GST cess collections used to recompense States and their compensation dues could accumulate to a significant sum of “between Rs. 5 lakh crore to Rs. 7 lakh crore”, said the official privy to the Commission’s assessment of States’ fiscal positions. The resolution and the modalities adopted for the payment of GST compensation dues to States would significantly impact the fiscal consolidation roadmap for India’s general government debt, the official said. While the revenue shortfall for States is pegged at Rs. 3 lakh crore this year, GST cess collections are expected to be just Rs. 65,000 crore, on account of the sharp contraction in the economy that was already slowing down before the COVID-19 pandemic and was exacerbated by the lockdowns. The Centre has allowed States to borrow from the market to meet part of the shortfall, with the assurance that loans will be serviced and repaid from future GST cess collections. The Centre had promised compensation for revenue losses to States on account of giving up their indirect taxation powers and switching to the GST regime, for the first five years of the new tax regime launched in July 2017. A compensation cess was levied on so-called ‘sin’ and ‘demerit’ goods to finance this payout to States over the same period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finance-panel-warns-of-rising-gst-dues-of-states/article33044682.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||Cong. says Centre is betraying armed forces||The Congress on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of betraying the armed forces by trying to ‘steal’ their pension and accused it of ‘fake nationalism’. Party general secretary Randeep Surjewala said the Prime Minister should clarify the government’s proposal to lower the pension amount of those officers seeking premature retirement after serving 20 years. “We demand that Prime Minister Modi comes forward and clarifies his stand on the issue and takes back its anti-Army decision of October 29,” Mr. Surjewala said at a press conference. “An officer after 20 years of rigorous service, right now gets 50% of their last drawn salary as pension but the government’s new proposal is snatching away 50% of this. For example, if an officer gets Rs. 1 lakh as their last drawn salary. Presently, he will get Rs. 50,000 as pension but the BJP’s new proposal shall only give the officer Rs. 25,000,” the Congress general secretary claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-says-centre-is-betraying-armed-forces/article33044688.ece

A Division Bench will hear the Maharashtra government and complainant Adnya Naik on Saturday, the last working day before the court breaks for a 14-day Deepavali vacation. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Mr. Goswami, said the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Alibaug had important points about the illegality of the arrest. Mr. Goswami, he said, was merely involved in a commercial transaction with Anvay Naik, the suicide victim.

Assam claims people of Arunachal Pradesh have encroached upon 6,375 hectares of its forest land. “We were told by officials in Arunachal Pradesh that this was an old issue but they assured to look into the matter after we said it was our duty to point it out,” Assam’s Principal Chief Conservator of Forest A.M. Singh told journalists after top officials of the Forest Department of the two States met in Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar on Thursday to thrash out their border issues. The Assam team also raised the issue of about 20 wood-based industries and four coke factories set up in areas of Arunachal Pradesh adjoining reserve forests in Assam. While the allegedly unlicensed wood-based industries have been blamed for illegal logging along the inter-State border, the coke factories are allegedly being run by coal mined illegally from Tinkopani and Namsai reserve forests in Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-raises-border-issue-with-arunachal/article33044694.ece

07 November 2020||Chandigarh,||Haryana clears Bill on right to recall panchayat member||The Haryana Assembly on Friday passed a Bill which provides the right to recall members of Panchayati Raj institutions to those who elected them and gives women 50% reservation in these rural bodies. The Bill also proposed 8% reservation to the “more disadvantaged” among the Backward Classes. The Bill allows the recall of village sarpanches and members of the block-level panchayat samitis and district-level zila parishads if they fail to perform. Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala tabled the Haryana Panchayati Raj (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, in the House on the concluding day of the Vidhan Sabha session. With the enactment of the Bill, people in rural areas will get the right to remove a sarpanch or members of the two bodies even before their tenure is over. According to a statement of objectives, the amendment is aimed at increasing their accountability to the voters. Mr. Chautala said to recall a sarpanch and members of the two bodies, 50% members of a ward or gram sabha have to give in writing that they want to initiate proceedings. This will be followed by a secret ballot, in which their recall will require two-third members voting against them. The Bill is also aimed at enhancing participation of women in the three-tier panchayati raj system and allows 50% reservation to them in gram panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishads, according to the statement said. The Bill also allows reservation to the Backward Classes Category (A), the “more disadvantaged” among the group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryana-clears-bill-on-right-to-recall-panchayat-member/article33045497.ece
07 November 2020||Alappuzha,||Towards better menstrual health, cleaner environment||They were dumbfounded to see the sheer volume of menstrual waste of synthetic sanitary pads in canals in Muhamma grama panchayat during a cleanliness drive some time ago. On Friday, T.N Seema, vice chairperson, Haritha Keralam Mission, declared Muhamma the first synthetic pad-free panchayat in the State. The sleepy village on the banks of Vembanad Lake made this achievement by distributing pads made of clothes and menstrual cups and encouraging women to switch to reusable pads.  Awareness drive “Muhamma is the first in Kerala to achieve this feat and probably the first in India too. The women of Muhamma have switched to reusable pads as a result of series of interventions and awareness initiatives in the past one year. This is not a small achievement with regard to the environmental and health perspective,” says J. Jayalal, president, Muhamma grama panchayat. The story in between the cleanliness drive and becoming the synthetic sanitary pad-free village shows a collective effort to deal with a menacing problem and, above all, the willingness to change for the good. “It was not an issue of canal pollution alone. Sanitary napkins currently in use are made up of around 90% plastic and could take hundreds of years to degrade,” says an official. The first step to switch to reusable pads was taken in March 2019 with the support of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), a Bengaluru-based non-profit organisation. The Antrix Corporation, the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), financially supported the project through its CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/towards-better-menstrual-health-cleaner-environment/article33044964.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde issued notice on the appeal filed by the low-cost airline against the High Court order. “Issue notice returnable within four weeks. There shall be stay of operation of the impugned order until further orders,” the court order said. KAL and Mr. Maran had transferred their shareholding to Ajay Singh, who is currently the chairman and managing director of the airline, in December 2014.  Six-week deadline The six-week deadline for payment had expired on October 14. Mr. Maran and KAL had waited a week before moving the High Court again. On September 2, the High Court had, in an oral order, said that if the payment was not made in time, Mr. Maran and KAL were at liberty to revive their prayers “seeking directions to the joint debtors to maintain status quo with respect to their shareholding.” The case relates to the dispute arising out of non-issuance of warrants and preference shares in favour of Mr. Maran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-hc-order-in-spicejet-case/article33045407.ece

A three-judge Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar rejected the appeal filed by Sanchita Gupta against publisher Harper Collins. Gupta, represented by senior advocate Devdutt Kamat, contended that the book,Gunning for the Godman: The True Story Behind Asaram Bapu’s Conviction, contained defamatory and baseless material against her. She was the warden of the ashram. She said the book prejudices her appeal against her conviction as an “accomplice” of the godman in the ashram. Gupta said the Delhi High Court decision of September 22 to set aside a trial court’s ex-parte injunction on publication was based on “flimsy grounds.” But the top court disagreed with her and dismissed her petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-dismisses-plea-on-book-on-asaram/article33044708.ece

The department has decided to digitise births and deaths registered in different gram panchayats and upload them online so that they can be downloaded with a click of the mouse at any point of time. Instructions have accordingly been issued to district panchayat officers and mandal level officers to digitise the data at the gram panchayat level and upload the information on to the e-panchayat portal. “The exercise has been taken up as part of efforts to improve delivery of services to people. Officials have been asked to upload the information incorporated in the birth registers that are being maintained at the gram panchayat level since the formation of the State on June 2, 2014,” a senior official told The Hindu . Registration of births and deaths is being done under the Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969, and registration of this vital event, either birth or death, has to be done at the place of its occurrence. Power to local bodies Local bodies are authorised to issue birth or death certificates at their level and these certificates are presently being generated through Mee Seva centres. But the system by and large is confined to urban areas. The existing system is reportedly prompting manual interface at some point or the other in the issuance of certificates. “We want to avoid this and hence, the digitisation of records,” the official said. The department has set November 9 as the tentative deadline for uploading available information in the e-panchayat portal to ensure that work picks up pace. “Work will not progress with the desired speed unless a deadline is set for the officials,” another official connected with the process said. The cut-off date of June 2, 2014, could be extended further based on the functioning of the system and feedback from people. “Our aim is to ensure that residents of the State can obtain these certificates irrespective of the year of occurrence of the event. But this will take some more time to materialise,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pr-dept-to-digitise-birth-death-certificates/article33045544.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veggie prices remain high due to fewer arrivals||Some vegetables continue to remain expensive at the Koyambedu wholesale market owing to fewer arrivals. It may take a month for prices to stabilise, said wholesale traders. The price of 1 kg of onions climbed from Rs. 70 to Rs. 80 on Thursday. As Friday was a weekly holiday for the wholesale market, retail prices would be based on Thursday’s wholesale cost. Traders said the market received only half the normal daily load of 80 trucks. This led to onions selling for a higher price. “We also get 10 tonnes of Egyptian onions daily. It is sold for Rs. 50-Rs. 60 a kg. Onions from Iran have reached markets in other places like Tiruchi and Madurai. State government outlets selling onions for a subsidised rate has also helped keep the wholesale cost under control,” said P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Association. Small onions were sold for Rs. 110-Rs. 120 a kg due to fewer arrivals. Brinjals and potatoes were sold for a higher price at Rs. 60 a kg and Rs. 45 a kg respectively due to less supply and rainfall in other States. “We expect carrots and beetroots, now priced at Rs. 80 and Rs. 45 a kg respectively to cost less in 10 days as fresh supply may begin to arrive from Udhagamandalam,” he added. The price of some vegetables like tomato, radish, ladies finger and cucumber have dipped over the past few days. Once the semi-wholesalers and retailers reopen shops in Koyambedu market after Deepavali, the prices of vegetables may further stabilise, traders noted. Retail sales along roads Meanwhile, residents of Brindavan Nagar, Virugambakkam, complained of retail vendors selling produce along roads, causing inconvenience. Vehicles of vendors were parked on either side of roads such as Roja Street, Parijatham Street and Samanthi Street, which are linked to the arterial Kaliamman Koil Street in the locality, and trade is carried out from 11 p.m. to 9 a.m. daily. Residents noted that they were often unable to step out and reach the arterial road due to the sale, that often begins as early as 5 p.m. in the evenings. Small vendors also run temporary shops till the morning hours. J. Gopinath, president, Brindavan Nagar Residents’ Association, said the locality close to Koyambedu market had turned into a makeshift business area since the wholesale vegetable and fruits section reopened. Many residents and children are unable to go for morning and evening walks or use the neighbourhood parks as push carts occupy a lot of space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/veggie-prices-remain-high-due-to-fewer-arrivals/article33045436.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation to digitise records of 10,000 land parcels by Dec.||The Greater Chennai Corporation will complete work on digitisation, mapping and computerisation of 10,000 corporation land parcels by December. Civic officials have planned to conduct meetings with residents’ associations in all zones to identify OSR (open space reservation) land that had not been properly handed over to the Corporation. The records pertaining to layouts of residential areas in all 200 wards of the city are likely to be collected and matched with records of the Corporation to trace land records that had not been handed over to local authorities. Many promoters had not handed over OSR land to the local body, officials said. This was caused due to the delay in clearance by the Town Planning Committee a few years ago. The erstwhile local bodies had failed to hand over records pertaining to Corporation land to zones or the Land and Estates Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation after 2011, officials said. The merger of areas such as Velachery had led to the loss of many records, officials said. Many land records were yet to be traced in the newly added areas because of issues relating to handing over of records by the erstwhile local bodies before the merger. The Corporation had been developing parks in OSR land. The civic body had 774 parks, 283 schools, 140 primary health centres and over 3,000 office buildings in its lands. Burial grounds, community halls, Amma canteens and homeless shelters had been developed on such lands. Some land records had been damaged. Retrieving of information pertaining to lands remained a challenge in some areas, officials said. After computerisation of the records, residents in 200 wards will have access to the information. The information would be shared online to improve transparency. “We will identify most encroachments on Corporation land after the completion of the project,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-to-digitise-records-of-10000-land-parcels-by-dec/article33045438.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NGT levies fine on Kamarajar Port for damage to creek||The southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slapped a fine of Rs. 4 crore on Kamarajar Port Ltd., revising the earlier interim amount of Rs. 8.34 crore as environmental compensation for dumping dredged material, including many chemicals, into the Ennore creek. While revising the interim compensation on a review petition filed by KPL against the previously-imposed fine, the Bench relied on a report by a committee, and slammed the port for not removing dredged material from the sites falling under notified areas of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) in the creek. “From satellite images and analysis results it is observed that the dredged material dumped in the nine dumping sites falling under CRZ-notified area were not yet fully removed. The mangroves in the area may be lost due to dumping in the nine sites. Currently, the mangroves in the area are very thin. The port authority has not adopted any scientific methods to remediate the soil or to restore the soil / mangroves to regional conditions. Though efforts were made to remove the dump falling within the CRZ area, it is observed that it is not fully removed and dredged material is still lying in the CRZ area,” the bench noted in its order. A committee had found that the soil in the dredged material was highly contaminated with chemical elements and the dredged material dumping area was contaminated with high concentrations of magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, aluminium, chromium, lead, copper and zinc, up to a depth of 100 cm below the ground. Due to the dumping of such material, the mangroves may have been lost in that area, it had said. The Bench said satellite image verification showed that there existed large-scale mangroves, and due to dumping of the dredged materials since February 9, 2016, the mangroves have been lost. The Bench said that till September 11, 2017, the dredged material was not removed from the sites, and hence, the port cannot escape from the liability of payment of compensation at least till that date. The committee had taken the entire period from February 9, 2016 to November 30, 2019, a total of 1,391 days, as the period of violation, based on which the fine of Rs. 8.34 crore was earlier imposed. While KPL had disputed this in the review application, there was no dispute that there was violation from February 9, 2016 to September 11, 2017, a total of 581 days, based on which the interim compensation was decided at Rs. 4 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngt-levies-fine-on-kamarajar-port-for-damage-to-creek/article33045416.ece

07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Economic recovery not possible till restrictions go: Rangarajan||The economy cannot get back on track unless the lockdown is lifted and restrictions are removed, C. Rangarajan, former RBI Governor and former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, said. “It won’t be proper to expect a recovery in economic growth without lifting the restrictions. It can’t happen. Much of the recovery would depend on what view we are going to take about the lockdown,” he said during an interaction with Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (SICCI) president Ar. Rm. Arun as part of the industry body’s 360 initiative that involves monthly discussions with distinguished guests. Mr. Rangarajan pointed out that the government may be told to spend more and the banking system may be asked to provide more credit but this might not result in an increase in production until everybody is able to move, goods start moving and migrant labourers return from home States. The decision to completely lift restrictions would be difficult given the fears of a second wave of COVID-19, he said, citing the recent concerns expressed over the opening of schools and colleges. ‘Adequate measures’ Rather than imposing another lockdown, Mr. Rangarajan said the second wave could be tackled by taking other adequate measures. Higher growth rate can be the only answer to address socio-economic issues, he added. “Without a higher level of growth, it would be difficult to achieve the socio- economic goals of reducing poverty and inequality,” Mr. Rangarajan said. Apart from increasing healthcare spends and expenditure to take care of the vulnerable sections in society, the government should also increase capital expenditure that goes into infrastructure-building. This would lead to a pick up in economic activity, and create jobs. Mr. Rangarajan said there would be a slight pick up in economic growth in the second half of 2020-21 (September-March) but that would not be adequate to make good the loss suffered during the first half. ‘Tackle second wave’ Economic growth can get back to pre-pandemic levels by 2021-22, provided the second wave of COVID-19 is tackled, he added. Thereafter, Mr. Rangarajan said, economic growth would be stronger but a lot would depend on, among other factors, what action the government takes and whether private investments come in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/economic-recovery-not-possible-till-restrictions-go-rangarajan/article33044780.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Deepam festivities to be scaled down at Tiruvannamalai temple||The Arunachaleswarar temple at Tiruvannamalai is gearing up for a simple ‘Karthigai Deepam’ festival. This year, the ‘maha deepam’ falls on November 29. Around 15 lakh devotees turn up for the event. Another 5 lakh devotees turn up for the car festival. Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department said that since the government had permitted only 100 persons for religious functions in the latest set of guidelines, it was working towards a celebration that would be limited to the prakarams inside the temple. The processional idols of the deities would be taken on the temple car inside the temple and the number of persons allowed to witness the events would be limited. “After the lockdown restrictions were lifted, we have been getting around 5,000 devotees daily and we ensure that they do not sit or stand anywhere inside the temple.” “The sanctum sanctorum is not closed during the afternoon, which is how we are managing the crowds at present. A decision regarding allowing these numbers during the festival would be taken by the district administration,” an official said. The administration has banned the girivalam (circumambulation) due to COVID-19 restrictions. The temple has been showing its regular Pradhosham pujas live on YouTube, and similar arrangements are likely to be made for the ‘Karthigai Deepam’ festivities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deepam-festivities-to-be-scaled-down-at-tiruvannamalai-temple/article33044769.ece

07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC comes to the rescue of BSNL contract employees denied wages since 2019||The Madras High Court on Thursday paved the way for celebration of Deepavali by over 3,500 contract employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) by ordering immediate payment of Rs. 40,000 to each of them. Justice R. Suresh Kumar took serious note of the fact that the employees had not been paid salaries by the contractors since January 2019 and decided to make an interim arrangement so that they could at least celebrate Deepavali. The judge pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Telecom Contract Workers Union and Tamil Manila Tholaithodarpu Contract Labour Union had approached the court complaining about hundreds of contract employees not having been paid their salaries. Pursuant to that, the court directed the Regional Labour Commissioner (central) to conduct an inquiry. Accordingly, the Commissioner verified the pay details of 3,528 contract employees and submitted an interim report before the court. The report stated that the employees had been paid Rs. 23.29 crore and that gross wages to the tune of Rs. 24.6 crore was yet to be paid to them. Immediate disbursal Hence, the judge decided to make arrangements for immediate disbursal of some money during Deepavali. He directed the principal employer BSNL to deposit Rs. 60 crore, which had to be paid to the contractors, in a special account so that the money could be disbursed directly to the employees after due verification by the Labour Commissioner and the trade unions. Accordingly from the first instalment of Rs. 15 crore, out of the total amount of Rs. 60 crore, he ordered that Rs. 40,000 each should be disbursed to the 3,528 employees on or before November 9 and a compliance report should be filed in the court on November 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-comes-to-the-rescue-of-bsnl-contract-employees-denied-wages-since-2019/article33044772.ece

Vijayabaskar said on Friday. “We have successfully completed the first round of the Oxford University’s Covishield vaccine trial involving 75 volunteers. They have to receive two doses. We have completed the first dose, and will administer the second dose after a month. Following this, they will be under observation for six months,” he told mediapersons during the sidelines of inaugurating a gym for health department staff on the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) campus, Teynampet. Approval to take up the trial of another vaccine candidate, COVAXIN, along with Bharat Biotech, has been obtained and the trial would commence. “Though vaccine trials are under way, the vaccine that we have right now against COVID-19 is wearing masks. We should adhere to norms during the festive season,” he said. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan made a presentation on COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in Tamil Nadu during a session of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, he said. He spoke on “COVID-19 sitution analysis in the Indian State Tamil Nadu: learnings and the way forward” during a session on post-pandemic cooperation, making cities more sustainable, attractive, smart and safe as part of International Municipal BRICS Forum. Gym for staff After launching compulsory health screening for healthcare workers, the department has set up a gym for its staff on the DMS campus at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh. The Minister said they were already conducting a “Fit Health Worker” campaign as the frontline workers of the department were working round-the-clock with a lot of stress for the last six months. They were being screened for hypertension, diabetes, oral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. During COVID-19, it was important to stay healthy, treat co-morbidities and prevent NCDs (non-communicable diseases), he said. “This is a campaign against NCDs. All staffers are being registered and are being compulsorily screened. This will help in early detection and enable them to lead a healthy life,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/75-volunteers-received-first-dose-of-covishield-vaccine/article33044815.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AICTE clarifies on recruitment to interdisciplinary programmes||The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has issued a circular setting to rest concerns about recruitment of faculty to interdisciplinary programmes. AICTE Member Secretary Rajive Kumar, in the circular, said that deviation in nomenclature of qualifying degree in undergraduate and postgraduate level had led to institutions sending their grievances to the council. Although the AICTE had given flexibility to institutions in the matter of recruitment, it was coming across unnecessary litigation. Graduates rejected Giving an example, he said a candidate might have a B.E./B. Tech degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and M. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering but would not be considered for recruitment to teach Electronics and Communication Engineering or Instrumentation and Control Engineering despite possessing a Ph. D degree. The council said similar instances were noticed in many of the major disciplines in which there are relevant/ appropriate courses being offered, and graduates of these courses were being rejected by employers. Different cases “Since 2013, there have been a lot of difficulties for the interdisciplinary faculty members. For instance, faculty with B.E. (CSE) and M.E. (IT) are not able to work in any one of the base departments. Similarly is the case with B.E. (EEE) and M.E. (Electronics) and such. There are so many different cases like this,” said a faculty. The AICTE had announced in 2013 that qualified persons in the same discipline alone could work in the base department. In April 2017, the council came out with another notification regarding faculty recruited in the past, permitting them to continue in their position in the same institution. “The new announcement says that interdisciplinary faculty members recruited in the past are eligible for promotion and new recruitment also. However, during the recruitment process, it should be highlighted in the advertisement,” the faculty explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aicte-clarifies-on-recruitment-to-interdisciplinary-programmes/article33044831.ece

Murugan interspersed with those of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran has rankled the AIADMK. More of a promotional video of Mr. Murugan, the song, similar to one from an MGR movie, has multiple visuals of him tilling land, riding a tractor on farm land. When asked if the his party was trying to appropriate the late AIADMK leader, K.T. Raghavan, BJP State general secretary said MGR was known for his good governance as was K. Kamaraj. “MGR was a leader who had got a good name as Chief Minister for his governance. Our leaders quote Kamaraj as well. MGR was an icon in Tamil Nadu. So we are using the reference. There is nothing wrong with that,” he said. AIADMK deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy, however, strongly opposed the visuals of MGR. “Our Dravidian ideology and movement is different. Their [BJP’s] ideology is different. Using our leader’s visuals and images to get their party to grow is absolutely unacceptable and condemnable,” he said. According to him, the video only proved that the BJP had accepted that MGR was the undisputed leader in Tamil Nadu. “Our leader, Puratchi Thalaivar’s fame and legacy belongs only to the AIADMK and our cadres. Other parties do not have the moral right to lay claim to any of it,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Munusamy wondered if the BJP was so short of leaders, who had given good governance, that they had to use MGR and usurp his achievements for the growth of their party in Tamil Nadu. Referring to the visuals of Mr. Murugan interspersed with MGR’s, he said there was a limit to such comparisons. “MGR is a Bharat Ratna. People still look at him like God. Who are you comparing with whom? Aren’t you crossing a limit,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-fumes-as-bjp-uses-mgrs-visuals-in-vetrivel-yatra-video/article33045422.ece

Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Karti Chidambaram against the refusal of a special court to discharge them from prosecution launched by the Income Tax Department. Justice N. Sathish Kumar heard elaborate arguments advanced by senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing Mr. Chidambaram, and adjourned the matter to Tuesday for hearing senior counsel P.S. Raman on behalf of Ms. Chidambaram. Thereafter, Special Public Prosecutors N. Baskaran and M. Sheela would reply. The issue relates to prosecution launched against the couple in 2018 for having allegedly not disclosed their income in full during 2014-15. The charge against them was that they had sold an immovable property at Muttukadu near here, but suppressed a portion of the sale proceeds received in cash. Assessment valid Assailing the prosecution, Mr. Sibal contended that the Income Tax assessment order for the year 2014-15 was still valid and had not been set aside so far. Prosecution could not be launched without setting aside that order, he argued. Counsel also questioned the competence of the Deputy Director (Investigation) of the Income Tax Department to launch prosecution. Senior counsel said only the Assessment Officer would be competent to launch prosecution. He further stated that the electronic evidence produced by the prosecution before the special court for cases filed against legislators was not in conformity with the provisions of the Evidence Act of 1872.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-begins-hearing-in-karti-chidambaram-case/article33044775.ece

Three dog handlers from the Remount and Veterinary Corps of the Army, Meerut, visited Chennai and received the dogs from R. Aravindaraj, a Madurai-based Combai breeder. “I sold them two female puppies and a male puppy through a proper sale order from the Army. The arrangement was made by the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University,” said Mr. Aravindaraj, who had gifted three Combai puppies to the Central Reserve Police Force, Bengaluru. Combai are known for their ferociousness, fearlessness and loyalty to owners. These muscular and powerful dogs with reddish brown coats were used for boar hunting in many parts of Tamil Nadu. “We have already purchased three Chippiparai and three Rajapalayam puppies,” said Mr. Prabakaran, one of the handlers who came to Chennai with havildar Jagbirsingh and another handler Rajkumar to collect the puppies.

Such abnormal charges would affect the industry that had been worst hit during the pandemic. Association president M. Ravi said digital meters were installed during March. Many hotels and restaurants in the city received notices to pay bills that were a minimum four times higher than the usual water charges. Bills were raised even for the months when hotels were shut during the lockdown. “Many of us are able to do 30%-35% of sales only even after relaxations to operate provided by the government. Such additional charges would add burden to the hoteliers,” he said. The association has represented to Minister for Municipal Administration S.P. Velumani to waive off water charges. The water board had started installing digital water meters with automated readings in commercial buildings under the Smart City Mission. It had identified 12,708 properties were to be installed. According to the water board, those who use nearly 5,000 kilolitres of water every month were in the category of water-intensive consumers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hotels-seek-relief-from-high-water-charges/article33045432.ece

However, the four care goals — glycaemic control (HbA1c), blood pressure, cholesterol and cessation of smoking — need improvement. Diabetologists refer to the four care goals as ABCD — HbA1c below 7%; BP (below 140/90 mmHg); cholesterol (below 100mg/dl); and D (diet, in this case they looked at prevalence of smoking). The authors found that HbA1c control had risen from 25% during 2010-11 to 30% during 2015-16. The percentage of those who controlled their cholesterol rose from 34% to 45% but there was no significant improvement in blood pressure control. Also, the smokers in the studied population had not given up their habit. The analysis, titled T emporal changes in diabetes prevalence and achievement of care goals in urban South Asia from 2010 to 2016-The Center for Cardio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Study , was published in the peer reviewed British journal Diabetic Medicine . The project was coordinated by CoE-CARRS (Center of Excellence–Center for cArdio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia) based at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), New Delhi, in collaboration with the Centre for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC), New Delhi; the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi; Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), Chennai; Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan; and Emory University, Atlanta, U.S. Anjana Mohan, first author and managing director of Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, said, “Definitely, South Asia is making progress in terms of its ability to deliver health care and there are marked improvements in the past few years. There are many aspects that we need to achieve. We had two different cohorts in two different time points. We started in the base line and followed the same individual for a specified time.” The Centre’s chairman and one of the authors, V. Mohan, said only 7% of those studied had all the four parameters under control. The other two authors of the study were Mohammed K. Ali and K.M. Venkat Narayan, faculty of Global Health and Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University.

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan said the government was racing against time as it intended to complete the construction of the hospital as early as possible to cater to the needs of the local population. He said the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests had granted permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 for felling eucalyptus trees. The Forest department had conducted an enumeration exercise to identify trees that had to be felled. Mr. Narayan said the courts had been consistently impressing upon the need to promote shola forests in hill stations, such as Udhagamandalam and Kodaikanal, and discouraging the growth of exotic species, such as eucalyptus. It was all the more reason to permit the felling of eucalyptus trees, he said. The judges agreed to pass orders on his request on Tuesday. The court also asked about the government’s plan to introduce an air ambulance in Udhagamandalam, so that patients in the hill station could be shifted quickly to private hospitals. Advocate Chevanan Mohan told the court that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was to inaugurate the air ambulance early this year but it got delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/permit-felling-of-eucalyptus-trees-for-hospital-hc-told/article33045423.ece

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan said the government was racing against time as it intended to complete the construction of the hospital as early as possible to cater to the needs of the local population. He said the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests had granted permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 for felling eucalyptus trees. Mr. Narayan said the courts had been consistently impressing upon the need to promote shola forests in hill stations, such as Udhagamandalam and Kodaikanal, and discouraging the growth of exotic species, such as eucalyptus. It was all the more reason to permit the felling of eucalyptus trees, he said. The judges agreed to pass orders on his request on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/permit-felling-of-eucalyptus-trees-for-hospital-govt-urges-hc/article33044867.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP leaders detained for ‘Vetrivel Yatra’||BJP leaders and workers, led by party Tamil Nadu president L. Murugan, were detained at Tiruttani in Tiruvallur district on Friday when they attempted to take out a ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ despite denial of police permission due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of them were released in the evening. The party had announced the month-long religious roadshow covering the six abodes of Lord Murugan and planned to end it at Tiruchendur in Thoothukudi district on December 6. It was also intended as a platform to strengthen the BJP ahead of the 2021 Assembly election and to politically attack the DMK, dubbing it “anti-Hindu”. Shortly before he was taken into preventive custody, Mr. Murugan, who offered prayers at the Subramanya Swami Temple, said the yatra would tear apart the DMK’s mask. “The DMK and its allies, from the start, have always spoken against Hindus, Hindu Gods and Tamil Gods. That is their only job — to mock the Hindus, our religious beliefs,” he said. “They claim there is no God. Who are they to say which Gods we should pray to?” He said it was the DMK’s agenda to spark violence during the yatra.       The BJP leader also referred to a YouTube channel ‘Karuppar Kootam’ denigrating the Kanda Sashti Kavasam , a hymn in praise of Lord Murugan. “Mr. Stalin [DMK president], your chief ministerial dreams will be buried during this yatra,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Murugan said in Chennai, “The Constitution of India guarantees that every person can worship his own [God]. It is our fundamental right. That is why I am proceeding towards Tiruttani.” Standing in a specially designed sun-roofed vehicle holding a ‘Vel’ aloft, he and BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi then headed to Tiruttani, followed by party functionaries and workers in cars and two-wheelers. This led to traffic jams in and around Koyambedu and along the route, inconveniencing commuters. When the convoy reached Nazarathpet, the police stopped it. After heated arguments, the police allowed five vehicles to proceed to Tiruttani. On reaching the temple town, Mr. Murugan met Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kishan Reddy who had arrived there. Later when Mr. Murugan proceeded with the yatra after addressing the workers, the police stepped in and took him and others into custody and accommodated them in nearby halls. Among those detained were former Union Ministers Pon. Radhakrishnan and C.P. Radhakrishnan, senior leader H. Raja and State vice-president Annamalai. BJP State general secretary K.T. Raghavan told The Hindu that the party would again try to take out the yatra on November 8 and Mr. Murugan would take part at a rally in north Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-leaders-detained-for-vetrivel-yatra/article33044820.ece

Alagiri said. Mr. Alagiri on Thursday contended that the Congress had not even once interfered in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case nor sought any specific punishment for the accused as the party had faith in the justice system and the belief that the courts and law would do its duty. “As far as the Congress is concerned, in the matter of seven convicts, it is for the courts to decide. Political parties’ interference or political decisions will lead to injustice and give rise to a different mentality to the people,” he told The Hindu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/courts-should-decide-on-rajiv-case-convicts/article33044770.ece
07 November 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Provide 80% reservation for local residents in pvt. sector’||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday reiterated the party’s demand for 80% reservation for local residents in private sector jobs and urged the State government to promulgate an ordinance in this regard. In a statement, he pointed out that the Haryana Assembly has passed a bill to reserve 75% of private sector jobs for local residents. Dr. Ramadoss welcomed the move by Haryana to protect jobs for local residents and noted that Andhra Pradesh has already implemented such a policy, which he said was the need of the hour. He wondered when Tamil Nadu would bring in such a policy. “There might be concerns, if such a policy is introduced, whether companies will get skilled workforce and whether investments will flow into the States. Tamil Nadu has the best workforce, when compared to other states. Andhra Pradesh has not seen a drop in investments after implementing the policy. So the concerns are unwarranted,” Dr. Ramadoss contended. He also said the intention should be to train youth from the State and hire them, instead of hiring candidates from other States citing a lack of skill availability as a reason.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-80-reservation-for-locals-in-private-sector-jobs-urges-pmk/article33044824.ece
07 November 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Deepavali: traders expect near-normal sales||For the retail businesses here, be it jewellery or textiles, this festival season seems to bring near-normal sales despite the challenges of COVID-19 spread. The commercial hubs including Gandhipuram and Oppanakara Street are seeing public thronging the shops. There are queues in front of some of the major outlets. “The major retailers are trying their best to regulate the shoppers. But, awareness should improve among the public,” says one of the traders. Some textile showrooms are not permitting customers to try out the clothes as a precaution against disease spread. According to C. Balasubramanian, vice-president of Federation of Trade Associations of Coimbatore, though some sectors are not having the expected sales, the crowd on the roads is high in all the commercial areas. And almost every one is wearing masks. The small traders are unable to ensure all the precautionary measures. But, the large scale ones are doing their best to regulate the shoppers. The crowd was high during weekdays too as the schools were having only online classes. In general, the trade expected sales to be almost like last year, he said. Jewellery outlets usually see better sales after Deepavali. This year too, the crowd is similar to last year. The outlets have switched off ACs and provide sanitisers. They check the temperature of customers. However, it is difficult to ensure physical distancing. The footfalls are also not steady and vary every day, say jewellers here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deepavali-traders-expect-near-normal-sales/article33045449.ece

It was now using them exclusively to fight dengue spread, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said here on Friday. After the arrival of North East Monsoon in the city, the civic body was also focussed on controlling the spread of infection from mosquito bites, particularly dengue, by asking the checkers to their original task. They would now spray larvicide wherever there was water stagnation – be it roads or other public places and also within houses and commercial establishments if they found larvae. Meanwhile, the 2,200-odd workers whom the Corporation had engaged to fight the COVID-19 spread would go around spraying disinfectants and conducting door-to-door survey to identify people with fever or COVID-19 symptoms. Mr. Pandian said the Corporation had asked its sanitary inspectors and field engineers to ensure that storm water drain was free of waste and silt. It had also asked them to ensure that they cleared from roads the silt within a day of removing it from drain. Further, the civic body had asked engineers to clean drain, channels and the sanitary inspectors to remove waste off the roads, keep ready the motors used to pump out water from railway underpasses to ensure that the civic body removed stagnant water at the earliest. Even as it focussed on dengue, the Corporation had stepped up vigil in areas where people went for Deepavali shopping. In particular, it was focussing on Central Zone. The Central Zone assistant commissioner had formed teams to ensure that people wore mask and shopkeepers ensured maintenance of physical distance among customers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-focus-on-dengue-control-while-fighting-covid-19-spread/article33045447.ece

The city witnessed rainfall till around 11 a.m. Water-logging was witnessed in low-lying areas, including Simmakkal, Kalavasal, Vilakkuthoon, Kamarajar Salai and Periyar Bus stand. An official from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation said that water stagnation and slushy roads near Periyar Bus stand posed a severe hardship to road users. “An elderly couple were struggling to wade through the puddles of stagnant rainwater near the Periyar bus stand on Friday morning,” said the official. Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services personnel removed a tree that was uprooted on Alagarkoil Road because of the rains. Several stretches that were riddled with potholes and craters were filled with rainwater, making it difficult for motorists to identify danger spots, said L. Selvam, an autorickshaw driver. Collector T. Anbalagan said that there was no major water stagnation in the district on Friday. Separate teams have been formed to monitor and take necessary steps in the event of flooding at the 27 vulnerable spots identified in the district, he added. Farmers, especially those who grow paddy, were a happy lot as rains gave them the hope of assured irrigation. G. Murugan, a farmer from Vadipatti block, said that the current storage in the Vaigai dam would not be sufficient to supply water for irrigation till the harvest season. "With the commencement of the northeast monsoon, we are hopeful that the storage in the dam rises," he added. However, the prices of flowers reduced due to the rains, said S. Ramachandran, President of a flower vendors association at the flower market in Mattuthavani. “The jasmine, which was sold at around Rs. 250 per kg in the morning, came down to Rs. 100 by evening,” he said. The customer footfall at Vilakkuthoon and nearby areas was lower on Friday morning because of the rainfall, said Ashraf Tayub, Secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association. “But, more people started visiting by afternoon. However, the sales has been lower this Deepavali season mainly owing to the financial distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intermittent-rain-in-madurai-dt/article33045601.ece

Pugalendhi observed that during the time of the kings the land was full of waterbodies. The waterbodies were protected and safeguarded as they were the source for drinking water and agriculture. But now, the waterbodies were shrinking due to encroachments with buildings mushrooming everywhere. The Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act, 2007 has classified the waterbodies and a survey should be conducted periodically as per the Act. Unless the waterbodies are protected and safeguarded from encroachments, there will be no water left for the future generation, the court observed. The court put forth a series of queries for the State to respond to. The court asked the State to submit reports on the number and status of waterbodies in the 1980s compared to the present day. Whether surveys had been conducted and boundaries fixed in accordance with law and reports submitted in this regard. The court also sought report on the number of cases pending and action taken with regard to the encroachments, the process of geo-tagging the waterbodies, establishing a separate wing to remove encroachments and protecting them. The court appointed advocate T. Arul as the amicus curiae in the case to assist the court. The court directed Additional Advocate General M. Sricharan Rangarajan to file a report in this regard. Burdened with cases of encroachments pending since 2012, the court has separated the petitions into three batches: encroachment of waterbodies, public land and temple lands. The batch of cases were adjourned for hearing to November 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-states-response-on-setting-up-special-wing-to-tackle-encroachments/article33045603.ece

07 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Around 79% of assessed buildings have RWH structure’||Around 79% of the 3,19,761 buildings assessed by Madurai Corporation till October, have functional rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures, reveals data obtained from the civic body. The RWH structures present in the buildings were evaluated by the Corporation for a baseline survey undertaken as part of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a central government scheme on water conservation. According to the data, nearly 4% of the total evaluated buildings did not have any RWH structures. The remaining buildings had RWH structures, but they were not functional. The buildings that were examined include government buildings, commercial establishments, educational institutions, hospitals, industrial buildings and other residential buildings. Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said that the assessment of additional buildings was hindered during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. "The civic body gives high importance to harvest rainwater and several steps are taken to rejuvenate natural water sources within the city. By doing so, the groundwater level will also increase," he said. A Corporation engineer said that notices were issued for buildings that did not have functional RWH structures. "Currently, all existing RWH structures present in Corporation buildings are being desilted to ensure maximum harvesting of rainwater during the monsoon," added the official. The civic body has built RWH structures at 280 spots in the city which are prone to waterlogging, said the Commissioner. "There was no water stagnation for prolonged hours in most parts of the city, following the rains on Friday. The Corporation officials immediately attended to complaints raised by the residents regarding water stagnation," he added. In recent years, there has not been a dramatic change in the rainfall yield, but a fall in the number of rainy days. Hence, it is important to ensure that the rainwater is properly stored to answer the water shortage crisis in the city, said Lokesh Sinram, Environmental Engineer at the Centre for Urban Water Resources of DHAN Foundation. The Commissioner said that the civic body was also rejuvenating the 33 ooranis (ponds) located within the city. S. Suthanthira Amalraj, former Executive Engineer of the Public Works Department, said that the focus must be on restoration of the tanks by increasing their water storage capacity. He also suggested that large-sized RWH structures must be present in the new Periyar bus stand that is currently under construction. "Similarly, RWH structure has to be present in the multi-level car parking facility that is being constructed near Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple," he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/around-79-of-assessed-buildings-have-rwh-structure/article33045599.ece

The court was informed that as per an order passed by the Ministry of Defence, reservation for wards of armed forces personnel for admission is prioritised under nine categories. This includes widows/wards of defence personnel killed in action, disabled in action, died while in service, disability attributable to military service, receipt of gallantry awards, wards of ex-servicemen, wives of disabled defence personnel or ex-servicemen, wards of serving personnel and wives of serving personnel. Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian submitted that a total of 10 seats for MBBS and one seat for BDS were reserved for the children of ex-servicemen for the present academic year. The number of seats was increased from six to 11 and there was no provision to include the children of serving defence personnel. Taking cognisance of the submission, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the benefit had to be extended to the children of serving defence personnel as well and they cannot be excluded. The court asked the Centre and the State to respond to a series of queries that included the number of seats made available for the children of ex-servicemen in the past five years and the category wise break-up of seat allotment. When the number of medical seats and the number of medical colleges in the State had increased, why not include more seats for the children of ex-servicemen and extend the benefit to the children of serving defence personnel, the court asked. The court sought clarity on the priority categories. The hearing was adjourned to November 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/response-sought-on-inclusion-of-children-of-serving-defence-personnel-under-reservation/article33044833.ece

07 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC summons temple official||Taken aback by mismanagement of a temple in Tirunelveli district, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday summoned the Commissioner of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to ascertain the allegations made out in the case. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi took a serious note of the fact that idols were stolen from the temple, its lands were being used for mining blue metal rock without permission and the person at the helm of the affairs was actually removed in 2015. In a status report, the Joint Commissioner of the HR and CE Department, Tirunelveli submitted that one Nainar Naikar continued to discharge his duties at the temple in Radhapuram and had refused to hand over the charges of the temple. Following serious allegations from the public that Nainar Naikar was not performing his duties, he was removed in 2015 itself. Taking note of the allegations levelled against Nainar Naikar, it wondered how he was still continuing to discharge his duties in the said capacity despite the fact he was removed. The court termed it a deliberate failure on the part of the authorities concerned. Considering the fact that the temple lands were being exploited and an idol theft had taken place, the court sought to know the total loss incurred as a result of the mismanagement.

It is said that a resident of Kerala was involved in the illegal extraction and transportation of sand. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B.

Governor Kiran Bedi’s “interference in blocking schemes was leading to law and order issues”. In an online press conference, the Chief Minister said the Lt. Governor continued to interfere in the government’s efforts to solve people’s issues. “Her actions are causing discontent and frustration among the people, resulting in law and order issues. The Lt. Governor should understand that the views of people are against her. I think officials surrounding the Lt. Governor are misguiding her,” the Chief Minister said. The government had decided to provide tax concessions to cab/omni van operators for six months to compensate the loss they incurred during the lockdown. When the file was forwarded to Raj Nivas, the Lt. Governor returned it, raising several queries. Several States have given tax concessions to cab operators till December, he said. “Her decision led to cab operators and drivers hitting the streets on Thursday,” he said. The government, again, forwarded the file to the Lt. Governor, seeking financial sanction for providing at least six months of pending salaries, out of 11 months, to government-aided schoolteachers. “I hope the Lt. Governor will clear the proposal at least this time. The teachers have done no wrong, and if some schools have erred, I am ready to change the rules. The teachers are in penury as they have not received salary for 11 months and now, Deepavali too is coming,” the Chief Minister said. Nobody should take steps to “cheat” government employees. Salaries have already been budgeted for government servants, and it is the responsibility of the administration to disburse it, said Mr. Narayanasamy. Earlier in the day, after flagging off a dengue awareness rally, the Chief Minister said the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ by the BJP in Tamil Nadu was aimed at creating communal discord. The government would not allow anyone to whip up communal passions in the Union Territory. He said the government was taking every step to prevent the outbreak of dengue during the northeast monsoon.  The Lt. Governor should understand that the views of people are against her.

The renovation work, which started in January, was suspended owing to COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown and resumed following relaxations announced by the State government. With funds sanctioned by the Centre and the State government, the renovation works were proceeding in full swing in the exterior and interior portions of the over 350-year-old Rani Mangammal Kolu Mandapam which was constructed during the Nayak period. “While the renovation of the heritage building housing the museum has been taken up in phase-I, the phase-II works entails installing showcases and other electrical works,” said C. Sivakumar, Curator (in charge), Government Museum, Tiruchi.

The BJP state leadership had planned to take out a yatra from Tiruttani to Tiruchendur. The month-long yatra was intended to create an " awakening" among the Hindus and the people of Tamil Nadu, the BJP had said. However, apprehending trouble, a writ was filed in the High Court Chennai. As the state government informed that they have no intention to accord permission, the police arrested the BJP leaders when they arrived at Tiruttani. Condemning the arrest, the BJP said that they would not be cowed down by such threats. When the AIADMK, which is ruling the State, conducts functions, the police remain silent spectators, they charged and urged the police to be independent and impartial in their actions.   Dindigul In Dindigul district, the BJP functionaries led by its president Pandian, staged a demonstration in front of the Head Post Office. Across the district, including at Palani, Kodaikanal, Oddanchatram and others, close to 1000 people were arrested.

The issue was that the maternity ward in the GH was reportedly without power supply since morning. As there was no response from the staff and duty doctors regarding resumption of power supply, angered family members came to the road. They pointed out that many patients who were sick, required fans in the maternity ward. The police, who were on the GH campus, persuaded the agitators and told them that action would be taken. After the GH authorities were informed, the Tangedco restored the connection, a police officer said. CITU district secretary Sivaji demanded the State government to intervene and ensure better administration.

07 November 2020||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Cracker ban leaves fireworks units helpless||The ban being imposed on fireworks by one State after another amid the COVID-19 pandemic has come as a rude shock to the industry, which has been focusing on exports. Several States have taken the lead from Rajasthan and imposed a ban on the sale and bursting of crackers during Deepavali. “It looks like all our hard work for a whole year is being rendered waste by the ban. We are helpless,” said Ganesan Panjurajan, president of the Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers’ Association. The industry hopes the Centre will help it to survive. “We have sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who can ask the States to allow bursting of crackers during Deepavali,” Mr. Ganesan said. Based on the industry’s request, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has written to a few States urging that they reconsider their decision. However, more States are planning to ban crackers, fearing the emissions may further harm those affected by COVID-19. Credit to dealers The industry starts production based on advances given by dealers nationwide. Many units also take bank loans. “However, almost every company has to give credit to the dealers to distribute fireworks in far-off regions. The money is collected after Deepavali,” said N. Elangovan, general secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Fireworks Traders’ Association. The industry that usually makes a turnover of Rs. 2,000 crore during Deepavali suffered a 30% production loss when the units were shut for 43 days owing to the lockdown. “Out of the current turnover of Rs. 1,400 crore, almost 90% of the market is in the north Indian States. With bigger States banning crackers at the last minute, more than 50% of the goods are getting piled up,” Mr. Ganesan said. All these States had allowed the traders to get licences to open shops only a few weeks ago, Mr. Ganesan said, wondering what happened in the intervening period. Even the U.S. and Japan had encouraged fireworks display in July amid the pandemic. “Would not these developed countries have taken into account any adverse impact of emission amid the pandemic?” he asked. The traders, too, have made huge investments. “This ban will devastate the traders who have taken huge loans,” said Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore. Industry representatives said they have turned to making green-crackers based on the CSIR-NEERI recommendations, making huge changes to their processes. “When the Centre itself accepts that green-crackers have lower emissions, what else can the industry do?” he asked. Mr. Ganesan said the ban would affect the industry’s plan for exports. “If India itself does not use our goods, will not other countries have fear in buying our goods?” Over 1,000 units in Sivakasi usually resume work after 15 days of holiday following Deepavali. “If more than 50% stocks are not used this year, we may not need to resume operations next year,” he said. This would affect allied industries such as printing, packing and transport, besides around 8 lakh employees. Even the banks that had lent huge sums to the industry would suffer, he said.

07 November 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Senior citizen undergoes coronary IVL treatment||A 61-year-old patient, Aandappan, has successfully undergone coronary intravascular lithotripsy (CIVL) treatment at a private hospital here recently to get the blocks in the coronary blood vessels cleared. The CIVL treatment for clearing the blocks in coronary blood vessels has recently emerged as an alternative way to disrupt calcified lesions on the coronary blood vessels and is based on the lithotripsy concept used to treat kidney and ureteral stones. The IVL (Shockwave Medical) transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy during low-pressure balloon inflation and it does not rely on direct vascular tissue injury for plaque modification but on sonic waves, which travel from the balloon-based catheter to the surrounding tissue with the intention of safely and selectively breaking both superficial and deep calcium deposits with minimal soft tissue impairment, while improving vessel compliance. In contrast to debulking techniques, the calcium fragments resulting from the IVL therapy remain in situ, reducing the likelihood of distal embolisation. This innovative technology meant for removing calcified plaque clogging coronary arteries was successfully performed on Aandappan at the Thanjai Meenakshi Hospital here recently. Commenting about the procedure, cardiologists B. Kesavamoorthy, A. Srinivasan, and P. Sabari Krishnan, said that coronary artery calcification is the condition of calcium build-up within the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. It increases with age. Calcification is associated with a higher risk for stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events, they added. The conventional method to remove calcium deposits is known as rotational atherectomy where a revolving instrument is used to break up calcified plaque in arteries and restore blood flow to the heart. While excessive heat is produced during the procedure, the IVL ensures a minimally invasive procedure and no excessive generation of heat. For patients who require coronary revascularisation, IVL can be performed with high procedural success and minimal complications, they claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/senior-citizen-undergoes-coronary-ivl-treatment/article33044822.ece

07 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi’s traditional lamp-makers face uncertain future in the wake of pandemic||Artisans who make traditional earthen lamps ( akal vilaku ) at Mela Kondayampettai near Thiruvanaikovil here have resumed their trade after a long break due to COVID-19. While the lockdown ruined their business, the monsoon season could wreak havoc too, the potters fear. They have just started making the lamps for the Deepavali and Karthigai festivals. “It is sad that a profession so widely praised by our forefathers does not help me get one square meal a day,” said M. Inbarasu, a potter living at Thiruvanaikoil, where once at least 100 potters lived and made clay vessels, pots and earthen lamps all through the year. Now there are barely 30 families of potters. “There are only three or four of us who make them the traditional way. While some have moved to making pots and pans, most others have shifted to construction work,” he said. The remaining potters have begun purchasing clay to make the traditional vilaku . “One load of clay, enough to fill a mini-truck, costs Rs. 3,000. Nearly 10,000 lamps can be made from it,” said L. Ganesan, another potter. The makers sell 1,000 lamps for Rs. 600. The lockdown dealt a blow to the lamp-makers. “Many of us had to struggle to find work and took up construction and other odd jobs to get by. Construction work too was difficult to get,” Mr. Ganesan said. The women of these families, who had never gone to work before, were also forced to seek jobs. Wholesalers who purchase lamps from the makers and sell them at the market are apprehensive. “Many wholesalers have informed us that they will not be buying from us this year. We hope to make some direct sales but are not so hopeful,” Mr. Ganesan said. The monsoon season would also prove to be a problem as the lamps will not dry well. While many potters across the State have received mechanised wheels, the few potters at Thiruvanaikoil are yet to get them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchis-traditional-lamp-makers-face-uncertain-future-in-the-wake-of-pandemic/article33044803.ece

07 November 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Constable nabbed for burglaries||A police special team has arrested a police constable from neighbouring Thoothukudi district for allegedly involved in a series of burglaries in the city. After sudden spurt in burglary in the twin towns of Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai, in which over Rs. 50 lakh-worth gold ornaments were stolen, Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, Deepak M. Damor formed a special team to investigate the burglaries. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) M. Magesh was coordinating the investigations. When the special team lifted five fingerprints from the house in Perumalpuram that was burgled by unidentified culprits in October, the fingerprint experts found that one of the fingerprints resembled the fingerprint of police constable M. Karkkuvel, 28, from Tiruchendur in Thoothukudi district. Since he was found to be working in the Arumuganeri police station, Mr. Deepak alerted S. Jayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi, to closely monitor him. The SP transferred him to the Armed Reserve Police two weeks ago. Even as the special team brought Karkkuvel under its surveillance and recorded his telephone calls, he was transferred to Tenkasi district. However, Karkkuvel did not report for duty in Tenkasi but remained in Thoothukudi. Against this backdrop, the special team detained Karkkuvel on Thursday around 3 a.m. and brought him to Tirunelveli for inquiry. The investigators, during the questioning found that Karkkuvel, who joined the Tamil Nadu Police in 2017, had worked in Armed Reserve Police before joining duty in Tiruchendur and Arumuganeri police stations. As he had lost several lakhs of rupees in online gambling and had landed in a debt trap, Karkkuvel, along with his friends, had indulged in burglaries. The investigators recovered 12 sovereigns of gold ornaments, a car and a bike from him. A hunt is on to nab four of his associates. Karkkuvel was remanded in judicial custody on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/constable-nabbed-for-burglaries/article33044825.ece

Murugan in Tiruvallur, the party cadre led by State treasurer S.R. Seghar staged a protest at Gandhipuram in the city. Mr. Seghar charged the State Government with cowing down to the pressure from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and other opposition parties in denying permission for the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’.  The AIADMK government had denied permission for the Yatra also because it wanted to match the DMK in appeasing minority and was keen to show its secular credentials, he said. Besides, COVID-19 safety guideline was violated in several political meetings where State ministers had participated. Even during Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s visit to Coimbatore on Thursday, the AIADMK had violated the guideline by allowing several people to gather to greet him, he said. The Government should have acted only if the BJP had taken out the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ without following the guideline, he said. After the party workers marched towards the Gandhipuram Bus Stand, the Coimbatore City Police prevented them from proceeding further. After a while, the cadre dispersed from the place, Mr. Seghar added. Party workers detained Around 350 BJP workers were detained by the Coimbatore rural police after they attempted to lay siege to Sub-Collector’s office at Pollachi to condemn Tamil Nadu Government’s stand against the party’s ‘Vetrivel Yatra’. The protesters were then shifted to a private auditorium. According to police, the party workers were detained as they assembled at the Sub-Collector’s office in violation of safety guidelines that are in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Tiruppur city police, on Friday, removed over 200 people who participated in a protest staged by the BJP demanding permission for the ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ near the New Bus terminus here. During the course of the protest, a man holding the BJP flag climbed up a mobile phone tower in the vicinity. The Tiruppur North police said that they held talks with the man and made him climb down from the tower. Following this, the Tiruppur North police removed all the protesters. The protest took place prior to the visit of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to Tiruppur for a review meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-protests-against-murugans-arrest/article33045457.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||BJP leaders detained for ‘Vetrivel Yatra’||It was also intended as a platform to strengthen the BJP ahead of the 2021 Assembly election and to politically attack the DMK, dubbing it “anti-Hindu”. Shortly before he was taken into preventive custody, Mr. Murugan, who offered prayers at the Subramanya Swami Temple, said the yatra would tear apart the DMK’s mask. “The DMK and its allies, from the start, have always spoken against Hindus, Hindu Gods and Tamil Gods. That is their only job — to mock the Hindus, our religious beliefs,” he said. “They claim there is no God. Who are they to say which Gods we should pray to?” He said it was the DMK’s agenda to spark violence during the yatra. The BJP leader also referred to a YouTube channel ‘Karuppar Kootam’ denigrating the Kanda Sashti Kavasam , a hymn in praise of Lord Murugan. “Mr. Stalin [DMK president], your chief ministerial dreams will be buried during this yatra,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Murugan said in Chennai, “The Constitution of India guarantees that every person can worship his own [God]. It is our fundamental right. That is why I am proceeding towards Tiruttani.” Traffic dirupted Standing in a specially designed sun-roofed vehicle holding a ‘Vel’ aloft, he and BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi then headed to Tiruttani, followed by party functionaries and workers in cars and two-wheelers. This led to traffic jams in and around Koyambedu and along the route, inconveniencing commuters. When the convoy reached Nazarathpet, the police stopped it. After heated arguments, the police allowed five vehicles to proceed to Tiruttani. On reaching the temple town, Mr. Murugan met Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kishan Reddy who had arrived there. Later when Mr. Murugan proceeded with the yatra after addressing the workers, the police stepped in and took him and others into custody and accommodated them in nearby halls. Among those detained were former Union Ministers Pon. Radhakrishnan and C.P. Radhakrishnan, senior leader H. Raja and State vice-president Annamalai. BJP State general secretary K.T. Raghavan told The Hindu that the party would again try to take out the yatra on November 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-leaders-detained-for-vetrivel-yatra/article33044805.ece

While the cases dropped from 2,841 on October 3 to 1,608 on October 31 in Tumakuru, the number dropped from 930 to 527 in Vijayapura. In Bengaluru Urban, active cases dropped from 53,292 on October 3 to 34,459 on October 31, which is a decline by 35%. Haveri, Chickballapura, Bagalkot, Koppal and Chamarajanagar have seen a decline by above 80% during this period.  Aggressive testing Attributing the increase in Bengaluru Rural’s active cases to aggressive testing in the district, Bengaluru Rural Deputy Commissioner P.N. Ravindra said the number of new cases detected were high since the first week of October due to higher testing. “As it takes at least 14 days for a patient to recover, the active cases number will be high for another one week. The number of new cases are dropping now and we hope things will stabilise soon,” he said. V Ravi, senior professor and head of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said Bengaluru Rural had a low overall prevalence of 28.7% till mid-September. “While infections in the core city (Bengaluru Urban and BBMP zones) peaked till the beginning of October and started declining, the surge in Bengaluru Rural has begun now. More cases are being detected as the higher rate of testing is being maintained,” he explained. Tweaked discharge policy Mysore Sanjeev, convenor of Project: Jeevan Raksha, a public-private initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Medical Association, and Proxima, a management consulting firm, said a high recovery rate (due to which there is a decline in active cases) could also be due to the tweaked discharge policy that does not mandate compulsory testing before declaring a positive patient as recovered. “There is a higher chance of COVID-19 patients, especially in smaller towns, being officially declared as recovered, without being fully recovered,” he said. Pointing out that the sharp downward trend in active cases indicates that there is a significant drop in the number of new positive cases in October, Mr. Sanjeev said, “As per our analysis, the average number daily cases and deaths in Karnataka was 9,500 and 102 respectively between October 1 to October 10. This has reduced to 4,200 and 53 respectively from October 21 to 31. Further, TPR has also dropped from 12% to 10%, which is a good sign.”  While infections in the core city (Bengaluru Urban and BBMP zones) peaked till the beginning of October and started declining, the surge in Bengaluru Rural has begun now. More cases are being detected as the higher rate of testing is being maintained.  V.

07 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP’s plan on ‘love jihad’ law triggers debate||The ruling BJP’s push for a law to curb “love jihad” in the State has created a stir, while several legal experts and senior police officers have raised doubts about its legal tenability. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, speaking at the party’s executive meeting in Mangaluru on Thursday, said a law was necessary to put a stop to “conversions for the sake of marriage”. Several of his ministerial colleagues too have batted for such a law. State intervention   Senior human rights advocate B.T. Venkatesh argued that any intervention by the State in the marriage or religious choice of a consenting adult would violate fundamental rights. However, Vivek Subba Reddy, president of the BJP legal cell, Karnataka, clarified that the party was not against interfaith marriages, but was only “trying to protect Hindu women who are being forced to convert to Islam under duress”. “At least eight States in the country have laws that criminalise religious conversions through inducements, allurements or under duress. Love jihad is a special case of that scenario. The law would only apply in such cases,” he argued. The Allahabad High Court had, in September 2020 and in 2014, held conversions of women from Islam to Hinduism and vice-versa, respectively, not valid as “they had taken place only for the purpose of marriage”. Taking a cue from the recent order, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that his government would enact a law to fight “love jihad”. However, advocate Clifton D’ Rozario, Manthan Law, said the rights of the woman in an interfaith marriage and conversion was clearly laid out by the Supreme Court in 2018. “The BJP is trying to push through legislation that will not stand the test of judicial review,” he said. He pointed out that the apex court had set aside a Kerala High Court order annulling the marriage of a homoeopathy student who had converted to Islam and wed. Her father had called it a case of “love jihad”. If a person, of age of majority, says that he or she has converted to any religion on their own free will, no one can sit on value judgment, said Mr. Venkatesh. However, Mr. Reddy argued that in many cases, the community would not accept the woman if she did not convert. This amounted to “duress” and the law would seek to address this social issue, he said. Countering this, Maithreyi Krishnan from Manthan Law said such an argument was “patriarchal” and amounted to undermining the woman’s autonomy and choices. “How can love be called inducement?” she asked. Implementation issues Meanwhile, many senior police officers The Hindu spoke to, but who did not wish to be named, said such a law would drag the police into messy civil matters. “Most interfaith marriages will end up at police stations, as parents may take objection to them. The process will becomethe punishment,” asenior officer said. Former Director-General and Inspector General of Police S.T. Ramesh said that a law on such a sensitive issue would have tremendous potential for misuse.“With the prevailing standards of evidence prescribed by the Indian EvidenceAct, it will be an uphill task tomarshal evidence in such cases. It is also not clear what public good such legislation seeks to serve. Societywill only get more polarised,” he said.  The BJP is trying to push through legislation that will not stand the test of judicial review Clifton D’ Rozario, advocate, Manthan Law||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjps-plan-on-love-jihad-law-triggers-debate/article33044894.ece
07 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Proposed six-lane highway project a threat to forests, many wildlife species: Study||The proposed six-lane national highway between Mudigere and Nelliyadi towns of Chikkamagaluru and Dakshina Kannada — the Shishila-Byrapura road —, will cut across contiguous forest patches of the central Western Ghats, fragmenting the stretch protected under seven reserve forests connecting the Bhadra Tiger Reserve, the Kudremukh National Park, and the Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, a new scientific article has said. These areas host one of the highest populations of Asiatic elephants, a tiger corridor, five species of birds, nine species of reptiles, and 23 species of mammals. The proposed highway would disrupt wildlife movement, potentially worsening the existing human-elephant interactions, increase wildlife mortality through collision with speeding vehicles, and could provide access to poachers and smugglers, added the article. The article, A highway to hell: a proposed, inessential, 6-lane highway (NH173) that threatens the forest and wildlife corridors of the Western Ghats , was published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa on October 26 and is authored by H.S. Sathya Chandra Sagar, graduate (Ph.D) researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Mrunmayee, executive director of WildCANE, an NGO working in the Bhadra Kudremukh landscape, and M.Phil candidate at the University of Cambridge. According to the article, the entire project of 233 km has been split into four workable packages, each under 100 km, and among them is the 68.9 km stretch between Mudigere and Nelliyadi, with no existing highway in the alignment. It further said that the area between Mudigere and Nelliyadi lies on the high and moderate landslide susceptibility areas. In addition, it has pointed out that the highway is also planned to pass along the Kapila river, one of the main feeders for the Nethravathi river system. Ms. Mrunmayee told The Hindu that the whole landscape between Mudigere and Sakleshpur is a region where the forest is already severely fragmented due to multiple linear intrusion projects such as MRPL pipeline, high tension transmission lines, existing highways (Charmadi Ghat and Shiradi Ghat) and the existing Sakleshpur-Mangaluru railway lines. “In addition, Yettinahole river diversion project has created immense damage to the landscape. There are also multiple mini hydel projects and a major reservoir in this area. The lands are also being converted into plantations, tourism facilities and residential plots. All of these projects have severely fragmented the forest and the landscape, which are primarily wildlife corridors and water catchment areas,” she said, attributing them to increased human-elephant conflict in Sakleshpur, Alur and Mudigere. Changes in legislation “The recent amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, encourages more conversion of agricultural areas which can be detrimental to fragile landscapes such as these. There is an urgent requirement for the government to take measures to protect wildlife corridors and protect the water catchment areas. Human-wildlife conflict is a growing issue and very little attempts are made to protect its corridors. We need to have a landscape-level plan for dos and don’ts,” added Ms. Mrunmayee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposed-six-lane-highway-project-a-threat-to-forests-many-wildlife-species-study/article33044903.ece
07 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Relief for youth who created false profile of ex-President||Holding that there is no material to continue criminal proceedings, the Karnataka High Court has upheld the sessions court order that discharged a Mysuru-based youth from the charges of creating a false profile of the then President Pratibha Devi Singh Patil on the websitewww.orkut.comduring 2007. Justice K.S. Mudagal passed the order while dismissing the petition filed by the State challenging the 2016 order of the Sessions Court, Bengaluru Rural district discharging the accused, Avinash R. Kashyap, for want of sufficient material. The criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Kashyap based on a complaint lodged by the Joint Secretary to the then President on February 26, 2009, and the Economic Offences Police wing, New Delhi, had filed charge sheet against him. The President’s Joint Secretary had also filed a separate private complaint against him before the Tees Hazari court, New Delhi, for the offence of defamation, and the Supreme Court, on Mr. Kashyap’s plea had transferred both the cases to Bengaluru. It was alleged in the complaints that false profile was created on June 30, 2007 and its contents were objectionable, incorrect, defamatory and casting imputation concerning the President, directly or indirectly lowering dignity of the President in the estimation of the others. Broadband connectivity Pointing out that he was charged solely on the basis of Internet Protocol (IP) address, the High Court noted that the report of the Senior Sub-Divisional Engineer of the BSNL Vigilance Cell of the office of the General Manager Telecom, Jayalaxmipuram, Mysore, found in the charge sheet had made it clear that the new phone connection was provided to the father of the accused on June 20, 1997, and the broadband connection was provided only on July 7, 2007. The High Court also noticed that the BSNL’s report had also confirmed mere work order was issued on June 30, 2007 demanding advance rental payment of deposit amount for giving broadband connection, and the telephone exchange created the broadband account for the telephone number of accused’s father only on July 7, 2007, a week after the alleged creation of false profile. FSL report Also, the report of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh, did not find any data or material related to alleged creation of false profile, the High Court pointed out while holding that continuing proceedings against the accused only on the basis of the IP address was futile. The Chief Judicial Magistrate in 2014 had refused to discharge the accused and he had filed an appeal before the Sessions Court, which in 2016 discharged him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relief-for-youth-who-created-false-profile-of-ex-president/article33045380.ece
07 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC sets aside special court order in assets case against C.T. Ravi||In a partial relief to BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi, the High Court of Karnataka has set aside a 2016 special court order directing the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe a disproportionate assets allegation made against him in a private complaint. Justice John Michael Cunha, while partly allowing Mr. Ravi’s petition, remanded the matter back to the special court to afford an opportunity to the complainant to file an affidavit in terms of the law laid down by the apex court. The High Court said the special court should not have referred the complaint for investigation without asking the complainant, A.C. Kumar of Chikkamagaluru, to file an affidavit to fix responsibility on complaints and to obviate false and irresponsible complaints being filed. The High Court also said that it was open to the complainant, if need be, to file a complaint before the ACB, as the allegations pertained to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The complaint was originally filed before the special court for Lokayukta cases in 2012, and the court referred it for investigation in 2016. By then, the government had vested with the ACB the power to investigate complaints under the Prevention of Corruption Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-sets-aside-special-court-order-in-assets-case-against-ct-ravi/article33044897.ece

Ravindranath, who had recently submitted his resignation from service miffed at “injustice” in promotions, announced he would be withdrawing his resignation. He made this announcement after a meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday morning. The Chief Minister is learnt to have assured him that “no injustice would be done to him and any issues will be resolved”. Recently, the State government promoted T. Suneel Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer as Director General of Police (DGP), on the last day of his superannuation. This had miffed Dr. Ravindranath, who claimed he was senior to Mr. Kumar in service and hence the promotion was “out of turn and an injustice to him”. This is not the first time Dr. Ravindranath has submitted his resignation and then withdrawn it. He had done so in 2014 after being accused of clicking indecent pictures of a woman at a cafe, without her knowledge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/adgp-p-ravindranath-to-withdraw-resignation/article33045371.ece

07 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||More testing in outer zones||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is trying to reduce the COVID-19 positivity rate by increasing testing in the outer zones. At a joint meeting with Police Commissioner Kamal Pant at Town Hall on Friday, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad, while addressing marshals, supervisors and senior officials, said that following sero survey, the number of tests were increased in the core zones of South, East and West. This is one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of cases in these zones. “However, the number of cases being reported from the outer zones has seen an increase. The BBMP will now increase testing in these zones to check further spread of the pandemic in the city,” he said. Of the 53,000 tests were performed on Thursday across the city, and 1,600 people tested positive. At Town Hall, the authorities reiterated the need for citizens to wear masks, maintain social distancing and follow good personal hygiene practices. “This is imperative, given that there is no vaccine yet. The police and marshals, who have been empowered to levy fines on citizens not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, must work in coordination with each other,” said Mr. Prasad. Marshals have been instructed to monitor public places where footfall is high, such as markets and malls, and levy fines on those violating the rules. They have been instructed not to levy fines on those using handkerchief or cloth instead of masks. The BBMP issued an order making it mandatory for two-wheeler riders to wear masks and exempted those driving alone in their cars with the windows up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-testing-in-outer-zones/article33045385.ece

They dumped the sugarcane bundles at the place meant for crushing in the factory. Sugarcane growers of the district had staged protests demanding the restart of the factory. Mr. Balakrishna, speaking on the occasion, said the crushing of sugarcane had been stopped as the private operator wanted time to expand the capacity of the machinery.

Second Additional District and Sessions judge Panchakshari M., who holds additional charge as Third Additional District and Sessions judge, heard the arguments of both sides through videoconferencing on Friday and granted the three-day custody.

Former Minister and Lingayat leader M.B. Patil of the Congress too termed the arrest “politically motivated”. However, both Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the CBI was doing its duty and there was no truth in such allegations. Meanwhile, CBI sleuths continued questioning Vijay Kulkarni, the younger brother of Mr. Vinay Kulkarni, on Friday as well. They had let him off after a marathon grilling on Thursday, but summoned him for questioning again on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seers-jump-into-fray-as-cbi-gets-three-day-custody-of-kulkarni/article33044896.ece
07 November 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Creating awareness on the need for people to continue to wear masks||As part of COVID-19 awareness drive, Kalaburagi Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna went on a round of the city on Thursday imposing fines on those who were found not wearing masks and also distributing masks free. She randomly visited crowded areas such as SVP Circle, Jagat Circle and Supermarket and stopped the people on two-wheelers, four-wheelers and autorickshaws not wearing masks and educated them about the importance of wearing the masks to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. At SVP Circle, Ms. Jyothsna boarded a city bus operated by NEKRTC and found many people commuting without wearing masks. She held the bus conductor responsible for the lapse and imposed fine on him for allowing people without masks to travel on his bus. She also distributed masks to people free. In the Supermarket area, one of the heavily crowded areas in the city, Ms. Jyothsna found most street vendors transacting their businesses without wearing masks. She distributed masks to all of them and advised them to wear masks and take other precautions against COVID-19. At Jagat Circle, Kalaburagi City Municipal Corporation Commissioner Snehal Sudhakar Lokhande, Assistant Commissioner of Police Anshu Kumar, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Vinod Kumar and other senior officers joined Ms. Jyothsna in the awareness drive. As per information provided by the administration later, a fine of Rs. 12,000 was collected from 48 violators in the last two days. The fine amount thus collected thus far in the city rose to Rs. 4.20 lakh. Speaking to The Hindu in the Supermarket area, Ms. Jyothsna said that COVID-19 was still spreading dangerously, though the reported cases might have come down. None could afford to take the pandemic easy. “The government alone cannot curb the spread of the pandemic without the active support and participation of the people. Today’s drive is a part of our sustained campaign of spreading awareness among the people on the precautions to be taken against the pandemic. The campaign would continue in the city and also be extended to the rural areas as well,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/creating-awareness-on-the-need-for-people-to-continue-to-wear-masks/article33044875.ece
07 November 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||State govt. urged to set up welfare board for tailors||The Karnataka Rajya Tailors Federation, affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), demanded that the State government provide social security for tailors by forming a welfare board. AITUC district president Prabhudev Yelasanghi, addressing a press conference here on Friday, said that most of the women continue to sew at home and a number of families in cities and rural areas are dependent on sewing, stitching and embroidery business for their livelihood. The government has failed to address these unorganised sector workers, he added. Mr. Yelasanghi said that at least 2 % of cess collected from garments and textile manufacturing industries should be utilised for the welfare of these unorganised workers through the tailors welfare board. He also demanded that the government provide a pension and health insurance cards for tailors aged over 60. The federation would organise a protest outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office on November 9 to press for its demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-urged-to-set-up-welfare-board-for-tailors/article33044880.ece

07 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Sasihithlu Beach to be developed without causing harm to fishermen’s interests||Dakshina Kannada district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari on Tuesday said that the government will develop the Sasihithlu-Munda Beach, off Mukka, at an initial cost of Rs. 10 crore. The development, Mr. Poojari said, would be undertaken without affecting the interests of local fishermen. Already, Rs. 5 crore have been released for the development work, he said and added that a Rs. 4.15 crore plan was prepared for the construction of a sea protection wall. He was speaking to reporters during a visit to Sasihithlu Beach along with Moodbidri MLA Umanath Kotian, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and others. Mr. Kotian urged the Minister that beach development should also ensure the protection of the interests of local fishermen. He said that fishermen from Sasihithlu should be able to access the benefits of the proposed Hejmady Fishing Harbour to the North of Nandni-Shambhavi Estuary. Comprehensive plan Interacting with officials earlier, Dr. Rajendra said that since the beach falls under Coastal Regulation Zone 1, no permanent structure, including all-weather concrete road, cannot be constructed during the development project. Instead of permanent structures, temporary structures such as cottages could be built on the location, he suggested. He also asked the officials whether any comprehensive plan for developing the beach as a surfing destination was prepared. Highlighting local woes, Zilla Panchayat member Vinod Bollur said that residents of Sasihithlu village were not getting adequate supply of the Netravathi water through the Mangaluru City Corporation facility. Dr. Rajendra directed officials concerned to resolve the issue. Fishermen leader Shobendra Sasihithlu said that 146 house owners in the locality have not received possession certificates since 1990. There was a need to develop a fishermen colony, he said. While officials said that possession certificates could not be issued due to technical problems, Dr. Rajendra asked them to identify vacant government land and a list of homeless persons to take the proposal forward. Dr. Rajendra directed the development officer of the Haleyangadi Gram Panchayat to stop collection of entry fee from visitors to the beach and also ensure protection of structures there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sasihithlu-beach-to-be-developed-without-causing-harm-to-fishermens-interests/article33045620.ece
07 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Udupi district records drastic fall in new COVID-19 cases||The number of COVID-19 positive cases in Udupi district has now come down to two cases per every 100 sample tests from 30 cases earlier, according to Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha. Though the new cases are on the decline, people should exercise caution and should continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing, he said in a statement on Friday. In a video message posted on Facebook, Mr. Jagadeesha said that the graph of the new cases has come down due to the committed work by the staff of the district administration and cooperation from people. Many intensive care units (ICUs) and ventilators in hospitals are now vacant. “We need to be careful to ensure that there is no spurt in COVID-19 cases again,” he said. With marriages lined up in the coming days, Tahsildars are giving permission to allow the participation of a maximum of 200 people in those gatherings. The district administration has received reports that more than 200 people are participating in some of the marriages without bothering to keep social distancing. This is against the guidelines laid down by the government for controlling COVID-19. “We do not want the organisers of such events to be the cause for the spread of COVID-19,” he said and added that an officer has been assigned to keep a close watch on marriages in his allotted area. If marriages are held in contrary to the guidelines, criminal cases will be booked against organisers. “If the official concerned is found not taking any action, disciplinary action will be initiated against him too,” he added. The Deputy Commissioner asked people not just care for one’s own health but also have concern for the health of others. People should not crowd for “mehendi” and other such social functions. The police have been booking cases against people for not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms and are collecting fines every day from violators. The Deputy Commissioner asked owners and staff of shops and other establishments to wear masks properly. When owners and staff do not wear masks in a proper manner, they cannot ask their customers to wear them properly, he said. The local bodies will suspend licence of such establishments where owners and staff are found without masks and do not wear them properly. “Those who are serious in doing business should ensure strict compliance with safety norms,” he added On buses, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, all should compulsorily wear face masks. Bus drivers and conductors should be a model for their passengers. “If it is not done, then, action will be taken,” he said and asked bus owners to ensure that their buses are completely sanitised after every trip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/udupi-district-records-drastic-fall-in-new-covid-19-cases/article33045617.ece

Speaking at a meeting in Udupi, the Minister said that since the coastal belt had ports, quality timber can be imported for manufacturing furniture and such goods can also be exported. It will help create employment opportunities. The government will support the setting up of the cluster once land is identified. The Minister said that he has instructed the district administrations to develop different clusters for the growth of the industrial sector in the State. A toy manufacturing cluster will come up at Koppal and pharma clusters will be set up in Yadgir-Raichur districts. He said that his department will review whether land allotted to different industries in Udupi to open their units have been utilised or not. The Minister instructed entrepreneurs to employ locals in their units and implement the Sarojini Mahishi Report while recruiting employees. Mr. Shettar said that a detailed project report will be prepared for the development of Belikeri Port in Uttara Kannada. The government has allowed opening of industries in tier I and tier II cities to avoid concentration of industries in Bengaluru alone. With this, employment opportunities will be created in such cities.

Insulin for a month was arranged following the recent visit by officials, including District Endosulfan Relief Nodal Officer Naveenchandra Kulal. It followed reports about how Gagan’s father Krishnappa Gowda, a daily wage worker, was struggling. Gagan, who has disability of less than 25%, was, hence, issued a green smart card with which he could access free treatment at government and empanelled private hospitals. However, with private hospitals refusing to offer free treatment based on the card, Mr. Krishnappa said he was unable to arrange for Rs. 150 for insulin twice a day. He was also unable to provide his son a nutritional diet. His petition to District Legal Services Authority in January highlighting his plight changed nothing. He has pledged gold and has made use of relief available under the Dharmasthala Suraksha Bima Yojana to take care of Gagan -the younger of two children. Dr. Kulal said that the nearby government hospital has arranged for insulin. The government would take care of Gagan’s treatment either at government or private hospitals. The card that has become old would be replaced. On complaints by physically challenged endosulfan victims Umesh from Chibidre village of Belthangady taluk and Trupti and Mithun from Kadeshivalaya village of Bantwal taluk of not getting monthly stipend of Rs. 3,000 since 2019, Dr. Kulal said the department was told to right things.

In this connection, the Minister has told the Superintendent of Police, Kodagu, to send a proposal to the government. Addressing presspersons, Mr. Bommai said the Police department had taken all measures for tackling naxal activities in the State and another anti-naxal troop had been proposed in addition to two such squads that are already operating. Approval for the third crew of personnel had been given. In reply to a question on elephant attacks, the Minister said the Chief Minister will discuss with the Forest Minister and the Minister in-charge of Kodagu district the demand for enhancing the compensation to the deceased. The Minister said the police have taken all stringent steps for curbing the drug menace and added that a separate squad will be set up for checking illegal cow trafficking and slaughter. Mr. Bommai warned of action against Kodagu homestays that are operating without valid licences. “We have information on the homestays in Kodagu. Every homestay has to register with the department concerned. The police will act against unauthorised homestays if they fail to comply with the rules.” The Home Minister said steps will be taken to provide new vehicles for patrolling in Kodagu which happens to be a hill district. As people reside in isolated areas, there is a need for strengthening the police force in the district for the safety and security of the people. As the office of the SP in Madikeri is located in an old building, he asked the SP to submit a proposal for the building of the new SP office. The government can sanction about Rs. 10 crore for it. The Minister asked the police force to be in touch with the people living in hilly regions and establish good relationships with the public besides ensuring their well-being. IGP Vipul Kumar and SP Kshama Mishra were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sdrf-team-for-kodagu-mysuru-to-handle-calamities-minister/article33045005.ece

07 November 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||N. Mahesh draws flak for teaming up with BJP in Kollegal CMC chief polls||Former Minister N. Mahesh, who had been expelled from the BSP after he abstained from voting during the trust vote of the H.D. Kumaraswamy government last year, has drawn flak from the BSP leaders in the State for joining forces with the BJP and defeating the party’s candidate during last week’s elections to the post of president of Kollegal City Municipal Council (CMC). Seven out of nine BSP councillors in the 31-member house went against the whip issued by the party in favour of its candidates during last week’s elections to the post of president and vice-president of Kollegal CMC. The seven BSP members along with seven BJP members, one Independent, besides Chamarajanagar MP Srinivas Prasad and Mr. Mahesh himself had voted in favour of rebel BSP candidate Gangamma for the post of president and BJP’s Kavitha as vice president. The 31-member Kollegal CMC comprises 11 Congress members, 9 BSP members, 7 BJP members, besides four Independents. Though Mr. Mahesh has been claiming that he would remain neutral and function as an Independent MLA, BSP leaders in the State pointed out that the Kollegal MLA’s move to align with the BJP in the recent CMC polls was preceded by his increasing proximity to the saffron party leaders. “He was hobnobbing with BJP Ministers and party leaders in the district,” said BSP’s State General Secretary Nagendra. Call for resignation Calling upon Mr. Mahesh, who had even as a Minister in the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy, to resign from the Assembly and get re-elected as an Independent, Mr. Nagendra said the Kollegal MLA should not forget the sweat of hundreds of BSP cadres, who had toiled hard for his successful election during the 2018 assembly polls. Many BSP workers had contributed their hard-earned wages for Mr. Mahesh’s election campaign, Mr Nagendra claimed. Apart from Kollegal, the elections to the posts in Chamarajanagar too saw the lone BSP councillor vote in support of the BJP candidate. Mr. Nagendra said the party had taken the development seriously had would be moving the courts soon for disqualification of all the BJP councillors, who had violated the whip.  ‘Communal’ forces Congress leader and former Chamarajanagar MP R. Dhruvanarayan too has criticised Mr. Mahesh for identifying himself with ‘communal’ forces after criticising them throughout his political career. Clearly, Mr. Mahesh does not believe in secularism, Mr Dhruvanarayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/n-mahesh-draws-flak-for-teaming-up-with-bjp-in-kollegal-cmc-chief-polls/article33045008.ece

Hours after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa asked people to use only “green crackers”, customers have been lining up at the shop to return the crackers they had purchased a few days ago. Supreet, the owner, told The Hindu that they were currently accepting returns at a loss. “The government should have announced their intention sooner. As a wholesale dealer, we have given crackers on loan to several retailers. They are also asking us to take back whatever has been given to them. We had placed indents with the cracker manufacturers last year. What are we to do with the stock?” The Chief Minister made the request after a consultation with health experts, including members of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which was of the opinion that bursting of crackers could impact the health of those already infected with COVID-19. R. Ashwanth Narayana, owner of Harsha Traders, near Roopena Agrahara bus stand, said he had mortgaged his wife’s jewellery to raise money to purchase stock for the festival. “It’s a double blow for us, as we had to pay GST and now have to spend on ensuring that the stock does not get spoilt by hiring employees to move the stock regularly and pay rent for a godown,” he said and added that he was contemplating approaching dealers and manufacturers to return as much as he could. Stating that over the past five years, the sale of crackers had come down a great deal, he said many traders were already hit by the pandemic. “Had the government issued the advisory sooner, we would have saved the money spent on tax and licence renewal. The government takes no action on industries polluting the environment on a daily basis, but cracks down on the bursting of crackers, which happens for a few days every year,” said B.L. Jayaram, owner of Lakshmi Traders, Bodanahosahalli, near Whitefield.  It’s a double blow for us, as we had to pay GST and now have to spend on ensuring that the stock does not get spoilt R.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Colleges may extend teaching hours||The heads of many higher education institutions in the city are considering extending teaching hours among staff so that classes can be conducted in batches for students. This comes after the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines issued on Thursday stated that only 50% of the student strength would be allowed on a campus at a time. C.B. Annapurnamma, principal, National College, Basavanagudi, said that if they implement this, they will have no choice but to extend teaching hours. “We are also considering holding classes on alternate days, depending on the year. However, we have doubts on the modalities of mixed teaching methodology. We still do not know if we need to record separate classes for students who have opted for online learning. If that is the case, the workload will increase, and it will be difficult for teachers,” she said. The college plans to finish practical classes first and then conduct internals as soon as possible. “That will take around 20 days. By then, we will get a clearer idea on the way forward,” she said. K.R. Venugopal, V-C, Bangalore University, said that many of their affiliated colleges are thinking of extending working hours. “Completing practicals and revision classes in a phased manner is the priority. For this, teaching hours may have to be extended as there has not been any cut in the syllabus,” he said. Karisiddappa, Vice Chancellor of Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), said that they would consult various stakeholders, including teachers, students and parents, on the issue and take a decision early next week. “We are also waiting for the State government’s SOP. Since engineering is technical in nature, we need to plan well before we open our doors to students,” he said. On the other hand, a few deemed-to-be-universities and autonomous colleges have almost finished the current semester and have scheduled exams in early December. Fr. Abraham V.M., Vice-Chancellor of Christ (Deemed To Be University), said that the last working day of the present semester for UG was November 7, and the exams would commence in the first week of December. “The next semester begins in the first week of January 2021. We are planning to hold classes on alternate days. Those who cannot attend classes in campus can attend them online,” he said. ‘Hostel guidelines impractical’ While the UGC guidelines state that sharing rooms may not be allowed in hostels, many colleges said it is not practical. A senior faculty member of Bangalore University said that around 1,000 PG students recently stayed in the hostels to appear for their final year exam. “How can we give each a separate room? We need more clarity on this,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/colleges-may-extend-teaching-hours/article33045382.ece

H.C. Sharatchandra, former chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) who is member of the Karnataka High Court appointed Technical Guidance Committee, said he had proposed a blanket ban on sale and bursting of crackers in view of the resultant air and noise pollution. “However, there was a lot of opposition to the proposal itself,” he said. Many health experts and environmentalists pointed out that with COVID-19 affecting the lungs, it was important to ensure that the air quality did not deteriorate. “Given the situation, we must take all measures to ensure the spread of the virus is checked,” said D.T. Devare from Bangalore Environment Trust. Manohar B.S., vice president of Basavanagudi Residents’ Welfare Association, urged people to consider those in home quarantine. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there are many infected people who are under home quarantine.

While Jakkur, Rachenahalli, Madiwala, Doddakallasandra lakes received a fair amount of water, many others, including those that have been rejuvenated, were not so fortunate. Doddanekundi lake, for instance, did not receive water. “It should have been brimming with water, but resembles a grassland. There’s even cattle grazing on patches spread across the lakebed,” said a resident. The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had spent around Rs. 10 crore on the rejuvenation and beautification of the lake before handing it over to the BBMP in February this year. ‘Fewer birds visit’ P. Pramod of Nekkundi Tank Rejuvenation Association (NeTRA) said that it had been a few years since the lake was ‘rejuvenated’ by the BDA. “However, we are still waiting for it to be filled with water The lake needs one more round of de-weeding now,” Mr. Pramod said. The number of birds that visited the lake had drastically reduced. “Around 18 different species of birds used to flock the lake but now we hardly see any of them,” he said. Vibhutipura and Devasandra lakes, too, have not received water despite being rejuvenated. ‘Water recedes’ Srinivas P., who lives near Devasandra lake, said that the water level has always been very low. “Even when water collects during the monsoon, it recedes quickly. The lake is neglected. The authorities have not made proper arrangements for water to freely enter the lake,” he said. V. Ramprasad, founder and convener of Friends of Lake, said that the agencies responsible for rejuvenation of the lake just concentrate on the beautification and cosmetic changes. “Lakes without water even years after rejuvenation is the result of such flawed and wrong execution of rejuvenation,” he said. Water retention seems to be a problem at Vidyaranyapura and Chikka Basavanapura lakes. “The lake received a decent amount of water, but it receded quickly,” said a resident near Vidyaranyapura lake. While civic officials acknowledge the problem, lake activists and experts say that one of the main reasons for this is encroachment of stormwater drains (SWDs). Nagesh Aras of Friends of Lake said that the BBMP was not doing enough to clear the blocked incoming channels of SWDs to the lake. “Also, since many lakes in the city are interconnected and are dependent on overflow of water, SWDs need to be free from sewage and encroachments,” he said. According to a survey of lakes by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), around 437 acres out of around 5,207 acres under 169 lakes in the city have been encroached. The BBMP has managed to recover 45 acres. Mohan Krishna, Chief Engineer, Lakes, BBMP, said that three tahsildar level officers had been appointed as ‘Special Executive Magistrates’ to execute the encroachment drive, but they had still not reported for duty due to COVID-19 related administrative reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-rejuvenated-lakes-remain-dry-despite-rain/article33045384.ece

As many as 116 of the 360 students in their seventh semester have already received pre-placement offers from the who-is-who of IT industry after the campus placement process for the final year batch started in September. More companies are slated to conduct online tests and interviews for aspirants in the coming days. The recruiters include Deloitte, Bosch, Oracle, TCS, IBS Software, Prevalent AI, Gadgeon, and Amadeus Labs. Saving time “The response from major recruiters for the present final year batch [seventh semester] has been overwhelming. The entire process, from test to interview, was held online in view of the COVID-19 situation. The digital route has turned beneficial compared to the traditional mode, as recruiters save on their valuable time and expenses incurred for travel and other logistic challenges,” said M.V. Rajesh, associate professor, department of electronics engineering, who is also the training and placement officer at the college. Annual salary The highest annual salary offered for the 2021 pass-out batch was Rs. 23 lakh. The average salary was Rs. 5.4 lakh, while the lowest pay proposed was Rs. 3.2 lakh. Prof. Rajesh said the average salary was almost similar to the pay packet offered to students who passed out of the college this year. The highest salary for the outgoing batch was around Rs. 30 lakh per annum. Data available with the placement cell showed that the virtual on-boarding of nearly 80% of the 2020 pass-out batch by the recruiters had been complete amid the pandemic crisis. WFH option They have been given the option of work-from-home, as many companies prefer it in view of the continuing health crisis. The freshers have undertaken projects entrusted by their companies. Several students have also taken the opportunity to enrol for skill development programmes online. They were relieved amid apprehensions that the recruiters might freeze their placement offers in view of the financial crisis induced by the pandemic. However, many companies have kept their promise despite the troubled times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mec-students-beat-pandemic-blues-grab-impressive-offers/article33045576.ece

District Collector S. Suhas handed it over to KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma. The land belongs to the PWD and houses, among others, governments quarters. KPMG has been tasked with conducting a study and readying a master plan for the Bliss City project. In addition, investors will have to be made aware of its potential. “The consultancy firm is expected to submit the plan shortly. Details like the mode of financing the project too ought to be finalised. It will most likely emulate the second phase development work of the Vyttila Mobility Hub, which is slated to be executed in Public-Private Partnership [PPP] mode,” metro sources said. KMRL had earlier this year inked an MoU with Kerala Infrastructure Fund Management Limited (KIFML) to develop the Bliss City project in Kakkanad and to woo international investments. The project has been envisaged as a state-of-the-art entertainment zone in the city, one which will become a wellness and wholesome entertainment destination for the people of Kochi and also for tourists. However, plans to construct affordable apartments on the premises were dropped, considering the fall in demand for apartments, especially in the Kakkanad region, sources said. The revenue from the project will be used to meet the metro’s operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses. Ecological concerns A section of residents and socio-environmental activists have expressed concern over the possible felling of trees numbering 4,000, of around 180 species, for the project. It will in turn affect hundreds of birds that nest there. “The felling of trees will affect the region’s biodiversity and hamper percolation of water into the ground. A majority of trees are either fruit-bearing or rain trees having good canopy,” said environmental activist Prof. C.M. Joy, who led tree surveys here under a District Tree Committee initiative. Meanwhile, metro sources said care would be taken to retain maximum greenery on the 17.30-acre premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-receives-title-deed-of-17-acres-for-bliss-city-project/article33045584.ece
07 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||No more rusting away of vehicles seized under NDPS Act||Gone are the days when vehicles seized under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act rusted away in various excise offices. An amendment to the Act reflected in Section 52A, which was effective from 2015, though was not fully enforced till now owing to various implementation-related ambiguities, has finally kicked in, enabling law enforcement agencies to encash such vehicles and add revenue to the government exchequer. The Excise Department in Ernakulam has put up the first lot of such vehicles — three scooters seized in NDPS cases — for auction subject to the approval of the district-level disposal committee comprising the deputy excise commissioner, assistant excise commissioner, and a squad excise circle inspector. “They have been listed in the portal of the State-owned e-commerce company Metal Scrap Trading Corporation (MSTC) Limited and anyone from any part of the country can participate in the auction and secure the vehicles on sending in a demand draft for the auction amount. The proceeds will be deposited with the court concerned, which will take a call on it at the end of the trial,” senior Excise Department officials said. The department will organise an offline auction for vehicles that have no online takers. Earlier such vehicles could not be sold off till the completion of the trial that could have gone on for years during the course of which they had to be kept in excise offices concerned, which hardly have had space even otherwise. Besides, by the time the long-winding trials meandered to completion many of these vehicles would have rusted away, leading to waste of potential revenue to the government. “Some courts used to give the vehicle owner its interim custody till the higher courts intervened and stopped that practice,” said Mr. Kumar. In contrast, no such restrictions were applicable in the case of vehicles seized under Abkari Act even previously as they could be sold off even amidst the trial either online or offline. The department used to conduct offline auctions of such vehicles like the latest one involving 35 vehicles set to be held at Mamala excise range office on November 19 in compliance with COVID protocol. The Excise Department in the district seizes, on an average, 15 vehicles in a month under both Abkari Act and NDPS Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-more-rusting-away-of-vehicles-seized-under-ndps-act/article33045578.ece
07 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Ancient ring well unearthed at Thevarkad||When his yard at Thevarkad, near Varapuzha, was being dug up to lay a water pipeline last month, little did Sijo A.A. know that he would stumble upon a ring well, a series of terracotta rings in the ground, used to store water. “I had no idea how old it might be and have not studied history, but I was curious about it,” said the 33-year-old who approached several authorities, and then the PAMA Institute for the Advancement of Transdisciplinary Archaeological Sciences, a non-profit educational trust that carried out excavations at Pattanam and Mathilakam earlier this year. An eight member team from PAMA unearthed the well, mostly in fragments, on Thursday, as part of a “rescue archaeology mission.” Similar ring wells, some intact, were found at Pattanam and have been dated to the early historic period between 300 BCE and 500 CE, said P.J. Cherian, director, PAMA excavations at Pattanam and Mathilakam, 2020. “Our research question is, what might be the similarity of this well with the wells we found at Pattanam, some 15 km away. If it belongs to the same period, the settlement at Pattanam would be extended to a broader area. The burnt terracotta ring wells are a sign that we were advanced in terms of technology and organisation of life then,” he said. “The well was present intact at the site, but we could only remove it in fragments. We began to see the rings from about 70 to 80 cm below the ground, up to around 200 cm. The deeper we went, more water came up to the surface, making it difficult to get to the rings,” said Rizvan P.S., who has a postgraduate degree in history and supervised the trench. “It could be difficult to give it a date using radio carbon dating considering the disturbances in the area. Stratigraphically, in the Periyar river belt, at 70 cm or deeper, the dates are usually in the early medieval period or early historic period,” said Rizvan who was also the trench supervisor for a few trenches at Mathilakam earlier this year. A ring well had been uncovered near Mathilakam in January this year on private property, but the presence of water made it difficult to excavate the rings. Some of the ring wells found in Pattanam had only three or four rings, while the one at Varappuzha had about 13 rings. “We do not have an informed chronology for these ring wells. They are found mostly in coastal, sandy regions. Carbon dating and the years of excavations at Pattanam point to the dates of the wells found there,” Mr. Cherian said. Before he approached PAMA, Sijo was advised by people in the area to not report the presence of the well. “There is a kind of fear when people come across archaeological objects and they do not know what to do,” Mr. Cherian said. “After the studies, Sijo can claim the fragments. It should not be taken away from that panchayat or municipality area,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ancient-ring-well-unearthed-at-thevarkad/article33045575.ece

The Fisheries Department has come across such frauds where victims were cheated of thousands of rupees on such promises that could never be legally fulfilled. In fact, the department even had to issue a release warning potential victims to be alert against such fraudsters. “The fact is that the department is no longer giving registrations for such nets, which were issued decades ago under two Acts, which are now defunct and since then subsumed in the Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, 2010. Only, the existing registered nets are allowed to be transferred to the successors of the original registration holders,” said Nousher Khan, Deputy Director of the Fisheries Department, Ernakulam zone. Already, there are thousands of illegal fishing nets set up without any registrations across the district. It is the operators of these nets who are being cheated mainly with promises of securing registration from the department. “They realise that they are without due registrations when they are asked to re-register when it is due. Many people who operate such nets have nothing to show for their original registrations, exposing their illegal existence,” said Mr. Khan. He said that Kumbalanghi alone had about 2,000 such illegal nets criss-crossing the surrounding waterways. However, the Palluruthy police having jurisdiction over the area said that they hadn’t received any complaints about being cheated in the name of securing registrations for Chinese and stake nets, which sources said could be an indication that the victims were either reluctant to approach the police or were from marginalised sections. Meanwhile, the Fisheries Department has increasingly turned its attention towards removing illegal nets that posed hardship to inland fishermen and even water transport. “We have removed over 150 such nets from the national waterways between Ernakulam and Kottapuram. Our next focus is Kumbalanghi,” said Mr. Khan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/registration-for-chinese-stake-nets-several-fishers-taken-for-a-ride/article33045580.ece

The poster shows road users struggling to cross a pothole-ridden road. It appeals to the conscience of harried Kochiites, fed up of among other things the ill-maintained roads which get inundated at the drop of a hat. Ever since its launch in September, V4Kochi has been supporting its poll campaign with a unique social media blitzkrieg to make inroads into voter minds. At the helm of the formation are people once associated with the Aam Aadmi Party in Ernakulam. It intends to take on mainstream parties by fielding candidates in all 74 divisions of the Kochi Corporation. The outfit has already made its presence felt in most divisions with posters and innovative campaigns, led mostly by young volunteers. Mazha peythal puzhayakunna Kochi, reads yet another poster, showing motorists and pedestrians wading through a flooded arterial road in the city. The posters and our logo were designed by Lenish John, a professional designer from Australia who is our supporter as well, says Alexander Shaju, joint controller of the body’s Kochi zone. “The formation was launched after much brainstorming, to weed out corruption and inefficiency from civic affairs and to plug leaks in the existing style of governance. The response from the public has been overwhelming.” They are also contributing to our crowdfunding, which has brought in Rs. 1.60 lakh so far, he says. Its political campaign controller Nipun Cherian says the body stands for direct democracy.“People are fed up, since mainstream political parties are hampering people’s direct participation in the democratic set up. We want to eradicate such intermediaries, thus re-establishing people’s power,” he says. “We found that posting videos of regional issues yields faster results, since visuals are shown and the name of the division councillor mentioned,” says Foji John, one among the 16 founding members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/v4kochi-to-draw-on-peoples-power/article33044980.ece

The varying positions were reflected in the status report filed before the Southern Bench of the tribunal by the technical committee consisting of the District Collector, Ernakulam; Sub Collector; Secretary, Maradu Municipality, and the Chief Environmental Engineer of the State Pollution Control Board, Ernakulam (nodal officer). The tribunal had asked the board to assess the environmental compensation from the Maradu Municipality and service providers for non-compliance with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016. The board informed the tribunal that no specific guidelines or model calculations were available before the Central Pollution Control Board for imposing environmental compensation, if any, for violations committed by the secretary of the local body on account of not submitting periodical reports and action plans. The violations, if any, will be addressed accordingly after receiving such a document, said the board. The nodal officer had issued a letter on September 24 to the secretary, pointing out non-compliance with the tribunal’s direction to submit the action plan and a consolidated report on the action taken by the civic body. The secretary rejected the views of the board representative while stating that the entire demolition debris had been removed. The draft report prepared by the board was contrary to its earlier position. The weekly action plan submitted by the project proponent was verified by board officials. A log book was maintained by the agency responsible for the removal of the demolition debris. The service providers have completed the removal of the debris as per the agreement with the local body. The municipal authorities have given the completion certificate. The secretary said a detailed action plan was submitted by the project proponent before the Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board ahead of the start of the debris removal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ngt-panel-members-differ-on-removal-of-demolition-debris/article33045589.ece

The petition was filed by Muhammed Haleem K.K. of Malappuram and another person. According to them, there is confusion among the common man about the cremation/burial/last rites of those who die of COVID-19. Once a patient dies, the Health Department takes away the body to the cremation/burial ground where nobody is allowed to enter, not even a single family member.

07 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Rape accused gets 12-year imprisonment||The Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ernakulam, on Friday sentenced a person to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment in a case of rape in North Paravur dating back to 2011. The convict is Sibin of Vadakkekara, who was 25 years old at the time of committing the crime. The remaining three accused were acquitted for want of evidence, while another has been absconding since 2012. The convict was guilty on three counts under Sections 376 (rape) 377 (unnatural offences), and 384 (extortion). Though he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and slapped with a fine of Rs. 25,000 each on the first two counts of offences, they will run concurrently, while the sentence of two years for extortion will run separately. “Being the most hated crime, the rape tantamounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman and offends both her esteem and dignity. The accused must face the consequences of the crime,” observed judge P.J. Vincent. The prosecution case was that the victim, who was 23 years old then, was raped multiple times by the convict at the home of the absconding accused with the active abetment of the rest of the accused since March 11, 2011. The offence was captured using a hidden camera, and the convict shared the footage with the rest of the accused over phone. Since then, the accused individually and collectively extorted Rs. 25,000 and gold ornaments from the victim by blackmailing her to make public the recordings thus bringing disrepute to her family. Special prosecutor P.A. Bindhu appeared for the prosecution. The convict allegedly lured the victim with the promise of marriage and raped her without revealing that he had already been married. The convict was found not guilty of charges under the IT Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rape-accused-gets-12-year-imprisonment/article33045590.ece

The project envisages the construction of an elevated walkway-cum-cycle track over Chilavannoor lake, to link the Kochi metro’s Elamkulam station with the corridor that links Subhash Bose Road with Jawahar Nagar. The authority had declined to sanction the project. Subsequently, the corporation submitted a letter, requesting it to reconsider the decision. ‘Bid to reclaim land’ Critics, including socio-political and environmental activists, had termed the project as a ploy to reclaim around 10 acres on the western side of the waterbody. They further alleged that it would worsen flooding in the region. They also warned of intensifying their agitation, if the corporation went ahead with its plans. Sources associated with the project said the temporary bund constructed through the centre of the backwaters would be demolished in a phased manner as soon as piling for the walkway-cum-cycle track was over. But detractors wondered why the structure was being built through the centre, when it could have been constructed through the eastern or western end of the waterbody, along the banks, after clearing encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sarovaram-project-corporation-moves-kczma-for-sanction/article33045585.ece

07 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Tenure extension set aside||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Ernakulam Bench on Friday set aside an order issued by the president of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Thiruvananthapuram, extending the tenure of Asha Kishore as director of the institute. The Bench comprising P. Madhavan, judicial member, and K.V. Eapen, administrative member, passed the verdict on an application filed by Sajith Sukumaran of the SCTIMST challenging the extension given to Dr. Kishore from July 15, 2020. The tribunal observed that the institute body (IB) ought to have obtained the approval of the Union government’s Appointment Committee of Cabinet (ACC) when it decided to extend the term of the director. The IB had only the power to recommend the extension of tenure to ACC. The tribunal said it was surprising that the institute had not framed recruitment rules for its Chief Executive. The dispute could have been avoided if the institute had incorporated the tenure and conditions of service of the post of director as observed by the High Court more than seven years ago. Counsel for Dr. Kishore and the president of the institute contended that no specific tenure was prescribed in the Act or Rules of the institute for the post of director. If the power to appoint the director was granted to the IB, then the same body had the power to extend the tenure as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cat-sets-aside-sctimst-chiefs-tenure-extension/article33044914.ece

When the petitions filed by the survivor and the State government for shifting the case from the present trial court came up for hearing, the prosecutor told the court that the senior public prosecutor handling the case could not appear as he was in quarantine. The prosecutor, therefore, sought to extend the order deferring the trial in the case pending before the Additional Special Sessions Court, Ernakulam. In her petition, the survivor alleged that she was aggrieved by the biased and hostile attitude of the trial court towards her. She further alleged that the trial court remained a mute spectator when she was being examined and harassed by counsel for Dileep. The government also argued that a fair trial in the case would not be possible before the Additional Special Sessions Judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trial-deferred-till-nov-16/article33044915.ece

The daily average international export alone between March and October was more than 125 tonnes, even as the Civil Aviation Ministry has curtailed dedicated cargo flights through airports other than the six designated ones from October 1. Since then, air export of perishable items has been adversely affected. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation restrictions are on operation of foreign ad hoc and purely chartered, non-scheduled freight services. As a result, there are no airports in Kerala now being permitted to handle special cargo flights or ad hoc flights. The special cargo flight services are available from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Restrictions on movement have resulted in a big fall in cargo volume in October. CIAL had handled 3,409 tonnes of international cargo in September 2020, but in October, the volume plunged to 2,331 tonnes, airport sources said. Around 18,553 tonnes of export cargo and 2,278 tonnes of import were handled in the international sector, while the volume of domestic cargo handled by the air cargo division was 900 tonnes in the export section and 3,767 tonnes in the import section. Major commodities carried by the flights were fish seed, meat, and mobile phone sets. In the international sector, Emirates accounted for the largest volume of export cargo. The restrictions on dedicated cargo flights from Kochi means the volume has come down from the pre-COVID of 150 to 100 tonnes per day. Air cargo movement from Kochi is being taken care of by passenger flights, but they carry only up to 15 tonnes, while special flights carry up to 50 tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cial-handled-25500-tonnes-of-cargo-in-pandemic-times/article33045582.ece

Hariprasad while inaugurating through videoconferencing the fast-track special court to handle cases registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court in Punalur was sanctioned considering the difficulties of those living in the Ghat sections of the district. “The court complex in Punalur was completed to bring together the five courts scattered across the region,” said Forest Minister K. Raju who presided over the function. At present Punalur has three judicial first class magistrate courts, one Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and one Munsif sub-court. The lack of special courts had caused pendency of cases, making it difficult for child and women victims. There has been much delay in the disposal of appeals in POCSO and other cases related to atrocities against women and children. Cost factor The Union government had started setting up of fast-track special courts across the country as a part of National Mission for Safety of Women. It had introduced the concept to ensure time-bound trial of cases related to rape and POCSO Act. The States will bear 30% expenses for the construction of courts. The fast-track special POCSO court will function on the first floor of the court complex in Punalur. Additional district judge N. Harikumar, judicial first class magistrate Ambili Chandran, Munsif V.

07 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||RMPI still packs a punch||Be it an Assembly poll or Lok Sabha election, the martyrdom of Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI) founder T.P. Chandrasekharan will be a topic of discussion in the politically sensitive Onchiyam and Eramala grama panchayats of Kozhikode. And it gets more intense during local body elections. After Chandrasekharan’s murder on May 4, 2012 the RMPI’s attempts to emerge as a force against the Communist Party of India (Marxist) continue to be a tale of endurance. Though the candidate list in its strongholds of Onchiyam, Eramala, Chorod, and Azhiyoor is not ready, the RMPI’s desire for an electoral bond with the United Democratic Front (UDF) is likely to be stronger this time. A three-cornered contest is unlikely in any of these sensitive panchayats, where the battle lines are clearly between the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the UDF. Talks on Discussions are in the final phase in the RMPI to retain all seats in its strongholds in an understanding with the UDF to take its fight to the LDF. For the parties, the results were tricky in the last elections in Onchiyam, the main battlefield of the RMPI. Neither the RMPI nor the LDF nor the UDF got a clear mandate. The RMPI won six seats, LDF seven, and the UDF four in the 17-member grama panchayat. With the support of the UDF, the RMPI got the posts of president and vice president in the panchayat. CPI(M) unperturbed At the same time, the CPI(M) is not unduly worried. It believes that the RMPI is losing ground, citing the latter’s performance in successive polls. The RMPI which won eight seats in 2010 got only six in 2015. It points to the last Assembly elections when the RMPI could not make much of an impact in any of the 11 seats it contested after a heated campaign. The RMPI seeks to gain in the coming local body polls, given the allegations against the State government. It thinks anti-incumbency and diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case will stand it in good stead at the hustings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rmpi-still-packs-a-punch/article33044991.ece

Grama panchayats are now organising special camps to facilitate quick registration of eligible farmers and extend the benefits of the scheme to more people. On the inaugural day on Thursday, the Department distributed aid to 357 paddy field owners, who were part of the finalised list of 835 eligible applicants in the district. The Department has so far given Rs. 94,359 to selected beneficiaries. A proposal has been forwarded to the higher authorities for sanctioning additional amounts to process new applications. T.D. Meena, Deputy Director, Department of Agriculture, said the amount was given as a token of the State government’s consideration for paddy farmers. “It is not a big amount, but a royalty payment which was introduced for the first time in India for acknowledging the efforts of paddy farmers. People are happy to register their names,” she said. Many grama panchayats, including Velam, Kodiyathur, Mukkom, and Balussery, have conducted special camps to help farmers complete the registration process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-royalty-scheme-evokes-good-response-in-kozhikode/article33044913.ece

Palakkad remains the sole municipality in the State under the BJP reign. Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and former MP M.B. Rajesh released the chargesheet here on Thursday. The chargesheet has enumerated and underscored the failures of the BJP during its five-year tenure in Palakkad. The front cover of the document has two pictures depicting the waste issue and the issue of stray cows on roads in the municipality. T.K. Noushad, former MLA, said here that the chargesheet mentioned a dozen promises made by the ruling council at the time of the election. Range of issues “They have failed to implement all of them. Their failures range from ensuring drinking water in all houses, implementing scientific waste treatment, a permanent solution to stray dogs and cows, to scientific drainage system, student-only buses, and free university textbooks,” said Mr. Noushad. The LDF blamed the BJP for failing to finish the work under AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) project. “The failure of the ruling council was evident at the levelled municipal bus-stand and the broken municipal town hall. The bus-stand remains a plain ground, and the town hall remains uncompleted,” said Mr. Noushad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-chargesheet-against-bjp/article33045680.ece

07 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||197 new-generation courses for colleges||The government has sanctioned 197 new-generation interdisciplinary courses in State universities, government arts and science, and engineering colleges. Universities have been advised to introduce the courses this academic year and expedite preparation of curricula. Arts and science colleges have received most of the courses with 166 programmes being allotted to 152 institutions. Colleges affiliated to Calicut University have received the highest – 59, while those under Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala University and Kannur have been sanctioned 48, 30, and 15 respectively. Nineteen campus programmes have been sanctioned in eight universities, including Kerala Agricultural University. Twelve engineering programmes will be launched in eight government and aided colleges. Sources said the courses were a mixture of traditional, five-year integrated and new-generation programmes. While a six-member committee chaired by Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas had mooted the integrated and new-generation courses, the Higher Education Department had prepared another list of courses offered by global varsities. Both lists were collated and sent to universities and colleges. While accepting the selections made by universities, the government has allotted some traditional courses to relatively new colleges to enable them to seek NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council ) grading. The onus is now on the universities to frame curricula and conduct the examinations of the fresh programmes. No new posts No posts will be created for the newly sanctioned courses until 2025. Classes should be run with guest faculties until then. New programmes The new programmes include integrated courses in Political Science with International Relations, Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language), master’s degree in Economics and Data Science, World History, Econometrics, Physics with Computational and Nanoscience specialisation, Drug Chemistry, Science with specialisation in Artificial Intelligence, Physics with specialisation in Space Physics, Forensic Science and International Trade, degree courses in Psychology and Behavioural Science, Advertising Sales Management, Sports Management, and English and Media Studies. Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel said colleges graded highly by NAAC had been sanctioned two courses each. While courses were allotted largely on the basis of NAAC grading, the stipulation did not apply for government and SC/ST management-run colleges. Those government and aided colleges that received new courses earlier during the Left Democratic Front government’s rule have not been considered this time. He said the colleges run by the Nair Service Society were also not considered as none of them applied for new courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/197-new-generation-courses-for-colleges-in-state/article33044918.ece
07 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Challenging five years see local bodies setting new benchmarks||As local self-government institutions (LSGIs) in Kerala go to the polls in the first half of December, their history in the past five years will perhaps be marked for an unprecedented widening of their role and an increase in challenges, with local bodies being at the forefront of everything from post-disaster relief work to being the coordinating point for implementing almost every other programme of the various departments on the ground. That this is the scenario at a time when Janakeeyasoothranam (People’s Plan Campaign) is completing 25 years of its implementation is noteworthy, as this was one of the aims when the decentralisation programme was rolled out in 1996. More visibility Two major natural disasters and two health crises over the past three years have certainly played a catalysing role in the increased visibility of the work done by the State’s local bodies, which were at one time associated just with local civic works and waste management. When the unprecedented floods hit Kerala in 2018, local bodies across the State swung into action, even though they were never seen as key elements in disaster management. In coordinating local rescue efforts to being the coordinating point of collecting and transporting relief material, local body administrations lent help to areas much farther from their limited geographic spreads. Some of them even sent squads to clean up houses and public spaces and provide medical help in other districts. By the time another major flood happened in 2019, this had become a standard expectation and many of the local bodies upped their game. After the Nipah outbreak in 2018, local bodies in the affected areas initiated grassroots-level awareness campaigns and contact tracing, which aided much in arresting the spread of the virus as well as the fear around the same. But, it was after the outbreak of COVID-19 that they played a much wider role, with the use of their network of health staff for contract tracing, in keeping track of quarantined people and in the setting up of community kitchens across the State. Key role When the State government announced the Subhiksha Keralam project to ensure self-sustainability in vegetable production, it was the local bodies which worked with the Agriculture Department to identify and prepare several hectares of land for cultivation. The local bodies have also played a key role in implementing the government's flagship projects including the LIFE Mission, the Haritha Keralam Mission’s river rejuvenation and mini-forests project and in the Health Department’s palliative care projects. “In the early years of the People’s Plan, there was some kind of energy visible on the ground. Then, a kind of lull set in, with the plan being prepared only by October or so and at least 50% of the plan implementation happening in the last two months of the year. Since 2017-18, the annual plan has been prepared in the previous year and the local bodies are now getting an entire year to implement. This has also resulted in more innovative projects being proposed from various local bodies, touching upon various spheres of life,” says Planning Board member K.N. Harilal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/challenging-five-years-see-local-bodies-setting-new-benchmarks/article33044987.ece

07 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI flays ‘extrajudicial’ killings of Maoists||The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Thursday blamed the State police for the “wanton and recurrent” killing of Maoists in Kerala. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the law enforcement spilt the blood of Maoists to claim Central funds for combating armed insurgency. The role of the police was to identify Maoists, gather evidence against them, and arrest the insurgents. The government should not allow the police to act as judge and executioner. The CPI State Council adopted a resolution urging the government to rein in special police forces operating with unbridled freedom against Maoists in the forests of north Kerala. Mr. Rajendran said the shooting of Maoist Velmurugan in Wayanad recently had all the markings of an extrajudicial killing. None of the Thunderbolt commandos involved in the ‘encounter’ had sustained any injuries. Elected representatives who visited the locality learned from local people and other sources that Velmurgan had not fired his weapon. Magisterial inquiry Mr. Rajendran demanded that the government hold a magisterial inquiry into the incident and asked the administration make public the findings of magisterial inquiries into earlier Maoist killings. Maoists posed no threat to Kerala. The CPI was against Left-wing extremism and armed insurgency. However, it did not believe that eliminating Maoists in cold blood was a solution. The Left was in power in Kerala. The deliberate killing of Maoists would only serve to erode its political stature. Kerala did not face Left extremism on the scale perhaps witnessed in Chhattisgarh or Jharkhand, the CPI said.

07 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State seeks to redefine modern-day parenting||The State has rolled out a parenting campaign 'Namukku valaram, nannayi valartham’ to redefine parenting in modern times. An initiative of the Women and Child Development Department, the campaign urges parents, teachers, and society to ‘grow up’ for healthy upbringing of children. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a Facebook post on Friday, said problems in families and in schools had an impact on children’s mental health. Issues created by parents’ actions or words or lack of attention should not be ignored. The aim is to help parents with parenting. The campaign comes after a survey conducted by the department among 70,000 parents to understand their approach to parenting and the problems they perceived that their children faced. The findings of the survey were factored in while deciding what areas to focus on and for framing various messages as part of the campaign, which addresses various issues such as body shaming, alcohol and drug abuse, depression, academic pressures, cartoon and internet addiction. Kick-started with a series of social media posters, the campaign helps plant positive thoughts in children. It also inculcates values such as gender equality and mutual respect by catching them young. The next phase of the campaign will focus on mass media and include videos featuring film actors. Shirt films and documentaries are also planned. Later, anganwadi and ASHA workers will go the field to directly interact with parents and distribute an illustrated handbook on parenting. After six months, another survey will be conducted to gauge any changes. Women and Child Development Director Anupama T.V. said field-level activities such as parenting sessions in anganwadis that were planned as part of Karuthal Sparsham, the responsible parenting campaign launched by the government last year, could not be taken up owing to COVID-19. However, as problems faced by children kept on increasing, the field-level component of Karuthal Sparsham was transformed into a mass and social media campaign. The campaign material prepared earlier was adapted to posters and the like targeted at mass and social media. The parenting campaign was not new; however, the period from October 11 to November 11, was an intensive campaign period under 'Namukku valaram, nannayi valartham,’ Ms. Anupama said.  Problems in families and in schools have an impact on children’s mental health.

The dog bit the three-year-old girl and four-year-old boy on their face and hands. Both of them have been admitted to hospital and were administered anti-rabies injections. Both the children are out of danger. Municipal Commissioner PVVS Murthy said the civic staff immediately caught hold of the dog and culled it. The dog was, however, not rabid, he claimed. Meanwhile, a special drive has been launched to catch stray dogs in areas where they are troubling people and leave them in the nearby jungle. All these dogs had been caught by an expert team from Tirupati and operated upon as per the specifications, but to the availability of food thrown on the streets, these dogs were surviving in the colonies and turning ferocious, he said. Animal rights organisations had been opposing the culling of dogs and also leaving them in the jungles, and the municipal corporation was looking for alternatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stray-dog-bites-two-children/article33044739.ece

The rise in instances of red sanders smuggling in the district after the lockdown was lifted made the worried police focus on old-timers in the profession, which apparently led to the arrest. Though the department is tight-lipped, he was reportedly picked up from Bengaluru in the early hours of the day. In fact, the nabbing of the criminal was believed to be the result of the accident occurred near the airport a couple of days ago, in which a red sanders-laden SUV collided with a tipper. Though the precious logs were reduced to ashes and four persons in the vehicle perished, the inmates of the accompanying escort vehicle survived on treatment. It is believed that the vital clues from the survivors led the police trail to the hardcore offender, who was reportedly picked up from Bengaluru. A habitual offender, Basha Bhai, has several cases on him in the district and was arrested many times in the last three years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wanted-red-sanders-smuggler-nabbed/article33045673.ece

I have found that the complaint was true and I have returned her the solid waste that was thrown by her on the road, with a warning of penalising her if she repeats the same practice,” Mr. Swapnil told The Hindu . On Thursday, another resident in the city was given back the solid waste which he threw on the road near the Seven Hills road area. “We call it a return gift, an initiative that throws light on the need for residents to cooperate with the sanitation staff.

The workers raised slogans protesting against the “'undue delay” in taking up of a major development project approved by the Union Cabinet and also the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, to benefit the backward south coastal Andhra Pradesh at the time of bifurcation in 2014. It was unfortunate that both the present governments at the Centre and in the State were trying to scuttle the project with an alleged “ulterior motive” to favour some private players operating in its vicinity and putting paid to the hopes of unemployed youth in Sullurpeta, Naidupeta, Gudur and adjoining areas, said Congress leaders Poola Chandrasekhar, Panta Srinivasulu Reddy, Vemaiah, Ramanaiah who led the protest. When 14 ports could function in Gujarat, why the maritime State of Andhra Pradesh should not have 10 ports in its over 1,000-km coastline, they asked.

Appalaraju on Friday said milk procurement under the AP-Amul Milk project will start from November 20 in Prakasam, Chittoor and Kadapa districts. At a press conference, the Minister said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would distribute cheques to dairy farmers on November 25. He said the government had signed an MoU with Amul to encourage milk cooperative societies, specifically those run by women, and also to develop the dairy sector. The objective was to infuse confidence among dairy farmers and their economic and social empowerment. Mini dairies The State stands fourth place in the country in milk production with a daily production of about 4 crore litres. He said nearly 5.6 lakh women, who had received financial assistance under the YSR Cheyutha scheme, had said they would set up mini dairies in their villages for which the government had supplied them cattle and buffaloes. These mini dairies were expected to contribute an additional 22 lakh litres of milk production, he said. The Minister said there was a proposal to develop infrastructure such as establishment of Bulk Milk Cooling Units (BMCU) and Milk Collection Centres (MCC) in Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) at a cost of Rs. 1,362 crore in a phased manner. In the first phase, around 7,121 MCCs and 2,774 BMCUs would be established while 3,639 and 3,486 BMCUs would be set up in the second and third phases respectively with additional MCCs. There was also a plan to develop RBKs into Milk Potential RBKs, he added. “Amul will collect milk from around 550 villages in Prakasam, Chittoor and Kapada districts, and Prakasam district alone will contribute around 56,000 litres of milk,” he said. Stating that efforts were aimed at bringing majority of the unorganised dairy units into the organised sector by encouraging cooperative societies and women farmers, the Minister said the tie-up with Amul would usher in all-round growth of the dairy sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/procurement-under-ap-amul-milk-project-from-nov-20-minister/article33045721.ece

Under GO.131 issued by the Home Department on Thursday, of the 147 women life convicts in the State, 27 housed in the Special Prison for Women in Kadapa, 21 in the Rajamahendravaram Special Prison for Women, five from Central Prison Nellore and two women prisoners of Central Prison, Visakhapatnam, would be released on special remission, Ms. Sucharita said. Addressing newsmen here on Friday, she said in a first of its kind in the country, the State government had decided to grant premature release (special remission) to the women life convicts, who had completed five years of sentence, and based on the recommendations made by the high-level committee. Important role The government had taken the decision as women were the most important in the family structure and their absence disturbed the entire family. Once they were released, the whole family was taken care of. “In Indian culture, family has high respect and women plays a key role in the family. Releasing women from the jails would be more beneficial for the welfare of society. Most of the convicts to be granted special remission acquired a degree in B.A. or appeared for final year examinations through distance education. Besides, they were trained in embroidery, triloring, embroidery, coir mats making and other courses,” the Home Minister said. The women convicts would be released in a week after scrutiny, Ms. Sucharita added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/55-women-life-convicts-to-be-granted-special-remission/article33045669.ece

He sought approval of the revised cost of the project as recommended by the Polavaram Project Authority, Central Water Commission and the revised cost committee of Ministry of Jal Shakti.

Ramana and some judges of the Andhra Pradesh High Court at the earliest, through the in-house mechanism as per the extant rules and conventions, and requesting him to take remedial action that may be required.

Addressing the workers, CITU city general secretary M. Jaggu Naidu alleged that the Centre was planning to privatise BPCL and to sell its stake in the IOC. He said that HPCL was already merged with ONGC and the latter was made to raise funds in this regard. He alleged that the Centre was now planning to privatise ONGC on the plea that it has run into debts. The CITU leader said that the public sector oil companies were contributing thousands of crores of rupees to the government in the form of taxes besides providing employment to youth. They have stood as the backbone of the economy of the nation. They were providing their CSR funds to the tune of several crores for the development of various projects in Visakhapatnam city. The privatisation of oil companies would result in a steep hike in petrol/diesel prices and it would have a cascading effect on the prices of all essential commodities. He alleged that the Modi government was planning to handover the public sector oil companies to corporate groups like Ambanis. He called upon all sections of the people to raise their voice against the ‘anti-worker’ and ‘anti-people’ policies of the government. The Centre had converted 44 labour laws into four labour codes in a bid to deprive workers of their rights, he alleged. CITU Malkapuram Zone leaders P. Pydiraju, R. Lakshmana Murthy and K. Penta Rao participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anti-worker-policies-of-centre-should-go-citu/article33045728.ece

The teams have conducted inspections of several food zones since October 16 to check how far the managements are following safety precautions in the pandemic.

The restaurants were instructed to get their staff tested and obtain a physical fitness certificate. The staff should wear masks, gloves, head-caps and aprons while on duty, and tables should be sanitised at regular intervals. The restaurants were instructed to also observe distancing while seating customers, and to avoid overcrowding. “Apart from these, the restaurants should check the temperatures of each guest and provide hand sanitizers. They should also maintain a register and note the details of customers. However, a number of rules are not being followed at many restaurants,” he said.

Demanding immediate scrapping of the VRS proposal for the steel plant employees, CPI(M) Greater Visakha City Committee secretary B. Ganga Rao sought that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy write a letter to the Centre, opposing the proposal. The CPI(M) leader noted in a statement on Friday that a circular was issued to the employees on November 5 stating that those who have completed 40 years of age and 15 years of service were eligible for VRS. “The Modi government has already decided to hand over thousands of acres of land, belonging to the VSP, to POSCO. The present move is intended to reduce the number of employees to pave the way for handing over of the plant to the South Korean firm. The failure of the Chief Minister to disclose the details of the meeting he had with representatives of POSCO in Vijayawada recently, indicates that the State government is also in favour of the proposal,” Mr. Ganga Rao alleged, adding that the TDP should also raise its voice against the VRS proposal. The capacity of VSP was enhanced to 7.3 million tonnes recently and there is scope for raising it further to 11 million tonnes. At present, there are around 18,000 permanent and an additional 15,000 contract employees working in VSP. A notification was issued by the plant management recently for the recruitment of 188 Management Trainees and another notification for Junior Trainee/Operator posts is expected to be released soon. The announcement of VRS at this juncture indicates that VSP is going to be handed over to POSCO, Mr. Ganga Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vrs-for-steel-plant-staff-a-ploy-by-centre-alleges-cpim/article33045726.ece

07 November 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tribal varsity to be fully ready in two years: V-C||Central Tribal University of Andhra Pradesh (CTUAP) will be a full-fledged institution in two years, according to its Vice-Chancellor T.V. Kattimani. He hopes the State government will finalise site for the varsity as early as possible as Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is keen on having it the tribal belt of Vizianagaram district. Speaking to The Hindu, the Vice-Chancellor said a team from Centre recently visited Kottaki village of Saluru Assembly constituency (Reserved for Scheduled Tribes) to study feasibility as the AP government is not keen on Relli village of Kothavalasa mandal where the university was proposed during the TDP regime. At present, CTUAP has been functioning from Andhra University buildings, Vizianagaram, by offering six different courses for both tribals and non-tribal students. Dr. Kattimani, who previously worked as Vice-Chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak of Madhya Pradesh, said that CTUAP would be developed to meet the national standards while ensuring higher education for all students apart from the tribal youth. “IGNTU-Madhya Pradesh, which started its journey with nearly 500 students in 2014, now offers higher education to nearly 6,000 students. All the departments have full-fledged faculty, laboratories and other facilities.

07 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Order probe into flood relief ‘scam’: Uttam to Governor||Alleging that TRS was ‘buying’ votes for GHMC polls using public money, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy asked what was the reason behind distributing cash rather than giving beneficiaries cheques or money online. Mr. Reddy, who spoke to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan over the phone on Friday, demanded her to order a high-level probe into the irregularities in distribution of flood relief in Greater Hyderabad. He pointed out several instances of misappropriation of funds meant for distribution among people and described the entire operation as ‘open loot in broad daylight’ by the ruling TRS. Distribution of cash itself is against the norms and that too by TRS activists with pink scarves than the officials concerned, he said. The TPCC chief pointed out that the State government issued a GO on October 19 sanctioning Rs. 550 crore towards distribution of flood relief. However, of the Rs. 550 crore sanctioned amount, the government withdrew Rs. 387 crore in cash and it was distributed through TRS cadre,” he said. At many places, TRS cadre took up to Rs. 5,000 commission to distribute Rs. 10,000. Citing several irregularities, he said locals were deprived while those from outside were given money. People on third floor got money while those living on ground and first floor were denied. Somesh also blamed The TPCC president said that they have a list of officers who had withdrawn the money and even Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar would not be spared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uttam-asks-governor-to-order-probe-into-flood-relief-scam/article33045547.ece
07 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS on a roll, attracts big investments||For Telangana, Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) announcement that Hyderabad will be the second AWS region in India and host a set of data centres marks a new high in the State’s efforts at attracting investments. The estimated capital investment of $2.77 billion (Rs. 20,761 crore) AWS will make to establish the data centres is not only the largest FDI in the State thus far, but also a pointer to the ecosystem Telangana has nurtured to act as magnets for such investments. Hyderabad on top Industries and IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said AWS had also evaluated a few other States, but chose Telangana as “we were offering the best” and more importantly, Hyderabad scored high in terms of how well the data centres will be utilised. “They were more confident of the off-take of the data centre in Hyderabad since [core customers] e-commerce, banking, insurance [firms] were deeply entrenched,” he said. The three data centres, or Availability Zones as AWS calls them, will come up on 132 acres on the outskirts of Hyderabad. India’s Data Protection Act, especially data localisation norms, as well as business opportunity that the National Digital Health Mission and the government’s cloud strategy will open up are larger contextual factors accelerating the decision on setting up of such data centres. For e-commerce giant Amazon, the latest decision builds on its engagement with the State in the past few years, the most prominent of them being setting up of a 3-million sq.ft. campus building on 9.5 acres in Hyderabad, its single largest building globally. AWS announcement is the biggest and forms part of a series of such investment commitments and facility opening by a clutch of companies across industries in the State of late. Figuring in the list are Welspun group, Medtronics, Goldman Sachs, drugmakers Granules and Laurus Labs, EV makers and RE firms Mytrah, Olectra, Eto; as well as the homegrown Medha Group.  Mr.Ranjan said it is a continuous process since “many of these investments decision are taken over a period of time.” On whether COVID-19 was a factor that influenced the company’s decision on investment, he said it did impact but “temporarily in the initial days.” But in some sectors such as pharma, the pandemic also accelerated the firm’s decision. Did the drop in the Ease of Doing Business ranking prompt the State to push the envelope, he said companies are increasingly realising that more than rankings what matters is whether the government stands by investors post investment like Telangana, handholding them and addressing issues at every stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-on-a-roll-attracts-big-names-investments/article33045519.ece

An extent of one acre and 34 gunta land that was sold to one K. Jagadish in August 2019 by a PA Pally resident Vijayalakshmi remained unmutated — change of ownership not effected in records. And, recently, in the ongoing digital registration through Dharani, seller of the land Vijayalakshmi registered the same property in favour of her daughter Priyanka. The issue came to light after Mr. Jagadish, who had already started a venture and was selling plots on it, along with the plot owners protested outside an office here. The protest and subsequent inquiry also exposed another violation. District Collector Prashant J. Patil, explaining the case to media persons at his office on Friday, said the one-acre-34-gunta land was an agricultural land before 2016 and despite its conversion to non-agricultural use, the Revenue staff of P.A. Pally had issued a pattadar passbook to the owner. Mr. Patil said the then surveyor and VRO were immediately placed on suspension for the violation, and the tahsildar who had issued the pattadar passbook, who had since retired from service, was summoned. The Collector has also recommended to the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration to initiate action against the retired tahsildar. Superintendent of Police A.V. Ranganath said Ms. Vijayalakshmi initiated the online transfer of registration of the already sold land hiding the fact from the registering authorities. She was booked for cheating and remanded to judicial custody, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/woman-registers-already-sold-land-in-daughters-name/article33045702.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A deceptively engaging thriller||Gatham came as a surprise. There was no publicity drive and even those in the media came to know about the Telugu film barely a few days before it began streaming on Amazon Prime Video. An independent project by a group of Indian origin film buffs living in the United States, it was pitched as a psychological thriller.  Gatham opens with an aerial view of a snow-covered terrain in which two people scurry for their lives, only to succumb. Within minutes there are other snapshots of crime, following which one of the primary characters, Rishi (Rakesh Galebhe, whose voice and diction is similar to Vijay Deverakonda) wakes up in a hospital and is told that he has suffered brain damage and memory loss. Rishi cannot remember the woman who is supposedly his girlfriend (Poojitha); they remain cordial but emotionally distant to each other, given the circumstances they are in.  Gatham begins to plod along familiar tropes of a psychological crime thriller. After a car breakdown, when the couple find themselves cornered in a secluded house with a father and son who display psychopath traits, it looks like yet another cold and lifeless thriller of trapped people desperately trying to escape. Only Sricharan Pakala’s background score managed to pique some interest. You might give up on the film in the first 30 minutes, especially when the father (Bhargava Poludasu) says an utterly cringe-inducing line. But soon, Gatham slowly pulls the rug from under the viewers’ feet to reveal its true colours. You know that something is amiss in the way new characters pop-up and the conversations are staged, punctuated with memory flashes of women being in trouble. With no memory of the past, Rishi is as much in the dark as anyone viewing the film.  Gatham then turns the tables and makes us look at the character afresh, which isn’t entirely unexpected. But there’s an earnestness in its storytelling. Even when the later portions basically work as a recap to put things in perspective, it sustains interest because this indie-spirited film is sure about its narrative style. There are misgivings, like the investigation by the cops never adding up to anything concrete in the plot or every other person turning out to be Telugu-speaking in the US. Yet, Gatham plays out like a short story neatly being woven into place to pin down the culprit. To discuss anything more about the storyline would mean revealing spoilers. Barring Bhargava Poludasu who is impressive, the acting all around is just about adequate and there are no frills in production, given the shoestring budget.    Gatham has a runtime of an hour and 44 minutes, and comes from a team that knows to narrate a story. At the end of the day, that matters a great deal.

Swamy files plea to allow use of straw, sipper||Father Stan Swamy, 83, on Friday filed an application before the special court seeking that he be allowed the use of a straw and sipper in Taloja Central Jail as he cannot hold a glass because of he has Parkinson’s disease. The prosecution has sought 20 days to file a reply and the matter will be heard on November 26. Father Swamy is an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case and is now in the prison hospital. He was arrested by the National Investigation Agency on October 8 from his residence in Ranchi and brought to Mumbai the next day. He is a Jesuit priest and activist working with tribal people. The agency did not seek for his police custody and he was remanded in judicial custody from October 9. On October 22, his medical bail was rejected by special judge Dinesh E. Kothalikar, who relied on the directions of the high powered committee constituted to release undertrial prisoners during COVID-19. Judge Kothalikar said, “The accused (Father Swamy) is involved in commission of offence punishable under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act cannot be said to be entitled for interim bail.” Father Swamy’s medical plea was sought on the grounds that he has been suffering from Parkinson’s disease and has almost lost hearing ability in both ears. He has fallen in jail multiple times and has been operated for hernia twice and still has pain in his lower abdomen. He also needs to be protected from COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fr-swamy-files-plea-to-allow-use-of-straw-sipper/article33044963.ece

During the hearing on Friday, the commission asked him to produce all material documents, including the court order of the reopening of the case, for the next hearing. The MHRC has also asked for a certified copy of the magistrate’s case reopening orders from the Raigad SP. The commission took cognisance of the case after a lawyer, Aditya Mishra, filed a complaint alleging human rights violation pertaining to Mr. Goswami, who was arrested by the Raigad Police after hours of drama at his residence in an abetment to suicide case. MHRC member M.A. Sayyed on Thursday issued a notice to Ashok Dudhe, SP, Raigad, and ordered him to appear at its office on Friday morning with the records pertaining to the arrest of Mr. Goswami.

07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Daily COVID-19 cases in Delhi cross 7,000 mark for first time||The Capital recorded its highest number of daily COVID-19 cases on Friday since the pandemic began, with 7,178 new cases being recorded in 24 hours, a Delhi government health bulletin said. This was the first time that the number of cases has crossed the 7,000 mark. The total number of cases in Delhi stands at 4,23,831, with 6,833 deaths and 3,77,276 recoveries. The bulletin said that 64 deaths and 6,121 recoveries were also reported during the same period. The government also conducted 58,860 tests with a positivity rate of 12.19%. There are 39,722 active cases in the city and 3,754 containment zones at present. The cumulative positivity rate is 8.49% and the case fatality rate 1.61%. Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that to deal with the rising number of cases, the Delhi government has decided to augment the availability of 685 beds for COVID-19 patients in 14 private hospitals. This takes the total number of beds in these private hospitals from 1,756 to 2,441, which is 50% of the capacity of these hospitals. There are currently 23,679 patients under home isolation and out of 15,781 hospital beds available in the Capital, 8,253 are vacant. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday urged the people of Delhi to consider their masks as a vaccine for the virus till an actual vaccine is here. “What we are facing currently is the third wave. To fight the virus, the only protocol to follow is wearing your mask. Till the time we have a vaccine, consider your mask as the vaccine. There is no other way to fight this virus ,” he also said. He also expressed confidence in the Capital’s fight against the third wave of COVID-19. The Chief Minister was speaking at the foundation-laying ceremony for the redevelopment of Rohtak Road.“It was a request long due from the people living in the area, and ones travelling on it to get the road reconstructed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/daily-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-cross-7000-mark-for-first-time/article33044951.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi govt. plea to SC to vacate stay on reserving COVID-19 beds||The Delhi government on Friday appealed to the Supreme Court to lift a High Court stay of its direction to 33 hospitals to reserve 80% of their Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds to treat COVID-19 patients. “As a result of this proactive intervention, almost 500 patients were able to secure admission in ICU beds of these private nursing homes and hospitals. The rate chargeable for these beds have also been capped by the government in the interest of the public,” the Delhi government petition, filed through advocate Chirag M. Shroff, contended in the apex court. The Health and Family Welfare department of the Delhi government had, on September 12, ordered these choice hospitals reserve substantially more ICU/HDU beds for COVID patients owing to the rising graph of infections. A single judge of the High Court however, on September 22 stayed the government order on a petition filed by Association of Healthcare Providers (India), which said the order would deprive non-COVID patients of urgent medical care. Amid rising cases A Division Bench of the High Court, instead of lifting the stay, merely adjourned the case to late November. “The Division Bench has failed to take judicial notice of the COVID-19 pandemic and the steadily rising graph of infections. Delhi has always been the preferred location for seeking medical treatment by patients even from neighbouring and other States,” the government appeal said. The government said the HC failed to appreciate that the petition filed against the September 12 order was nothing but a cloaked attempt by certain hospital managements to guard their own financial interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-govt-plea-to-sc-to-vacate-stay-on-reserving-covid-19-beds/article33044956.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Audit of DU colleges reveals irregularities: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said that a special audit of five Delhi University colleges funded by the Delhi government reveals serious financial irregularities and violations of UGC norms and that the government was considering initiating legal proceedings based on the report. “Despite showing a surplus of crores, the salary of teachers and staffers has not been released. This comes after the colleges have repeatedly alleged that the Delhi government was withholding funds,” Mr. Sisodia said. He said that the special audit, when initiated, was obstructed by the colleges by resisting to show their accounts books to the audit officers. The books were only shown when the High Court intervened and directed the colleges. “Two major issues have emerged in the special audit — unauthorised payments by the college, and surplus funds being stashed by the colleges,” said Mr. Sisodia. The colleges that were audited on the order of the court are Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Shaheed Sukhdev College, Bhagini Nivedita College, and Maharishi Valmiki college. Two colleges, Aditi Mahavidyalaya and Lakshmibai College, refused to allow the audit to be carried despite the order. Mr. Sisodia said that according to the ‘pattern of assistance” by which the Delhi govt. makes payment to all the higher education institutions funded by it is based on the principle of deficit funding. “The govt. pays these higher education institutions the net deficit between their total expenditure, and their total income,” he said. He added that these colleges violated this pattern of assistance as large, undeclared incomes in their accounts have been found by the auditors, which were never declared to the government and the colleges kept taking funding from the government on false premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/audit-of-du-colleges-reveals-irregularities-sisodia/article33044947.ece

No meetings were conducted in March, April and May this year due to the pandemic situation. Mr. Kanth argued that if a councillor is not appearing for three such meetings, then that will invite action under the DMC Act.

Ministers Nawab Malik, Anil Parab and Amit Deshmukh — representing the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Shiv Sena and the Congress respectively — formally handed the list to Mr. Koshyari. According to sources, the NCP has nominated estranged former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, who recently entered the NCP fold, as well as Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti. The other two NCP nominees are Yashpal Bhinge and noted singer Anand Shinde. The Sena has nominated actor Urmila Matondkar, Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, Vijay Karanjkar and Nitin Bangude Patil. Congress’s nominees The Congress has put forth the names of its spokesperson Sachin Sawant, former MP Rajni Patil, Muzaffar Hussain and noted artiste Aniruddha Vankar, an influential figure in the Ambedkarite movement from the Vidarbha region. Earlier, the three parties had reached an agreement that they would nominate four names each and that the names would be submitted in separate sealed envelopes to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. While the term of legislators (from the Governor’s quota) to the Upper House of the State Legislature had expired in June this year, the three MVA partners had deferred sending its list of nominees to avoid friction with the Governor owing to the raging COVID-19 situation. Mr. Thackeray and the MVA has already had much-publicised run-ins with the Governor.

07 November 2020||Washington,||House Democrats take stock after losses||Their majority shrunk, House Democrats cast blame on Thursday on their election message, ground game and leadership under Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s team after expectations for big wins came crashing down by a stark reversal in Trump country. They focused too narrowly on health care, when voters were also worried about the economy. They failed to fight back when Republicans labelled them “socialists” aligned with the party’s most liberal firebrands. They didn’t knock on doors to meet voters, focusing instead on phone calls, digital outreach and TV ads, due to the health risks of campaigning during the pandemic. They lost Latino voters in some places, and white, working class men in others. They did not pass more COVID aid through Congress when Americans needed help most. And perhaps most importantly, Democrats are coming to grips with the fact that whether President Donald Trump is e-elected or defeated by rival Joe Biden, they still have a problem winning over Trump voters. Campaign failure Lawmakers unloaded during a caucus call on Thursday — Democratic freshman Rep. Abigail Spanberger, in a so-tight race in Virginia, spoke with “passion” about the party’s campaign failures, according to a person familiar with the private call and granted anonymity to discuss it. The marathon call ran three hours, with some 30 members adding their views. No one spoke against Ms. Pelosi, who tried to remind them, they did, in fact, win — Mr. Biden is on the verge of replacing Mr. Trump, and House Democrats are on track to keep their majority, according to another person familiar with the call and granted anonymity to discuss it. “We did not win every battle but we did win the war,” Ms. Pelosi said. But there were plenty of complaints to go around — over faulty polling, Republican attack ads — as expectations had been raised sky high for election night gains and that made the setbacks all the more disorienting. Rather than bolstering their majority, as planned, Democrats lost a handful of freshman lawmakers who had just won in a 2018 midterm election backlash against the President. They also failed to add to their ranks as Republicans defeated one Democratic challenger after another. Asked what went wrong, one Democratic strategist said- “All of the above.” Money was the one thing on their side. But money alone was not enough. Key Democrats said the GOP attacks against them as wild-eyed “socialists” are damaging. They cited the “defund the police” movement that calls for shifting law enforcement resources to social workers and other ways of revolving conflicts. It gained prominence last summer after the police killing of Black people, including George Floyd, sparked a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice. Democrats also were criticised this year as insufficiently supporting Israel because of a liberal proposals helping Palestinians. Socialist label “I think that the Democratic party needs to clearly push that we are not supportive of ideas like socialism or defunding the police or anti-Semitism,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy. Several Democrats said the “socialist” label particularly harmed lawmakers who lost seats in Florida .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/house-democrats-take-stock-after-losses/article33044660.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Counties worst-hit by virus voted for Trump||U.S. voters went to the polls starkly divided on how they see President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. But in places where the virus is most rampant now, Mr. Trump enjoyed enormous support. An Associated Press analysis reveals that in 376 counties with the highest number of new cases per capita, the overwhelming majority — 93% of those counties — went for Mr. Trump, a rate above other less severely hit areas. Most were rural counties in Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin — the kinds of areas that often have lower rates of adherence to social distancing, mask-wearing and other public health measures, and have been a focal point for much of the latest surge in cases. Taking note of the contrast, State health officials are pausing for a moment of introspection. Even as they worry about rising numbers of hospitalisations and deaths, they hope to reframe their messages and aim for a reset on public sentiment now that the election is over. “Public health officials need to step back, listen to and understand the people who aren’t taking the same stance” on mask-wearing and other control measures, said Dr. Marcus Plescia of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “I think there’s the potential for things to get less charged and divisive,” he said. He added that there’s a chance a retooled public health message might unify Americans around lowering case counts so hospitals won’t get swamped during the winter months. The electoral divide comes amid an explosion in cases and hospitalisations in the U.S. and globally. The U.S. broke another record in the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases, hitting nearly 90,000. The tally for new cases Thursday was on track for another day above 1,00,000, with massive numbers reported all around the country, including a combined 25,000 in Texas, Illinois and Florida.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/counties-worst-hit-by-virus-voted-for-trump/article33044656.ece
07 November 2020||NEW YORK,||Presidential race exposes America’s ‘perilous’ divides||Presidential elections can be revealing moments that convey the wishes of the American people to the next wave of elected officials. So far, the big reveal in the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is the extent of the cavernous divide between Republican and Democratic America, one that defines the nation, no matter which candidate ultimately wins. Voters from both parties turned out in droves to pick the next President, but as they did so, they found little agreement about what that President should do. Democrats and Republicans prioritised different issues, lived in different communities and even voted on different kinds of ballots. Whoever emerges as the winner, that division ensures that the next President will face significant gridlock in Congress, scepticism about the integrity of the vote and an agitated electorate increasingly divided by race, education and geography. Even the vote count threatens to split Americans. "Except for the Civil War, I don’t think we’ve lived through any time as perilous as this in terms of the divisions,” said historian Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. Even after the 2000 election, when the Supreme Court ultimately intervened on Republican George W. Bush’s behalf, Democrat Al Gore quickly conceded and congressional leaders found areas of agreement on Capitol Hill. The yawning divides will threaten the next President’s ability to manage multiple crises — daily coronavirus infections set a record this week, the economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic and many Americans are pressing for a reckoning on racial injustices. Trump and Biden voters, however, express strikingly different views on those challenges, according to AP VoteCast. Biden voters overwhelming say they want the federal government to prioritise limiting the spread of the virus, even if that means further damage to the economy. But most Trump voters preferred an approach that focused on the economy. About half of Trump voters also called the economy and jobs the top issue, while only 1 in 10 Biden voters named it most important. To bridge the gap Mr. Biden has tried to bridge this gap, often appealing to a sense of national unity and the “soul” of America. Mr. Trump often casts himself as a defender of his voters. He has threatened to withhold pandemic-related aid from States run by Democratic Governors and disparaged cities run by Democrats. Many Democrats desperately hoped that Mr. Trump would suffer an embarrassing defeat that would serve as a clear repudiation of Mr. Trump and his brand of politics. At the very least, they wanted an unambiguous mandate that would allow Mr. Biden to pursue ambitious policies on health care, education and the economy. Mr. Trump may lose, but strong GOP turnout in battlegrounds and unexpectedly solid victories for Republican candidates in Senate and House races made Tuesday far from a thumping. “There’s certainly not a clarion call to go in one direction or another. There’s a lot of confusion and chaos,” said civil rights leader Martin Luther King II.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/presidential-race-exposes-americas-perilous-divides/article33044662.ece
07 November 2020||Washington,||Trump claims the election is being ‘stolen’ from him||U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed that the election was being “stolen” from him. Mr. Trump, 74, has sought to portray as fraudulent the slow counting of mail-in ballots, which surged in popularity due to fears of exposure to the coronavirus through in-person voting. As counts from those ballots have been tallied, they have eroded the initial strong leads the President had in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. States have historically taken time after Election Day to tally all votes. The close election has underscored the nation’s deep political divides, and if he wins Mr. Biden will likely face a difficult task governing in a deeply polarised Washington. Republicans could keep control of the U.S. Senate pending the outcome of four undecided Senate races, including two in Georgia, and they would likely block large parts of his legislative agenda, including expanding healthcare and fighting climate change. Task ahead The winner will have to tackle a pandemic that has killed more than 2,34,000 people in the U.S. and left millions more out of work, even as the country still grapples with the aftermath of months of unrest over race relations and police brutality. Mr. Trump fired off several tweets in the early morning hours on Friday, and repeated some of the complaints he aired earlier at the White House. “I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST,” he said on Twitter, without offering any evidence that any illegal votes have been cast. Twitter flags post Twitter flagged the post as possibly misleading, something it has done to numerous posts by Mr. Trump since Election Day. In an extraordinary assault on the democratic process, Mr. Trump appeared in the White House briefing room on Thursday evening and alleged the election was being “stolen” from him. Mr. Trump lambasted election workers and sharply criticised polling before the election that he said was designed to suppress the vote because it favoured Mr. Biden. “They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen,” said Mr. Trump, who spoke in the White House briefing room but took no questions. Several TV networks cut away during his remarks, with anchors saying they needed to correct his statements. Mr. Biden, who earlier in the day urged patience as votes were counted, responded on Twitter: “No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.” Trump supporters, some carrying guns, ramped up their demonstrations against the process on Thursday night. In Arizona, Trump and Biden supporters briefly scuffled outside the Maricopa County Elections Department in Phoenix.  Weapon seized In Philadelphia, police said they arrested one man and seized a weapon as part of an investigation into a purported plot to attack the city’s Pennsylvania Convention Center, where votes were being counted. Mr. Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, pursued a flurry of lawsuits in several states, though judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly rejected challenges there. Legal experts said the cases had little chance of affecting the electoral outcome, and Biden campaign senior legal adviser Bob Bauer call them part of a “broader misinformation campaign.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-claims-the-election-is-being-stolen-from-him/article33044652.ece
07 November 2020||Addis Ababa,||Ethiopia PM says ‘clear, limited’ objectives to military operation||Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Friday that military operations launched in the northern region of Tigray had limited objectives, as concern mounts over a possible slide into war. “Operations by federal defence forces underway in northern Ethiopia have clear, limited and achievable objectives — to restore the rule of law and the constitutional order, and to safeguard the rights of Ethiopians to lead a peaceful life wherever they are in the country,” Mr. Abiy wrote on Twitter. His comments come after the military said on Wednesday it was at war with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) after months of tensions between Addis Ababa and the party whose leaders effectively ruled Ethiopia for three decades before Mr. Abiy took power. Mr. Abiy appeared to be seeking to play down the bellicose rhetoric, and responded to growing international calls for dialogue between the two sides. He said the government “patiently tried for several months to resolve differences with TPLF leadership peacefully; we tried mediation, reconciliation, dialogue. “All failed (because) of TPLF criminal hubris and intransigence. In the last straw TPLF attacked the Northern Command based in Tigray.” Mr. Abiy, the winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, announced Wednesday that he had ordered military operations in Tigray in response to an “attack” by the TPLF on a military camp there. The TPLF denies the attack occurred and accuses Mr. Abiy of concocting the story to justify deploying the military against the party. UN chief Antonio Guterres on Friday expressed deep alarm at the situation and urged de-escalation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ethiopia-pm-says-clear-limited-objectives-to-military-operation/article33044654.ece

In August, the 44-year-old anti-graft campaigner collapsed on a flight from Siberia to Moscow and was eventually transferred for treatment to Germany, where experts ruled he was poisoned. The Interior Ministry’s Siberian branch said doctors who treated Mr. Navalny for two days before he was flown to Berlin confirmed their diagnosis of “disruption of carbohydrate metabolism and chronic pancreatitis”.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||The price of saying ‘no’||At around 3:30 p.m. on October 26, Nikita Tomar — 20, studious and ambitious — stood outside the sprawling campus of Aggarwal College in Ballabgarh, soon after writing an exam, and waited for her brother to pick her up. Giving her company were two friends. Winter was just setting in and it was a pleasant day. But chilling events were to follow within minutes, captured in 23 seconds of closed-circuit television footage that later went viral on social media. Tausif, Nikita’s former schoolmate, and his friend and classmate, Rehan, are seen arriving in a Sedan. Tausif, just shy of 21 and his face covered in a white mask, tries to push Nikita into the car, but she manages to free herself from his clutches and hide behind her friend. Tausif pushes the friend aside and catches hold of Nikita. A brief struggle ensues. A man strolls past talking on the phone; another cycles down the road slowly. They see what’s going on, but don’t intervene. Suddenly, Tausif brings out a gun and shoots her point-blank. The bullet hits Nikita in the nape of her neck and she collapses to the ground. Nikita’s friend is transfixed, and then turns this way and that. A motorbike whizzes past, but doesn’t stop. Rehan runs towards Tausif and grabs him. Both of them, undergraduate students of physiotherapy at Gurugram University, make a dash for the vehicle, scramble into it, and drive away. Nikita’s grief-stricken father Moolchand Tomar says his daughter had told him that Tausif had called her a week before the incident. “She told me that he wanted her to convert and marry him. I promised that I would talk to his family about it and told her not to worry. But she did not reveal much. She may have been under a lot of pressure. I will never know. After the 2018 kidnapping incident, she did not want to trouble me any more by talking about him,” he says. Nikita Tomar’s murder has yet again shocked a nation where cases of stalking are common. However, the outrage this time hasn’t always centred on the safety of women in general. Citing this case, the Harayana government is mulling a law against ‘love jihad’, the communal slur used to target inter-faith relationships in which the man is Muslim.  An exam and a murder Tomar, 48, is seated on a mattress at a condolence meeting for Nikita on the street outside his Sector 23 Faridabad house in Haryana. On the wall behind him, plastered across a door and a window, is a large banner featuring Nikita’s photo and a lamp. It reads: ‘ Lado hum sharminda hain tere kaatil zinda hain. Haryana sarkaar hosh mein aao. Hatyaro ko phansi do (My dear, we are ashamed that your killers are still alive. Haryana government, come to your senses. Hang the killers). India wants justice for Nikita Tomar.’ Another banner across another window says Nikita was “shot dead by Tausif in broad daylight for refusing to convert and marry him”. Just beneath it, Nikita’s photograph with a garland around the frame is precariously balanced on a stool mounted on a grey plastic chair. The chair leans against a wall that has large patches of fresh plaster and fading paint. Tomar recalls the morning of that fateful day. He says he left for work around 7:30 a.m. Nikita, who had been preparing for the exam till around 2:30 a.m., was still asleep. “I called my wife around 8:30 a.m. She told me that Nikita was studying after taking a bath and eating breakfast. I didn’t want to disturb her, so I didn’t speak to her over the phone,” he says. Around noon, Nikita’s brother Naveen and mother Vijaywati dropped her at the examination centre, the Aggarwal College, and went shopping. Nikita’s uncle’s house was a stone’s throw away from the college. “Nikita came out of the college after the exam and called Naveen to come over and pick her up,” recounts Tomar. “A few minutes later, I got a call from her friend saying Nikita had been shot. Since I was far away, I asked my brother-in-law to rush there immediately. Something was terribly wrong, I told him.” Shattered dreams After Nikita was shot, some students picked her up and took her on a two-wheeler to Manavta Hospital, where she died during treatment. “By the time I reached the hospital, the staff told me that her body had been sent to Badshah Khan Hospital for post-mortem,” says Tomar, his voice cracking. “I could not even speak to her one last time.” The killer ruined their lives “in just 20 seconds,” he says. “All our dreams are shattered. All her certificates and medals are now useless. Her mother has not even gone to her room since the incident. Her clothes, books... everything reminds us of her. Her mother cannot face it,” he says. “ Hamare liye gudiya thi (She was our doll). She was a reserved and studious girl. She loved me the most. Nikita would hug me when I returned from work in the evening. Like a little child, she would share all the details of her day with me,” Tomar says, surrounded by neighbours and his father-in-law. A generation ago, the Tomars had shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Faridabad. Tomar sold the ancestral house a few years ago to borrow a loan and construct a new house, the one they live in now. As he wanted a good education for his children, he built the house near the main road where efficient transport facilities could take them to school quickly. “I ensured good education for them even if I had to go without food,” says Tomar. He recalls how Nikita was a motivated woman and always strived to excel. “Inspired by her maternal uncles and grandfather, she wanted to join the Army. Sometimes she dreamt of becoming a civil servant. She would often say that she would be so powerful one day that her orders would be final and binding on all.” Tomar hopes that a school or a college is named after Nikita who “laid down her life to protect her dignity”. Allegedly kidnapped earlier Nikita was around 17 years old when she first met Tausif, a resident of Gurugram’s Sohna. Tausif comes from a family of politicians in Nuh, located about 70 km from Delhi. Nikita and Tausif met while studying at the Rawal International School, Nangla, in Faridabad. Tausif was a year senior to her. Nikita was a day scholar and Tausif stayed in the hostel. Nikita’s family vehemently denies that she liked Tausif. “I have no clue how he entered my daughter’s life,” says Tomar. Tausif’s maternal uncle, Islamuddin, was arrested four years ago in connection with a spate of robberies across several States. He was also involved in the 2016 abduction of Inspector Surender Singh Phogat, who was then Station House Officer of Sector 29 police station. Phogat was kidnapped, robbed and dumped in Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. Islamuddin, lodged in Gurugram’s Bhondsi Jail, is now out on parole for a family function. Tausif’s step-cousin Aftab Ahmed, a former Haryana Transport Minister, is a Congress MLA from Nuh. His uncle Javed Ahmad has contested twice, albeit unsuccessfully, on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket from Sohna. The two families got involved in their teenaged children’s personal lives for the first time two years ago when Tausif allegedly kidnapped Nikita from outside Aggarwal College. The matter reached the police. The First Information Report of the incident, accessed by The Hindu , says Nikita was about to board an auto-rickshaw to her house on the evening of August 2, 2018, when Tausif kidnapped her. Nikita informed her friend Abhishek about it, who in turn called up her father. A case was registered under Section 365 of the Indian Penal Code at the Ballabgarh City police station. The Tomars were later forced to withdraw the complaint owing to social and political pressure and mediation by the police. Tomar recalls that he decided to do this after the two families had a meeting. He says he did not know the family before the incident. Nikita gave in writing to the police that she had gone with Tausif of her own volition and the FIR was quashed. “They (Tausif’s family) apologised to us. They assured us that this would not happen again. Also, a poor electrician like me could not stand up against a mighty family like that with a long political and criminal record. I am a man with limited means, whereas they have a lot of wealth. Besides, Nikita was a good student. I did not want her to go from court to court. It was a question of her life. In our society, we also need to think about the girl’s esteem,” says Tomar. For almost a year after the incident, Nikita’s mother and brother accompanied her every time she stepped out. Gradually, they put the incident behind them and normalcy returned. “Nikita was not on social media, so there was no question of anyone stalking her online. For almost two years after the incident, we never faced any problem from him (Tausif),” says Tomar. Tomar is now remorseful about closing that case. “I have regrets. But even if I am put in a similar situation today, what choice would I have? I cannot fight the bahubalis (musclemen),” he says. Three arrests Tausif, who was arrested a few hours after the incident, has no regrets, says the police. “It was a premeditated, cold-blooded murder,” says Faridabad Police Commissioner O.P. Singh. “The psychology behind it is the same as in most stalking incidents: Meri nahi to kisi ki nahi (If she is not mine, then she can’t be anyone else’s).” The 700-page charge-sheet citing 60 witnesses was filed in court on Friday. Though there is no evidence of Tausif stalking the girl after the 2018 kidnapping incident, mobile records show his location around the college on a couple of occasions a week before the murder. “He recced the area before the murder,” says Singh. Rehan was arrested a day after the incident. Azharuddin alias Azru was also arrested on charges of supplying the country-made pistol used in the murder. According to the police, Azru is a close acquaintance of Islamuddin. Tausif also knew Azru well. “We have a strong case against the accused with digital and forensic evidence and some eyewitnesses. The CCTV footage of the incident is the most clinching evidence. The weapon and the car used in the commission of the crime have also been recovered,” says Singh. Keeping in view the public outrage over the murder and the media attention, the Faridabad Police set up a Special Investigation Team, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Anil Kumar, to investigate the matter. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij announced that a fast-track court would be set up for day-to-day hearing and quick disposal of the case. The Faridabad Police have also moved the local court seeking to re-open the 2018 kidnapping case. Tausif’s family maintains that they don’t approve of the illegal act and the law must take its own course. Tausif’s mother claims that her son was a brilliant student who stood first in class. “After the 2018 incident, he never spoke to anyone in the family about the girl. He got admission into an MBBS course at a college in Bengaluru, but did not go. He did not want to go that far away for a course. He is very shy and docile. I don’t know why he did this,” she says. She claims that Tausif did not kidnap the girl and that Nikita went on her own with him and was taken back by her maternal uncle later. Political and communal colours The case of a Muslim man stalking and shooting a Hindu girl has also become a perfect recipe for communal flare-up in the region. Just a day after the incident, several Hindutva organisations, including the Karni Sena (the Tomars are Rajputs), started using the example of this case to once again talk about ‘love jihad’. For a few days, the victim’s house was used by various organisations to hold demonstrations and protests seeking justice for the girl. But in these events, the problem of stalking wasn’t the focus. One such demonstration was held by a group called the Sarv Biradari Sangathan on Dussehra Ground on November 1. Thousands participated in it. The crowd turned violent when around 200 young men, agitated over the turn of events at the panchayat, threw stones at shops and the police, and tried to block National Highway-44 (connecting New Delhi with Agra). Ten policemen were injured in the clash with the mob and 32 people were arrested. Investigation into the violence revealed that inflammatory and provocative messages were spread through Whatsapp groups and other social media platforms. As the prime accused in the case is related to Congress MLA Aftab Ahmed, the incident has also assumed political hues. The party’s State chief, Kumari Selja, allegedly encountered misbehaviour when she went to Nikita’s family’s house to offer her condolences. An FIR was filed in this connection on charges of misbehaviour, wrongful restraint, and criminal intimidation by Faridabad Municipal Corporation member Jaiveer Khatana. He later filed a counter FIR accusing Congress workers of resorting to violence against him during Selja’s visit. The problem of stalking Two-time Rashtriya Gaurav Gram Sabha Puraskar winner Sunil Jaglan, also known for the ‘Selfie With Daughter’ campaign, says stalking lies at the core of most cases of heinous crime against women, such as rape, murder and acid attacks. “It all begins with stalking, but mostly, the girl and her parents tend to ignore it. They either don’t take it seriously or prefer to keep mum for the sake of social prestige. In a conservative society like ours, reporting such cases leads to loss of social reputation for the victim more than the perpetrator,” says Jaglan, who is also an adviser in the Pranab Mukherjee Foundation. Working in Nuh on issues concerning women and girls, Jaglan says parents in the region do not send their daughters to schools that are located far away as they fear their daughters will be stalked. “If a girl tells her parents about being stalked, they tell her to quit school and sit at home,” says Jaglan. Stalking is not about religion, he says. Girls are stalked by boys from their own religion and village, too. The police don’t take stalking cases seriously till a more henious crime is committed, since most of the time the two parties reach a compromise, he says. Social media has made it easier to stalk a person. “However, in a predominantly rural area such as Nuh, online stalking is not prevalent. It is more common in cities like Faridabad and Gurugram. Social media makes it possible even for older men to stalk young women with the benefit of anonymity,” he says. “We need to communicate more and more with our children, especially during their teenage years. We should speak not just to girls, but also boys to guide them through their most difficult years,” says Jaglan. Tomar agrees that this is not about religion. Tired of sitting on a mattress for long hours, he presses his back against the wall to correct his posture. “How can a girl be shot dead simply for saying ‘no’? The parents of many girls in our locality are in shock after the incident. They are scared to send their daughters to school. They asked me whether they are bringing up their daughters only to see them being killed like this one day. It is not about Hindus or Muslims. We need a stringent law so that these obsessive stalkers don’t even dare to look at our daughters. Even in this case, when the police have such clinching evidence, why can’t the court decide the matter in a couple of days?” That is the question that keeps his mind occupied all day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-price-of-saying-no/article33044650.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Biden, India and comfort in the old normal||With U.S. Democratic candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden seizing the lead in the presidential elections that puts him at the cusp of victory, the attention in India turns to what kind of foreign policy changes he will bring to India-U.S. relations. A bit of history may hold some clues. In September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama had tasked his Vice-President, Joseph Biden, with building an alternative plan to Afghanistan, to present to U.S. Generals who were pushing for the “surge” or an influx of up to 400,000 troops to win the war in Afghanistan. Mr. Biden fought long and hard, building on multiple visits to the region, and suggested that the U.S. did not need more troops; instead it needed to pull out, and focus on a five-point agenda for what he called “Counter-terrorism Plus”. The details, as recounted by veteran journalist Bob Woodward in his book, Obama’s Wars , included a full focus on al-Qaeda, exiting other counterinsurgency missions and dropping the Bush era “nation-building” theme, reducing U.S. bases to just two or three, and fighting the Taliban with a view to bringing them to the table for reconciliation. On Pakistan, a country that gave him one of its highest civilian honours, the Hilal-e-Pakistan, Mr. Biden favoured a policy of engagement in order to deal with the Taliban. Eventually, Mr. Obama did not go with the Biden plan, and ended up with following the military’s plan for a surge of about 33,000 extra troops instead. A decade later, it was President Donald Trump who picked up ideas similar to the Biden plan, when he ordered a large-scale pullout of U.S. troops, limited U.S. presence at bases and its mission in Afghanistan, while appointing Zalmay Khalilzad to build a reconciliation process with the Taliban. While the relative merits of the different American strategies on Afghanistan will be judged in the future, what this shows is that the specific policies of Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump in the international arena may not differ as much as their political styles and their ideologies do. Roots in the Obama-Biden era For India, this would mean some comfort in the continuity a Biden administration will show over the U.S. policy with India, strategic and otherwise. While Mr. Trump owned the Indo-Pacific policy later, the policy owes its origins to the Obama-Biden administration that first focused on “Asia-Pacific” in order to build a coalition to counter Chinese inroads in the region: during his visit to New Delhi in 2015, Mr. Obama signed the first India-U.S. vision statement on the subject (https://bit.ly/355d8N7). He may not, however, pursue the head to head, brinkmanship style Mr. Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo preferred. It is also likely that Mr. Biden will build on the military foundational agreements with India, strengthen military cooperation and push the sale of U.S. military hardware. When it comes to trade, it is unlikely that Mr. Biden can dial back many of the measures that Mr. Trump has put into motion, but he would have low hanging fruit to pick, if he chooses to be more flexible, in restoring India’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status for exporters, and in wrapping up a mini-trade deal that the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal have been working on, but without success thus far. On visas, Mr. Biden gave Indian-Americans some assurances at a campaign speech last month, and he already has an in-house understanding of the value of Indian immigrants to the U.S., and the importance of India’s outsourcing industry to the U.S., through his running mate Kamala Harris. Friction areas Where there is likely to be some friction with the Modi government, especially given India’s pending review by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, is where the Democratic Party leadership, including Ms. Harris, Mark Warner, Pramila Jayapal, have been particularly vocal: Jammu-Kashmir, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, communal and caste-based violence, actions against non-governmental organisations and media freedoms. These are areas Mr. Trump ignored for most part, but are areas where Mr. Biden once said the U.S. “admired” India the most. In a speech in 2013 during a visit to Mumbai, Mr. Biden had said: “We admire the way you’ve melded ethnicities, faiths and tongues into a single, proud nation; the way entrepreneurship seems almost hard-wired into Indian society, from rickshaw-wallas to web programmers; and maybe most of all, we admire your democracy and the message that your democracy sends to people everywhere in the world.” International outlook Above all, Mr. Biden’s foreign policy will be watched for just how much he reverses Mr. Trump’s pullout from the multilateral world order, including the World Health Organisation, UNESCO, Human Rights Council, agreements such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Accord and traditional trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific alliances. He will also be watched for what concrete measures he takes in order to strengthen the rules-based international order, and to ensure the countries that flout it the most, including China, Russia, and even the United States are held to account. New Delhi might not miss Mr. Trump’s abrasive, transactionalist style that puts a premium on personality over policy, but it had learned to embrace the “new normal” of the Trumpian era, as the two public rallies Mr. Modi invited Mr. Trump to, in Houston and Ahmedabad, showed. The success of the government’s dealings with Mr. Biden’s administration now depends on how much of the “old normal” the Modi government is able to revert to and find comfort over the next few months. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/biden-india-and-comfort-in-the-old-normal/article33044645.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Market dictates and a blow against equality||On October 27, the Supreme Court of India heard brief arguments on the constitutional validity of the levy of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mobility aids used by disabled citizens. The petitioner, in Nipun Malhotra vs. Union of India , argued that the tax imposed on these products, which included wheelchairs, tricycles for the disabled, braille paper and braille watches, was patently discriminatory. But the Court indicated that the scope of its power to review the levy was slender. A decision to impose a tax, it said, was a matter of policy over which the judiciary ought not to ordinarily interfere. In adjourning the case, it suggested that the petitioner exhaust his options by submitting his grievances to the GST Council, which is the governing body responsible for determining which products are taxed, and at what rate. Tax and a fundamental right At first blush, this approach seems reasonable. But should the GST Council reject the petitioner’s plea, it would be imprudent of the Court not to test the legitimacy of the levy. Much as it might be keen to ensure that the judiciary does not sit on judgment over matters that fall within the domain of legislative and executive competence, it must recognise that there is nothing inherently distinct about taxing laws; they are in no way plenary and unamenable to judicial review. Quite to the contrary, taxes have a direct bearing on how society is arranged. The nature and rate of tax imposed on a product can impinge both on a person’s freedom and on a person’s right to be treated with equal care and concern. Therefore, it ought to be well within an independent judiciary’s province — as the top courts in Canada and Colombia, among others, have recently held — to examine whether or not an imposition of a tax violates a fundamental right. Market forces are at play The GST regime was launched amid much fanfare in July 2017, with the idea of not only simplifying India’s complex and multi-layered tax structure but also with a view to fashioning the country into a unified, common market, in which the levy of GST will subsume almost all other extant indirect taxes. To that end, the GST serves as a consumption tax on the supply of all manners of goods and services. But its functioning has proved far from transformative. At the time of its inception, the central government claimed that the causes of liberty and equality would benefit from the States pooling their sovereignty together with that of the Union. But what we have seen since is that with the withering of the States’ fiscal autonomy, it is the dictates of the market alone that appear to determine how and what goods are taxed. The levy on commodities used by the disabled is a prime example of this. Until the advent of the GST, mobility aids were almost entirely immune from indirect taxes. In virtually every State, exemptions were granted on the payment of value-added-tax on such goods. The GST did away altogether with this exemption. Indeed, it was only after substantial outcry that the originally proposed 18% tax on these devices was reduced to 5%. But even at that rate, as the petition in the Supreme Court demonstrates, the levy increases manifold the prices of commodities that allow the disabled to perform the most basic tasks — in this case, to walk or to read. Despite this affront to dignity, the government claims that it cannot relieve mobility aids from taxation, because to do so will disincentivise domestic manufacturers. “The 5% concessional GST rate,” the government said in a statement explaining the levy, “will result in a win-win situation for both the users of such devices, the disabled persons, as well as the domestic manufacturers of such goods.” This argument is influenced by the GST’s structure, in particular the manner in which firms are allowed to claim credit on taxes paid by them in the making of a product. Under the existing regime, if the maker, say, of a wheelchair has paid taxes on commodities that serve as raw material in the process of manufacturing, it will be entitled to claim credit for the tax paid when it remits the levy collected from the eventual purchaser of the product. So, if the manufacturer spends a sum of Rs. 100 as taxes towards the purchase of aluminium that goes into the making of a wheelchair and then collects a sum of Rs. 120 as GST when it sells the wheelchair, it would be entitled to claim the sum of Rs. 100 as “input tax credit” and would consequently only have to deposit Rs. 20 to the government. The State’s argument is that in the absence of a levy of GST on the final product, the manufacturer will be burdened with input taxes. Since it cannot claim any credit for those taxes paid, the prices of the final product would have to be concomitantly higher, and, as a result, the manufacturer will be placed in a relative position of disadvantage to foreign makers. Parliament can find a way This argument, though, suffers from at least two fallacies. First, a reading of the various notifications issued by the GST Council shows that many other products that are essential to human needs are exempt from tax — notably, in July 2018, following a sustained campaign, the levy imposed on female personal hygiene products (tampons and sanitary pads) was removed. Second, that the grant of an exemption in cases such as these would disentitle manufacturers from claiming input tax credit is a matter of legislative design. Nothing suggests that Parliament cannot find other ways to ensure that domestic manufacturers are granted credit for the taxes that they pay on inputs. A set off against taxes collected from the eventual consumers can scarcely be seen as the only legitimate mechanism available to ensure that a rebate is provided. What is more, the government might well have all manners of other options available — it could, for example, exempt firms from paying taxes on inputs on the condition that such inputs will be used to manufacture mobility aids. A reasonable classification Ultimately, a decision taken on exempting goods from taxation is a matter of classification. The Constitution’s equality code requires such a classification to be a reasonable one. In the case of mobility aids, the oppressive nature of the levy is evident. The tax places a prohibitive burden on the ability of disabled citizens to access the most basic goods, to lead lives with dignity. Given that the classification rests on a state of disability, it must be seen, on any sensible consideration of our equality jurisprudence, as, at least facially, inequitable. The onus must, therefore, rest on the government to show the Court that it had cogent reasons for treating these goods as distinct from other commodities that are exempt from tax. A failure to discharge this onus ought to render the levy illegitimate. It need not come to this. The GST Council can take a leaf out of the books of Canada and Australia, and grant a complete exemption on the levy imposed on mobility aids. A fair and just regime ought to demand nothing less. Taxation, after all, is a tool that is intended to augment general welfare. It is time we recognised that an unreasonable levy can deeply compromise fundamental human needs. To free taxing statutes from the ramparts of the Constitution is to risk the entrenching of inequality.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||New dawn||After trailing but steadily closing the gap since Election Day, Democrat and former Vice-President Joe Biden has seized the lead in the Republican-leaning swing State of Georgia, and in Pennsylvania, and winning them would guarantee his victory in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Mr. Biden is now poised to garner more than 270 votes in the Electoral College, with leads in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona, and wins in any two of them or in Pennsylvania alone should be enough. However, an obstacle in his path to the Oval Office comes from the scattershot legal action by the Trump campaign to stop the counting of votes after polls closed, on the unfounded allegation that mail-in votes were subject to large-scale fraud. Mr. Biden is also firmly on track to win the popular vote decisively, having secured more than a whopping 73 million, a fact that Democrats will no doubt seize upon in the days ahead to underscore the legitimacy of their potential mandate to govern. The nail-biting denouement of the contest belied earlier hopes on both sides for a landslide victory, with the fiercest contests playing out in the swing States of the Rust Belt, including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and, further afield, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, a historically unprecedented surge in mail-in voting contributed to a high overall turnout, likely in excess of 68%. In normal times, and with a predictable predecessor, Mr. Biden may have relished the prospect of preparing to enter office in January 2021. Yet the pandemic and the legacy of Mr. Trump’s administration imply that, should he win, Mr. Biden will have to make plans on an emergency footing, not only in the realms of health care and macroeconomic policy but also in terms of healing the painful divisions that have led to the emergence of two Americas, with radically divergent views on everything from tolerating pluralism to embracing globalisation. On COVID-19, the U.S. will soon touch a grim milestone — 10 million cases; more than 230,000 fatalities have been recorded. This makes it imperative that the next President of the country respects science and advocates the use of masks, social distancing, and lockdowns. Similarly, experts concur that the pandemic-induced tailspin of the U.S. economy will need a pragmatic and bold fiscal policy, not fear mongering tweets denigrating immigrants. Finally, it is likely that “Trumpism” — which includes not only dog-whistles to white supremacists, retrograde views on women’s reproductive rights and an instinct to pander to unhinged nativism, but also concern for economically disenfranchised working-class Americans — will certainly outlast Mr. Trump’s time at the White House. If the U.S. is to have a hope of holding onto its superpower status, the mammoth task of bridge-building across the bitter polarisation of the partisan divide must be the highest priority for the 46th President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/new-dawn/article33044638.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Alimony guidelines||In India, though more girls are going to school now, for many, the inevitable reality seems marriage before completion of higher education. Girls are married off early and bear children long before they should. This triggers a state of poor maternal health and is one of the root causes of high levels of child stunting and wasting in India. There is also the possibility of a marriage not working out for varied reasons, leaving the girl or young woman in extreme distress because often she is not financially independent. Parliament and the courts have persistently enacted legislation to give women better rights. Article 15(3), which states ‘nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children’, read together with Article 39, which directs state policy towards equal pay and opportunities for both men and women, and protecting the health of women and children, are two key constitutional safeguards. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court leaned on these two Articles, and a host of other laws, while hearing a dispute between a Mumbai-based couple, and set down comprehensive guidelines on alimony. The court ruled that an abandoned wife and children will be entitled to ‘maintenance’ from the date she applies for it in a court of law. In a 67-page judgment, a Bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and R. Subhash Reddy, outlined specifics, including “reasonable needs” of a wife and dependent children, her educational qualification, whether she has an independent source of income, and if she does, if it is sufficient, to follow for family courts, magistrates and lower courts on alimony cases. Given the large and growing percentage of matrimonial litigation, some clarity was necessary. Cases are known to drag on and acquire cobwebs, worsening the misery for vulnerable women. The Court laid down that while women can make a claim for alimony under different laws, including the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and Section 125 of the CrPC, or under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it “would be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings”, urging civil and family courts to take note of previous settlements. Perhaps keeping in mind the vastness of India and its inequities, the Court also added how an “order or decree of maintenance” may be enforced under various laws and Section 128 of the CrPC. For women in India, especially the poor who are often overlooked in discourses, the top court’s words that maintenance laws will mean little if they do not prevent dependent wives and children from “falling into destitution and vagrancy”, offer a glimmer of hope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/alimony-guidelines/article33044639.ece
07 November 2020||New Delhi,||NBFCs with high systemic risks need more regulation: RBI DG||Asserting that there was a need to recalibrate regulations for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), Reserve Bank Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao on Friday said NBFCs with significant externalities and which contribute substantially to systemic risks must be identified and subjected to a higher degree of regulation. “One can also argue that the design of prudential regulatory framework for such NBFCs can be comparable with banks so that beyond a point of criticality to systemic risks, such NBFCs should have incentives either to convert into a commercial bank or scale down their network externalities within the financial system,” he said. This would make the financial sector sound and resilient while allowing a majority of NBFCs to continue under the regulation-light structure, Mr. Rao said at an Assocham conference. Observing that NBFCs currently enjoyed a great degree of regulatory arbitrage vis-a-vis banks, he said these entities could contribute to a build-up of systemic risks because of such arbitrage and hence there was a need to recalibrate the regulations. “We could perhaps consider a graded regulatory framework for NBFCs, calibrated in relation to their contribution to systemic significance,” he said. MFI norms Mr. Rao said the share of NBFC-MFIs (microfinance institutions) in the overall microfinance sector had come down to a little more than 30% as several large MFIs had converted into Small Finance Banks. “There is a need to re-prioritise regulatory tools in the microfinance sector so that our regulations are activity-based rather than entity-based,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/nbfcs-with-high-systemic-risks-need-more-regulation-rbi-dg/article33044633.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||WhatsApp introduces payment services in India||WhatsApp unveiled payments services in India following approval by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) after a wait that extended for more than two years. However, not all users in India — one of the biggest markets for the unit of Facebook — would be able to access the feature as NPCI had mandated expansion of WhatsApp’s UPI user base ‘in a graded manner starting with a maximum registered user base of 20 million.’ “We’ll continue to work with them [NPCI] to make it available to everyone over time,” the company said in an e-mailed response. The NPCI approval also follows another recent direction imposing a cap of 30% of the total volume of transactions processed in UPI, applicable to all third-party app providers, effective January 1, 2021. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, had started testing its UPI-based payments system in 2018 and would now compete with players such as Paytm, Google Pay, Amazon Pay and PhonePe. “Starting today, people across India will be able to send money through WhatsApp. This secure payments experience makes transferring money just as easy as sending a message,” WhatsApp said in a blogpost. “Now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp as easily as sending a message,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “There’s no fee, and it’s supported by more than 140 banks.

07 November 2020||London,||Blockbuster weekend in the Premier League||Manchester City’s bid to regain the Premier League title faces a defining moment against leader Liverpool this weekend, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fights to silence the critics as troubled Manchester United takes on Everton. City is already five points behind Liverpool, albeit with a game in hand, and cannot afford to lose to the champion at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Pep Guardiola’s side has allowed Liverpool to steal a march on it after winning just three of its first six league games. Although City has won five of its last six games in all competitions, including a midweek Champions League success against Olympiakos, it remains some way short of its peak form. Recurring injury Hampered by Sergio Aguero’s recurring injury problems, City has lacked a cutting edge at times. Guardiola can take heart from the return to fitness of Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus, who came off the bench to score against Olympiakos. Acknowledging the significance of the Liverpool match to City’s title hopes, Jesus said: “It’s a very important game for us. It’s a direct confrontation against the leader of the table. “We need to be very focused, especially playing at home. We need to play our way and try to win the game. We need to win those three points if we want to aspire to win the Premier League again.” Spluttering start While City has made a spluttering start, Liverpool appears back to its best despite the absence of key defender Virgil van Dijk. Klopp has been forced to alternate between inexperienced youngsters Rhys Williams and Nat Phillips as Joe Gomez’s partner in central defence, but the Liverpool machine is still running smoothly. Jurgen Klopp’s team has won five games in all competitions and conceded just two goals since Van Dijk suffered the serious knee injury that is likely to rule him out for the rest of the season. Liverpool, one point clear of second placed Leicester, crushed Atalanta 5-0 in the Champions League in midweek thanks to in-form Diogo Jota’s hat-trick. “We are not a team of only one player. The last weeks have been difficult times because we have lost some important players in our team, but now we have many coming back as well,” Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker said. Danger of sack Meanwhile, Manchester United’s dismal start to the season has left Solskjaer in danger of the sack. After two successive losses, another damaging defeat at Everton would put the Norwegian under intense pressure amid reports United’s board has made contact with representatives of former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. United’s shock 2-1 defeat at Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League on Wednesday was an especially embarrassing night for Solskjaer as his team’s defensive frailties came back to haunt him yet again. Beaten by Arsenal in the league last weekend, United is off to its worst start at home since 1972, so Solskjaer might welcome an away game against an Everton side which has lost its last two games. But Solskjaer, whose side sits just four points above the relegation zone, will know the forthcoming international break potentially presents an opportunity for his dismissal if he doesn’t inspire a win against Everton. United, loser in three of its six league games, has not been beaten in four of its first seven in a league campaign since 1989-90. No comment “I decline to comment on such a thing. Of course, it’s early on and opinions are out there all the time. You’ve got to stay strong,” Solskjaer said after the shambles in Istanbul. “I’m employed by the club to do a job and I do that to the best of my ability with my staff.” Elsewhere this weekend, if Liverpool drops points against City, then Leicester, which hosts Wolves, or Tottenham, which travels to West Bromwich Albion, could seize first place.  It’s a very important game for us. It’s a direct confrontation against the leader of the table.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Williamson, Holder ensure SRH stays alive in a tense shoot-out||An outstanding all-round bowling effort, followed by Kane Williamson’s masterly unbeaten 50 (44b, 2x4, 2x6), ensured Sunrisers Hyderabad continued its winning run, beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by six wickets in the Eliminator at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Electing to bowl, SRH restricted RCB to 131 for seven, led by Jason Holder’s brilliant spell of three for 25. Despite a hiccup during the chase’s middle phase, Williamson made sure his side will face Delhi Capitals in the second Qualifier on Sunday. SRH more than kept pace with the asking-rate in the PowerPlay, scoring 48. But it lost two wickets, including the big one of captain David Warner. RCB leg-spinners Adam Zampa and Yuzvendra Chahal made a contest of it, giving away only 20 in the next six overs and picking up two wickets. SRH looked shaky at 68 for four after 12 overs. But Williamson, who had started scratchily, hit two crucial sixes, one each against Washington Sundar (14th over) and Chahal (16th over). Holder gave him steady support, the duo forging a 65-run stand for the unbroken fifth wicket. Holder’s 20-ball 24 included three boundaries, two of which came in the final over to seal the win. Holder had earlier set the tone with the ball, in partnership with Sandeep Sharma, in the PowerPlay before spinners Rashid Khan and Shahbaz Nadeem applied the squeeze in the middle overs. A.B. de Villiers (56, 43b, 5x4) and Aaron Finch (32, 30b, 3x4, 1x6) were the only top-order batsmen to get into double figures. Skipper Virat Kohli opened the innings to lead from the front, but the move did not work. He gloved a rising delivery from Holder down the leg-side to wicketkeeper Shreevats Goswami — in for an injured Wriddhiman Saha — in the second over. RCB managed only 32 in the PowerPlay and the spinners did not let the pressure ease thereafter, with Nadeem, in particular, keeping de Villiers quiet while Rashid was at his accurate best. Just as Finch started to find his feet — he slogged Rashid for the only six of the innings — Nadeem had the Australian caught by the deep-cover fielder. After being reduced to 62 for four by the 11th over, de Villiers took charge. But just when the South African was set for a final push to get RCB to a fighting total, Natarajan (two for 33) produced another of his brilliant yorkers to remove de Villiers’ middle-stump and help SRH finish the innings strongly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bowlers-and-williamson-help-sunrisers-stay-alive-in-shoot-out/article33044717.ece

Having lost a thriller to Velocity in its first match, the champion needs to get its act together. Trailblazers is placed well in the race for a place in the final after its crushing win over Velocity with plenty to spare. Because of its vastly superior net run-rate, it just has to avoid a massive defeat. If Supernovas wins, all the three sides will finish with two points each — like they did last year — and the net run-rate will decide the finalists. Better batting display Harmanpreet Kaur’s women have to bat better than they did against Velocity in the opening match. Chamari Atapattu and the captain had batted well, but the team also needs runs from the likes of Jemimah Rodrigues and Priya Punia. The spinning Yadavs, Poonam and Radha, and overseas seamers Ayabonga Khaka Shakera Selman form a good attack, but it is up against a quality batting line-up headed by Trailblazers captain Smriti Mandhana, who will be keen to regain her form. Her opening partner Deandra Dottin had led the chase of the small target against Velocity and had looked in good touch. That win was set up by the bowlers, among whom left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone stood out. Seamer Jhulan Goswami and spinners Rajeshwary Gayakwad were also impressive. Supernovas has a tough job on its hands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/champion-supernovas-in-a-must-win-situation/article33044723.ece

Azharuddin at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Friday, decided to start cricketing activity in a phased manner. R. Vijayanand, HCA secretary, informed The Hindu that the meeting deliberated at length about conducting the leagues with all safety measures in place. “Yes, we are confident of starting the Leagues within two weeks as all the main grounds are already being maintained for resumption of cricketing activities,” Vijayanand said. “Contrary to the earlier idea of starting the leagues only for the A-Division teams, it has been decided to conduct leagues for all the Divisions so that all the players have a chance to be in action,” the secretary said. “The other important decision taken today was to convene the Annual General Meeting on November 29, with the permission of the government authorities since it was resolved to have it in the auditorium and not via any app,” he said. The HCA secretary also informed that Rs. 20 lakh will be sanctioned for the development of a full-fledged cricket ground in Mahabubnagar with a provision for a pavilion including two dressing rooms.  The meeting also decided to give a monthly pension of Rs. 4,000 each to former cricketers (mostly Ranji players) from this month onwards, he said. “The members gave their consent for organising the Telangana Premier League (T20), in coordination with T-Sports,” said Vijayanand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hca-apex-council-decides-to-start-cricketing-activity/article33045537.ece
07 November 2020||Bengaluru,||ISL — Ferrando keen to focus on the positives||The Indian Super League (ISL) season is sure to test Juan Ferrando, in more ways than one. Ferrando only recently took over from Sergio Lobera as head coach of FC Goa, and the truncated pre-season has left him with little time to get familiar with his players. The Spaniard also has to try to get the best out of his team while managing life in the strict bio-bubble. Ferrando has a lot on his plate, but for now, he is keen to focus on the positives. Get on to the field “It’s a strange situation for everybody involved with the ISL. We are under quarantine, staying 24/7 in the hotel. Some players want to talk to their families, and others to their girlfriends. There are problems, but I tell my players that it is better to be in a hotel, train and play football than to be quarantined at home. We are happy to go to work on the football field,” Ferrando said in a media interaction on Friday. The 39-year-old is worried about players picking up injuries, given the long layoff and short pre-season. “If you look at the Champions League, EPL, LaLiga and Bundesliga, there have been a lot of injuries. Players are facing a lot of physical stress now. Pre-season training is short, and normal training was not possible at home during the quarantine period. The last professional match that most players played was in March. “There could be a lot of injury problems during the ISL, not just for FC Goa but for all teams,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ferrando-keen-to-focus-on-positives/article33045355.ece
07 November 2020||Olivos (Argentina),||Maradona to remain in hospital for treatment||Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona is to remain in hospital for several more days to undergo treatment following surgery to remove a blood clot on the brain, his doctor said on Thursday. “We saw that in the postoperative phase Diego had episodes of confusion,” Leopoldo Luque told reporters. Therapists treating Maradona had linked the behaviour to withdrawal symptoms and the necessary treatment would last “a few days,” he said. Luque did not provide details, but Maradona has a long history of drug and alcohol addiction. Although he has publicly said he no longer uses cocaine, friends and media reports have suggested he remains addicted to alcohol. At a press conference outside the private clinic in Buenos Aires where surgeons spent 80 minutes removing the clot on Tuesday night, Luque took pains to present an upbeat assessment of the 60-year-old’s overall condition. “Diego is doing well. The CT scan came out well. We were even dancing. Yes, we danced!” the doctor said.   Maradona’s doctor Leopoldo Luque said he “agrees” with the diagnosis and would remain in the clinic||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/diego-maradona-to-remain-in-hospital-for-treatment/article33045356.ece
07 November 2020||Paris,||Der Klassiker to grab headlines in Bundesliga as Bayern and Dortmund clash||Germany’s heavyweights Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund go head to head while Juventus faces Lazio in some key clashes in Europe this weekend. It is the biggest game in Germany, but the latest meeting of Dortmund and Bayern will be played behind closed doors and, anyway, it has not been much of a rivalry in recent years. Bayern has won the Bundesliga eight years running, although Dortmund ha finished runner-up five times in that period, including in the last two campaigns. Bayern has also won 10 of its last 14 Bundesliga meetings since winning the 2013 Champions League final showdown. It also triumphed 3-2 when the sides clashed in the German Super Cup recently. Level on top This time, though, the teams are level atop the Bundesliga and Dortmund is in fine form, with Erling Braut Haaland on 10 goals for the season. Yet the hottest striker in Europe is Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski, and Hansi Flick’s team has won 32 of its last 33 matches. Lazio was a thorn in Juventus’s side last season and will be hoping to get one over the reigning champion on Sunday. Andrea Pirlo’s Juventus is a work in progress even if it remains unbeaten in Serie A and is two points above Lazio. Juve also won in the Champions League in midweek at Ferencvaros while Lazio drew at Zenit Saint-Petersburg. However this fixture last season was won by Simone Inzaghi’s team, which beat Juve 3-1 at home and won 3-1 again in the Italian Super Cup a few weeks later. Welcome news Cristiano Ronaldo’s brace did give Juve a 2-1 victory in their last encounter in July, but the good news for Lazio before this clash is that it is gradually recovering the players who have missed recent games due to coronavirus tests. Lazio hopes the prolific Ciro Immobile could be among those returning. He was forced to miss the Zenit draw, with Italian media saying that was linked to a positive COVID-19 test the previous week. The teams who finished third and second respectively in Serie A last season are struggling to live up to their pre-season billing. Atalanta is fourth having lost two of its first six games, while Antonio Conte’s Inter is sixth. Going tough Both teams are also finding the going tough in the Champions League, with Atalanta being demolished 5-0 by Liverpool in midweek as Inter lost 3-2 to Real Madrid to drop to the bottom of their group. Who will bounce back here?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/der-klassiker-to-grab-headlines-in-bundesliga-as-bayern-and-dortmund-clash/article33045569.ece
07 November 2020||Madrid,||Barcelona looks to shrug off poor LaLiga start when it hosts Real Betis||Barcelona has taken solace in the Champions League recently while getting off to its worst start to a LaLiga season in almost two decades, leaving Ronald Koeman’s side already under serious pressure before Saturday’s meeting with Real Betis. The Catalans have taken just eight points from their first six matches in LaLiga, failing to win any of their last four outings after drawing 1-1 away at 10-man Alaves in the Basque Country last time out. It is Barca’s worst start since 2002/03, a campaign in which it finished sixth, and it is already nine points behind the leaders, Real Sociedad, albeit with two games in hand. Barca is also eight points adrift of reigning champion Real Madrid and it desperately needs a result at home to Manuel Pellegrini’s Betis with a trip to Atletico Madrid coming up next. “The mood is better, there are new players, young players who are bringing dynamism to the group and the way we play,” insisted Gerard Pique after Wednesday’s 2-1 win over Dynamo Kiev, its third in three Champions League outings.  The emergence of the likes of Ansu Fati, who turned 18 last weekend, and fellow teenager Pedri does point to a brighter future, but Barca remains mired in crisis off the field after the recent resignation of president Josep Maria Bartomeu. “The club right now is how it is,” Pique said. “It’s in a process of many changes which are necessary. We needed to turn things around. “It was obvious that we were in decline and every year we were a little worse. “We don’t have much time, but we need it to improve. There’s never a transition year at Barcelona, but now a new president and board will come in and we will see changes in the coming months.” Old form In the meantime Koeman will also be hoping for Lionel Messi to show something more like his old form against Betis, as the Argentine is still looking for his first goal in open play this season. He has just one league goal so far, and leaving aside last season when he was injured at the beginning of the campaign, it is Messi’s own worst start in front of goal in LaLiga since 2005. Back then he was an 18-year-old just breaking through. Betis heads to the Camp Nou in seventh place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-looks-to-shrug-off-poor-laliga-start/article33045570.ece

07 November 2020||KOCHI,||Gayatri ready with ‘mind games’||A few months ago Gayatri Rajesh Menon was a very worried girl. The State women's tennis champion had taken a break from tournaments early this year to focus on her X standard exams and felt the time away from the circuit would play havoc with her National rankings. But, life took some strange twists and turns. The coronavirus pandemic proved to be a blessing in disguise. The National competition calendar went for a toss, tournaments were cancelled and now it looks like the 17-year-old has not missed much. Staying fit “I thought my ranking (currently 138) would go really down, but then ‘luckily’ there was this stoppage due to corona. I kept my fitness going throughout the break so my game is still the same, it has not suffered,” said Gayatri, Kerala's youngest women's champion, in a chat with The Hindu here. The long lockdown saw her try out a few things. “I took up kalari, it has made me very flexible, helps improve my stability, reflexes and endurance,” she said. Now, from one tennis session a week Gayatri has moved to four. “That's because we could have tournaments coming up. I'm ready for them, I can go and play tomorrow, if necessary, because I've worked on my fitness,” she said. Gayatri, who is in open school, plays mostly with veterans and that has added some wonderful weapons to her armoury. “I play with Dr. Sanjay Cherian, Tom Edward, Prakash Aswani, P.V. Timothy and Joseph. They give me a lot of advice and strategies. That has also improved my mental approach. Earlier I just used to go out and just play, now I use my mind more, almost playing a strategical game,” she said. “I practise the sets with Nirupama at the Regional Sports Centre here and she tells me whether I'm better. She's the board that tells me whether I'm going up or down. I'm waiting to try out all those mental strategies in my next tournament.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gayatri-ready-with-mind-games/article33044976.ece
07 November 2020||Paris,||Nadal enters quarterfinals||Rafael Nadal battled past Australian Jordan Thompson in straight sets to reach the Paris Masters quarterfinals on Thursday, as Diego Schwartzman moved within one win of securing an ATP Tour Finals debut. Top seed Nadal got the better of Thompson 6-1, 7-6(3) to set up a last-eight clash with fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, who must win the title this week to have a chance of snatching the last Tour Finals spot from Schwartzman. World No. 61 Thompson missed a set-point to force a decider in his first meeting with the 20-time Grand Slam champion. Nadal is bidding for a first Paris indoors triumph which would draw him level with Novak Djokovic on a record 36 Masters titles. Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka made the quarterfinals with a comeback 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 win over Andrey Rublev of Russia.  The results (third round): Rafael Nadal bt Jordan Thompson 6-1, 7-6(3); Pablo Carreno Busta bt Norbert Gombos 7-5, 6-2; Alexander Zverev bt Adrian Mannarino 7-6(11), 6-7(7), 6-4; Stan Wawrinka bt Andrey Rublev 1-6, 6-4, 6-3; Diego Schwartzman bt Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-1, 6-1; Daniil Medvedev bt Alex de Minaur 5-7, 6-2, 6-2; Milos Raonic bt Marcos Giron 7-6(1), 6-2; Ugo Humbert bt Marin Cilic 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nadal-enters-quarterfinals/article33044721.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Embodiment of knowledge||Vallalar sees Lord Muruga of Kanda Kottam in Chennai as his wealth, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. A similar sentiment is expressed in Thiruvachagam in the Piditha Pathu section, where Manickavachagar extols Lord Siva as his wealth and says that because Lord Siva is his only wealth, he seeks liberation at the feet of the Lord. Praising the deity of Thiruvalangadu, Sundarar says that he will readily be a servitor of Lord Siva’s devotees. Vallalar praises Lord Muruga as the embodiment of jnana. Muruga, after all, was a teacher to his own father — Lord Siva — and thus earned the name Swaminatha. When a devotee’s heart is full of love for his God, he acquires jnana. God ensures that he becomes God realised. No wonder Mancikavachagar says in the Achcho Pathigam of Thiuvachagam that Lord Siva saved him from being bonded by worldly ties, and was his guru. In Kandar Alankaram, Arunagirinatha expresses his unhappiness over Brahma not endowing him with four thousand eyes. And why does he need so many eyes? Arunagirinathar says that it is to feast his eyes on the nephew of Lord Vishnu, and the son of Lord Siva, that is Muruga, who is synonymous with jnana (mei-jnana deivam). Vallalar refers to Muruga as the One who is eternally young, and here he is echoing Arunagirinatha, who, in his Thiruppugazh, refers to Muruga as the One who is young (ilayoi). Vallalar celebrates Muruga’s lineage, and points to His being the nephew of Lord Vishnu and the beloved son of Lord Siva, who showers His son with kisses. This is similar to a verse in Kandar Alankaram, where Muruga’s family connections are praised. In addition to the connection to Vishnu and Siva, Kandar Alankaram also mentions Valli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/embodiment-of-knowledge/article33044711.ece
07 November 2020||CHENNAI,||YSCA Trophy postponed||The All-India YSCA Trophy cricket tournament has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the first time in the 51 years of its existence. However, it hasn’t dampened the spirits of its promoter — 78-year-old M.S. Gurumurthy, whose tireless efforts has ensured that the tournament has been conducted for so many years. Started in 1970, the YSCA trophy has grown steadily with the inclusion of outstation teams in the ’90s and has been a regular fixture in the cricket calendar. The tournament has witnessed players of the calibre of G.R.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||When rare visitors flutter by||Recently, the Branded Royal, rarely seen in India, made news when it fluttered through the Nilgiris after a gap of over 130 years. “It was last recorded in 1888 by British entomologist GF Hampson,” says Vinod Sriramulu. A trustee of the Wynter-Blyth Association (WBA) that comprises conservationists who document butterfly species in the Nilgiris, Vinod photographed the Branded Royal during a butterfly walk along the Kotagiri slopes. The four-year-old WBA has over 800 members. Butterfly season usually begins with the onset of the South-West monsoon; and the buzz tends to continue post-monsoon, well into February. “Now is the best time to watch them as they flit about in good numbers looking for nectar from tender greenery that springs up after the rains,” says P Mohan Prasath, founder of Act for Butterflies, the butterfly conservation NGO. This year, especially, many rare species have been sighted across the country. The Blue Mormon, a black-coloured velvet-winged butterfly, a species endemic to the Western Ghats, showed up in Patna. Another rare species, the Spotted Angle butterfly, has been sighted in the reserve forests of Chhattisgarh. The Liliac Silverline, a protected species whose only known breeding population is in Bengaluru, was sighted for the first time in the Aravalli range of Rajasthan. Mohan remarks, “Common Onyx showed up in the Western Ghats. It hides itself under canopies of mango trees, its host plant, and is rarely seen on the ground. All these sightings point towards a range extension of the habitat, or may be more people are observing unexplored habitats, home gardens and backyards especially during the COVID-19 lockdown.” Adding that species like Common Birdwing, Common Jester, Painted Jezebel and Vagrant have made an appearance at Telangana in the Eastern Ghats, much to the excitement of naturalists, he says, “Of the 1,339 species of butterflies in India, over 900 are seen in Arunachal Pradesh. Maybe, they are trickling down and this is indicative of climate change.” A recent study done by researchers Appanna Saragada, E Ramakrishna and Ramana Bhusala in the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district, documents a number of species recorded in the region for the first time. These include the African Marbled Skipper, the Tree Flitter and the Double-branded Crow. “We hope that the findings will help mobilise conservation research, action and attention for the Eastern Ghats forest habitats,” says Rahul Pandey, Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), Andhra Pradesh. Forest Section Officer (Visakhapatnam Division) Ramana Bhusala, who manages the Butterfly Park at Indira Gandhi Zoological Park, says that some of these sightings were particularly special, like the Orange-tailed Awl. “I spotted it at Kambalakonda forests during my regular visits. When I checked the records, I found it was a rare sighting, since it was never recorded before from this region,” says Ramana.Another special sighting was the Large Guava Blue. Saying there have been just three sightings in Tamil Nadu over the last six years, Sharan Venkatesh, a keen watcher adds, “It feeds on wild fruits such as figs, or common fruits like pomegranate and guava.” Isaac Kehimkar, the butterfly man of India, calls the winged creatures ‘fussy’. “They are sensitive to weather and habitat. They won’t settle for anything less. When the habitat is polluted, they abandon it. Once the habitat shrinks, the populations come out,” says Isaac. He considers catching a glimpse of the Northern Jungle Queen in Sikkim and the endangered Bhutan Glory in Arunachal Pradesh as a real treats. “The Bhutan Glory is endangered and protected under Wildlife Protection Act like tigers and elephants.” Butterflies are habitat specific and rarely wander off, he adds. For example, the Southern Birdwing, which can only be seen in South India. It comes up to the southern tip of Maharasthra, but never stops by in Mumbai. Says Isaac, “We have the Sanjay Gandhi National Park but perhaps that is not good enough. Habitats restrict butterflies. That is why they are called bio-indicators.”  With inputs from   Nivedita Ganguly   Rarer than Halley’s Comet The Striated Five-ring was sighted at Neyyar, Kerala in 2015-16 after 100 years. The Nilgiri Plain Ace was rediscovered by butterfly enthusiasts after 130 years.  The Marbled Map butterfly recorded for the first time in Visakhapatnam is protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act. This ‘rare’ species is confined to the hilly forests of Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bhutan and Myanmar.  Malabar Banded Peacock is endemic to South India. So is Tree nymph, a large white butterfly with black spots resembling white paper wafting through the air.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Reaching for the skies||This Deepavali will be a quiet one at the Suriya household. “The new normal,” laughs Suriya over a telephone call. The actor is gearing up for an unusual festive season. Unlike in previous years when his films would release to much fan frenzy in theatres, his latest movie, Soorarai Pottru , will drop directly on OTT platform Amazon Prime next Thursday. Inspired by the life of Captain Gopinath, the film has Suriya playing Maara, a villager who is a ‘rebel with an idea’, as the trailers suggest. Excerpts from an exclusive interview:  Why was the story of Nedumaran Rajangam (Maara), whose character is based on Captain Gopinath, important enough to be told to the world?  He [Captain Gopinath] changed the history of the Indian aviation industry. His dream was to make the common man fly, and he made about 30 lakh people fly with a ticket priced at just Rs. 1. He ensured villages and towns prospered by connecting them with bigger centres. Real India lives in the villages; he made people from there fly and succeed. In fact, he discovered that there was an air strip in Dindigul and many other places. And, he was a school teacher’s son from a simple background, proving that no dream is too big whoever you may be.  You worked hard in the garment business before starting out as an actor. Did you recall that phase while portraying this character’s initial struggles?   We all go through this phase once we turn 18, when we start thinking about our future. I did not want to follow my father’s [Sivakumar] footsteps in the film industry. I got a job in a garment factory, with my first month’s salary being Rs. 736, which I got after 18 hours of work every day. I still remember the weight of the white envelope that had that money. I re-lived all those days during the shoot of Soorarai Pottru that charts the struggles of the protagonist. After a long time, I felt refreshed at a shooting spot and experienced a new way of filmmaking. Everybody needs to press that refresh button once a while, and that happens only when you get a challenge. Happiness is facing new challenges.  Was there need to add drama for a cinematic representation of this real-life personality?   Yes. The book we have based the film on, Simply Fly , is 670 pages and we cannot do justice to that material in two hours. We have taken four highlight points. With director Sudha Kongara’s vision, we have added characters coming alive around the protagonist and made it a cinematic experience.  Tell us about the physical demands of this project.  Sudha had a 10-minute confrontation sequence that the protagonist undergoes when he is 18. I am 45 now, and there was no way I was going to play that part! I showed her the CGI work done in Hollywood film Gemini Man , and was hoping she would rope in someone who looks like me for that sequence. But she was insistent that I play it myself. In a span of 27 days, I went through an unhealthy crash diet — that I will not recommend at all — to make myself look like a teenager.  You have played army officers and cops previously. Is there a certain majesty that comes with representing the Armed Forces?  Definitely. They look after civilians in a very protective manner, just like how we would take care of our kid or younger sibling. They are very chivalrous in the way they behave with women. I really wish that each of us experiences life in the Army for a couple of years after schooling. I believe that will bring some order to life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/reaching-for-the-skies/article33045270.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||The old man and the loom||Seated on the thinnai of his home at Musiri, senior weaver Ganapathi stares into a distance, deep in thought. He wears a bright checked lungi he wove himself and nearby, sits a small stack of checked saris, fresh off his loom. The 75-year-old, who has been weaving ever since he can remember, designed the saris himself — from the colour combinations to the width of the checks — and wove each one over three days on his loom at home during lockdown. “ Thatha wove the saris using leftover threads from the paavu (hank) I gave him,” says C Sivagurunathan, who started Nurpu, an initiative to revive the handloom tradition of weaving clusters in and around Erode. Sivaguru, who markets handwoven clothes on his website, has been working with Ganapathi for the past couple of years. “He weaves dhotis and saris for me,” explains the 34-year-old, adding that the kind Ganapathi weaves are called ‘Thapettai’ dhotis, named after the weaving cluster they come from. “These are the eight-yard veshtis MGR wore during his time,” he adds. During lockdown, orders dwindled and his loom went silent; but Ganapathi could not sit idle. He put together leftover threads and started weaving. The result was a range of checked saris in combinations that feature shades of peacock blue and sunshine yellow. When Sivaguru met him, all he could do was smile at the old man’s commitment to his loom. “I travelled to his hometown when restrictions were eased,” says Sivaguru, adding with a laugh, “He had actually tied one of the saris as a lungi. When I asked him about it, he said there were no rules to what one can do with a piece of cloth.” Sivaguru, in fact, planned on tailoring the saris into paavadai (long skirts) and tops for little girls. “They are of fine cotton, and I thought children might find it comfortable on their skin.” But he got busy with Nurpu’s Deepavali orders and put them up as they were for sale. Sivaguru, who is from a family of weavers, talks about a work ethic they strictly adhere to: “We never take back leftover threads from the weavers once we offer it to them for work,” he says. “My father and grandfather have told me that those are for the weaver to make a living.” But Ganapathi turned them into saris. “Ganapathi thatha is like that,” says Sivaguru.

Shan says this story has several layers. “For instance, the series originally featured a Hindu couple — Mani and Madhu. But we thought it would be more interesting to explore the conflict between an inter-religious couple. And, it doesn’t say that love is all rosy and marriage is difficult.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Lhasa soup for the Delhi soul||One of the nicest meals I have had was at a Tibetan restaurant called Greens in Dharamshala, when we visited some years ago. It served only vegetarian food, and I recall a delicious platter called A Ploughman’s Lunch, a variation of the traditional hearty meal of England. This had some Tibetan soup — full of crunchy veggies — and a thick slice of Tibetan bread, the delightful taste of which I can still recall. I have an old and warm relationship with Tibetan food. There was a time when the only place where you could get a good bowl of thukpa — a nourishing soup with all kinds of meats and vegetables — was Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi. We were regulars there, for one could have a fulfilling meal for just a few rupees in one of the little shacks known as Tib Dhabs, or Tibetan Dhaba. Strangely, while Delhi today offers food from across India and the world, there are not too many Tibetan eateries that one can think of. The one restaurant where I had a good Tibetan meal in the recent past was Yeti, which had a menu that included Tibetan and Nepali cuisine. That is why I was delighted when I saw that there was an eatery called Lhasa from where I could order food. I had been thinking of all those meals at Tib Dhabs for a while, so Tibetan food was on my mind while I was surfing the Net a few days ago in search of little known restaurants. Lhasa (198/52 Ramesh Market, East of Kailash) sounded promising. It had a menu of Tibetan and Chinese dishes. I ordered (through Swiggy; Zomato also delivers) a plate of chicken kothay — (eight pieces for Rs. 149), mutton shapta (Rs. 359), pork thenthuk (Rs. 149), double fried pork (Rs. 219) and buff sha phaley (Rs. 129). The restaurant had, curiously, a packaging charge of one rupee, and I made an online payment of a total of Rs. 1,121. The food arrived in plastic containers (not as well packed as some other food deliveries, I am afraid). There was enough food for two meals and three people. I started with the kothay , which was a partly steamed and partly fried dimsum stuffed with chicken. Then I went on to the thenthuk , a bowl of flat noodles with pieces of pork and vegetables in soup. It was mildly flavoured but delicious — and I made a nice meal out of it. The double fried pork is a favourite of mine, and I really liked their offering. The tender pork pieces had just the right balance of fat and meat, and had been well cooked with peppers. The disappointing dish was the shapta , stir-fried lamb cooked with ginger and red chillies. The lamb was much too tough; there was some meat on the bone that truly challenged my teeth. The best dish of all was the sha phaley , Tibetan fried bread with a meat or vegetable stuffing. There were three large pieces in our order, and the stuffing had spicy buff meat. I bit into one, and enjoyed the differing textures of the crispy fried bread and the soft meat within. Lhasa rekindled old memories of Tib Dhabs. The meal, like the old times, was hearty and didn’t strain the wallet. Just the teeth, on one dish.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||5 commandments to dining out||Last weekend, chef Prateek Sadhu, co-founder of Masque — the Mumbai restaurant that won the Miele One to Watch Award at Asia’s 50 Best Restaurant earlier this year — put up an Instagram post calling out diner behaviour that has been angering many of India’s top restaurants for a while now. “Last night, on Saturday, a group of 10 guests failed to turn up after confirming their booking at Masque Lab. Now here’s the thing, we only have 12 seats in the house. Think about the implications of this reckless act,” the post reads. No-shows are just one of the poor guest behaviours that restaurants the world over have always taken in their stride. However, with the pandemic shuttering so many businesses even as the rest struggle to survive, unthinking lack of etiquette has graver implications for our eating-out culture. Last minute cancellations mean that restaurants already operating at half their capacity are unable to sell the seats they could have otherwise. “If this continues, we may as well shut. There is no way we can survive,” says Sadhu. Top restaurants are now devising ways in which bookings can be charged, redeemable against what you eat and drink. Till now, this has not been a wide-spread practise in India because most find it cumbersome to build in e-commerce payment links into their reservation systems. “We tried doing it through a reservation platform before the pandemic, but we found the number of bookings dropped. People did not like the idea of paying in advance,” says restaurateur Gauri Devidayal. If you are stepping out to eat out this festive season, be mindful of the new etiquette restaurant dining now demands. Here’s a checklist:   If you have made a reservation, keep it. Restaurants and their staff are struggling, and it is a crushing blow to them if guests decide to not show up. Emergencies happen, but call in advance if you can’t make it. Not wait till they have put the soufflé in the oven! Thou shalt eat (and not only take selfies)! Anyone visiting a restaurant is a welcome guest. However, a peculiar problem arises if guests choose to focus more on taking ‘I have arrived’ photos than actually enjoying their meal. Sure, going to a top restaurant is as much about your social media vanity as indulging your palate, but try to order a ‘reasonable’ amount of food, pocket and stomach permitting. “A group of 10 did not even run up a bill of Rs. 10,000 one evening, but they took 40 pictures,” says a distressed chef of a restaurant where an average meal for two is in the range of Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000. Precisely cooking your meal, plating it up beautifully, with the sommelier recommending a wine, and the hostess greeting you by name, all have a cost which is met from what you eat. So don’t get that elaborate machinery cranking if all you really want is a picture for the gram! Thou shalt not abandon masks Now that Gucci, Fendi and even Nykka are making necessity fashionable, use your mask to make a statement but don’t take it off the moment you hit Goa, currently the destination for vacationers, with most of its restaurants reopening. “People seem to think that the moment they get here, the pandemic has fled,” says a worried hotelier. For those who still don’t know: the protocol is to keep masks on while indoors and take them off only to eat. This ensures the safety of your fellow diners and wait staff, who are exposed to so many people every day. Thou shalt follow rules This one is for restaurants and their owners. We know that business is limping back to pre-pandemic normal, but that is only because people are trusting owners to follow safety and hygiene protocols. Please don’t be tempted to cut corners. Hand sanitising, distancing between tables, and employee checks are still musts. Thou shalt learn to say ‘no’ This is not a life lesson; it is an exhortation to restaurants to find the strength to keep out unruly customers. If diners are irresponsible, showing symptoms, not masking or socially distancing, show them the door. It is akin to a bar’s responsibility to protect, say, women from unruly drunken behaviour. Except, in this case, the implications are even graver.

While efforts are being made to reduce and recycle, the endless outflow of gift boxes reflect our double standards on waste. I’m waiting for some real change. Like if Pantene and Sunsilk replaced hard-to-recycle sachets with shampoo bars. Or if big beauty brands completely stopped manufacturing elaborate press kits, inserts and leaflets. This would make us all sit up and take notice, but as of today we are yet to see any brave initiatives. The problem with gifting    In October 2019, I said no to decorative boxes and coffrets. I regret to inform you that it didn’t really change anything. Neither did it put an end to decorative boxes, nor did it help reduce my personal waste. But this Diwali has been excellent. After I refused to accept freebies altogether, there is 90% less waste from my home. Even though I have missed several luxurious beauty confections, in the larger scheme of things, every courier missed is less waste created. That’s not to say gifting isn’t important. It is, because that’s how influencers and journalists discover new products. But instead of blindly sending us every new product, it would be better to have a choice. I miss the days when instead of a bag of free products, beauty writers were offered a discount on products they bought. If we did have that choice, it would lead to a more nuanced, individualised conversation on, say, serum, as opposed to blanket posts identified correctly as brand plugs. The loopholes The fact is that waste is a subject that makes us all deeply uncomfortable. For this article many important brands didn’t send their responses. So the ones mentioned here deserve credit as they’ve allowed themselves to be part of a difficult conversation. Brands are making an effort, whether it is reducing plastic or collecting waste, but these initiatives need to leapfrog to match current times. The issues to be considered are:   Who recycles the recyclables?   “About 70% of our waste lies untreated and nearly 25%-30% of the waste produced in India isn’t collected,” says professor Brajesh Dubey of IIT Kharagpur’s Environmental Engineering department. The expert on waste management further explains that while most plastics get recycled if collected properly, ones like “squeezable tubes, made with different types of plastics blended together, are difficult to recycle”. As are products such as sheet masks that are made with mixed materials like fibre, paper and plastic. The process of recycle and reuse may sound simple, but it is extremely labour intensive. “Everyone thinks they can make money out of waste, but the reality is that waste is not gold,” says Dr Manoj Datta, professor and head of the Civil Engineering Department at IIT Delhi, and an expert on landfills. “Plastic has to undergo so many processes — cleaning, drying, cutting and shredding — before it can be recycled, which means increased costs, especially if it is fished out of landfills,” he says. Therefore, collections done in a responsible manner are as important as making recyclable packaging.   Bioplastic is complicated   Even more problematic than traditional polymers is bio/compostable plastic which, unfortunately, is the new buzzword in cosmetic packaging. “If it gets accidentally mixed with traditional plastic after disposal, it ruins the entire recycling chain,” says Dubey. In India, even if bioplastic has mnemonics marking it separately, neither the waste picker nor the customer will take the effort to sort it. “It also causes logistical problems in a compost or biogas plant where they take longer to degrade, which means that they cannot be mixed with other green waste that decomposes quickly.” We don’t have dedicated composting centres for them in India, therefore bioplastics aren’t resolving the problem but adding to it.   Paper and glass are also waste   Dubey says that even paper needs to be collected properly, recycled and/or composted. “If it reaches the landfill, it rots and produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is bad for the environment.” Dr Datta even found a newspaper (10-15-years-old) in a dumping ground because not all paper decomposes easily. As for glass, it requires a lot of energy to be made and to be recycled. Real innovations    “Itis essential to do a comparative life cycle assessment that looks at the environmental, economic and social aspects of a problem in a holistic way. We need to take into account the energy and money utilised and the long-term impact of each and every material, rather than blindly eschew plastic for bioplastic, paper, and glass,” says Dubey, who was a judge at The Ocean Plastic Innovation Challenge at Washington DC last year. He talks about an innovation from the first prize winner in the Circular Economy category: Alagramo from Chile. They made a mobile vending van with shampoos, conditioners and soaps from various brands that could be filled into personal bottles. “This has the potential to get rid of single-use sachets,” he says. For both brands and customers, this is the time to question how we use beauty products. Is a body wash really better than soap? I have gone back to using soap for two reasons: firstly, it comes with barely any packaging and secondly, a body wash isn’t that much better in terms of skin benefits. Similarly, are face masks better in powder form than paste? A mask powder will require lesser packaging, preservatives and will give me the flexibility to add a hydrosol, honey, milk or fruit according to my skin type. Can we also revisit products with double benefits like shampoos with conditioners? Talking of hair care, I find large conditioner bottles extremely wasteful. No one ends up finishing the entire bottle. The truth is that we need both path-breaking innovation and a return to the basics. Given that our decades-old raddiwalla and waste-picker network is the most reliable way of disposing waste, sometimes the simplest solutions are the best, especially in the complicated world of beauty waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/how-i-got-serious-about-beauty-waste/article33045200.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Lavazza’s Chaplin-inspired 2021 calendar||This May, Italian coffee company Lavazza launched its new global communication campaign, Good Morning Humanity. Based on actor-filmmaker Charlie Chaplin’s speech in The Great Dictator 80 years ago — which exhorted people not to despair in the face of trials and tribulations — the ad showcased stunning landscapes and portraits by photographers such as Steve McCurry and Jerome Sessini. It was a way for the brand to ‘look positively to the future that awaits us’. Chaplin’s call for peace has gained relevance in the last few months, and so Lavazza’s much-awaited 2021 calendar, themed ‘The New Humanity’, is an extension of the campaign. Much like earlier editions (shot in Vietnam and Hawaii), this one is also centered around sustainability, but what makes it different is how it was conceived and conceptualised during lockdown. The 2021 edition “has 13 shots that, through the maximum freedom of each artist, their personal gaze and their particular style, bring back a new and positive vision of humanity,” says Francesca Lavazza, Board Member Lavazza Group. Proceeds from the sale of 1,000 calendars and photograph auctions will go towards Gurugram-based NGO Save the Children’s project. We speak to two photographers about working on the 2021 edition: Ami Vitale and ‘the ancient footsteps’ Featuring the feet of Africa’s Samburu tribe, Vitale’s chosen image is themed on reimagining our relationship with nature. The photographer explains that the image was taken during lockdown in northern Kenya. “Twenty years ago, this landscape was empty of wildlife as poachers had decimated the elephants, the ecosystem’s engineers,” says Vitale. Today, the Samburu people have become the elephants’ greatest protectors. They have created Africa’s first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary, Reteti. “This oasis where the orphans grow up, learning to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds, is a story as much about the elephants as it is about all of humanity,” says Vitale. Martin Schoeller For 2021’s Lavazza calendar, the master of close-ups has taken his love for details up a notch with an image of 25 eyes taken earlier this year. “It is tough to get a hard read of a person by looking at a picture,” he says. The one thing that you can glean from looking at a good portrait, however, is “a sense of something that brings us together as humans”. As for the eyes, he says while they are all unique, they fill the same purpose. “It goes to show that we have the same organs and eyes, and we see the same way. We think we are so individual, but we are closer to each other than we think.” As an artist, what is it about our current interactions on Zoom and Instagram Lives that pique his interest? “I like Instagram because I can show and tell the stories that I find important. As for Zoom, I don’t enjoy it much as it is impersonal. I miss human interactions. A lot has got lost with us just staring at a screen all day long. It is sad,” he concludes.  The calendar launches on November 12 on lavazza.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/lavazzas-chaplin-inspired-2021-calendar/article33045209.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||With the stroke of a pen…||If you have seen some of the work that Charlie Hebdo produces, you will know that it takes on everything and everybody — it has depicted the Christian trinity with as much scathing impudence as it has the Pope. It has lampooned presidents and queens. And it has featured Prophet Mohammad. The magazine’s stock in trade is irreverence. Cartoons use gentle mockery or stinging satire to throw an issue into sharp relief and thereby hold it up for scrutiny. As the Pulitzer-winning political cartoonist Steve Benson once said, cartoonists are the “canaries in the coal mine” — they alert humans to cracks in the system. Beheading the canary is hardly a smart thing to do. There have been at least three incidents in recent memory when Prophet Mohammad has been the subject of cartoons and on all three occasions, extremists have responded with violence. Before the shooting at the Charlie Hebdo office in 2015, a set of cartoons published in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005 met with violent protests, threats, and even diplomatic stand-offs. And in 2007, Bangladesh’s biggest newspaper, Prothom Alo, published a cartoon strip that saw massive unrest in the country and the arrest of cartoonist Arifur Rahman. Up until the 1500s, the Catholic Church simply burned at the stake heretics or disbelievers or anyone really that it disagreed with. Queen Mary, nicknamed Bloody Mary, had more than 300 Protestants put to death. Her sister Elizabeth I hanged and quartered Catholics. It was an age when all of Europe considered religious dissent or even just atheism an “infection of the body politic” that had to be cauterized. Between 1400 and 1800, some 50,000 people were burnt to death in Europe for ‘witchcraft’, which modern historians believe was nothing but the Church’s way of appeasing the faithful by exterminating random people deemed ‘devil-worshippers’. We have come a long way from those days. Putting someone to death for their disagreeable views on gods, religions, kings, or prime ministers is no longer deemed agreeable. Of course, one can be angered or offended or disgusted by such views, but sane voices point out that the same freedom of speech that allows the ‘heretic’ or ‘blasphemous’ book or painting or cartoon to exist allows one to stage a protest march or write angry op-eds or draw an angrier cartoon. TheQuranitself, as some experts explain, says that blasphemers will be punished in the hereafter, clearly leaving the right of chastisement to God. At any rate, we are no longer in the dark ages, and violence and savagery, howsoever grave the provocation, is not the mark of civilised nations. ‘Provocation’ itself is too subjective a concept — Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people in a New Zealand mosque last year, claimed to have been ‘provoked’ by ‘Islamic terror’. The religious fundamentalists who murdered Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, MM Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh were ‘provoked’ by their rationalist, secular writings. At what point on the scales of justice do we allow offended sensibilities to tip over against human lives? The idea of modernity, of progress and civilisation means that we no longer allow heretics or apostates to be burned at the stake nor non-believers to be converted by the sword. This understanding that diverse beliefs or even the absence of belief has legitimacy means that religion is not forbidden ground for critics and cartoonists in modern democracies. When fanatics demanded that the film PK , which mocked Hindu superstitions, be banned, the state rightly refused, and French President Macron has said that newspapers and magazines have the right to publish any caricature. After the 2005 controversy, Jyllands-Posten journalist Flemming Rose wrote in The Washington Post : “The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions... They made a point: we are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding Muslims.” That’s what satire does — treats nothing as sacrosanct, mocks everything. Actually, American cartoonist Bill Mauldin said it better: “Ours is the role of the lowly gadfly,” he said, “We circle and stab, circle and stab…” By taking jabs at everyone, satire equalises. And if there’s one thing democracies are premised on, it is equality. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/with-the-stroke-of-a-pen/article33045263.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Down Daffodil Lane||Sanya Podar, 29, prefers reading Roald Dahl, Joan Aiken and Enid Blyton to other “age-appropriate” literature. “I also love the Madeline series by Ludwig Bemelmans and listening to my mother’s version of Akbar and Birbal stories. There is something comforting about re-reading the books of our childhood,” says the founder of Daffodil Lane, a new Mumbai-based children’s book publisher. The young imprint, with four titles out, joins a growing kid lit market in India (reports from 2019 indicated a 14% to 18% growth in the segment). Digital classes and pandemic screen time have meant that parents have been looking for ways to engage their children. And publishers are delivering. We will see The Big Thoughts of Little Luv by filmmaker Karan Johar and a series of picture books by Nobel Prize winner Esther Dufflo, both from Juggernaut. Anand Neelakantan’s debut novel, Asura: Tale of the Vanquished (2012), has been reimagined as The Very Extremely, Most Naughty Asura Tales for Kids (Puffin). Indie publishers such as Tara Books have been promoting cross-cultural stories under their Travelling Titles collection, while Tulika has a multilingual podcast with Spotify, with stories and songs every Friday.  Podar and her team also used the lockdown to fine-tune their work. Aimed at ages four and above, the books are designed to be relatable to children across the country. “We wanted to talk about the world around them without getting preachy, and so we looked for nuanced and layered messaging,” she says. To this end, they have gone with animal protagonists and picture books. Just in time for the festive season, Cat’s Diwali is a reminder of what furry family members experience during our human celebrations. The storylines in One More Does Matter, Lana and Try Your Best, Patrick are simple, with art by in-house illustrator Urvashi Dubey. Even as there is an increase in e-reading, one might wonder if this is a good time to launch a line of books. Kavita Gupta Sabharwal, co-founder of Bengaluru-based Neev Literature Festival, says yes. “They are an antidote to the ennui brought by too much time spent online. As a wise child once told me, ‘Reading on the web distracts me, but reading a book makes me slow down and think’.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/down-daffodil-lane/article33045199.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Out of the sea||A few luxury watch brands have been using ocean plastic for some time, like Panerai and Breitling. Last month, Tom Ford announced the launch of the first high-end wristwatch crafted from 100% recycled ocean plastic. And then there is Ulysse Nardin. Earlier this week, the Swiss watch manufacturer launched an eco-friendly diver’s watch called the Ulysse Nardin Diver NET. Using renewable resources recently seen in their ‘R-Strap’ (made from recycled fishing nets), this concept timepiece is yet another example of luxury taking the sustainable route. A video that explored the process from fishing net to final product was presented to over 150 watch reviewers from across the globe. Live conversations with Vendée Globe participants (and Ulysse Nardin ambassadors) brought the action on the seas up close: Vendée Globe, sailing’s ultimate test, begins off the coast of France on Sunday. A Ulysse Nardin UN-118 automatic movement drives the eco-friendly Diver NET, which holds a 60-hour power reserve and 300-meter water resistance. While the watch is not available to purchase yet, this is one to track. Details: ulysse-nardin.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/out-of-the-sea/article33045204.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||5 commandments to dining out||Last weekend, chef Prateek Sadhu, co-founder of Masque — the Mumbai restaurant that won the Miele One to Watch Award at Asia’s 50 Best Restaurant earlier this year — put up an Instagram post calling out diner behaviour that has been angering many of India’s top restaurants for a while now. “Last night, on Saturday, a group of 10 guests failed to turn up after confirming their booking at Masque Lab. Now here’s the thing, we only have 12 seats in the house. Think about the implications of this reckless act,” the post reads. No-shows are just one of the poor guest behaviours that restaurants the world over have always taken in their stride. However, with the pandemic shuttering so many businesses even as the rest struggle to survive, unthinking lack of etiquette has graver implications for our eating-out culture. Last minute cancellations mean that restaurants already operating at half their capacity are unable to sell the seats they could have otherwise. “If this continues, we may as well shut. There is no way we can survive,” says Sadhu. Top restaurants are now devising ways in which bookings can be charged, redeemable against what you eat and drink. Till now, this has not been a wide-spread practise in India because most find it cumbersome to build in e-commerce payment links into their reservation systems. “We tried doing it through a reservation platform before the pandemic, but we found the number of bookings dropped. People did not like the idea of paying in advance,” says restaurateur Gauri Devidayal. If you are stepping out to eat out this festive season, be mindful of the new etiquette restaurant dining now demands. Here’s a checklist:   If you have made a reservation, keep it. Restaurants and their staff are struggling, and it is a crushing blow to them if guests decide to not show up. Emergencies happen, but call in advance if you can’t make it. Not wait till they have put the soufflé in the oven! Thou shalt eat (and not only take selfies)! Anyone visiting a restaurant is a welcome guest. However, a peculiar problem arises if guests choose to focus more on taking ‘I have arrived’ photos than actually enjoying their meal. Sure, going to a top restaurant is as much about your social media vanity as indulging your palate, but try to order a ‘reasonable’ amount of food, pocket and stomach permitting. “A group of 10 did not even run up a bill of Rs. 10,000 one evening, but they took 40 pictures,” says a distressed chef of a restaurant where an average meal for two is in the range of Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000. Precisely cooking your meal, plating it up beautifully, with the sommelier recommending a wine, and the hostess greeting you by name, all have a cost which is met from what you eat. So don’t get that elaborate machinery cranking if all you really want is a picture for the gram! Thou shalt not abandon masks Now that Gucci, Fendi and even Nykka are making necessity fashionable, use your mask to make a statement but don’t take it off the moment you hit Goa, currently the destination for vacationers, with most of its restaurants reopening. “People seem to think that the moment they get here, the pandemic has fled,” says a worried hotelier. For those who still don’t know: the protocol is to keep masks on while indoors and take them off only to eat. This ensures the safety of your fellow diners and wait staff, who are exposed to so many people every day. Thou shalt follow rules This one is for restaurants and their owners. We know that business is limping back to pre-pandemic normal, but that is only because people are trusting owners to follow safety and hygiene protocols. Please don’t be tempted to cut corners. Hand sanitising, distancing between tables, and employee checks are still musts. Thou shalt learn to say ‘no’ This is not a life lesson; it is an exhortation to restaurants to find the strength to keep out unruly customers. If diners are irresponsible, showing symptoms, not masking or socially distancing, show them the door. It is akin to a bar’s responsibility to protect, say, women from unruly drunken behaviour. Except, in this case, the implications are even graver.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||With the stroke of a pen…||If you have seen some of the work that Charlie Hebdo produces, you will know that it takes on everything and everybody — it has depicted the Christian trinity with as much scathing impudence as it has the Pope. It has lampooned presidents and queens. And it has featured Prophet Mohammad. The magazine’s stock in trade is irreverence. Cartoons use gentle mockery or stinging satire to throw an issue into sharp relief and thereby hold it up for scrutiny. As the Pulitzer-winning political cartoonist Steve Benson once said, cartoonists are the “canaries in the coal mine” — they alert humans to cracks in the system. Beheading the canary is hardly a smart thing to do. There have been at least three incidents in recent memory when Prophet Mohammad has been the subject of cartoons and on all three occasions, extremists have responded with violence. Before the shooting at the Charlie Hebdo office in 2015, a set of cartoons published in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005 met with violent protests, threats, and even diplomatic stand-offs. And in 2007, Bangladesh’s biggest newspaper, Prothom Alo, published a cartoon strip that saw massive unrest in the country and the arrest of cartoonist Arifur Rahman. Up until the 1500s, the Catholic Church simply burned at the stake heretics or disbelievers or anyone really that it disagreed with. Queen Mary, nicknamed Bloody Mary, had more than 300 Protestants put to death. Her sister Elizabeth I hanged and quartered Catholics. It was an age when all of Europe considered religious dissent or even just atheism an “infection of the body politic” that had to be cauterized. Between 1400 and 1800, some 50,000 people were burnt to death in Europe for ‘witchcraft’, which modern historians believe was nothing but the Church’s way of appeasing the faithful by exterminating random people deemed ‘devil-worshippers’. We have come a long way from those days. Putting someone to death for their disagreeable views on gods, religions, kings, or prime ministers is no longer deemed agreeable. Of course, one can be angered or offended or disgusted by such views, but sane voices point out that the same freedom of speech that allows the ‘heretic’ or ‘blasphemous’ book or painting or cartoon to exist allows one to stage a protest march or write angry op-eds or draw an angrier cartoon. TheQuranitself, as some experts explain, says that blasphemers will be punished in the hereafter, clearly leaving the right of chastisement to God. At any rate, we are no longer in the dark ages, and violence and savagery, howsoever grave the provocation, is not the mark of civilised nations. ‘Provocation’ itself is too subjective a concept — Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people in a New Zealand mosque last year, claimed to have been ‘provoked’ by ‘Islamic terror’. The religious fundamentalists who murdered Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, MM Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh were ‘provoked’ by their rationalist, secular writings. At what point on the scales of justice do we allow offended sensibilities to tip over against human lives? The idea of modernity, of progress and civilisation means that we no longer allow heretics or apostates to be burned at the stake nor non-believers to be converted by the sword. This understanding that diverse beliefs or even the absence of belief has legitimacy means that religion is not forbidden ground for critics and cartoonists in modern democracies. When fanatics demanded that the film PK , which mocked Hindu superstitions, be banned, the state rightly refused, and French President Macron has said that newspapers and magazines have the right to publish any caricature. After the 2005 controversy, Jyllands-Posten journalist Flemming Rose wrote in The Washington Post : “The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions... They made a point: we are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding Muslims.” That’s what satire does — treats nothing as sacrosanct, mocks everything. Actually, American cartoonist Bill Mauldin said it better: “Ours is the role of the lowly gadfly,” he said, “We circle and stab, circle and stab…” By taking jabs at everyone, satire equalises. And if there’s one thing democracies are premised on, it is equality. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/with-the-stroke-of-a-pen/article33045299.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Lavazza’s Chaplin-inspired 2021 calendar||This May, Italian coffee company Lavazza launched its new global communication campaign, Good Morning Humanity. Based on actor-filmmaker Charlie Chaplin’s speech in The Great Dictator 80 years ago — which exhorted people not to despair in the face of trials and tribulations — the ad showcased stunning landscapes and portraits by photographers such as Steve McCurry and Jerome Sessini. It was a way for the brand to ‘look positively to the future that awaits us’. Chaplin’s call for peace has gained relevance in the last few months, and so Lavazza’s much-awaited 2021 calendar, themed ‘The New Humanity’, is an extension of the campaign. Much like earlier editions (shot in Vietnam and Hawaii), this one is also centered around sustainability, but what makes it different is how it was conceived and conceptualised during lockdown. The 2021 edition “has 13 shots that, through the maximum freedom of each artist, their personal gaze and their particular style, bring back a new and positive vision of humanity,” says Francesca Lavazza, Board Member Lavazza Group. Proceeds from the sale of 1,000 calendars and photograph auctions will go towards Gurugram-based NGO Save the Children’s project. We speak to two photographers about working on the 2021 edition: Ami Vitale and ‘the ancient footsteps’ Featuring the feet of Africa’s Samburu tribe, Vitale’s chosen image is themed on reimagining our relationship with nature. The photographer explains that the image was taken during lockdown in northern Kenya. “Twenty years ago, this landscape was empty of wildlife as poachers had decimated the elephants, the ecosystem’s engineers,” says Vitale. Today, the Samburu people have become the elephants’ greatest protectors. They have created Africa’s first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary, Reteti. “This oasis where the orphans grow up, learning to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds, is a story as much about the elephants as it is about all of humanity,” says Vitale. Martin Schoeller For 2021’s Lavazza calendar, the master of close-ups has taken his love for details up a notch with an image of 25 eyes taken earlier this year. “It is tough to get a hard read of a person by looking at a picture,” he says. The one thing that you can glean from looking at a good portrait, however, is “a sense of something that brings us together as humans”. As for the eyes, he says while they are all unique, they fill the same purpose. “It goes to show that we have the same organs and eyes, and we see the same way. We think we are so individual, but we are closer to each other than we think.” As an artist, what is it about our current interactions on Zoom and Instagram Lives that pique his interest? “I like Instagram because I can show and tell the stories that I find important. As for Zoom, I don’t enjoy it much as it is impersonal. I miss human interactions. A lot has got lost with us just staring at a screen all day long. It is sad,” he concludes.  The calendar launches on November 12 on lavazza.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/lavazzas-chaplin-inspired-2021-calendar/article33045308.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Out of the sea||A few luxury watch brands have been using ocean plastic for some time, like Panerai and Breitling. Last month, Tom Ford announced the launch of the first high-end wristwatch crafted from 100% recycled ocean plastic. And then there is Ulysse Nardin. Earlier this week, the Swiss watch manufacturer launched an eco-friendly diver’s watch called the Ulysse Nardin Diver NET. Using renewable resources recently seen in their ‘R-Strap’ (made from recycled fishing nets), this concept timepiece is yet another example of luxury taking the sustainable route. A video that explored the process from fishing net to final product was presented to over 150 watch reviewers from across the globe. Live conversations with Vendée Globe participants (and Ulysse Nardin ambassadors) brought the action on the seas up close: Vendée Globe, sailing’s ultimate test, begins off the coast of France on Sunday. A Ulysse Nardin UN-118 automatic movement drives the eco-friendly Diver NET, which holds a 60-hour power reserve and 300-meter water resistance. While the watch is not available to purchase yet, this is one to track. Details: ulysse-nardin.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/out-of-the-sea/article33045307.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Move to the dark side||It’s a myth that dark and moody colours are dreary and sombre. These shades are rich, cosy, and inviting. Navy, dark chocolate, charcoal, grey, purple… they might be unconventional hues for décor, but are quite the rage right now. If you’re iffy about going bold and out of your comfort zone with them, here’s why and how you should be incorporating these tones. 1. They make a room feel more intimate  Dark coloursare called moody for a reason. They’re ambient and make a room feel more intimate. They’re best used in bedrooms, entertaining rooms, and large living spaces. An evening of deep conversations is best enjoyed surrounded by these colours. 2. The shades add drama  Dark is alwaysmore dramatic. Add drama to your living space by going for deep colours. It will be a lot more appealing to your guests. 3. They make for great contrast options  While addingdrama, go a step ahead and work an interesting contrast; contrasting wall colours, walls and furniture or textiles. Deep reddish brown and white and bridal or petal pink set off by deep brown, for instance. 4. They highlight other design elements  Even if you have plain-looking furniture or other décor elements, rich colours will highlight them and make furniture and other accessories seem luxurious by themselves. Architectural features such as crown mouldings and window trims also enjoy attention thanks to dark walls. 5. They make for a striking backdrop  A charcoalor eggplant-coloured wall as the backdrop for your eclectic collection of artwork will make it look artistic. Photo frames or paintings, anything goes against deep colours. 6. Just one dark wall is enough  Such is thepower of a deep tone! Even if you have just one wall that has a dark colour, it will add the needed luxurious look. This is especially great if you are wary of going all out and painting all the walls dark. 7. Choose colours that will reflect light  Dark shouldmean intimate, cosy, cocooning, but not cheerless. For that, go for colours that will reflect natural light and not absorb it. Mint green, bright green or lacquered blue are great options. 8. Try a tone-on-tone scheme  A tone-on-tonecolour scheme feels snug, especially if you choose the colour well. Try plum or eggplant colours that look sophisticated. Furniture, walls, rugs, and upholstery can be in the same scheme to enhance the effect. Shades of purple are anyway a symbol of royalty. 9. For a comfortable feel  Whether the blue of the sea or the lakeside, combine dark shades of blue with grey to get a laidback and easy vibe thanks to its aqua feel. You can go for camel, neutral colours, and green with this combination for your linens. 10. Try green for energy  Hunter green, emerald green, or fern green… pick your choice and you will have an energetic look in your room. Fern green, especially, will lend a vibrant vibe to your space.  Rich colours like navy, dark chocolate, charcoal, grey and purple are popular choices||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/move-to-the-dark-side/article33045342.ece
07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Go big or go home||Across cities, the trend of office work shifting into our homes — the much-talked-about work-from-home (WFH) effect — has gained prominence. A home office, previously considered a luxury or even completely unnecessary, is now an important feature in our living spaces. It not only helps home owners separate work from personal life to some extent, but enables the focus required for optimal WFH productivity. WFH as the ‘new normal’ Many companies have discovered first-hand that WFH is a viable option and are willing to extend it to employees who can maintain productivity under these changed circumstances. Some companies have even given their employees a permanent WFH option, while others have extended it to mid-2021. Like their owners, homes too need to multitask efficiently given the current scenario. A separate workspace is therefore essential, and many home buyers are willing to shift to cheaper suburbs and even to smaller cities to get larger homes. In most cities, home buyers are opting for 2.5-3 BHK configurations wherever they can purchase them within their budgets. While peripheral areas of our cities are invariably cost-effective, buyers look at a large home as a secure investment for what are currently less-than-certain times. Even in other respects, the quest for bigger homes is not a surprising trend. A natural progression Most Indians begin their home ownership journey with small ‘starter’ homes, fully intending to upgrade to a sizeable space at a later stage. Upgrade decisions are usually taken when finances improve on the back of higher salaries, as a better income improves affordability. Earlier, home prices would grow inexorably over time. However, salaries and savings grew too, so there would eventually come a point when one could comfortably afford to buy a larger home via a home loan. No doubt, a question mark currently floats above the issue of salary increments in the immediate future. The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously dampened India’s economic vibrancy, stifling companies’ growth prospects in some instances and actually causing them to scale back their manpower in other instances. Many retained employees have taken temporary salary cuts. Nevertheless, housing affordability has improved in tandem with the times. To boost consumption, the RBI has brought lending rates down to a two-decade low and thrown several other sweeteners into the mix. In Maharashtra, stamp duty charges have been brought down for the duration of the festive season. On their part, developers have not only trimmed prices to their lowest best, but also responded to the current exigencies by offering several cost-saving incentives. Moreover, serious buyers can negotiate the final price like never before. Buyer profiles Those looking at buying big homes primarily comprise salaried people who either already own a home or were in the process of finalising their first purchase. Current home owners merely need to upgrade, and first-time buyers just need to set their sights higher. Across the major cities, buyers are viewing home ownership with a renewed sense of urgency and are factoring in the new WFH environment. The second buyer group is the entrepreneur community. The Indian home buyer population is not exclusively salary-driven and has a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. Many small-time business owners are now relocating their previous workplaces to their homes to save on office rental costs and the daily commute. Space matters Interestingly, latest trends suggest that cities like Bengaluru and MMR are especially conforming to the new WFH reality — the need for more space. For instance, over the last few months, enquiries for larger homes in Bengaluru have increased up to 40% with property seekers predominantly scouting for 3BHKs (avg. 1,800 sq. ft. built-up area) as against the previously-preferred 2 BHKs. The current buyers are largely working couples with children, most currently pursuing the WFH and e-learning options. In many cases, their budgets have not increased. Instead, they are willing to settle for peripheral locations to secure bigger homes and a better lifestyle at a more affordable price. Likewise, we are also seeing an increase in enquiries for bigger spaces in MMR. In previous months, many buyers sought to upgrade from 1 BHK to 2 BHKs. In Noida and Ghaziabad, an increasing number of buyers are looking for 3 or 4 BHKs, as opposed to the previously-preferred 2 BHKs. Those with lower budgets look for 2 BHK + study (2.5) of around 1,200 sq. ft. of built-up area. In Gurgaon, demand for both 2 and 3 BHKs is as consistent as before. In Hyderabad, the preference for large homes of minimum 3 BHK was in place even before the pandemic and its fallout. Making a case No matter how disruptive the COVID-19 pandemic is, it will eventually be contained. The economy is already recovering, and employment will not only stabilise, but grow. Eventually, many people will return to their offices. Nevertheless, some of the lessons we have learned will not be unlearned. For instance, the WFH condept works, but it needs larger homes. Also, cutting out the daily commute saves both time and money, simultaneously boosting productivity and job satisfaction. The previously trendy ‘compact’ homes are only viable when we can work in an external office. Perhaps the two strongest messages we have received from the COVID-19 pandemic are that our homes are the only environments that we can actually control, and it makes sense to not only own this precious domain but to make it as large as possible.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Mumbai’s luxury boom||Beginning the festive quarter on a distinct upbeat note, South-Central Mumbai localities witnessed luxury home sales worth Rs. 500 crore in October. In 2019, the corresponding period saw luxury sales worth approximately Rs. 150 crore, thus improving sales by >230%. South-central localities of Worli, Prabhadevi, Mahalaxmi, Tardeo and Lower Parel, among others, witnessed average ticket prices beginning at Rs. 4 crore onwards. These micro markets host some of the biggest and most prestigious luxury housing projects in the city, and thus attract business honchos, sports personalities and other celebrities, start-up founders and C-Suite professionals. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, says, “The limited-period stamp duty cut of 3% up to December 2020 and 2% between January-March 2021 has had an impact even in Mumbai’s hyper-expensive luxury locales. At such steep ticket prices, even HNIs are not impervious to potential savings.” The offers currently rolled out by developers are also pushing sales in these markets. “The stamp duty cut alone helps buyers save at least Rs. 12 lakh on a property worth Rs. 4 crore, and the saving increases in tandem with the average property cost. The pandemic impact on this clientèle is seen to be minimal, with buyers largely scouting for ready homes or those nearing completion,” adds Puri. What the numbers reveal As per Anarock research, the unsold stock in South-central Mumbai localities has reduced by over 5% in a year — from approx. 11,870 units as on Q3 2019-end, it had decreased to nearly 11,300 units by Q3 2020-end. Luxury housing developers active in these micro-markets, previously struggling to sell unsold stock here, are breathing easier now. Previous years’ data indicates that unsold stock in these premium localities had risen by 8% in 2019 as against 2018. As on Q3 2018-end, the unsold stock in the localities collectively was over 11,000 units which increased to 11,870 units by Q3 2019-end. Back in Q3 2017-end, the unsold inventory in South-central localities was merely 8,350 units. This area of Mumbai has traditionally ranked as the most aspirational residential destination in the city, housing the financial capital’s business magnates, film stars, prominent sports personalities and other celebrities. This phenomenon continues, even though newer precincts are competing with South-central Mumbai’s legacy areas, especially among the nouveau riche . The limited new supply in highly aspirational South-central Mumbai continues to command a premium among wealthy buyers.

We’ve been forced to stay indoors, cut down our visits to stores and even reduce our reliance on the availability of fresh food and water from external sources. In a way, COVID-19 has highlighted the problems with globalisation and has put the limelight on the importance of being self-sufficient. One of the key aspects of being self-sufficient is to grow our own food. Doing so will not only guarantee food security, but also ensure the food we consume is free of pesticides and harmful chemicals. Although more plausible in independent homes with large vacant areas, food gardens are also being set up in balconies and rooftops of apartments. In fact, roof gardens also provide us with the added benefit of cooling our indoor spaces below, reducing our energy requirements and making it easier to be energy-efficient with a lower capital expenditure. Current technology has also made possible vertical gardening and the use of hydroponics — growing plants without soil — which has proven to yield more and occupy less space. Drip and automated irrigation systems controlled by sensors and timers can also be brought in to save water. Community food gardens could also be thought about as they would incorporate a larger area and provide food for the entire neighbourhood. Another aspect of self sufficiency is to ensure water security. We need to adequately harvest and capture rainwater, treat waste water and reuse the same. These two tasks along with the use of efficient water fixtures will make us water-secure and reduce our reliance on the natural resource from external sources. Rainwater from rooftops, once filtered, can be directly channelled into a sump for domestic use. Black water (water from toilet flushes) and grey water (water from kitchens, wash basins, washing machines) should be treated separately and reused appropriately. The resulting treated water can be used for flushing and gardening. While channelling grey water, it will be imperative to ensure the use of filters to remove grease, oil and other solid contaminants. Use of natural and organic cleaners and soaps will avoid harsh chemicals and microbeads in the treated water. Periodic monitoring and testing of treated water will be required. Appropriately treated and monitored grey water can even be used to irrigate our food gardens thus leading to a cycle of self-sufficiency at least in terms of food and water, ensuring we are better prepared for the next crisis.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Tackling unauthorised construction||Our builder formed an owner’s association in 2014 to avail certain regulatory sanctions for the project from various government authorities. The association has not been renewed for the last five years nor has the Annual General Meeting (AGM) been convened for the same period. The Register of Membership, books of accounts, audited balance sheet and bank account have not been maintained so far as well. On the insistence of owners, the builder conducted an election in December 2019 and a new Executive Committee (EC) was formed. The AGM was not convened by the erstwhile EC of the association. The builder has applied for the renewal of the association and an approval for the newly elected EC that is still pending for disposal by the concerned authority. Given the circumstances I have the following queries: 1. Will the erstwhile association become defunct due to its non-renewal and non-maintainance/submition of the statutory records to the Registrar of Societies every year? 2. Is the election conducted by the builder (instead of the EC) in order? 3. The application of the association’s renewal after a gap of five years and the approval of the new EC is yet to be authorised by the Registrar of Societies. The certificate of renewal is yet to be obtained too. In the absence of this certificate, does the newly elected EC have any legal powers to enter into any agreement and sign the handover documents with the builder? 4. The enrolment of owners as members of the association has not yet been done. Is it compulsory for the owner to become a member of the association? Vasudha G. Urapakkam Since you have mentioned that the application for renewal of the association is pending, you have to wait for the outcome of the said application. Grant of renewal will depend on the records being in order. If rejected/ refused, the erstwhile association will become defunct and the election held by the builder will be invalid. In this event, the present elected members may treat themselves as an ad-hoc committee, form a new association and hold a fresh election. The newly formed association, in their general body meeting, can ratify prior acts of the ad-hoc committee. Every flat owner should participate in formation of an association as provided in Sec. 19 (9) of RERA. A friend’s neighbour constructed a house and it’s plan is a deviation from the original. He has built six shops in front of his house on government property (open space). If we complain, will it be demolished? Will my friend be questioned by authorities? Annada Shankar Chennai Any construction ought to be carried out only after obtaining approvals and sanctions for putting up the same from the competent authority such as CMDA or Corporation of Chennai or DTCP or local body depending on the location and size of the plot. Approvals are normally given with certain stipulations and guidelines on setback spaces, height of the building (number of floors) and other aspects of construction. If there is any deviation or violation, a complaint can be given to the sanctioning authority and they will take necessary action which may include levy of fine, demolition or sealing of the premises. Should either party take the matter to Court for any reason, violation of any order passed by the Court may entail imprisonment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/tackling-unauthorised-construction/article33045339.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||The home market’s recovery||The 99acres Insite Report — a quarterly analysis focusing on capital and rental price trends in the residential market across India’s top eight cities — reveals that the home buying sentiment has shown improvement. This is due to public sector banks and private players slashing home loan interest rates to a 15-year low. Reduced rates, coupled with the resumption of construction work, helped take the enquiries up by 80% of pre-COVID times. Developers reported a 50% recovery in the number of transactions. The resale segment remained under pressure with deals closing at a 2-5% discounted rate on average. With an addition of over 31,000 units in metro cities, new launches went up by 4.5 times, QoQ. Speaking on the report, Maneesh Upadhyaya, Chief Business Officer, 99acres.com, said, “The Jul-Sep 2020 quarter set the pace for the recovery of the Indian residential real estate market. Post an initial lull in sales and new launches in the previous quarter, the current quarter came as a breather as sales resurged by almost 2.5 times of the pre-COVID levels.” Both Delhi NCR and Mumbai, he says, saw a significant improvement in transactions, QoQ, as end-users flocked to leverage the lucrative deals floating in the market. “Price correction, unlike anticipated, remained a far cry; however, with a negotiation window of up to 10-15%, the deals closed in at a reduced price of 2-5% of the pre-COVID levels,” added Upadhyaya. The gradual recovery, post the COVID-19 outbreak, was evident from the sale of about 33,000 units in Jul-Sep 2020; 2.5 times of the sales reported in Apr-Jun 2020, i.e. 9,700 units. Mumbai and Delhi led other metro cities in terms of sales volume and constituted about 29% and 22% of the total transactions, respectively. The quoted property prices remained unchanged across cities. However, with offers, discounts and negotiations on the table, transactions closed at a corrected price of about 2-5% on an average. The worst affected were Chennai and Delhi-NCR, which bore the brunt of a high disparity in demand and supply. Bengaluru and Hyderabad were the only markets that sustained prices amid the pandemic and the resultant economic downturn due to the dominance of end-users and a favourable demand-supply equation. The report also looked at how the construction industry reported a surge in activities this quarter. The sector is expected to witness a strong recovery to the tune of almost 12% in 2021. Piggy-backing on this, the realty sector may also see a resurgence in demand, supply and absorption in the festive quarter of Oct-Dec 2020. With the government handholding developers, homebuyers and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) through the tough times, the rebound is most likely on the cards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-home-markets-recovery/article33045335.ece

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Go big or go home||Across cities, the trend of office work shifting into our homes — the much-talked-about work-from-home (WFH) effect — has gained prominence. A home office, previously considered a luxury or even completely unnecessary, is now an important feature in our living spaces. It not only helps home owners separate work from personal life to some extent, but enables the focus required for optimal WFH productivity. WFH as the ‘new normal’ Many companies have discovered first-hand that WFH is a viable option and are willing to extend it to employees who can maintain productivity under these changed circumstances. Some companies have even given their employees a permanent WFH option, while others have extended it to mid-2021. Like their owners, homes too need to multitask efficiently given the current scenario. A separate workspace is therefore essential, and many home buyers are willing to shift to cheaper suburbs and even to smaller cities to get larger homes. In most cities, home buyers are opting for 2.5-3 BHK configurations wherever they can purchase them within their budgets. While peripheral areas of our cities are invariably cost-effective, buyers look at a large home as a secure investment for what are currently less-than-certain times. Even in other respects, the quest for bigger homes is not a surprising trend. A natural progression Most Indians begin their home ownership journey with small ‘starter’ homes, fully intending to upgrade to a sizeable space at a later stage. Upgrade decisions are usually taken when finances improve on the back of higher salaries, as a better income improves affordability. Earlier, home prices would grow inexorably over time. However, salaries and savings grew too, so there would eventually come a point when one could comfortably afford to buy a larger home via a home loan. No doubt, a question mark currently floats above the issue of salary increments in the immediate future. The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously dampened India’s economic vibrancy, stifling companies’ growth prospects in some instances and actually causing them to scale back their manpower in other instances. Many retained employees have taken temporary salary cuts. Nevertheless, housing affordability has improved in tandem with the times. To boost consumption, the RBI has brought lending rates down to a two-decade low and thrown several other sweeteners into the mix. In Maharashtra, stamp duty charges have been brought down for the duration of the festive season. On their part, developers have not only trimmed prices to their lowest best, but also responded to the current exigencies by offering several cost-saving incentives. Moreover, serious buyers can negotiate the final price like never before. Buyer profiles Those looking at buying big homes primarily comprise salaried people who either already own a home or were in the process of finalising their first purchase. Current home owners merely need to upgrade, and first-time buyers just need to set their sights higher. Across the major cities, buyers are viewing home ownership with a renewed sense of urgency and are factoring in the new WFH environment. The second buyer group is the entrepreneur community. The Indian home buyer population is not exclusively salary-driven and has a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. Many small-time business owners are now relocating their previous workplaces to their homes to save on office rental costs and the daily commute. Space matters Interestingly, latest trends suggest that cities like Bengaluru and MMR are especially conforming to the new WFH reality — the need for more space. For instance, over the last few months, enquiries for larger homes in Bengaluru have increased up to 40% with property seekers predominantly scouting for 3BHKs (avg. 1,800 sq. ft. built-up area) as against the previously-preferred 2 BHKs. The current buyers are largely working couples with children, most currently pursuing the WFH and e-learning options. In many cases, their budgets have not increased. Instead, they are willing to settle for peripheral locations to secure bigger homes and a better lifestyle at a more affordable price. Likewise, we are also seeing an increase in enquiries for bigger spaces in MMR. In previous months, many buyers sought to upgrade from 1 BHK to 2 BHKs. In Noida and Ghaziabad, an increasing number of buyers are looking for 3 or 4 BHKs, as opposed to the previously-preferred 2 BHKs. Those with lower budgets look for 2 BHK + study (2.5) of around 1,200 sq. ft. of built-up area. In Gurgaon, demand for both 2 and 3 BHKs is as consistent as before. In Hyderabad, the preference for large homes of minimum 3 BHK was in place even before the pandemic and its fallout. Making a case No matter how disruptive the COVID-19 pandemic is, it will eventually be contained. The economy is already recovering, and employment will not only stabilise, but grow. Eventually, many people will return to their offices. Nevertheless, some of the lessons we have learned will not be unlearned. For instance, the WFH condept works, but it needs larger homes. Also, cutting out the daily commute saves both time and money, simultaneously boosting productivity and job satisfaction. The previously trendy ‘compact’ homes are only viable when we can work in an external office. Perhaps the two strongest messages we have received from the COVID-19 pandemic are that our homes are the only environments that we can actually control, and it makes sense to not only own this precious domain but to make it as large as possible.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Lavazza’s Chaplin-inspired 2021 calendar||This May, Italian coffee company Lavazza launched its new global communication campaign, Good Morning Humanity. Based on actor-filmmaker Charlie Chaplin’s speech in The Great Dictator 80 years ago — which exhorted people not to despair in the face of trials and tribulations — the ad showcased stunning landscapes and portraits by photographers such as Steve McCurry and Jerome Sessini. It was a way for the brand to ‘look positively to the future that awaits us’. Chaplin’s call for peace has gained relevance in the last few months, and so Lavazza’s much-awaited 2021 calendar, themed ‘The New Humanity’, is an extension of the campaign. Much like earlier editions (shot in Vietnam and Hawaii), this one is also centered around sustainability, but what makes it different is how it was conceived and conceptualised during lockdown. The 2021 edition “has 13 shots that, through the maximum freedom of each artist, their personal gaze and their particular style, bring back a new and positive vision of humanity,” says Francesca Lavazza, Board Member Lavazza Group. Proceeds from the sale of 1,000 calendars and photograph auctions will go towards Gurugram-based NGO Save the Children’s project. We speak to two photographers about working on the 2021 edition: Ami Vitale and ‘the ancient footsteps’ Featuring the feet of Africa’s Samburu tribe, Vitale’s chosen image is themed on reimagining our relationship with nature. The photographer explains that the image was taken during lockdown in northern Kenya. “Twenty years ago, this landscape was empty of wildlife as poachers had decimated the elephants, the ecosystem’s engineers,” says Vitale. Today, the Samburu people have become the elephants’ greatest protectors. They have created Africa’s first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary, Reteti. “This oasis where the orphans grow up, learning to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds, is a story as much about the elephants as it is about all of humanity,” says Vitale. Martin Schoeller For 2021’s Lavazza calendar, the master of close-ups has taken his love for details up a notch with an image of 25 eyes taken earlier this year. “It is tough to get a hard read of a person by looking at a picture,” he says. The one thing that you can glean from looking at a good portrait, however, is “a sense of something that brings us together as humans”. As for the eyes, he says while they are all unique, they fill the same purpose. “It goes to show that in the greater scheme of things, we have the same organs and eyes, and we see the same way. We think we are so individual, but we are closer to each other than we think.” As an artist, what is it about our current interactions on Zoom and Instagram Lives that pique his interest? “I like Instagram because I can show and tell the stories that I find important. As for Zoom, I don’t enjoy it much as it is impersonal. I miss human interactions. A lot has got lost with us just staring at a screen all day long. It is sad,” he concludes.

07 November 2020||November 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Real stories for urban kids||“I don’t know why we have not told these stories before,” muses Shobha Viswanath, creative director and co-founder of children’s publishers, Karadi Tales. Continuing their aim of bringing “Indian stories to Indian children”, their new imprint, Minmini Reads, has brought out five books in collaboration with People’s Archives of Rural India (PARI). The stories are inspired by news reports filed by journalists for the online journal. “Urban children need to read stories that don’t reflect just their lives and milieu, but that of others starkly different from their own,” she says. In author Aparna Karthikeyan’s No Nonsense Nandhini , Vishaka George’s House of Uncommons , Subuhi Jiwani’s No Ticket Will Travel , Nivedha Ganesh’s The Big Splash and Priti David’s Coming Home , young readers will do just that. “These are stories about real people and real lives, not dreamed up,” P Sainath, senior journalist and founder of PARI, says, adding that he hopes children and parents alike will find the hard-to-put-down books a gentle introduction to the larger reality of India. The series, aimed at middle-schoolers between the ages of 10 and 15, is particularly compelling in these times. After all, urban India only sat up to take notice when images of thousands of hungry and exhausted migrant labourers walking back home were beamed into their living rooms during the early days of the pandemic. The books are written in simple English. The Big Splash tells the story of Dhivya, the daughter of a cotton farmer who swims like a fish despite having a deformed arm. Follow her journey to the Paralympics, as she learns lessons on controlling her temper and keeping friends. In No Nonsense Nandhini, a woman farmer (and single mum), goes against patriarchal opinions, and dares to grow sampangi ( champak ) flowers instead of paddy on her land. The covers are beautifully illustrated by Tanvi Parulkar, a student at the National Institute of Design. Nandita Das, who launched the books on October 31, lauds the series, pointing out that rural lives and the realities of a diverse people are vanishing from our collective consciousness. “This ‘other’ India rarely finds mention in newspapers or television broadcasts,” she says. With plans for the books to be translated into Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu, Viswanath hopes that they will be well-received. “But whether there is a market for them or not, these stories have to be told,” she concludes.

07 November 2020||Bengaluru,||MEMU trains to be operated between city and Hosur||MEMU or Mainline Electric Multiple Unit trains will be operated from the city to Hosur once the Railway Board gives the green signal for services to resume across the country. Though the electrification of the line from Baiyappanahalli to Anekal was completed in March, the work on other sections was delayed due to the outbreak of the pandemic, among other reasons. In a press release on Friday, the South Western Railway (SWR) announced that it had opened Anekal – Periya Naga Thunai 44 km electrified line for traffic after Mr. Abhai Kumar Rai, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), conducted the statutory inspection on Thursday. The SWR plans to run MEMU trains once passenger services resume. Divisional Railway Manager (Bengaluru division) Ashok Kumar Verma said that once operational, it will benefit people working in various industrial sectors in Bellandur, Sarjapur, Electronics City, Bommasandra and other areas. “We have the required infrastructure to run MEMU trains on the line. Compared to conventional coaches, the time taken to operate these trains is less and we can increase frequency. Owing to COVID-19, we might not see a large number of passengers initially. We will run services as per demand,” said Mr Verma. The CRS inspection of the Railway Electrification works between Baiyyappanahalli (excluding) – Anekal (including) for a length of 38 km was already done and the line was commissioned in March 2020. Rail activist Mr. Sanjeev Dyammanavar said, “It is a good sign that even during the pandemic, the railways is working to upgrade its infrastructure. Operation of MEMU trains from city points towards Hosur will help thousands of people. People can use stations such as Bellandur, Carmelaram, Heelalige, Anekal and others to reach their workplace. It is not only this line, after resumption of passenger trains, the SWR should prioritise operation of suburban trains on the other line so that it will help from people travelling from neighbouring districts.” Rail activists have also demanded the authorities to provide basic amenities at the stations and last mile connectivity to reach workplaces. Speed limit increased The SWR has received the sanction to raise the maximum permissible speed between Yelahanka Junction and Chikkaballapur station (46.05 km) in the Bengaluru division from existing speed of 75 kmph to 100 kmph. A speed certificate issued by the Chief Planning and Design Engineer of SWR stated that the trial on the section was conducted on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/memu-trains-to-be-operated-between-city-and-hosur/article33045388.ece
07 November 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana hooch toll rises to 16||Four persons died in Sonipat and Panipat districts due to consumption of spurious liquor on Friday, taking the death toll in the hooch tragedy in the State to sixteen. Fourteen First Information Reports have been registered in the two districts so far and 12 people arrested. Superintendent of Police, Sonipat, Jashandeep Singh Randhawa told The Hindu over phone that three persons died in the district on Friday taking the death toll to nine. He added that five persons were under treatment in various hospitals, including two in a private hospital. “The autopsy has been conducted in eight cases so far and the viscera sent for further examination. Though all nine deaths are suspected to have been caused due to spurious liquor, the final confirmation can be done only after the viscera reports are received,” said Mr. Randhawa. Earlier in the week, the media reports had attributed 17 deaths in the districts to spurious liquor, but a four-member committee headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner Munish Kumar has, in its interim report, expressed likelihood that only one of the deaths was caused by consumption of illicit liquor. Later, four deaths related to hooch were caused on November 4 and another man died due to similar reason on Thursday. Four colonies in the district — Hanuman Nagar, Indian Colony, Shastri Colony and Mayur Vihar — spread across three police station areas of Mohana, City and Kharkhoda have reported most of the incidents of spurious liquor in Sonipat. Mr. Randhawa said 10 people, including a teacher, were arrested in connection with as many cases registered and raids were being mounted for more arrests. Three police officers, including the Station House Officer of Mohana Police Station, have been suspended for dereliction of duty.  Tour of affected villages Sonipat Deputy Commissioner Shyam Lal Poonia and Mr. Ranhawa together took rounds of two affected villages and advised people to get their medical examination done in case anyone had consumed spurious liquor. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Headquarters, Panipat, Satish Kumar, said the death toll in the district in the hooch tragedy rose to seven with one more death on Friday. Mr. Kumar said four cases were registered so far and two persons were arrested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-hooch-toll-rises-to-16/article33044935.ece
07 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Panel starts work to check stubble burning’||The Union government informed the Supreme Court on Friday that the new Commission to check stubble burning by farmers in the adjoining States of Delhi would start functioning this day. “The Commission will start functioning from today [November 6] itself,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde. Chief Justice Bobde said, “There are many Commissions working, but at the end they have to be effective”. The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance of 2020 was promulgated by the Centre recently. It is meant to both prevent and monitor stubble burning by farmers of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The air pollution caused by the indiscriminate burning of fields is choking Delhi. “We have representation from NGOs. They are experts in the field,” Mr. Mehta submitted. During the hearing, Chief Justice Bobde reminded that it was for the government to take timely steps to stop pollution. The government had the resources and money. “Ultimately we are a court of law. A court of law has limitations, not of power, but functionality”, he remarked. ‘Pollution has worsened Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for petitioners, said the pollution had worsened in Delhi. “Something drastic needs to be done,” he submitted. The court agreed to hear the case after Deepavali vacation — the whole of next week. On October 16, the apex court-appointed its former Judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, to a one-man committee to monitor/prevent stubble burning in U.P., Haryana and Punjab. But the decision was put on hold shortly thereafter when Mr. Mehta informed the Bench about the ordinance. On October 16, the court asked Justice Lokur with the help of student volunteer forces deployed from the National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides, to protect Delhi NCR from air pollution caused by stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and U.P. this winter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/panel-at-work-to-check-stubble-burning-centre/article33044760.ece

Digital classes and pandemic screen time have meant that parents have been looking for ways to engage their children. And publishers are delivering. We will see The Big Thoughts of Little Luv by filmmaker Karan Johar and a series of picture books by Nobel Prize winner Esther Dufflo, both from Juggernaut. Anand Neelakantan’s debut novel, Asura: Tale of the Vanquished (2012), has been reimagined as The Very Extremely, Most Naughty Asura Tales for Kids (Puffin). Indie publishers such as Tara Books have been promoting cross-cultural stories under their Travelling Titles collection, while Tulika has a multilingual podcast with Spotify, with stories and songs every Friday. Podar and her team also used the lockdown to fine-tune their work. Aimed at ages four and above, the books are designed to be relatable to children across the country. “We wanted to talk about the world around them without getting preachy, and so we looked for nuanced and layered messaging,” she says. To this end, they have gone with animal protagonists and picture books. Just in time for the festive season, Cat’s Diwali is a reminder of what furry family members experience during our human celebrations. The storylines in One More Does Matter, Lana and Try Your Best, Patrick are simple, with art by in-house illustrator Urvashi Dubey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/down-daffodil-lane/article33045482.ece

07 November 2020||New Delhi,||High Court asks CBI to respond to expelled BJP MLA Sengar’s plea||The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the CBI on an appeal by expelled Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar challenging his conviction in the death of the Unnao rape victim’s father in 2018. Justice Vibhu Bakhru asked the CBI to respond to the appeal while posting the case for further hearing on November 10. On March 13 last, a special court here sentenced Sengar and six others to 10 years imprisonment in two cases linked to the death. On March 4, Sengar was held guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). One of the cases related to the death of the victim’s father on April 9, 2018, while the other was for possession of illegal arms.  Death in custody As alleged, the girl’s father was assaulted following an altercation with some of the accused on April 3, 2018. He was taken to the area police station and charges were framed for allegedly possessing an illegal firearm and sent to judicial custody, during which he died. On December 20, 2019, a court sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment for raping the girl in 2017. Sengar, in his appeal filed through advocate Kanhaiya Singhal, claimed that the present case was an offshoot of a long-drawn political rivalry and deep-seated animosity existing between two political factions. The plea claimed that Sengar and the co-accused persons, who are BJP supporters, and one of the primary witnesses and his associates who, Mr. Sengar claimed, owe their allegiance to the Samajwadi Party. “It would not be preposterous to submit that in the instant case neither the justice was done nor seen to be done”, Sengar’s plea said.”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/high-court-asks-cbi-to-respond-to-expelled-bjp-mla-sengars-plea/article33044936.ece
