30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Metro services to resume next week, small meetings allowed||Metro rail services may resume from September 7 and congregations with a ceiling of 100 persons will be allowed from September 21 under the fresh set of Unlock 4 guidelines announced by the Union Home Ministry on Saturday. However, movement of passenger trains will continue to be regulated as per existing standard operating procedure. As per the new guidelines, there will be no prohibition on the consumption of alcohol and tobacco products in public places, implying that bars are allowed to function. However, lockdown measures will be implemented strictly in containment zones till September 30. The guidelines state that outside the containment zones, States will not be allowed to impose localised lockdowns at State, district, subdivision or city levels without the prior permission of the Union Home Ministry. Research labs While schools, colleges and educational institutions will remain shut till September 30, research scholars and students of technical or professional institutions that require laboratory work will be allowed to visit the premises. Students of Class 9-12 may be permitted to visit their schools, in areas outside the containment zones, on voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers, subject to written consent of their parents and guardians, the Ministry said. The States and Union Territories may permit up to 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff in schools for online teaching or tele-counselling and related work. Metro rail will be allowed to operate from September 7 in a graded manner and a detailed standard operating procedure will be issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). “Social, academic, sports, entertainment, religious, political functions and other congregations will be permitted with a ceiling of 100 persons with effect from 21 September. However, such limited gatherings can be held with mandatory wearing of face masks, social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and hand wash or sanitiser,” the Ministry said. Open air theatres can open from September 21. The guidelines were issued by the Home Ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, after it was invoked for the first time in March. Meanwhile, the total number of COVID-19 cases has surged past 35 lakh and more than 63,000 deaths have been reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/metro-services-to-resume-next-week-small-meetings-allowed/article32477607.ece
30 August 2020||Kolkata,||Cloud of uncertainty hangs over Durga Puja festivities in West Bengal||With less than two months to go for the biggest religious carnival in West Bengal, every discussion on the 2020 Durga Puja festival is shrouded in a cloud of uncertainty. The question that puja organisers, idol makers and every Bengali is grappling with is — how will the festival be organised this year in the midst of the pandemic? Kumartuli, the famous potter colony on the bank of the Hooghly river, bears a forlorn look, with few artisans and fewer not-fully-baked clay idols of deities waiting to travel to Puja marquees. Chaina Pal, who has earned the reputation of being one of the first female idol makers of the potters’ colony, and whose designs travelled far and wide even in China, is upset over how things are turning out. “We do not know what is going to happen. There is not even 30% of the business that was seen last year. Even those who are giving orders are asking for smaller idols,” Ms. Pal said. The Kumartuli artisan said that there was no clarity on how the Puja will be held this year, which had affected their business. Several restrictions For the thousands of clubs that organise this community celebration, it is the time of year when they start the preparations for erecting the Durga Puja pandal by doing a ‘Khuti Puja’ (a starting ritual). Not only have these events, which brought advertisers and stars to the Puja, faded away, in the wake of restrictions on the number of workers, a significant part of the available resources are being spent on protective gear. One club in Kolkata’s Ultadanga area has put up an image of the Goddess with masks in all hands. Jayanta Banerjee, one of the organisers of the Chorbagan Durga Puja in north Kolkata said 30% of the funds have been spent on ensuring that protection is in place for workers. “We cannot even employ more than 10 workers at a time,” he said. Durga Puja organisers are brainstorming on various ways to ensure that the religious carnival does not spread COVID-19 infections, often employing innovative means that sometimes border on the bizarre. Three organisers in a particular neighbourhood of south Kolkata have come together to have a “drive-in darshan”, where people can drive around the three puja  pandals, each built around the theme of one of the films in the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray to mark the 100th birth of the legendary filmmaker. Durga Puja committees are investing in everything from sanitation tunnels and giant projectors to installing ultra violet lights. A puja organiser has plans to close the pandal and switch on UV lights for 15 minutes after every group of devotees visits the pandal to “kill all the virus” and then allow the next group of visitors. The forum for Durgotsav, a collective of Durga Puja organisers, has announced a number of measures on how can the festival can be organised amidst the pandemic. The forum has made recommendations, including pandals that are not very high and are sanitised daily. All eyes are, however, on how the West Bengal government will control large gatherings during the festival? From Holi to Eid-ul Fitr, West Bengal, often referred to as the land of ‘ baro maase tero parbon ’ (13 festival in 12 months) has witnessed muted celebrations for several months. Social and political observers feel that it will not be possible for the State to completely put the Durga Puja festival on hold. Driver of economy Not only does the festival has a strong emotive appeal among the people but it is one of major drivers of the State’s economy. Estimates made over the past few years have revealed that the economy of the festival in West Bengal runs into thousands of crores of rupees. A report by ASSOCHAM in 2013 had pegged it at Rs. 25,000 crore and (then) growing at 35%. The Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) pegged it at no less than Rs. 50,000 crore. Even this could be an underestimate because such studies are not carried out regularly. “As the national economy is contracting this year, according to some by 5-10%, we expect the Durga Puja economy of Bengal to contract by the same, likely on the higher side. As uncertainty grips people, they hold on to their wallets. The festival [usually] creates a huge demand for new dresses, where reportedly there is a contraction of 50%,” Rajiv Singh, ICC’s director general, said. Mr. Singh added that Pujas would be held this year, albeit on a lower scale, and the focus should be on lowering the income inequality, and bringing back the smile to the face of the deprived and the needy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cloud-of-uncertainty-hangs-over-durga-puja-festivities-in-west-bengal/article32477968.ece
30 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Centre must borrow and pay States’ GST dues: Kerala||Kerala has rejected the two options for Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation mooted by the Centre at the 41st GST Council meeting earlier this week. Instead the State has asked the Centre to take a loan and provide compensation to the States. “We have decided to inform the Centre in writing that the State cannot agree to the two options put forward in the GST Council on August 27. Kerala wants the Centre to take a loan and provide GST compensation and this has the approval of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other Ministers,” Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Issac told a press conference here on Saturday. Under the two options put forward at the Council meeting, the first was a special window for States, in consultation with the RBI, to borrow [collectively] Rs. 97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate. The second option was to borrow the entire Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall under the special window. The Centre acknowledged that the States are likely to face a GST revenue gap of Rs. 3 lakh crore this year as the economy may contract due to COVID-19, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed an unforeseen “act of God”. At the GST Council meet, the Centre had distinguished between the shortfall due to GST implementation itself — claiming that this is the portion “hardwired” into the compensation law — and that caused by the impact of COVID-19. Lashing out at the Centre for “betraying” the States and the two options mooted, Dr. Issac said the proposals would lead to a financial loss for the State. “This shows the mindset of the Centre. It could have been resolved easily. But, the Centre has made it a big issue of the federal system. Even in the GST Council, except two BJP-ruled States, all other States wanted the Centre to take a loan and disburse it to them. The views of the States in the GST Council were ignored,” Dr. Issac said. He said Kerala would take the lead to arrive at a consensus on the issue by holding discussions with other States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-must-borrow-and-pay-states-gst-dues-kerala/article32477604.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Anti-national forces spreading hatred and violence, says Sonia||Anti-national and anti-poor forces are spreading venom of “hatred and violence” in our country, democratic institutions are being destroyed, lokshahi (democracy) is getting overwhelmed by tanashahi (dictatorship), Congress president Sonia Gandhi said on Saturday. She was addressing the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the new Chhattisgarh Assembly building to be built in Nava Raipur, through a recorded video message. Speaking in Hindi, Ms. Gandhi said, “There are new challenges in front of our country. Anti-national, anti-poor and divisive forces that are ruling us are spreading venom of hatred and violence, freedom of expression is in danger and democratic institutions are being destroyed. The influence of tanashahi is increasing on lokshahi ,” she said. ‘Voice suppressed’ Without naming anyone, Ms. Gandhi further said, they want to suppress the voice of the people of the country. “What do they want? They want people of the country, our youth, our tribal people, our women, our farmers, shopkeepers and small traders, jawans to keep their mouths shut. They want to keep the nation’s mouth shut,” she said. Stating that in two years, the country will complete 75 years of Independence, Ms. Gandhi said, “The Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, G.V. Mavalankar (Speaker of Constituent Assembly of India), Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and our other ancestors would have never imagined that even 75 years after Independence, the country will face such a difficult situation, when our Constitution and democracy are in danger.” Ms. Gandhi called on Congress leaders to “take a pledge that till the time we are in power, all our decisions are keeping in mind the last man in the line”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anti-national-forces-spreading-hatred-and-violence-says-sonia/article32477795.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Capital sees highest new cases in 50 days||Delhi on Saturday witnessed the highest daily new COVID-19 cases in about 50 days with 1,954 fresh cases being reported in the past 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the State government. The total number of cases stood at 1,71,366. The number of active cases, positivity rate, COVID-positive people in home isolation also increased on Saturday.

Of the total cases, 1,52,922 people have recovered and there are 14,040 active cases. The number of new cases is still less compared to June. On June 23, daily new cases touched almost 4,000, the highest so far, and since then it had been dropping. But earlier this week, the daily new cases hit a 30-day high and then breached the 1,500 mark after remaining below the level for 39 consecutive days. The number of active cases in the city on Saturday was the highest in over a month. The last time the number of active cases was more than this was on July 23 when the active cases were 14,554.

The number of containment zones in the city has seen a sharp jump in the last 10 days from 560 on August 19 to 803 on Saturday. The number such zones, especially the smaller ones, is likely to go up further, said officials. Though Delhi has a capacity to do around 11,000 RT-PCR tests in a day, only 6,597 such tests were done in the past 24 hours. The positivity was 8.8% on Saturday, which is higher than the levels earlier this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/capital-sees-highest-new-cases-in-50-days/article32477800.ece
30 August 2020||Kolkata,||State keen on resumption of Metro, local train services||The West Bengal government has written to the Centre expressing its opinion that Metro and local train services can be resumed in the State. “This is to bring to your notice that State government is of the view that Metro and local train services can be resumed in Bengal in a limited manner, maintaining the norms of physical distancing and health hygiene protocols,” State’s Home Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay wrote in a letter to Vinod Kumar Yadav, chairman, Railway Board. The letter dated August 28, came before the Unlock 4.0 restrictions were announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday, which allow Metro services from September 7. In the letter, Mr. Bandhopadhyay said “required modalities and logistics to ensure smooth operation of these services” should be worked out in consultation with the State before resumption of services. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said Metro services could be resumed in the city with proper safety restrictions . Kolkata Metro, the oldest underground Metro services in the country, which connects north and the south of the city, ferries about five lakh passengers on weekdays. The State government has already eased out restrictions on incoming flights to Kolkata from six cities starting September 1. Meanwhile, the West Bengal government continued with its stand on opposing the NEET and the JEE entrance examination, scheduled next month. “Amid this global pandemic, @DrRPNishank can you guarantee safety of nearly 30lakh students who have registered for JEE & NEET exams? With the transport system still not fully operational, why do you want to jeopardize their future so desperately? Immediately postpone the exams! (sic),” State’s Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-keen-on-resumption-of-metro-local-train-services/article32477965.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,||COVID-19 spread has been brought under control: CM||The spread of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu has been brought “under control”, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Saturday. Attributing the situation to a combination of steps taken by the State government in the last five months, the Chief Minister, in his concluding remarks at the ninth video-conference with Collectors since March 26, said the reduction in the spread had been achieved by testing of 75,000 samples every day through RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) and providing treatment at hospitals to those having symptoms. The Collectors should give priority to areas where the degree of infection was greater than in other parts, besides taking steps for more testing. Inaugurating the conference in the morning, Mr. Palaniswami said that as of now, the State’s recovery rate was 85.45%, with 3,49,682 persons having been cured of the disease, the “highest” in the country. The case mortality rate was 1.7%, the “lowest” in the country. He urged the Collectors to intensify execution of precautionary measures before the northeast monsoon set in and ensure that there was no accumulation of garbage or solid waste in urban areas. The State government had so far allocated over Rs. 7,162 crore towards measures aimed at containing the spread of the disease, treatment and relief. As many as 46 lakh reusable masks were distributed in Chennai and 72.56 lakh masks in the rest of the State. Agricultural activity was being taken up in a full-fledged way. This year, 4.11 lakh acres had been covered during the current ‘kuruvai’ season, against the target of 3.5 lakh acres. Against the usual procurement of 23 lakh tonnes of paddy, 30 lakh tonnes had been procured through the government-run outlets, which was “a record”, Mr. Palaniswami said. During the pandemic, the government had signed 42 memoranda of understanding, involving an investment of Rs. 31,464 crore, with a potential to generate 69,712 jobs. It had set apart Rs. 200 crore under the COVID-19 Relief & Upliftment Scheme to mitigate the hardship of micro, small and medium enterprises. The State had obtained sanction for around Rs. 7,518 crore under the Central government’s loan scheme for industrial units as a result of his (the Chief Minister’s) holding State-level bankers’ committee meetings and call for immediate disbursal of loans to the industry, Mr. Palaniswami said.

30 August 2020||KOCHI,||Kochi metro to be back on track from September 7||The Kochi metro will resume service from September 7 in a phased manner as part of Unlock-4 guidelines issued by the Centre binding on areas outside containment zones. Unlock 4 will take effect on September 1. Based on this, the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs will issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) binding on metro rail systems in the country, metro sources said. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) had recently rolled out a new protocol to ensure safety of passengers. As part of the protocol, metro trains will operate air conditioning at between 25 and 26 degrees Celsius, while they will halt at each station for 20 seconds longer for fresh air to circulate within the compartments. They will also be stationed at the terminal stations — Aluva and Pettah — for five minutes with all doors open. All this is apart from measures to disinfect trains after each trip. The trains will initially operate every 20 minutes. KMRL has also taken measures with regard to sanitisation and social distancing of passengers, among a host of other precautions. Ro-ro service The Fort Kochi-Vypeen roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) service of the Kochi Corporation resumed service on Friday, following lifting of containment zone regulations in Fort Kochi, bringing relief to commuters who relied on this easy, cost-effective service to commute between the two densely populated locales. Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), entrusted with operating the service, has exhorted commuters to abide by physical distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kochi-metro-to-be-back-on-track-from-september-7/article32477910.ece

30 August 2020||New Delhi,||L-G overturns CM, gives nod for NEET, JEE tests in Delhi||Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal has overturned Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s decision to postpone the NEET, JEE tests in Delhi, government sources said. According to the sources, Mr. Baijal’s decision to allow the exams to be conducted in the city as per the schedule in September was conveyed to the Delhi government on Saturday. The matter was broached at a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on August 19, following which a file related to it was moved by the Delhi government’s Revenue Department. The file, said the sources, contained the Revenue Department’s suggestion that the exams be postponed in the interest of the students. It was signed by Mr. Kejriwal who decided against holding the two examinations in view of the conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was, however, overturned by the L-G who gave the go-ahead for the exams to be held according to the schedule, said the sources. Sisodia letter Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia had written to Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Wednesday, urging him to postpone the examinations given the pandemic situation. “Our students are our future. They are being told that all arrangements are being made to ensure their safety from the coronavirus at the centres. These claims sound good, but we have thousands of examples where people have been infected despite taking several precautions,” Mr. Sisodia had written. “Despite the risk, if we still go ahead, we will be risking the lives of over 28 lakh students,” he had written in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/l-g-overturns-cm-gives-nod-for-neet-jee-tests-in-delhi/article32477796.ece
30 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,||‘Tonsuring’ case: Nutan Naidu’s wife among seven held||The police on Saturday arrested seven persons, including Priya Madhuri, 28, wife of Big Boss fame (Telugu) Nutan Naidu, on the charges of assaulting and tonsuring a 20-year-old Dalit youth on Friday. The police collected CCTV footage at Nutan Naidu’s house, which reportedly revealed that the accused thrashed and tonsured the youth, a resident of Pendurthi. The arrested included T. Indira Rani (26), housekeeping supervisor, Ch. Varahalu (35), Supervisor, I. Ravi Kumar (26), a barber, S Balagangadhar (29), M Jhansi (19) and M Sowjanya (29), staff at Nutan Naidu’s house. Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha said the youth worked as housekeeping boy at Nutan Naidu’s house from February to August 1. However, he left the job and took up another profession. On August 27, Varahalu asked the youth to come to the house. When the youth went to the house, Priya Madhuri allegedly accused him of stealing her iphone. Denying it, the youth left the house. On Friday, Varahalu asked him to come to the house at around 1 p.m. When the youth arrived, he was allegedly thrashed by some of the inmates and staff with sticks and steel rods. He was also allegedly verbally abused, said Mr. Sinha. Later, the accused called Ravi Kumar, who tonsured the youth. They allegedly threatened him not to reveal the incident to anyone, the police said. After the victim approached the Pendurthi police, a team rushed to the house and collected the evidence, including the CCTV footage, tonsured hair and the sticks used to beat the youth. The police said that after tonsuring the youth, a few of the accused reportedly took selfies with him and later they deleted it. However, their mobile phones were seized and the deleted data retrieved. The police booked cases under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and other sections such as including 342, 323, 506 r/w 34 IPC & 3(1)(e) & 3(2)(v) of SC/ST POA Act, 2015. Judicial remand “All the accused have been arrested and sent to judicial remand. Further, we will take them into police custody and ascertain more facts,” Mr. Sinha said. As of now, the police did not find any role of Nutan Naidu in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/filmmakers-wife-among-7-held-for-assault-on-dalit-youth-in-ap/article32477545.ece

30 August 2020||CHENNAI,||T.N. may broadly toe Centre’s Unlock 4 norms||The Tamil Nadu government may go along broadly with the ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines issued by the Centre on Saturday. The State government is believed to be considering, among other things, resumption of intra-district public transport and re-opening of hotels and resorts. Some more relief was also expected because of the State’s compulsion to allow more economic activities, especially in view of the expected gap in revenue through the Goods and Services Tax. Hinting that the State might largely align itself with the Centre’s latest guidelines, a source in the government said further details of the decision would be made known through a press release on Sunday. During the day-long deliberations at the Secretariat on Saturday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami held two sessions of video-conference with Collectors and other officials to take stock of the situation arising out of the COVID-19 lockdown, which would expire on Monday. He also met a team of medical experts. Until now, Tamil Nadu has retained the e-pass system for the movement of persons, though the Centre had recommended its abolition. A few days ago, the Chief Minister, during a visit to Cuddalore, made clear his government’s intention to retain e-passes and said the issuance of e-passes had been liberalised. The government’s position was that if the system was abolished, the authorities would not be able to perform the task of contact-tracing effectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-may-broadly-toe-centres-unlock-4-norms/article32477684.ece
30 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Pandemic evolving on predicted lines: CM||Kerala reported 2,397 fresh cases of COVID-19 and 2,225 recoveries on Saturday. The cumulative case burden thus rose to 71,701. With the State having reported 48,079 recoveries so far, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment in various hospitals at present is 23,277. The State’s death toll has risen to 280, with the Health Department confirming six more deaths on Saturday. The deaths had been reported from Kasaragod, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Kannur and Kollam earlier in the week. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing media here on Saturday, said the COVID-19 pandemic was evolving on predicted lines as the natural course of any virus-driven epidemic in the State. The patient numbers were yet to show any unusual spike and this was because of the care and vigil exercised in disease containment, he said. Of the new cases, almost 92% or 2,203 out of the 2,397 new cases reported are locally acquired infections, including that of 63 health-care workers.

30 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||From the blackboard to the blacktop road||On a side of BRTS Road near Padavalarevu Centre, a man in his forties sits on the black top with dozens of pairs of footwear spread in front of him. He manages to sell a few pairs every day to come back the next morning without fail, unless it is a rainy day. For 43-year-old T. Venkateswara Rao, this is not his daily routine though he has been doing it since three months. Mr. Rao used to teach mathematics to Class X students in three private schools of the city as a part-time teacher earning a small sum to feed his family of three children and wife. The COVID pandemic that hit every person in one or other way has also brought Mr. Rao’s life to a standstill and forced him to take up selling footwear to make ends meet. “With the schools shut, there was no source of income for me. Even permanent teachers in private schools are being paid in bits and pieces. Imagine the plight of part-time teachers who are also in large number,” he said. “Income has stopped but bills don't. With no option, I had to turn a street vendor and sell chappals. As chappals are essential for every person I hoped it would give some returns at the end of the day,” he adds. Asked why he chose to sell footwear on the road which is not an easy job for a teacher, Mr. Rao says, “I believe in the dignity of labour and every job and every profession needs to be respected. I have tried for work at courier services, delivery services and others, and realised nobody can recruit people now.” As paper boy “I have had the experience of working as a paper boy and a couple of other part-time jobs when I was young,” he says. Though he knows that there is a long way ahead for normalcy to return, he still looks forward to it with hope, Mr. Rao says. Mr. Rao says earning through selling chappals is not close to what he earns as a teacher, which is also a meagre income, but is sufficient to meet basic needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/from-the-blackboard-to-the-blacktop-road/article32477613.ece

30 August 2020||Mumbai,||Centre to discontinue medical equipment supply from Oct.: State||With most of the COVID-19 medical equipment such as testing kits and masks available at cheaper rates in the market, the Centre has informed the Maharashtra government that it would discontinue their supply from October, a senior Maharashtra Health Department official said on Saturday. The State government will buy these items, needed by healthcare workers and hospitals treating coronavirus patients, on its own,” the senior official said. “When the novel coronavirus outbreak started, nobody was making these items in the country. Now there are many suppliers, which has brought down the prices, so we can purchase them on our own,” the official said. The medical equipment which the Union government provided included personal protection equipment kits, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits, ventilators, N-95 masks, hydroxychloroquine tablets and other medicines, and oxygen supply units. “The RT-PCR testing kit would cost the Centre Rs. 1,800, hence patients had to shell out around Rs. 2,500 per test. Now these kits are going to be available at Rs. 400 or Rs. 600 and we will pass on the price benefit to patients,” he said. The Union government was meeting 20% of Maharashtra’s need for these items, barring RT-PCR kits, the official said. In the case of testing kits, 100% supply came from the Centre. “The Maharashtra government has so far received 3,000 ventilators from the Centre against the requirement of 4,500,” the official said.   When the outbreak started, nobody was making these items.

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Protocols for Parliament soon||The Health Ministry is developing SOPs (standard operating protocol) for Parliament and the Legislative Assembly sessions comprising COVID-19 protocols and preventive measures, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said while chairing the 20th meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19, here on Saturday. The GoM also expressed concern about the forthcoming festival seasons and advised everyone to adopt safe and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Vaccine preparations Participating in the meeting, Vinod K. Paul, chairperson of the Empowered Group-1 on medical emergency management plan apprised the GoM of the process of COVID-19 vaccine development in India and around the world. He said the 29 candidates, including two Indian ones, are in clinical trials, of which six are in Phase III. According to a release issued by the Ministry, Dr. Paul said in India, Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate based on inactivated virus procured by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is in Phase II trial along with Zydus Cadila’s candidate which is based on viral DNA. The Oxford vaccine candidate developed by Serum Institute of India (SII) is already in Phase III trial in Maharashtra and some other States. Meanwhile, the Health Minister said that in the month since the last meeting of the GoM on July 31, the country has made tremendous strides in containing the disease. Fatality rate falls “As many as 26.4 lakh have already recovered. The country’s case fatality rate is at its lowest 1.81% and consecutively the recovery rate has increased to 76.47%. Also, only 0.29% of cases are on ventilators, 1.93% on ICU and only 2.88% of cases are on oxygen. A total of 1,576 labs at present have led to an upsurge in testing and the goal of 10 lakh tests per day has been fulfilled. More than 9 lakh samples were tested in the last 24 hours and this has led to the cumulative total number of tests crossing the 4 crore mark,” said Dr. Vardhan.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Biden is strongest advocate for U.S.-India ties’||Richard Verma , former U.S. Ambassdor to India (2014 - 2017) and currently the Vice-Chair of strategy advisory firm The Asia Group, recalls that Barack Obama and Joe Biden wanted to carve out a separate designation for India as a major defence partner. In an interview, Mr. Verma vouches for Mr. Biden’s ability to help stabilise risks to peace in South Asia. Edited excerpts:  With both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention now over, what do you think are the issues that will dominate the campaign ahead of November elections? I’m really just speaking for myself in an individual capacity. Look, [the U.S.] is in the middle of a pandemic crisis that has devastated the country. There’s no question that’s the overriding issue for the next President. Second would be the economic recovery. Job number three is really an international repair job to rebuild American alliances, go back and talk to our friends and partners about the U.S. reclaiming and playing a leadership role again in the world as opposed to playing a disruption role. Given events, however, how concerned are you that that race issues are going to take over other issues? I am exceptionally concerned about the direction the [U.S.] has taken on race and on our treatment of immigrants and minority communities. I am an immigrant, I come from an immigrant family. The thought that my dad could show up here in the United States with $14, and a bus ticket, and his son could go back one generation later to represent the United States [as Ambassador]: That vision that dream, that ability to do what I did, I think is seriously at risk. In India there has been no response officially to the nomination of Kamala Harris on the ticket, and some scepticism in the commentary over whether Ms. Harris really owns her Indian origins. I don’t expect any foreign government, Indian government, or any government to opine on the internal politics of the United States and that would be appropriate. Again, I just think you have to look at her overall qualifications as a legislator as a lawyer as what she did in the state of California, how she’s built her office, incredibly diverse staff and her chief of staff is Indian-American. I am so confident about how she would not only do in the job but how she would do in managing really critical foreign policy relationships, including the U.S. and India. Could the Biden-Harris team match the Modi-Trump chemistry? And how do you address concerns that a Democratic administration will be much more intrusive on issues like human rights? Look, we broke every record on defence sales and trade record under the Obama-Biden administration. It was Joe Biden and Barack Obama who wanted to carve out a separate designation for India as a major defence partner and broke every record on the issuance of visas and welcomed tech workers. Now, if the chief complaint is that sometimes democrats raise human rights, I would just say, that’s what close friends and partners do. Indian leaders could call me and the President and the Secretary of State and others and raise sensitive issues. We can do the same. People should welcome that conversation. What do you think will be the relationship when it comes to China? I think it’s important that the U.S.-India relationship be about U.S., India relations and not about any third country. Look, we are in competition with China, obviously, militarily, economically, from a technology point of view. And yes, it is a concern. I don’t think either the United States or India aspire to contain or control China, or we certainly don’t aspire for conflict with China, but we have to be prepared. What would be Mr. Biden in South Asia policy in terms of the India-Pakistan equation? He has received Pakistan’s highest civilian honour, has been a votary of a larger role for Pakistan in the Afghanistan discussion…. With regard to Pakistan, you’ve heard [Mr. Biden] say directly, that cross border terrorism is not something that anyone could ever tolerate. I’m quite confident about his security credentials, and his ability to help stabilise a difficult set of situations that pose a threat to peace loving people in South Asia.

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Identify PwDs for ration cards: govt.||The Centre has asked States and Union Territories to identify persons with disabilities (PwD) eligible under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 and issue ration cards to those left out. The directive comes ahead of the August 31 deadline for the special scheme for providing ration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Union Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry wrote to all Chief Secretaries on August 26, reiterating the instructions issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution on August 22 to all State/UT Food and Civil Supplies Secretaries to identify PwD. Time-bound manner In her letter to all Chief Secretaries, Secretary of the Department of Empowerment of PwD in the Social Justice Ministry Shakuntala Gamlin said since the Atmanirbhar Bharat package would lapse on August 31, PwD eligible under the NFSA should be identified “in a time-bound manner”. She added that the Delhi High Court was monitoring the matter in connection with a petition filed by the National Federation of the Blind seeking free ration for PwDs. In the August 22 letter, the Department of Food and Public Distribution reiterated that “disability is one of the criteria for the inclusion of beneficiaries” under the NFSA. The Department said PwD not already covered should be identified and given fresh ration cards. “Atmanirbhar Bharat package of the Government of India is for persons who are not covered under either NFSA or any State Scheme PDS cards. Hence, disabled persons without ration cards are also eligible...,” the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/identify-pwds-for-ration-cards-govt/article32477580.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Executive order on J&K domiciles’ land rights soon||The Union government is all set to come out with an executive order to extend protection to land rights of domiciles in Jammu and Kashmir. The point of debate is currently on protection to be given to agricultural land, a senior government official told The Hindu . Union Home Minister Amit Shah said last year that “only government land would be used to establish industries, hospitals and educational institutions.” Earlier this year, the Home Ministry amended a 2010 Act to define domicile residents in the newly created Union Territory for eligibility in government jobs. The Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services Decentralization and Recruitment Act, 2010, substituted term “permanent residents” with domiciles. The order defines domiciles as anyone who has resided for a period of 15 years in J&K or has resided for seven years and appeared in Class 10/12 examination in an educational institution there or registered as a migrant. “The land protection policy for J&K will be an executive order and not introduced in Parliament. The loose ends are being tied as it is an emotive issue in both Jammu as well as the Kashmir Valley. But the development aspect also has to be considered; how would new business and industry will be set up else,” said the official. An earlier version of the domicile order that offered protection to domiciles only in Group D and entry level non-gazetted government posts was reversed within 72 hours after protest by the Jammu unit of the BJP. “After the fiasco with domicile policy, we are treading cautiously with the land law. Home Minister is closely monitoring the issue and it will be legally vetted and carefully studied before it is published,” said the official. J&K has identified a land bank of around 5,000 kanals or over 600 acres for investment. Before its special status was revoked, it had its own land acquisition Act enacted in 1935.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/executive-order-on-jk-domiciles-land-rights-soon/article32477567.ece
30 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka police summon film director Indrajit Lankesh||The Anti Narcotics Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Saturday issued a notice to film director Indrajit Lankesh after he told the media that he was aware of substance abuse in the film industry and was willing to share information with the police. This comes days after a drug bust by the Narcotics Control Bureau, which in a series of raids seized MDMA pills and LSD blots. At the time, the NCB had issued a statement saying that preliminary investigations had revealed that the arrested dealers were supplying party drugs to prominent musicians and actors. Mr. Lankesh alleged that everyone, including the police, was aware of the racket where drugs were supplied at rave parties. He further claimed that Rs. 4 crore worth of drugs were sold while the city was locked down. Following his allegations, the CCB issued a notice summoning him for questioning. “We will investigate every bit of information that he shares with us,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (crime). Citizens who have information to share can do so on the toll free number 1908. NCB officials are questioning the people arrested during the raids to probe the extent of the network. “We have gathered a lot of details, which we are investigating,” said an NCB official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-police-summon-film-director-indrajit-lankesh/article32477549.ece
30 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Kidnapped boy rescued within 16 hours||In an operation that involved a car chase, the East division police rescued an 11-year-old boy from kidnappers within 16 hours of the incident and arrested six persons early Friday morning. The accused had allegedly kidnapped the boy in the hope of extracting a ransom of Rs. 2 crore from his father who is a businessman. The police had to open fire at the prime accused, who attacked them in an attempt to escape. The boy was reunited with his family in the presence of Police Commissioner Kamal Pant, who commended the police on their success. Deputy Commissioner of Police (East division) S.D. Sharanappa said that the prime accused, Mohammed Zain, is a resident of Shivajinagar. He was a regular visitor at a readymade garment showroom in Bharatinagar, which is owned by the victim’s father. “Based on what he saw, Zain concluded that it was a successful business, and decided to kidnap the owner’s youngest son for ransom,” he said. He roped in his associates and, for one month, the gang kept tabs on the businessman’s house and shop. They mapped out the routine of all family members. On Thursday, Zain approached the boy while he was alone outside his house and lured him away with the promise of buying him a new kite. “They knew that the boy was fascinated with kite flying. He readily agreed to accompany Zain,” DCP Sharanappa added. The accused took the boy to his car, and gave him a cold drink laced with sleeping pills. With the boy sedated, he drove to the outskirts of the city to a house in Shampura and called the father to inform that he had kidnapped his son. He demanded Rs. 2 crore for his safe release. He then instructed his associates to take the boy to Tumakuru in the same car. Help sought from police The businessman approached the police for help. By evening, a special team led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Tabarak Fathima was formed to track down the boy and the kidnapper. Another team led by Inspector Sirajuddin tracked down the accused using call record details and traced the car to the outskirts of Tumakuru. The accused were travelling with the boy in the car. Sensing trouble, they tried to flee. They evaded the police for 15 kilometres before the driver lost control of the vehicle. The car overturned and rolled into a field. The police rescued the boy, who was fortunately unharmed. Based on information given by the arrested men, the police tracked down Zain to the house in Shampura. “He attacked the police team in an attempt to escape. We had to open fire and shot him on the leg,” said a senior police officer. “The kidnappers had rented a car and borrowed a SIM for the crime,” DCP Sharanappa said. Apart from Zain, the other accused are Fahim, Muzammil, Faizan, Shaheed and Khaleel. Zain has been admitted to a hospital for treatment. Police are awaiting his recovery for further investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kidnapped-boy-rescued-within-16-hours/article32477550.ece
30 August 2020||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan to hold State exams||While demanding postponement of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the Congress government in Rajasthan plans to hold several State-level examinations during the next three months, in which lakhs of candidates will appear. The government bodies organising the exams have said they would take precautions. Examinations such as pre-diploma in elementary education, supplementary exams of the State Secondary Education Board, pre-teacher eligibility test and the police constable recruitment exam will be held in the State during the next three months. The Congress leaders and party workers staged demonstrations across the State over the weekend for the postponement of JEE and NEET in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Online campaign It also launched an online campaign, “Speak Up For Students’ Safety”, in which the members uploaded videos of their protests. Congress leader Sachin Pilot, chief whip Mahesh Joshi and Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas took part in the agitation outside the Malviya National Institute of Technology in Jaipur. Mr. Pilot said there could be no justification for the Centre’s “adamant attitude” on holding the exams when the pandemic was serious. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said in a video message that lakhs of students were concerned about their health when there were difficulties of transportation and stay in the cities where the exam centres were situated.  The Opposition BJP, questioning the stand of the State government, said that the Congress was oblivious to the risks involved in organising the State-level exams. Party MLA Vasudev Devnani said the Congress’ attitude was “hypocrisy at its best”, as the party was unconcerned about the academic loss for students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-to-hold-state-exams/article32477572.ece
30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||CSIR to track employees’ health for 30 years||For the next 30 years, about 10,000 employees of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will likely be tracked for most of their working lives as part of an initiative to track an array of health-vitals and genes. The over-arching aim is to be able to build a medical cohort to give long-term perspective on the malaises that affect Indians and determine if such a databank can be used to help with predicting, say, the onset of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. For starters, said officials, the CSIR, which has 38 subsidiary labs across the country, has collected blood samples from around 2,000 employees to check for COVID-19 antibodies. COVID-19 pandemic “We’ve been thinking about this for a year and then COVID-19 struck. So we thought this would be good time to begin by checking for antibodies and along with that other health parameters,” said Director-General, CSIR Shekhar Mande. “A long-term cohort can be invaluable in answering several public- health questions and many of our 10,000-odd employees are expected to be with us for a long time and so can be reliably followed and monitored. This will, of course, be optional and with their full ethical consent.” Long-term cohorts, while few, aren’t entirely new in India. The Vadu Rural Health Programme, run by the KEM Hospital Research Centre in Pune, in nearby Vadu village has been tracking a cohort of patients since 2002 and monitoring births, deaths, causes of death and migrations. GARBH-ini is also a cohort in Gurugram, Haryana, that started in 2015 and tracks epidemiological, genomic and microbial parameters of pregnant women to, among other things, ascertain the causes of pre-term births. However, a great challenge of long-term cohorts is sustaining the programme and keeping participants and managers incentivised and motivated. The CSIR’s bet is that their employees, by virtue of being committed to a long-term job and availing of the organisation’s health care benefits, are likely to see benefits in sticking to the programme. “The interesting aspect of a CSIR cohort is that it would be fairly representative of a spectrum of middle class India. We could give them smart watches or other devices that can track health parameters and we will track variations in specific genes, known to be correlated to certain diseases, that can help predict the likelihood of disease,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, who is spear-heading the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/csir-to-track-employees-health-for-30-years/article32477583.ece
30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Environmentalists petition PM on Char Dham project||A group of 40 scientists, environmentalists and ecologists have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a halt to the Char Dham road construction work and that the recommendation of environmentalist Ravi Chopra, who heads a Supreme Court-appointed committee to advise on the sustainable execution of the project, be heeded. The Char Dham Project (CP) is an ambitious attempt by the Modi government to widen nearly 900 km of hill road to improve access to pilgrimage spots in Uttarakhand. The High Powered Committee (HPC), as it is called, was chaired by Mr. Chopra, former director of the People’s Science Institute and the court directed it to submit a report by December 30, 2019, which was extended to June 30 this year. However, what emerged from the exercise were two reports — one by Mr. Chopra and three other members (called the ‘Main report’), and another by 16 members of the 19-member core committee. The key difference is that the ‘Main report’ recommends a narrower road width than the majority group. The Saturday letter that comes ahead of a Supreme Court hearing on Monday says the majority committee members were “misusing their membership to further an unfeasible agenda that wasn’t in the public interest”. The Chairman’s recommendations, they say, had left the final decision on the road width to the Supreme Court and adheres to the “mandate of protecting the Himalayas”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/environmentalists-petition-pm-on-char-dham-project/article32477585.ece

Raja Singh and he was cautioned not to move on two-wheelers as it poses a ‘grave’ threat to his life. In a ‘confidential’ letter issued to the Goshamahal legislator, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar stated, “It has been noticed that sometimes you are moving on a motorcycle. This poses a grave security threat to you. Therefore, your kind cooperation is solicited to ensure proper security and you may kindly completely avoid moving on motorcycles and travel by the bulletproof car allotted.” Due to the threat perception, security has been enhanced for the MLA. Security personnel were also being alerted and checked from time to time. “Special training has been organised to all your Personal Security Officers, periodically,” the letter read. “The government has provided the bulletproof car only for your security, which remains a prime concern to us,” Mr. Kumar told the MLA. After receiving the communication in-person, Mr. Singh said that for the last couple of days, a few senior police officials had visited him and the weapons of his security personnel were changed after examining them. Police are also noting the details of people living in the vicinity, he said. Mr. Singh said that he would write to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Telangana Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali to know more details. “In the last few days, some terrorists were nabbed. I want to know the threat perception and whom the local police are suspecting. Are they terrorist groups, local groups and is there any personal enmity?” the BJP MLA added.

30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Probe Facebook ties with BJP, says Cong.||The Congress on Saturday reiterated its demand that the government constitute a joint parliamentary committee to investigate what it called an “unholy intimacy” between Facebook’s India operation and the BJP. The Congress flagged a Time magazine story which, it said, not only confirmed a piece by The Wall Street Journal but also pointed out that WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, also had similar connections with BJP. WhatsApp, which was used by 40 crore Indians had been “compromised and controlled indirectly” by the BJP, the Congress alleged. Payment platform The Time piece claimed that current Public Policy director of WhatsApp Shivnath Thukral, in 2013, used to operate websites and Facebook pages for the BJP. It alleged that WhatsApp was going slow on hate speeches on its platform because it wanted to soon launch its own payment platform. “There needs to be an exhaustive and unbiased investigation by a joint parliamentary committee between the unending links of Facebook employees and the ruling establishment. The investigation must include how Facebook manipulated voter opinion, allowed hate speech and was oblivious to fake news, even when they were in clear violation of their regulations,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said. The party demanded that WhatsApp must not be granted approvals for its payment operations until an inquiry is complete. “We also demand that Facebook should make the investigation ordered into conduct of Facebook India public,” Mr. Khera said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-facebook-ties-with-bjp-says-cong/article32477560.ece

She was addressing the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new Chhattisgarh Assembly building to be built in Nava Raipur, through a recorded video message. Speaking in Hindi, Ms. Gandhi said, “There are new challenges in front of our country. Anti-national, anti-poor and divisive forces who are ruling us, are spreading venom of hatred and violence, freedom of expression is in danger and democratic institutions are being destroyed. The influence of tanashahi is increasing on lokshahi ,” she said. Without naming anyone, Ms. Gandhi further said, they want to suppress the voice of the people of the country. “What do they want? They want people of the country, our youth, our tribal people, our women, our farmers, shopkeepers and small traders, jawans to keep their mouths shut. They want to keep the nation’s mouth shut,” she said. Stating that in two years, the country will complete 75 years of Independence, Ms. Gandhi said, “The Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, former Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, G.V. Mavalankar (Speaker of Constituent Assembly of India), Dr B.R. Ambedkar and our other ancestors would have never imagined that even 75 years after Independence, the country will face such a difficult situation, when our Constitution and democracy are in danger.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anti-national-forces-spreading-hate-sonia/article32477563.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Butterflies are migrating early in southern India this year||In a departure from the past, the annual migration of butterflies from the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats towards the Western Ghats is an early phenomenon this year. Usually, butterfly migration in south India begins in October-November, with the onset of the northeast monsoon, from the plains to the Ghats, and in April-June, just before the advent of the southwest monsoon, from the Ghats to the plains. But this year, the first migratory sighting was recorded in the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve in Palakkad district by forest watchers on July 14. Later, butterfly enthusiasts in Salem, Erode, Tiruppur, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris observed their movement in large numbers from August 21, which is still continuing. Butterfly migration has also been recorded in Mysuru, Bengaluru, Kolar and Coorg districts in Karnataka. “The migration started early after a gap of eight years. The Eastern Ghats complex of the Yercaud hills (Shevaroy hills), Pachamalai, Kolli hills, Kalvarayan hills are the major originating places for the migrating species,” said A. Pavendhan of The Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS). A recent study revealed that four species of milkweed butterflies belonging to the Danainae subfamily are mainly involved in the migration — the Dark Blue Tiger, Blue Tiger, Common Crow and the Double-branded (commonly known as tigers and crows). Species like Lime Swallowtail, Lemon Pansy, Common Leopard, Blue Pansy, Common Emigrant and Lemon Emigrants are also involved in the migration but their numbers are very low. However, the number of Lime Swallowtail butterflies had increased considerably this year, P.A.Vinayan, president, Ferns Nature Conservation Society (FNCS), Wayanad, told The Hindu . Observers noted that Blue Tiger and Dark Blue Tiger accounted for 90% of the butterflies involved in the early migration. “The change in rainfall pattern and a considerable increase in the number of sunny days may be the major reasons for the earlier migration,” Mr. Vinayan added. Mr. Pavendhan said peak migration was observed over Coimbatore district on August 25. The starting rate of movement was 180 individuals per hour, when the counting was done over a band of about 10 metres in the morning, and the movement reached a peak of 1,060 individuals per hour around noon. Observers also also found that thousands of butterflies had died of vehicle hits along the migratory path. D. Sadees Kumar, an observer from Erode, said that he counted 57 dead butterflies while travelling for merely 15 minutes on the Avinashi-Chengapalli road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/butterflies-are-migrating-early-in-southern-india-this-year/article32477532.ece

The protesters led by the party town committee secretary G Swamy squatted at the main entrance of the office seeking financial aid to all the flood-hit families to help the latter get their damaged houses repaired and buy groceries and other essential commodities in these turbulent times. They alleged that the flood-hit families are being denied compensation by some errant mandal-level officials on one pretext or other. They deplored that the officials sanctioned compensation to only four families as against a total of 600 flood-hit families, leaving the latter in dire straits. The aggrieved residents from Ashoknagar Kotha Colony, AMC Colony, Ayyappa Colony and Subashnagar took part in the protest. Later, the CPI (M) leaders submitted a memorandum to the Bhadrachalam in-charge RDO Swarnalatha with a charter of demands including appointment of a special officer to conduct survey on flood damages and sanction of double bedroom houses to the families living in the flood prone colonies to find a lasting solution to the flooding woes of denizens of the temple town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/compensate-flood-hit-families-cpim/article32477861.ece
30 August 2020||Bhopal,||Almost 8% of residents in Indore have antibodies, finds serological survey||The seroprevalence of 7.75% in Indore indicates more than 2 lakh individuals have had SARS-CoV-2 infection in the recent past — at least 15 days prior to sample collection, said the city’s first such survey. The community-based cross-sectional study, conducted from August 11 to 23 on 7,103 individuals residing since March 1 in Indore, noted 2,03,160 individuals had the infection. Indore’s seroprevalence is much lower than that of Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. Prevalence in hotspot areas is almost five times that in low risk areas. Further, the prevalence is the highest in 45-60 years age group followed by the above 60 years age group, said the survey coordinated by the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, and the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi. The study aimed at estimating the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assayed from blood samples of the residents. The Bambai Bazaar ward recorded the highest seroprevalence at more than 30, followed by another four wards where a prevalence of 20-25% was recorded. “Prevalence in hotspot areas is more and matches with surveillance data,” the study said, while noting the presence of antibodies are not a marker of total or partial immunity. Both males and females recorded a near identical seroprevalence. Samples were picked using the stratified random sampling method where 33% males aged 18 and above, 33% females aged 18 and above and children between a year-old and 18 years of age were picked. Only one sample from one household or family was collected. “The results show the containment strategy has worked dramatically,” believes Salil Sakalle, Professor, Community Medicine Department at the college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/almost-8-of-residents-in-indore-have-antibodies-finds-serological-survey/article32477803.ece

The tunnel has been found days after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a charge-sheet in the 2019 Pulwama terror case, saying that several Pakistani terrorists infiltrated from the sector between the months of March to May in 2018, with high grade RDX explosives that were used to assemble the 200 kilogramme bomb deployed in the attack. The BSF said in a statement that on August 28, “during an anti-tunnelling drive, while carrying out in-depth scanning of area, it suspected a place at International Border in district Samba and detected 25-foot deep tunnel with a 3-4 ft diameter”. The BSF said it found Pakistani-made sand bags with markings of “Shakargarh/Karachi factories” at the mouth of the tunnel. The opening of the tunnel is around 170 metres from the International Border in the field of a local farmer, the BSF said. “The tunnel’s origin is in Pakistan territory close to the IB,” the BSF said.

Was he helped by Modi government? Why a man accused of sexually assaulting a minor was chosen by BJP to make Modi ji ’s biopic and was even supported by the then CM?” he asked. Reacting to the revelations, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the State government will write to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the allegations. BJP MLA Ram Kadam refuted the charges calling it baseless. “Mumbai Police did not probe Mr. Singh when it was inquiring the case. All these allegations are childish,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sushant-case-congress-raises-more-questions/article32477569.ece

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC verdict in Prashant Bhushan case tomorrow||A three-judge Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra will on Monday pronounce its sentence on civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan, found guilty of criminal contempt for two tweets. Mr. Bhushan has refused to apologise in his two statements to the court. He was convicted of scandalising the court with his tweets of a picture of Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde astride a heavy bike and the role of the court in the past six years. The lawyer said the tweets were his bona fide opinions. In the last hearing, the court wondered about the resolve shown by Mr. Bhushan to not offer an apology in the face of contempt, saying “you have hurt someone, you must remove the hurt”. “What is wrong in seeking apology? Is it a sin to apologise? Will that be a reflection of guilt? ‘Apology’ is a magical word which can heal. You will all go to the category of Mahatma Gandhi if you can apologise,” Justice Mishra had said. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal had urged the court not to punish Mr. Bhushan. He said this was an opportunity for the court to enhance its greatness through its compassion. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. Bhushan’s lawyer, had advised the court to not make his client a “martyr” by punishing him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-verdict-in-prashant-bhushan-case-tomorrow/article32477588.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Centre must borrow to pay GST dues of States: Kerala||Already, talks had been held with Finance Ministers of other States and the response was encouraging, Dr. Isaac added. “A video conference will be held with other State Finance Ministers on Monday afternoon. A separate memorandum will be submitted by the States. But, we are trying to reach a common ground and ask the Centre to avail loan to provide GST compensation. It is not clear if the BJP ruled States will stick to their stance. A unified stand will be aired in the GST Council,” he said. As per the Constitution, a State needs permission from the Centre to take a loan and the interest will be 1-2% more if the State avails the loan. Only 3% of the State’s income can be availed as loan even if permission is granted. Even if the fiscal limit ceiling is enhanced by 0.5%, as suggested by the Centre, it will not be adequate for Kerala as it will not be enough to cover the GST compensation. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also indicated that Kerala would cobble together an alliance of States unhappy over the Centre’s suggestion that States raise loans to make up for the GST dues owed to them. Finance Ministers of States disinclined to accept the options proposed by the Centre would meet via video conference on Monday. The Centre had imposed the GST regime in 2016. At the time, it had promised the States a 14% increase in tax revenue. It had also pledged to make up for the shortfall in tax revenue caused due to the transition to the GST system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-must-borrow-to-pay-gst-dues-of-states-kerala/article32477530.ece

He was answering a question on the possible re-entry of Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) Jitan Ram Manjhi in the alliance. “Whoever accepts the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi is welcome in the NDA,” he said.

Mr. Jaiswal spoke after a meeting of party MPs from the State with national president J.P. Nadda on Saturday.

Speaking at the launch event Indian Youth Congress in-charge Krishna Allavaru told reporters that it is wrong on part of the government to blame the COVID-19 pandemic for the current state of economy which was in a shambles even before the pandemic hit. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called the pandemic an “Act of God”. Mr. Allavaru asked, “Was it ‘Act of God’ on 8 November 2016 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation that wrecked our economy? Was the faulty implementation of GST an ‘Act of God? When coronavirus pandemic was at our door, PM Modi organised Namaste Trump event putting lakhs of people in danger, was that also ‘act of God’?” He added, “Do not blame God for your faulty policies.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rozgar-do-campaign-launched/article32477561.ece

At Russia’s invitation, India has been participating in many international events. However, in view of the pandemic and consequent difficulties in exercise, including arrangements of logistics, India has decided not to send the contingent to Kavkaz 2020. The same has been informed to the Russian side,” a Defence Ministry official said late on Saturday. Other reasons include participation of Chinese troops and the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia which have been recognised only by Russia and a few other countries, sources said. The invitees to Kavkaz 2020 strategic command-post exercise, also referred to as Caucasus-2020, to be held in Astrakhan in Southern Russia from September 15 to 26 include Pakistan, Turkey and other member-states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). As reported by The Hindu on August 7, India had confirmed its participation and a tri-service contingent consisting of 150 Army personnel and a small number of Navy and Air Force personnel had been identified. “All planning has been completed, funds were allocated and the personnel started practising for the exercise,” the source said.

30 August 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||From silent films to the digital era — Madras’ tryst with cinema||Madras was a thriving epicentre for not just Tamil films but also for those in all south Indian languages, with its state-of-the-art facilities and visionaries who introduced several firsts in film-making. An automobile parts dealer who turned his attention to cinema, R. Nataraja Mudaliar set up the The Indian Film Company studio in Madras in 1916, and went on to make the first silent film in south India, Keechaka Vadham . Talkies came in later, with the pioneering efforts of A. Narayanan, who founded the General Pictures Corporation and set up the first studio with sound recording facilities in the city, Srinivasa Cinetone. Until then, one had to go to Bombay or Calcutta to produce films but in 1934, Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first talkie produced in Madras. In an interview with The Hindu in 1936, Mr. Narayanan said he was keen to see the film industry and the facilities in Madras advance like it had in parts of north India and other countries. True to his statement, rapid developments were seen in the next few decades. Bringing together both film-goers and film traders, the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce was inaugurated in April 1939. The 1940s welcomed film studios to the city. S.S. Vasan’s Gemini Studios came up on Mount Road, Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1948 at Kodambakkam and in 1949, A.V. Meiyappan shifted AVM studios from Karaikudi to a 10-acre campus, again in Kodambakkam. This turned Kodambakkam (and Vadapalani) into a famed cinema hub for aspiring actors, technicians and even fans, waiting to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao, in a 2010 interview to The Hindu , recalled Madras’ link with cinema. “Films of all regional languages were patronised in the city because films of all languages used to be made here,” he had said. Mount Road (Anna Salai) became a hub for theatres, with Elphinstone theatre, Gaiety Cinema and later, Anand and Shanti theatres. Kodambakkam had Liberty theatre and Broadway had Minerva, now called Batcha theatre. The studios in Madras were advanced and had expensive special equipment. A.V.M. Saravanan, son of the legendary film producer A.V. Meiyappan, founder of AVM Studios, says in the book AVM 60 , that it was the only studio at the time to have realistic special effects equipment to simulate rain and storm effects in films. Soon, a transformation ensued — movies that were being made in the confines of the studios began to be shot in real locations. Significant portions of Anbe Vaa , Kadhalikka Neramillai and Then Nilavu, made in the 1960s, were shot on-location, outdoors. Once they moved outdoors, the dynamics of the films themselves changed. Film historian and writer Venkatachalam said two films — Annakili and 16 Vayadhinile — were highly influential among film-makers. “The success of the two films made producers look for new locations to film their stories. It also reduced the costs involved and they began filming in realistic settings. This resulted in studios in Chennai slowly turning into commercial establishments, apartments and godowns,” he said. Another development that fundamentally changed Tamil cinema was the arrival of digital cinema projectors in the 1990s that were installed in theaters. Chennai-based Real Image Media Technologies (now Qube Cinema Technologies) was at the forefront of this change. The cost of distributing the film print of a movie significantly reduced and the film could be played in more theatres simultaneously. Just as a trip to Elphinstone theatre was incomplete without falooda from Jafar’s Ice Cream back in the day, the city now has its multiplexes that remain inseparable from popcorn. While theatres have remained shut since March, the buzz around OTT platforms and the varied content they have is yet another turning point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/from-silent-films-to-the-digital-era-madras-tryst-with-cinema/article32477713.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Three teachers from T.N. selected for CBSE award||The Central Board of Secondary Education has selected 39 teachers, including three from Tamil Nadu, for the CBSE Award to Teachers for 2019-20. Shoba Raman, principal, Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Chennai, said she was happy to have been chosen for the award and hoped for more teachers to be inspired. “As a chemistry teacher, I’ve always focussed on making my classes interactive and filled with activities. Through my years as a teacher, I have realised that how students need to learn is what we should base our teaching on. The focus should remain on the student,” said Ms. Raman, who has been teaching for 29 years. “Students are already under a lot of pressure. The onus is on us to make learning simple, experimental, fun and interesting.” For Dr. S. Deepa, science teacher at G.K. Shetty Vivekananda Vidyalaya, Ambattur West, teaching is something that she believes will bring about societal transformation. “For me, it is important that I work in tandem with parents, students and all other stakeholders... Teaching should not just be restricted to subjects and marks,” said the teacher, who has 21 years of experience. She underscored the need for creating a comfort level in the classroom for students to engage and learn. “For a subject like biology, I ensure that I get the content across in a simple manner. Beyond this, teachers should be approachable and guide students responsibly,” she said. “My journey has just begun,” said V. Bindhu, 51, principal of Hosur Public School, Karapalli, Hosur. With combined Masters in English Literature and Psychology and a Ph. D. in counselling, Ms. Bindhu sees her role of a principal, for which she has won the award, as a pedagogical leader. Having worked up her 23 years of teaching experience in many capacities, she joined the school as its principal. The award application had been a gruelling process that required compilation of all the best practices implemented, the impact made on children, parents and all the stakeholders, including the community as a whole, she said. She has also been a CBSE resource person for the last 10 years, which means weekend holidays spent on training teachers and schools in the best practices. “The role of the principal is that of a leader. Children look up to the principal as not just a teacher and a problem-solver, but as a counsellor to guide them through emotional issues, a mentor to guide through career choices,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-teachers-from-tn-selected-for-cbse-award/article32477732.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Patients languish in dirty ward||Health Department authorities have called for an explanation from over a dozen employees, including doctors, nursing staff and other outsourced workers as part of an investigation into the unhygienic conditions in a non-COVID-19 ward at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital, Chennai. The inquiry was ordered to be conducted by a team of senior doctors after a video on the poor conditions of amenities and cleanliness in the Pulmonary Medicine Ward posted by an in-patient was widely circulated on Friday. Besides damaged beds, dirty floor, medical waste and bird droppings strewn around in the ward, the video taken by the woman showed remains of what appeared to be a carcass of a bird on a blood-stained cot. Video examined The committee, comprising the Resident Medical Officer and seven professors, perused the video and identified the ward to be located on the sixth floor of the New Tower Block. A senior health official said the patients were accommodated in a room meant for storing condemned articles. The space had remained unoccupied for over three months because of the low turnout of non-COVID-19 patients. Unaware of this, some outsourced workers shifted the patients there, he said.  The inquiry revealed that although three surgical patients were shifted to the ward on August 25, doctors did not go for their morning rounds there the next two days. The Assistant Resident Medical Officer held discussions with the Nursing Superintendents and instructed the outsourced hospital workers to clean the fifth and sixth floors of the New Tower Block. Despite specific instructions, the cleaning staff did not visit the ward, hospital sources said on Saturday and added that an explanation has been sought from the doctors and paramedical staff who should have ensured the well-being of the patients. Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital Dean P. Balaji said the inquiry committee’s report had been sent to the competent authority. The ward was cleaned and new beds/medical equipment were installed. Fresh instructions were given to the health workers to ensure that there was no compromise on cleanliness, he said. DME lauds staff Director of Medical Education M. Narayana Babu, who inspected the hospital and also visited the ward, said doctors and health professionals were going out of way to save the lives of people during these times of crisis. “It is just not treating the patients but giving personal attention like feeding and transporting them since attenders are not allowed. The Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital has treated 23,000 COVID-19 patients and saved their lives,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patients-languish-in-dirty-ward-at-stanley/article32477697.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu to continue with Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana||While States such as Gujarat, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are pulling out of the revamped crop insurance scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Tamil Nadu is sticking with it and going ahead with the process of choosing insurance companies. The Agriculture Department has called for e-bids that can be submitted till the noon of September 2. Bids will be opened the same day, if there is no extension of the deadline, and it may take a few days for completing other formalities, including the issue of work order to the selected companies, explains an official of the Department. Once selected, the insurance companies will be involved in enrolment of farmers for three years, till the end of the 2022-23 ‘rabi’ cultivation season that covers ‘samba’ and ‘navarai’ in Tamil Nadu. One of the main reasons for the State government to continue with the scheme is the high coverage of farmers with the payment of compensation in times of crop loss. During the first three years of the scheme (2016-17 to 2018-19), 70% of the farmers enrolled were compensated for crop loss. Totally, in the last four years, 49.6 lakh farmers were paid around Rs. 8,934 crore in compensation. Another official points out that in the inaugural year of the scheme, 2016-17, the State had faced its worst drought in the last 140-odd years. Among the factors that have contributed to the success of the scheme in Tamil Nadu are the “timely payment” of premium subsidy by the State government to the insurance companies; “prompt” execution of crop-cutting experiments; and furnishing of yield data. The “burden” of premium subsidy to be paid by the State government is less, compared with those States that have withdrawn from the scheme. Another significant feature of the implementation of the scheme in the State is the presence of a substantial number of non-loanee farmers, accounting for 75% of those enrolled every year. It is this factor that will ensure that the changes in the stipulations, especially voluntary enrolment, will have no impact on the State. During the 2020 ‘kharif’ cultivation season, which covers ‘kuruvai’ in Tamil Nadu, 82% of those enrolled belong to the category of non-loanee farmers. The area insured and the number of farmers enrolled have increased this year by 50% and 38%, compared with the past, the official adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-to-continue-with-pradhan-mantri-fasal-bima-yojana/article32478008.ece

30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Private hospitals continue to delay referring the critically ill||Private hospitals across Tamil Nadu continue to refer critically-ill COVID-19 patients to government hospitals at the eleventh hour. Many of these patients, referred at the last-minute, have died within a few hours of arrival at government hospitals. Last week, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar warned that notices would be issued to private hospitals that resorted to such late referrals. Yet, at least five to seven critically-ill patients were referred from corporate hospitals, medium-level private hospitals and nursing homes to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital every day, according to official sources. A majority of these patients were sent to government hospitals at midnight, creating difficulty for healthcare providers to make arrangements for emergency cases. “Patients with oxygen saturation levels of 40%-60% and lung involvement of 70%-90% are referred to government hospitals. One or two patients survive, while the remaining die within two to three hours of arrival. Many are aged between 40 and 50. Even nursing homes have started admitting COVID-19 patients now, and once the patient becomes critical, they refer them to a government hospital. At times, shifting a critically-ill patient can make them sicker,” a senior government doctor said. Another senior doctor said there were one or two institutional deaths a day at the RGGGH, while the remaining deaths recorded were among patients referred late from private facilities. A doctor said even patients who were intubated were referred, once they knew that he/she could not be weaned from support. Government doctors in Tiruchi, Pudukottai and Ariyalur had similar complaints. While many such patients were aged over 65, some had severe co-morbidities, including diabetes and uncontrolled blood pressure, and had complaints of breathlessness and severe chest congestion. Increasing burden These last-minute referrals have increased the burden on government hospitals. “Patients with a high risk of fatality are often referred to government hospitals. In most cases, CT scans show severe lung infection,” a doctor at the Ariyalur District Headquarters Hospital said. While the hospital treats them as COVID-19 patients, some of them are not included in the Health Department’s COVID-19 numbers. These patients are among a large section of those transferred to government hospitals, he added. “They do not want to take the risk and ask them to go to the nearest GH,” a senior doctor at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Tiruchi, said. However, treatment coordinator of the COVID-19 specialty hospital at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, K. Senthil, initially said that there were a high number of late referrals when there was a spike in COVID-19 cases. “We would get at least four or five late referrals each day when there was a rise. Now there are fewer such cases,” he said. A Health Department official said the district administration held meetings with heads of various private hospitals and urged them to ensure that late referrals are avoided. In Coimbatore, following complaints that certain private hospitals were sending out critically-ill COVID-19 patients to government hospitals, Collector K. Rajamani appointed five government officials who can be contacted to report grievances. They were tasked with monitoring treatment, facilities and expenses at 20-odd private COVID-19 hospitals. Some deaths listed as “brought dead” in the bulletin are cases of late referrals from private hospitals, an official said. A health official said they were in the process of issuing notices to private hospitals on complaints of late referrals to government facilities.

30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP appoints former IPS officer Annamalai State vice-president||Former IPS officer K. Annamalai, who joined the BJP on Tuesday, was appointed the vice-president of the party’s State unit on Sunday. BJP’s Tamil Nadu president L. Murugan issued an official announcement in this regard. Recently, the party appointed former Deputy Speaker V.P. Duraisamy, who switched over from the DMK, as one of its vice-presidents. Former AIADMK Minister Nainar Nagendran also enjoys the status as the vice-president of the party. Asked whether rewarding new entrants with State-level posts would not affect the sentiments of those who had been doing party work for years, K.T. Raghavan, the State general secretary of the party, said all the senior leaders held some position or the other as State-level office bearers. “We have 40 State-level office-bearers. We have implemented 33% reservation for women in the party posts and regular reservation for the SC/ST candidates. When a prominent politician or a well-known person joins our party, we have to honour them,” Mr. Raghavan contended. In the past, Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, a Congress leader, was fielded as a BJP candidate in Tiruchi, after he joined the party. Subsequently, he was inducted into the Cabinet led by Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee. Another leader who was rewarded in a similar manner was Su. Thirunavukkarasar. He was sent to the Rajya Sabha and later made a Union Minister of State. He later joined the Congress and is a MP now. Mr. Raghavan said the experience of political leaders should be taken into account even though they may have roots in some other political party. “They know the ideology of the party. They have spent a lot of years in politics,” he said when asked whether they would be comfortable with the BJP and its ideology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-appoints-former-ips-officer-annamalai-state-vice-president/article32477702.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC to resume physical hearing of cases from September 7||The top seven judges of the Madras High Court have decided to start conducting physical hearing of cases in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as at the Madurai Bench as a pilot measure for two weeks from September 7. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam will begin hearing cases in open court with all safety measures in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Administrative Committee, comprising the top seven judges, on Saturday. According to sources, almost all members of the committee were in favour of the decision to resume physical hearing of the cases on a pilot basis. Hence, it was decided that six Division Benches led by them in the principal seat will begin sitting in the open court from September 7. Three Division Benches will conduct physical hearing in the forenoon session and virtual hearing in the afternoon. The other three Division Benches will hear cases through video conference in the forenoon and sit in the open court in the afternoon session. The arrangement had been made to reduce crowding on the court campus and to enable lawyers to maintain physical distance. Waiting hall for lawyers Individual Division Benches will take a call on the cases that require a hearing in the open court and the ones which can be heard virtually, depending upon the requests made by lawyers and their willingness to get the cases listed before open courts. It has also been decided to allocate waiting halls for the lawyers and let them inside court halls only as and when their cases are to be taken up for hearing. Measures will also be put in place to maintain distance between the lawyers, the judges and the court staff all the time. Since Justice Sathyanarayanan is the administrative judge of the Madurai Bench now, he will lead the Bench there. Similarly, a Division Bench led by Justice K. Kalyanasundaram will also hold physical hearing in Madurai, where only two Division Benches function. All other judges who sit single will continue to hear cases only through the video conference facility until a further decision is taken on resuming physical functioning on a full scale after discussing the issue in the Full Court (a body comprising all judges).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-to-resume-physical-hearing-of-cases-from-september-7/article32477706.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Toll fee revision at 28 plazas from Sept. 1||Toll fee at 28 plazas in the State, under the control of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), will go up by at least 5% from September 1. The annual revision is based on the wholesale price index (WPI), where 2% increase is fixed and the remaining is calculated depending on the WPI. Plea for relief The increase comes at a time when truckers have been seeking some kind of relief from the government. “Since not many factories are operational, we don’t get as many trips. We sought a six-month moratorium for toll collection and had suggested that the government extend the period of operation of the plazas by the same period but to no avail,” said M.R. Kumaraswamy, president, Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners’ Federation. He said that business was at its lowest ebb, and that small operators were hit the hardest. Sources in the NHAI said that they were only doing what was required under the law. Any decision to waive the fee should be made by the government. Toll collections stand at 70% of normal times since private and public transport vehicles are off the roads due to the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/toll-fee-revision-at-28-plazas-from-sept-1/article32477707.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Krishna water likely to be released by mid-September||The Andhra Pradesh government is likely to release Krishna water to Chennai by September 14. This was decided at the first permanent technical committee meeting of officials of the Water Resources Department in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh organised at the Chief Engineer’s Office in Tirupati on Saturday. A team of officials from the WRD and Chennai Metrowater attended the meeting. Officials said their Andhra Pradesh counterparts had assured them to release water between September 10 and 14 after building up storage at Kandaleru. The reservoir in Andhra Pradesh now has storage of nearly 23 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) and is receiving inflow from the Somasila reservoir. The WRD in Andhra Pradesh plans to step up storage till 30 tmcft before discharging water for Chennai’s drinking water needs, an official said. As per the inter-State agreement under the Krishna Water Supply project, Chennai has to be provided with 8 tmcft of water between July and October. “The Andhra Pradesh officials have assured us to release a minimum of 4 tmc in two months. We need to realise about 700 cusecs (cubic feet per second) daily to achieve it. By then, our reservoirs will also begin to receive inflow from catchment areas during the northeast monsoon,” he said. The committee was formed to discuss the modalities of water release to Chennai and technical issues in supply from Kandaleru reservoir. It may be recalled that the city received 8.05 tmcft between September-end last year and June this year in two spells. This was one of the highest realisation of water since the project’s launch in 1996.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/krishna-water-likely-to-be-released-by-mid-september/article32477705.ece

30 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Concerns raised over crowding in flower market at Vanagaram||Flower wholesalers have complained that the temporary market opened at Vanagaram on August 20 was getting crowded easily as a result of space constraints. The merchants demanded that they be allowed to operate in smaller groups in different areas until they are allowed to return to Koyambedu. Since several retailers and labourers gather at the temporary market, the nearby stretch of Poonamallee High Road has witnessed heavy traffic congestion, particularly during mornings, traders said. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority had allotted an alternative site for flower wholesalers who were scattered across the city following the closure of the Koyambedu Wholesale Market complex. A four-acre plot belonging to the Kailasanathar temple in Vanagaram, falling under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, was allotted. S. Rajapandian, a flower wholesaler from Thiruverkadu, said though 224 shops had been allotted in the Vanagaram market, about 500 to 600 traders operated daily from the vacant space. “This has led to the congestion,” he said. Merchants said the daily rent for each shop had now been reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 300. Physical distancing norms and other safety measures were not strictly enforced in the temporary market, they said. A. Manoharan, a wholesale trader, said, “Unlike in Thirumazhisai and Madhavaram, the operating hours of the Vanagaram market extends from 2 a.m. to 4 p.m. We plan to ask the authorities to allow us to function in separate batches until Koyambedu is reopened.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/concerns-raised-over-crowding-in-flower-market-at-vanagaram/article32477690.ece

Almost a thousand people came to Kasimedu with police protection, says R. Mohanasundaram, 70, who is a fourth-generation Kasimedu resident. “We held a meeting of our village council and since the people had nowhere to go, we allowed them to settle here,” he recalls. He was also among the leaders who fought against a proposed move to shift fishing activities to Ennore during the port expansion plan. “We are the original settlers along this stretch of the coast, and we went to the High Court to ensure our rights were safeguarded. The judge came to the seashore and said that we must not be disturbed. He asked us to cooperate with the port,” says Mr. Mohanasundaram. However, like other fishermen, he too is unhappy that the Chennai Port Trust has not implemented the High Court orders to provide drinking water, public conveniences and spaces to dry fish inside the fishing harbour. “They only want our space. Even some eight years ago, they wanted more space for a road, which we had to give to prevent accidents,” he said.  The now-bustling area, known for the city’s largest fishing harbour, is well lit and has concrete paved roads. Coastal erosion, however, is a perennial problem. Space crunch “Several fishing hamlets vie with each other for space here. Our area did not have as many people then. In fact, we only had mud roads and the streets were dark. We got tar roads only in 1989,” he said. This long-time resident of Kasimedu would like to see his area improve with better hygiene and sanitation. “People must cooperate. There must be a change in their attitude,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kasimedu-through-the-eyes-of-a-long-time-resident/article32477717.ece

With the death of the elephant aged around 50, the number of elephant deaths reported in Coimbatore Forest Division this year increased to 19. According to forest officials, tribesmen who went to the forest to graze cattle found the carcass of the elephant in a decomposing state. Forest staff and veterinarians went to the place and examined the carcass. The carcass was found near the forest area where an elephant calf was found dead on August 18. After autopsy, the carcass was left in the wild for scavengers. Injured elephant under observation Meanwhile, an injured makna (tusk-less male elephant) that has been roaming in bordering areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu is currently camping within the limits of Pooluvapatti forest range of Coimbatore Forest Division. Forest officials said that the makna had a severe injury in its mouth, possibly suffered after biting a country-made explosive laced with a food item. The makna nicknamed ‘bulldozer’ for its habit of damaging houses for food has been roaming in Sholayur and Attapadi region in Palakkad district of Kerala and Anaikatti region of Coimbatore district. The elephant was found at the Maruthamalai foothills in the second week of August. Later it moved to Kerala where the Forest Department tranquilised it and offered treatment. The elephant returned to Tamil Nadu side on August 26. “We were told by the Kerala officials that it has a severe injury in its oral cavity. The elephant is currently being monitored within the limits of Pooluvapatti forest range. The elephant consumed the rice balls stuffed with antibiotics and other medicines,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-found-dead-near-anaikatti/article32477761.ece

Karthik on Saturday accused the State Government and Coimbatore district administration of having failed to contain the spread of COVID-19. More cases “The Government that said that lockdown was the solution to contain the spread and the district administration that implemented it had not done enough as the number of cases is greater than what it was in March, when it imposed the lockdown,” he told journalists at a press meet. The district administration did not properly enforce the lockdown restriction. It did not perform as many tests as required to contain the infection. It also delayed declaration of results. No transparency The administration did not show transparency in its COVID-19 management. As a result, the number of cases had increased, particularly in the recent past, Mr. Karthik said and added that the administration’s failure only exposed the State Government’s poor strategy in managing COVID-19 pandemic. With the increase in cases in Coimbatore, people were scared. It was the district administration that should restore confidence in people but it appeared clueless. It should clearly tell the people if it had enough beds, ventilators, doctors and paramedical staff to meet spike in cases, as it had predicted.

Rajamani on Friday. “We explained our financial constraints to the Collector. Transport and handling costs have increased manifold after the lockdown. All businesses have to shell out for the statutory payments too. Hence, it will not be possible to test all the workers for COVID-19 in private labs,” said C. Balasubramaniam, vice president of the Federation of Trade Associations, Coimbatore. Testing the workers and staff for COVID-19 every 15 days under the pool test method will be practically difficult and unaffordable to the MSMEs. The industries have taken several measures to safeguard their workers. Regular awareness programmes are conducted for them, according to the Joint Council of Associations of Coimbatore, in a memorandum to the Collector. The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations also appealed to the Collector to ask the Corporation to conduct tests for the workers and to not take action on the units that are unable to test the workers. According to Mr. Balasubramaniam and R. Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, the Collector has urged the industries and commercial establishments to take all the precautionary measures. He urged the units to go in for random testing to ensure there is no spread. If there are more cases in a particular shop or industry, the Collector warned that strict action will be taken against the establishment. The officials have also said the trade and industry can test the workers at the COVID-19 camps conducted by the government, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industry-and-trade-associations-appeal-to-collector-against-mandatory-testing/article32477755.ece
30 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Parcel cargo express train launched||Salem Division of Southern Railway launched its first weekly parcel cargo express train from Coimbatore to New Delhi here on Saturday. The cargo express will be operated between Coimbatore North Junction and Patel Nagar Junction in New Delhi. Every Saturday, the train will originate from Coimbatore North at 10 a.m. and reach Patel Nagar on Monday night, a release said. During its return, the train will depart from Patel Nagar at 6 a.m. every Wednesday and will arrive at Coimbatore North Junction on Friday. The train will stop at Tiruppur, Erode, Salem, Renigunta and Nagpur Junctions for loading of parcels. Divisional Railway Manager of Salem Division U. Subba Rao and Senior Divisional Commercial Manager E. Harikrishnan along with other officials from the division flagged off the train at Coimbatore North Junction. This is the first time-tabled parcel cargo express train service to New Delhi by Southern Railway, Mr. Harikrishnan told The Hindu. Comprising 15 parcel vans and two seating-cum-luggage rake (SLR) coaches, the train could carry 353 tonnes of goods. The train will mostly carry hosiery products, machinery, textile materials and eggs, he said. The tender period for the train will be six years. “We (Salem Division) are expecting revenue of around Rs. 100 crore in these six years,” Mr. Harikrishnan said. Star Associates, a Salem-based private firm, has taken up the contract and will look after the aggregation of goods and collection of revenue from various parties for the train service, he said. All loading workers were screened using thermal scanners and personal distancing was ensured by railway officials during the loading process. The workers were also provided with masks and hand sanitisers, he said. “Even if other (passenger) train services are resumed, the parcel cargo train services will continue,” Mr. Harikrishnan clarified. Another parcel cargo train service between Coimbatore and Rajkot will be launched shortly, he said. Mr. Harikrishnan invited manufacturing units and industrial associations to utilise the train service for transportation of goods. Customers may contact 81110 00199 or 81110 00195 for bookings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parcel-cargo-express-train-service-launched/article32477738.ece
30 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Shops to close down||Nearly 350 shops on Cross Cut Road -- from Lala sweet corner to North Coimbatore flyover -- will remain closed from 7 p.m. on Saturday to September 6 night. This is to control the spread of COVID-19 and to reduce the crowd on Cross Cut Road, said S. Jothimani, secretary of Merchants’ Association, Cross Cut Road. There are several shops on the adjoining roads that have expressed support for the move, he said. The Federation of Trade Associations, Coimbatore, representing 14 trade associations will decide on Saturday night or Sunday whether its members will also go in for closure of shops. These associations represent traders in various sectors such as furniture, steel, and paper. Coimbatore Jewellers Association president B. Sabarinath said the association would decide on closure of retail jewellery outlets in the city on Monday. The hoteliers have decided to keep the hotels open.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shops-to-close-down/article32477752.ece
30 August 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. criticised for asking traders to have their employees tested||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee working president Mayura S. Jayakumar has criticised the Coimbatore Corporation for asking traders to have their employees tested for COVID-19, every 15 days. In a statement issued here on Saturday, he said at a time when traders were yet to recover from the impact of the lockdown restriction, the civic body’s latest order would only burden traders as they were not in a position to spend Rs. 3,000 to have an employee or worker tested for COVID-19, that too once in 15 days. This was an impractical order and raised the suspicion if the Corporation had acted so because of nexus between a few officials and private labs. The Corporation, instead of burdening traders, should come forward, take responsibility and test traders and their employees at no cost, Mr.Jayakumar suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-criticised-for-asking-traders-to-have-their-employees-tested/article32477754.ece
30 August 2020||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||Norms flouted at AIADMK event||COVID-19 guidelines were flouted at an AIADMK membership drive, held at a packed wedding hall in Dharmapuri on Saturday. The event was presided over by Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan. Ironically, only last week, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had visited the district to take stock of containment measures. There was hardly any distancing on the dais and the hall, where scores of cadre and leaders were present. Dozens of party functionaries were seated in close proximity on the dais, in the presence of Mr. Anbalagan, and many of them were not wearing masks or were seen not wearing them properly. The event was organised by the AIADMK’s Illagnar and Illam Pengal Paasarai. While COVID-19 guidelines do not permit any political, religious or cultural gatherings, many attendees were seen seated on the floor as well. None of them were subjected to thermal scanning or vetted for masks. The district is seeing a spike in cases and a ban on the use of wedding halls continues. However, it is unclear how permission was granted for the event.    The Hindu messaged Collector S. Malarvizhi, asking her about the violation, but she did not respond till late Saturday. Attempts to contact Mr. Anbalagan, who recently recovered from COVID-19, failed. Last week, during the CM’s event, DMK MP for Dharmapuri, Senthil Kumar, was denied permission to submit a petition, and was told that he had to take a COVID-19 test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/norms-flouted-at-aiadmk-event/article32477710.ece
30 August 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Sale of flowers dull despite Onam festival in Kerala||Despite Kerala celebrating Onam, flower growers from in and around the district have expressed concern over the poor sale of seasonal flowers here on Saturday. With just two days more for the Onam festival, flower markets and vendors from different parts of Kerala, who used to procure at least 20 tonnes of seasonal flowers over the last one week or 10 days as a mark of the celebrations, had not lifted the produce in a big way. “Just about 5 tonnes of flowers has been despatched till yesterday,” said Ibrahim, a flower grower here. The price of seasonal flowers, which was around Rs. 180 to Rs. 200 per kg last year, had dropped to Rs. 80 per kg this season. Farmers from Ammapatti, Vellodu, Narasingapuram, Perumalkoilpatti, Nilakottai and Pugayilaipatti who had grown flowers extensively were in a state of shock as they had ended up in a huge loss. “We expected the merchants to come and buy for the Onam festival in Kerala... but, everyone had attributed the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason and that the festivities were happening in a lowkey way there...” they added. There were also seasons in the past, where the vendors from Kerala took the flowers directly from the fields as and when the harvest was completed. The flower market here too wore a very thin crowd on Saturday as local vendors were hesitant to procure as many temples were yet to open in a full-fledged manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sale-of-flowers-dull-despite-onam-festival-in-kerala/article32478007.ece
30 August 2020||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Desilting of irrigation channel begins||Accepting to desilt a 27 km-stretch of an irrigation channel from Athur to Agaram at a cost of Rs. 90 lakh, the Athur MLA and senior DMK leader I. Periasami commenced the work here on Saturday. Thanking the MLA, the farmers’ associations from about eight villages said that it would benefit 4,000 acres of cultivable land from this season. Though in the past, the farmers had submitted representations to the VAO in the locality and also to the Collector, nothing tangible was done to remove the encroachments on the water channels, Joseph Arulanandam president of Sithalaikundu and Thamaraikulam farmers association said. The work, which commenced on Saturday from Palam Rajakkapatti on Palani Road, would move southwards of Anumantharayankottai bridge. Similarly, desilting of channel began from Athur Kamarajar reservoir side to Anumantharayankottai. In short, from Athur Chokkupillai channel to Agaram, the area covered would be 27 kilometres, said Reddiyarchatram union chairman K Sathiyamoorthi after inaugurating the works. An official from the Agriculture Department said that they had received petitions from the farmers’ associations in the past during the farmers’ grievances meeting. The PWD had last carried out works nine years ago. The desilting of channels being done now would benefit the tail end farmers in Agaram, he added. Mr. Periasami said that instead of indulging in blame game, he had decided to take it up on his own as nothing had been done by the government despite representations being given on many occasion. The ultimate benefit should reach the farmers and that they should know the DMK - irrespective of whether in power or not, delivered results. The farmers said that when the desilting of channels gets completed in about a fortnight, water would flow from Athur to Thamaraikulam, a distance of 15 kms and subsequently benefit tanks including Avatharakulam, Aynthankulam, Anaipattikulam, Kottur Avarampattikulam, Velasamudramkulam and among others, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/desilting-of-irrigation-channel-begins/article32477985.ece

The corporation-run flower market will remain closed with immediate effect and as an alternative, vendors can use the space in Kamarajar bus stand. The corporation flower market, which can accommodate all types of vendors on the campus, has now been moved to the bus stand, which was functioning as a makeshift market.

30 August 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Residents clean-up drainage canal||Stating that the corporation had failed to clean the drainage canal for the past six months resulting in carry bags and plastic bottles clogging the drains, residents of Thayumanavar Street in Kollampalayam deployed an excavator and removed the waste materials on Saturday. Residents said that hundreds of houses were located near the canal that runs for many kms carrying sewage from households. All these years, residents dumped municipal solid waste, including plastic waste, in the canal resulting in frequent clogging “During rainy season, overflowing canal is a major concern for us and the civic body failed to remove the bushes and the waste or desilt it,” said a resident. She said that water in borewells and wells had become contaminated due to the drain and many complain of skin diseases. “We were asking the officials to clean the drain for many months. Since, the situation turned worse, 16 families collected money and deployed the machine for cleaning”, said a resident. Waste materials removed from the drain were dumped along the road and residents, condemning the corporation, besieged the garbage collection vehicle on Saturday. Later, corporation officials arrived at the spot and held talks with the residents. Officials said that all the excavators were deployed for controlling the fire at the compost yard at Vendipalayam and added that they will deploy a tractor to remove the waste dumped on the road. Officials also assured to clean the drain regularly. Later, the protest was withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-clean-up-drainage-canal/article32477758.ece

Vasanthakumar, Kanniyakumari MP and businessman, in Chennai on Saturday. AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik, Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and TNCC president K.S. Alagiri were among those who paid their respects at the Kamaraj Bhavan in Teynampet where his body was kept before being taken by road to his hometown Agastheeswaram in Kanniyakumari. An eerie silence prevailed in Agastheeswaram, which lost one of its illustrious sons, who rose from humble beginnings to build a retail business empire, Vasanth and Co, and also succeed in politics. The TNCC working president had died on Friday in a hospital where he was admitted for treatment of COVID-19. Vasanthakumar’s cousins had placed his portrait in front of his house to enable the residents to pay their last respects. Since the mortal remains of the ancestors and parents of Vasanthakumar have been buried in a farm near the village, the MP’s family has also decided to bury his mortal remains in the adjoining land. “The family wants to construct a fitting memorial there,” a source close to the family said. Led by Tamil Nadu Government’s special representative for Delhi N. Thalavai Sundaram, a group of AIADMK functionaries and a few Roman Catholic priests offered prayers in his office at Thovalai. Though the Centre had suspended the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme fund in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Vasanthakumar was spending his entire salary for the education of poor students, locals said. He generously helped the poor by meeting their medical expenses and giving money for constructing houses. “When a peepal tree got uprooted and fell on a few houses and shops at Thirunanthikkarai on a windy day last month, he met the affected people and helped them with his personal funds,” recalled a resident. The most striking feature of Vasanthakumar was that he would impartially interact with the cadre and office-bearers of all political parties and help them in the best possible way. “I may have been elected to the Parliament as a Congress member. But I am a common man and the representative of every resident of Kanniyakumari district. So I should help them whenever they approach me,” he would say. The earthmover that was purchased with his personal fund for removing thorny bushes in his erstwhile Nanguneri Assembly constituency and then for desilting the irrigation tanks was moved to Kanniyakumari Parliamentary segment after he was elected MP for carrying out similar works there. “If we want to use the heavy equipment for a desilting work in a village, a responsible person from the hamlet should register in his office in advance. Within a couple of days, either Vasanthakumar or his men would visit the spot and send the earthmover for the work for which the beneficiary farmers or the villagers need not pay anything,” recalls S. Murugan of Nagercoil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agastheeswaram-mourns-its-illustrious-son/article32477768.ece

30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Outsiders come under scanner at entry points||A total of 97,933 e-passes have been issued to enter Madurai district from August 17 to 28, following relaxation of e-pass approval norms for inter-district travel in the State. Health department officials say strict monitoring and swab collection from symptomatic persons is done to prevent rise in COVID-19 cases. Deputy Director of Health Services Priya Raj said swab samples are lifted from those who travel from Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts at the entry points to Madurai. “Health officials trace people coming from districts based on their address and mobile number submitted for e-pass. They are monitored and swab samples collected from those who display symptoms,” she said. Around 80% of the people who applied for the e-pass system had their destination as Madurai city, said City Health Officer P. Kumaraguruparan. He said they receive the list of people who travel from other districts on a daily basis. The details are shared with Corporation officials and staff of Urban primary Health Centres. A total of 1,400 field level workers deployed by the civic body visit houses of these people and monitor them. Samples are lifted from those who display symptoms. A Corporation Sanitary Officer said many residents inform officials when outsiders stay in their area. “On a positive note, many people are coming forward to get themselves tested,” he said. An official from the district administration said that on an average, three persons travelled for every e-pass that was approved. “It is imperative to monitor them to prevent rise in COVID-19 cases,” he said. Dr. Kumaraguruparan said the main challenge was that a large number of people travelled to Madurai with approved e-pass to either attend weddings or for medical reasons. “Since these people leave the city in a day or two, it is difficult to trace them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/outsiders-come-under-scanner-at-entry-points/article32477992.ece

The order said that a total of 6,739 mcft of water will be released for irrigating the first paddy crop of the double crop region for 120 days. For the first 45 days, 900 cusecs will be released each day. In the next 75 days, the amount of water to be released will be based on the storage of water in the dam, said the release. Usually, water for irrigating the first crop of the double crop area begins by June 1, if the combined Periyar credit is 4,000 cusecs. But, this year there has been almost a three-month delay. Since the past two weeks, water is being released for irrigating 14,707 acres in Cumbum valley. A senior official of the Public Works Department said that it was expected that from mid September water would be released for irrigating the single crop areas in Madurai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-from-vaigai-dam-to-be-released-tomorrow/article32477983.ece
30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC ruling on TANGEDCO’s service regulations||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has clarified that TANGEDCO’s amendment to the service regulations, which prescribes a minimum experience for various feeder category posts for promotion to the next higher cadre, will have a prospective and not a retrospective effect. TANGEDCO had brought the amendment to its service regulation by prescribing a minimum experience for the feeder category posts, as some employees in these categories were able to get quick promotion within a span of one or two years to the next cadre. As this would have an impact on overall functioning of the Corporation, TANGEDCO thought it fit to make the amendment to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Service Regulations. However, the validity of the same was challenged before the court. The main contention of the petitioners was that before making the amendment in the service regulations, the employee union / trade union should have been consulted and briefed on whether the amendments will have a prospective or retrospective effect. They said that if they were retrospective, it would have an adverse impact on employees who were eligible for promotion prior to the amending rules coming into effect. The State told the court that the rule will come into effect from the date on which it was issued, June 2, and not prior to that. Consultation with trade unions was not required as the labour law will not be applicable to employees covered under the regulations, the State said. Taking cognisance of the submissions made, Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that the amending regulations will come into effect prospectively only from June 2 and will not have a retrospective effect.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-ruling-on-tangedcos-service-regulations/article32477993.ece

30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Chaos in college due to technical glitch in NATA||Chaos prevailed at Madurai Institute of Engineering and Technology at Pottapalayam in Sivaganga district on Saturday, located around 11 km from Madurai, as there was a technical glitch while students appeared for the online National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA), resulting in cancellation of the examination. This college was one of the centres in the district. R. Pandiarajan, who accompanied a candidate, said that the two-hour exam was supposed to start from 12.30 p.m., but it was delayed owing to an issue in the server. “Due to a power cut, the college was functioning with the help of a generator. Following the delay in conducting the exams, there was a commotion on the campus as parents enquired the college staff about the delay in conducting the exam,” he said. Although a few students did the online test, they complained that many questions were incomplete, said R. Shiva, another parent. “Eventually, the exams were cancelled. Many students had studied hard and prepared for the exam. But, there is no clarity on when the exams would be conducted for these candidates who missed the exams on Saturday,” he noted. College Director G. Johnson said that the issue of the server was a fault which had to be rectified only by the exam organisers. “The problems that occurred on Saturday were totally unexpected, but we took all measures to rectify them. The organisers have informed us that re-exams would be conducted for these students in the next three or four days,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chaos-in-college-due-to-technical-glitch-in-nata/article32478001.ece
30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Amendment to EIA notification challenged in HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday ordered notice to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in a public interest litigation petition that challenged the amendment made to a clause of the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, in 2013. A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and B. Pugalendhi ordered notice to the Centre in the petition filed by R. Fatima of Thoothukudi who challenged Clause 2(b) of the notification issued by the Centre to the amendment effected to item 7(f) of the 2006 notification that stipulated that highway projects required environmental clearance. But the amendment exempted extension of highway projects up to 100 km in length involving additional land acquisition of 40 metres width on existing alignment and 60 metres on new alignment from obtaining the clearance. The petitioner said this was contrary to the very purpose of the EIA notification, 2006 and had effectively removed all highway expansion projects from the purview of the notification. The purpose of the EIA notification, 2006 was to ensure sustainable development, she said. Taking advantage of this amendment, the impact of tree felling, land conversion and livelihood loss were not being assessed. The damage caused to the environment cannot be remedied, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amendment-to-eia-notification-challenged-in-hc/article32477990.ece
30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||See there is no fresh encroachments: HC tells Karur Collector||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Karur Collector to give an undertaking/assurance to the effect that there would be no fresh or re-encroachments on a waterbody in Muthalaipatti, Karur district. A father and son duo were hacked to death in 2019 for exposing the encroachment in the waterbody. A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam took cognisance of the State’s submission that whatever encroachments were found on the waterbody were removed, except for a temple. The temple has challenged the order of the High Court before the Supreme Court, the State said. With regard to the probe into the murder case of the father-son duo, Veeramalai and Nallathambi, the State informed the court that chargesheet has been filed in the case. The matter was pending for trial and there was a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Adequate police protection was granted to the members of the family, the State said. The court took cognisance of the fact that originally, the waterbody had a water-spread area of 198.42 acres, during the British rule. But it had now reduced to 15.72.5 hectares as the government had granted house site pattas and established a State seed farm.

30 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||GRH sees a slight dip in emergency cases||During the lockdown period, doctors at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) are performing around 40 emergency and semi-emergency cases each day, say senior officials. Dean J. Sangumani says a majority of these tend to be either neurological or maternity cases. “Orthopaedic surgery and cancer care are also attended to”, he adds. Prior to COVID-19, the GRH would see a minimum of 75 emergency surgeries, says Treatment Coordinator of the COVID-19 Speciality Hospital K. Senthil. However, due to various reasons the numbers have come down. “Even though e-pass relaxations are in place, lack of public transport has disallowed people from coming to the GRH. Most look for medical aid in and around their areas,” says a senior doctor. The doctor says that COVID-19 has also prevented people from crowding the hospital as the number of attendants have been restricted. “COVID-19 has been a deterrent as it has caused fear among the public to visit hospitals. Once elective surgeries begin in full swing and public transport is allowed, people may again throng GRH,” he says. The Dean says there are no plans to begin elective surgeries right now. “Our doctors use personal protection equipment even while tending to emergencies,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grh-sees-a-slight-dip-in-emergency-cases/article32477988.ece

30 August 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic focus shifts to rural areas||While the spread of novel coronavirus was largely concentrated in urban centres and its peripheries in central districts, officials and doctors say that more than half of COVID-19 cases reported in August have come from rural areas. With the increase becoming more distinct, authorities have shifted focus to containment of transmission of the virus in these areas. Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Pudukottai districts have recorded a hike in cases with many patients hailing from town and village panchayats. In Tiruvarur, a doctor at Tiruvarur Medical College Hospital told The Hindu that of the 236 villages in the district, a majority of cases were being reported from 90 villages. “While the advantage is that many of them are mild or asymptomatic, they may still become super-spreaders of the viral infection,” the doctor said. However, despite the increase in cases in small villages, no cases of recurrence of the viral infection have been reported in Tiruvarur district, he added. In Ariyalur district, the positivity rate has seen a slight increase at 8.5% due to increase in cases in rural areas. “The first challenge that villages are likely face is one of testing. Most of the RT-PCR labs are located in big cities, or at district headquarters. Therefore, to reach the grassroots, fever camps are being held, and also all primary healthcare centres in Ariyalur district take swab tests for COVID-19,” a health department official said. In Pudukottai, where a steady rise of cases has been recorded for over a month, the number of positive cases in rural areas are equal to that of the town, said V. Arjun Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services. “We have witnessed a significant rise in index cases with no history of contact or travel. These patients are being identified at fever camps being held across the district,” he said. Aranthangi and its surrounding villages are recording a rise, Dr. Arjun Kumar added. Meanwhile, quarantine norms in the district have been modified. “If there are three positive cases on a street, irrespective of whether they are from the same house or not, the street is declared a containment zone,” he pointed out. Forty such zones are currently barricaded and cordoned off in the district. The departments of health, revenue and civic bodies in the district are working hand-in-hand to contain the spread of the infection by conducting door-to-door surveillance and fever camps, They are also looking to involve non-governmental organisations to assist in surveillance, Dr. Arjun Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-focus-shifts-to-rural-areas/article32478032.ece

An official of the department said the work order has to be issued and construction will commence, probably in a month. The project at Rs. 1,157 crore (excluding land acquisition cost) will see construction of a four-lane flyover for nearly 10 km on Avinashi Road from Uppilipalayam. It is scheduled to be completed in four years. The flyover will have four up ramps and four down ramps at Anna Statue junction, Hope College junction, Kalapatti junction, and Nava India junction. The official said the land acquisition process for 18,000sq.mtis also on. Additional land is required only for the ramps and service road. Hence, work will start at the earliest for the main structure. The pillars will be raised along the proposed stretch for the flyover. Vehicle movement will be permitted on a single lane on either side of the existing road, the official said. Traffic diversion will be needed only when the main structure is built at the junctions, the official said. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said it would be better to finish land acquisition and then take up construction of an infrastructure project. However, since the Avinashi Road flyover is a long-pending demand for the city and has four-year time for completion, commencing construction works without completing land acquisition is acceptable. The government should do the land acquisition simultaneously. A separate team should focus on land acquisition. Further, Tiruchi Road, Mettupalayam Road and Avinashi Road are the main roads for Coimbatore. Flyover works will be going on all these roads soon. In an effort to facilitate easy flow of traffic, the Sowripalayam Road should be developed so that cars and two-wheelers can use it. All possible hardships that the road users may face should be thought of and steps taken immediately to find solutions to the problems, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/avinashi-road-flyover-works-to-commence-soon/article32477759.ece

30 August 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Centre, State have failed to contain virus spread’||The Union and the State governments have completely failed in containing the spread of COVID-19, KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi said here on Saturday. The Centre needlessly centralised the COVID-19 management. It also issued several hundreds of orders, some of which are contradictory to each other, he said. “Neither the Ministers at the Centre nor at the State have any clarity about COVID-19 management. They issue statements that make no sense.” Mr. Satish Jarkiholi told party workers in the Congress office. “Both the governments failed to listen to scientists. For their folly, the people had to suffer. The State government treated it as a law and order problem and not as a health crisis. It allowed the police and health officers to forcefully take all positive persons to the district hospital. This led to unnecessary rush in district hospitals. It also pushed out all those not suffering from COVID-19 from district hospitals. This also created a stigma among the people about the disease,” he said. He alleged that patients in taluks and small villages have been left to die as they had no medical advice. “The government also failed to control and monitor private hospitals and doctors who have refused to treat those suffering from COVID-19 and other ailments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-state-have-failed-to-contain-virus-spread/article32477847.ece

30 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mysuru records highest positivity rate||It may be Bengaluru Urban that is reporting the highest number of cases in the State, but when it comes to positivity rates, Mysuru is leading the list of districts in Karnataka. An analysis by the Karnataka State COVID-19 War Room of the daily report as on August 28, 5 p.m., showed that in the last 15 days from the date of analysis, Mysuru had the highest positivity rate among all districts with 25%. Shivamogga, Ballari and Gadag were a close second with a 23% positivity rate, followed by Udupi and Chikkamagaluru with 20%. On the other end of the graph is Chickballapur with 7%, Mandya at 8% and Kodagu, Bidar, Uttara Kannada and Chamarajanagar with 9%. Bengaluru, which has been the most significant contributor to the State’s 3,27,076 cases with 1,24,442, has 12% positivity rate. In the last seven days from Friday, Mysuru had a positivity rate of 34.1%. Ballari had the second highest positivity rate with 23.4%, followed by Gadag with 23.3%. Chamarajanagar has the least positivity rate at 7.4%, followed by Kodagu (7.6%) and Mandya (7.7%). For a three day period from the date of analysis, Karnataka had a positivity rate of 15%. Mysuru’s rate was 37.8%, followed by Chikkamagaluru (28.1%) and Gadag (25%).  ‘Advantageous’ C.N. Manjunath, director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and nodal officer for labs and testing in Karnataka’s COVID-19 task force, told The Hindu that the positivity rate of Karnataka was around 14% in the last few days, and the high positivity rate should be seen as an advantage rather than cause alarm among people. “It (the higher rate) in certain districts such as Mysuru probably means that more symptomatic people are being tested, while in districts like Bengaluru, more random testing is being conducted. The higher positivity rates do not mean new disease burden, but existing disease burden coming to light,” he explained. As on Saturday, as many as 72,684 tests, including Rapid Antigen Detection Test and RTPCR, were conducted, taking the total number of tests conducted in the State to 27,85,718. “Had we conducted fewer tests, the new number of cases being reported would also be low. But as you pick up more cases, you are preventing further spread, which is advantageous. This means it is also preventive as those cases where early treatment is needed are being attended to,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-records-highest-positivity-rate/article32477673.ece
30 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||II PU: Mid-term portion to be covered by October||After getting a good response towards pre-recorded classes for second year pre-university (PU) students, the Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE) now plans to complete the mid-term portion by October. The classes are available on YouTube and the videos have received over 1 crore views since they began on July 22, said M. Kanagavalli, the director of the department. The YouTube channel has 1.3 lakh subscribers and lessons are conducted for 21 subjects of the 2020-21 academic year. “We started classes as there was uncertainty around the re-opening of educational institutions. Once the mid-term portions are completed through the pre-recorded classes, we will conduct an assessment for students and later decide how the rest of the academic year should be designed,” she said. Syllabus to be reduced The department has also decided to reduce the syllabus by 30% as the duration of the academic year has been shortened owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Details of the lessons which will be deleted will be announced later this week. II PU students are given a timetable every week and are told whether they will have classes or be assigned writing work. Students have been getting their doubts clarified from their teachers on WhatsApp. However, some students say that they will be unable to appear for an assessment merely based on the pre-recorded classes. “I watch the pre-recorded videos, but it is very different from a classroom experience. I hope our colleges conduct revision classes for these lessons. Our lecturers have said that they will conduct a bridge course once college reopens. We cannot attempt the board examinations just based on online classes,” said a second year pre-university student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ii-pu-mid-term-portion-to-be-covered-by-october/article32477661.ece
30 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Candidates entitled to seek copies of their answer scripts from KPSC, says High Court||The High Court of Karnataka has declared that a candidate who has appeared for examination conducted by a public service commission can seek copies of his/her own evaluated answer scripts along with the marks allotted to each question under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.  Not of others  However, while issuing copies of the answer scripts and or the information sought, certain safeguards are to be followed namely identity of the examiner should not to be revealed and has to be masked, the court said while making it clear that a candidate cannot seek for copies of evaluated answer scripts of any other candidates. Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order while disposing of a petition filed by the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) which had questioned the order the Karnataka Information Commission (KIC) to provide copies of answer scripts to a candidate, Vinay Kumar Ramaiah, who had appeared for the Gazetted Probationers mains exam held in 2017. “Freedom of information being a fundamental right as also human right, any person would be entitled to apply for and receive information especially pertaining to himself which is held by any public authority. The reasons for requesting such information may be myriad. Whatever they may be when a particular information sought for is relating to the person applying for such information, the authorities concerned cannot refuse the furnishing the same,” the court observed.It added that in order to make an application under the RTI Act seeking answer scripts, the applicants will have to satisfy the parameters laid down by the apex court the case of UPSC Vs. Angesh Kumar, and submit application in a prescribed form and paying the requisite fee. Can’t remove PIOs Meanwhile, the court found fault with the KIC’s order of appointing the Controller of Examination of the KPSC as a Public Information Officer while holding that the RTI Act does not empower to dismiss a PIO appointed by a public authority and appoint a new PIO. The Information Commissions can only direct a public authority to appoint a PIO if the public authority had failed to appoint one, the court clarified. Qualification for PIO Noticing that there is no qualification fixed for the post of the PIO and they can be appointed as per the discretion of the public authorities, the court observed that “this aspect may be taken into consideration by the legislature in its wisdom to formulate the requirements of qualification, if any, for the appointment of an officer as a PIO as the officer is required to consider judgments of various courts while accepting or rejecting applications for information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/candidates-entitled-to-seek-copies-of-their-answer-scripts-from-kpsc-says-high-court/article32477674.ece

30 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Index application has reduced response time’||Anil Kumar Buna, a 25-year-old chattered accountant living in J.P. Nagar 7th phase, was surprised when an ambulance arrived at his doorstep within three hours of getting a positive result for COVID-19 in the latter half of July. He expected a long and tension-ridden waiting time given the experience of many who had contracted the virus in the earlier months. Recently, although the number of COVID-19 cases are on the rise, several people who tested positive in Bengaluru and needed medical assistance, say they have been able to receive a relatively quick response from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to reach the hospital if needed. An analysis by the BBMP War Room, which has developed the Index Application, states that the response time has become quicker after the introduction of this application. Access to information Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, BBMP war room special officer, said that the index application helps access information on cases from the ICMR portal, provides it to the zonal command centres and all field teams for action and implementation of tasks. “This application helps the civic body shift patients either to the hospital, COVID-19 Care Centres based on symptoms, arranging ambulances and tracking the health condition of the patient. We have reduced the response time to near real-time. Index Application has achieved this at a time when numbers surged 10-fold at Bengaluru,” she said.  Patients with co-morbidities The response time for patients with comorbidities has been reduced drastically. According to the data, 80% of 2,738 patients with co-morbidities have been attended to on the same day, between July 1 to August 15. Around 20% of the cases have delays of one day or more, while there have been delays of two days or more in 2% of the cases. The war room analysis also shows that overall, 75% of all the cases are attended to on the same day even though the case load had increased 30 times in July. After the State government saw these results, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar shared the document regarding this application and wrote to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs that it would facilitate peer-to-peer learning among smart cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/index-application-has-reduced-response-time/article32477664.ece

30 August 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||‘Report on internal quota should be tabled in legislature’||Justice A.J. Sadashiva Commission’s report on internal reservation, submitted to Karnataka government in 2012, is back in news in the light of the recent Supreme court judgment on the issue. The commission, to which Justice Sadashiva was appointed chairman in 2005, had come up with a formula for subdividing 15% reservation for the Scheduled Castes. In an telephonic interview with The Hindu , Justice Sadashiva expressed his disappointment over successive State governments delaying action on the recommendations. Excerpts from the interview:  Successive governments have not accepted your report. What do you think is the reason for the delay?   When a government constitutes a commission, it should act upon its recommendations. As I have often said, if they are not happy with it, let them reject it. It is sad they have not tabled it in the legislature, though it has been eight years since I submitted the report. It seems nobody has a genuine concern for providing benefits of internal reservation for deprived castes within the Scheduled Castes. They all talk much about it, but remain silent when they come to power.  Can you recall functioning of the commission?   The commission did a commendable work on the lines of population census. Involving Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, and tahsildars, we conducted a door-to-door survey of the Scheduled Castes across the State. We collected data about the socioeconomic status of each family. The number of Scheduled Caste households we covered was by and large the same as the census report released at that time. Many leaders from different parties and places actively participated in the deliberations and gave suggestions. But some of them forgot the report soon after coming to power.  The government has not released the report officially. However, the commission’s recommendations have triggered debates among the public.   The government should have made it a public document by placing it before the legislature. I had classified the castes among SCs into four categories. Considering the population of each, the overall 15% reservation was divided. The castes that fall under the “Left” category were given 6%, those in the “Right” category 5%, Touchables 3%, and those who do not figure in any of these were given 1%. People are free to express their opinions on the recommendations.  Some people raised objections alleging that you have recommended creamy layer for Scheduled Castes in the report.   The creamy layer is altogether a different issue. I have not touched that subject in the report. Let these people first get due reservation.  What would you suggest the State government to do now?   Considering the latest judgment, the State government can begin the process. It should debate the report tabling it in the legislature. Then pass a resolution and send the same to the Centre.  It seems nobody has a genuine concern for providing benefits of internal reservation for deprived castes within the Scheduled Castes. They all talk much about it, but remain silent when they come to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/report-on-internal-quota-should-be-tabled-in-legislature/article32477679.ece

Karnataka is ninth in the country in inland fisheries. The government wants to take the State to the top spot by promoting inland fisheries through various methods. The Minister, who also holds the Endowment portfolio, said that loans will be arranged through District Central Cooperative Banks. “Our aim is to create self- employment for 10,000 persons through caged fish farming alone,” he said. Referring to the capsizing of three fishing boats this month, the Minister said that the government is now mulling on making it mandatory for fishermen to wear life jackets while at sea. He said that deep-sea fishing in the State will begin from September 1. Like earlier years, it was to have resumed from August 1 after two months of fishing holiday in June and July. But owing to COVID-19, it was postponed by a month. Ramacharya, Director, Fisheries, Karnataka, said that the government has submitted a Rs. 4,115-crore action plan to the Union government to promote fisheries in the State in the next five years under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana. Awareness on cage culture in fisheries will be created at the taluk-levels by conducting workshops , he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/training-sessions-on-cage-fish-farming-to-be-conducted-kota/article32477838.ece
30 August 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fisheries Dept. seeks amendment to Act||The Department of Fisheries has requested the government to amend the Karnataka Marine Fisheries (Regulation) Act, 1986 to regulate marine fisheries with enhanced powers to the department, according to Ramacharya, Director, Fisheries, Karnataka. Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a workshop on ‘Caged fish farming’ here on Saturday he said that the amendment proposed is also aimed at curbing illegal marine fishing effectively. For example, under the existing law, fine only up to Rs. 5,000 can be imposed for illegal fishing. It was a heavy amount when the existing Act, rules for which were framed in 1987, came into force. The amount is meagre now. Hence the department has proposed to impose a fine of up to Rs. 2.5 lakh. Under the existing Act, illegal fishing is a non-cognisable offence. It has been proposed to make it as a cognisable offence by amending the Act and also give powers to the coastal security police to book cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fisheries-dept-seeks-amendment-to-act/article32477836.ece

The PWD (NH Wing) has not fully restored the Kundannoor-Pettah NH stretch, which was in shoddy condition during the past year after the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) dug up the stretch for pipeline work. Complaints are rife that the ongoing patch work is making slow progress, despite the increase in the number of vehicles, especially goods carriers. Officials clarify Officials of the agency said the contractor had been told to speed up repair work. “Work is under way to cover a portion of the stretch using concrete paver blocks, while patch work is being done over potholes. This work will get over in a week’s time. The entire stretch will be relaid with five years warranty once the rain subside,” said M. Swaraj, MLA, who represents Thripunithura. Barring SA Road which was resurfaced and upgraded by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), most arterial roads in the city hub are pothole-ridden. Officials of the PWD (Roads Wing) said half-a-dozen key roads, including Park Avenue Road, Banerjee Road, and Shanmukham Road had been handed over to Cochin Smart Mission Ltd. (CSML) for renovation. Traffic affected “There is delay on the agency’s part in restoring damaged portions of these roads and footpaths, and it is affecting traffic movement. The Vennala-Alinchuvadu Road which runs parallel to the NH Bypass, which was trenched by the KWA earlier this year, will be restored in three days,” they added. The Aluva-Ernakulam NH corridor too is being resurfaced. The bituminous macadam layer is almost over, while bituminous concrete work is under way, the officials said. Sources in CSML said ill-maintained arterial roads would be resurfaced soon after drains and footpaths were renovated. Repair work on Civil Line Road has been suffering, since a few workers are in quarantine. The road with width varying from 8 metres to 14 metres will be resurfaced in the coming month, PWD officials said. The Kochi Corporation too is under fire, since it has not repaired dozens of busy side roads. Sources in the agency said repair work would pick pace after Onam.

The sit-in was launched under the banner of Justice for Prithviraj Action Council. The child’s mother, Nandini, said her protest would continue till authorities accepted her demands. ‘Biased probe’ She was joined by family members as they held placards alleging that the investigations till now were biased and favouring the doctors who had examined the child. The death had stirred a controversy over medical apathy since the boy was taken to three different hospitals, including Ernakulam General Hospital and the Government Medical College Hospital in Alappuzha — before his death. However, the forensic report had ruled out the presence of foreign body as the potential cause for the death. It had attributed the death to a condition called status asthmaticus, considered an acute state of asthma unresponsive to standard treatments. The Binanipuram police who had registered a case for unnatural death even as the family alleged medical negligence. Status asthmaticus The forensic report attributed the death to complications related to breathing emanating from status asthmaticus. Adding to the theory was the boy’s pneumonic history. He was hospitalised as latest as February due to breathing complications. The boy had reportedly developed cold owing to extensive travel on the fatal day, which may have further deteriorated his already failing condition, the police said. But Ms. Nandini ruled out all these findings alleging that all these investigations failed to reveal the exact cause behind her son’s death. “My child did not receive proper treatment,” she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-begins-stir-at-aluva-hospital/article32477948.ece

30 August 2020||Kottayam,KERALA||Stage set for Thiruvonathoni procession||Keeping alive an age-old tradition, M.R. Raveendra Babu Bhattathiri, the eldest member of Mangattu Illam at Kumaranalloor here, on Saturday set sail to Sree Parthasarathy Temple at Aranmula on the banks of the Pampa river, ahead of the Thiruvonathoni procession on Sunday. The Thiruvonathoni carries provisions for the Onam feast at the Aranmula temple. Legend has it that the deity at the temple made one of the elders of the Kattoor Madhom (in Pathanamthitta) to be his host for every Onam owing to his devotion. Since then, it has been the privilege of the eldest of the Bhattathiris at the Mangattu Illam (whose ancestors hailed from the Kattoor Madhom) to host the Onasadya for the deity. Maiden voyage This is the maiden voyage for Mr. Bhattathiri. Till last year, it was his elder brother, the late Narayana Bhattathiri, who was leading the ritual. The Churulan Vallam carrying Mr.Bhattathiri was slated to reach the Devaswom Sathrakkadavu at Aranmula late in the evening. The ritual, which generally begins on the Moolam day every year, was delayed by a day owing to restrictions in the wake of COVID-19. No reception was accorded to the boat at Moovadathumadam in Thiruvalla. On Sunday morning, Mr. Bhattathiri will leave for Kattur Mahavishnu Temple on another boat and from there he will embark on the Thiruvonathoni for Aranmula, which also carries offerings to be presented before the deity, on Thiruvonam day. The Thiruvonathoni is slated to reach Aranmula by 6 a.m. on Thiruvonam. In a break from tradition, only one snakeboat ( palliyodam ) will accompany the Thiruvonathoni to the Parthasarathy temple this time. Last year, as many as six palliyodams were part of the regatta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stage-set-for-thiruvonathoni-procession/article32477940.ece

The Mukkom police on Saturday booked 50 persons who allegedly hosted an Onam celebration at the KMCT Medical College, Manassery. Though the event was organised without being publicised, the police registered the case after seeing some photographs being circulated through social media. The police said all the participants in the photographs were booked under various sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Plainclothesmen have been deployed in public places to ensure that traders comply with physical distancing norms. Police officers have also been deployed on the premises of shopping centres and busy streets. Meanwhile, the mushrooming of wayside traders has emerged as a fresh challenge for special squads. However, wary of public criticism, the enforcement squads are adopting a milder stance in discouraging such trade during Onam. For hoteliers, the permission given to resume dine-in facilities in non-containment zones has doubled responsibilities. However, many are yet to make use of the option in view of Onam season due to the huge risks involved. “We will have to increase the price of food to meet the additional cost of frequent disinfections as directed by the health authorities. It may not be a viable option for us and the customers,” said Mohammed Suhail, a functionary of Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crackdown-on-onam-celebrations-that-violate-health-protocol/article32477921.ece
30 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Mahila Mall entrepreneurs to intensify protest||Woman entrepreneurs at Mahila Mall here have taken to active protest after the mall management served them a notice to vacate the shops within a month. Besides moving the district court and the Kerala High Court, the entrepreneurs had recently launched a protest in front of the mall. Several political and cultural leaders have turned up at the venue, extending support to the protesters. “We recently received a notice to vacate the shops within 30 days, as the management was planning to discontinue the project. They have asked us to clear our rent dues before vacating. As for those who have paid the rent completely, they were informed that their contracts had expired,” Mini T., one of the entrepreneurs, said. While several entrepreneurs who were part of the Kudumbashree project since its beginning in November 2018 have abandoned business midway, many are still stuck at the mall, especially owing to their huge investment in business. “We have invested several lakhs of rupees into just the interior design. Why would we make such an investment just for a period of one year?” Ms. Mini asked, adding that they had specific instructions from Mr. Ramsy Ismail, who was then project officer of Kudumbashree in the Kozhikode Corporation, to go for good-quality interior design to maintain the overall standard of the mall. She complained that she was not allowed to check the condition of her boutique after the lockdown was lifted, just like several other entrepreneurs. “I had brought huge stock in view of the Vishu market. But the lockdown sabotaged our plans. I asked the management to allow me to make sure that my stock was safe inside the shop, but my request was denied,” she said, terming the act inhuman.

30 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||‘Plaints against mining being ignored’||Leaders of various local action committees fighting against the operation of granite quarries in the ecologically sensitive areas of Kozhikode district have raised strong protest against the alleged laxity on the part of senior Revenue officials in addressing their concerns. They claimed that complaints related to unlawful mining activities in upland areas remained ignored even after the recent formation of taluk-level special squads by the district administration. A local action committee leader from Koombara said the complaint against dangerous mining activities in the village was yet to draw any positive feedback for action. “Mining work continues here even during the monsoon. We want the District Collector to visit the spot and examine the situation,” he added. Special panel Members of the committee also held Geology Department officials accountable for the uninterrupted operation of the quarry in the environmentally sensitive area. They pointed out that the formation of a special committee alone would help uncover the alleged foul play in clearing the quarry’s operational permit. The Chengottumala Samrakshana Samiti, another local residents’ collective which has been on the warpath against the move to open a granite quarry in the village, said its long fight against the upcoming project had not been successful owing to the hostile approach of some influential officials. To expose the alleged nexus, the Samiti members are planning to stage a hunger strike in their houses on the eve of Thiruvonam. Samiti leaders said the experience had been the same for several other residents’ committees in their fight against polluting quarry projects in Karassery and Kavilumpara grama panchayats. According to them, even the panchayat authorities are finding it difficult to overcome external interventions for permitting such projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plaints-against-mining-being-ignored/article32477923.ece
30 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||No SAT score for DASA from next year||From next academic year, the Ministry of Education will not entertain the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) score for admissions under Direct Admission of Students Abroad (DASA) at National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPAs) and other premier technical institutions in the country. However, SAT, a standardised test widely used for college admissions in the U.S., will be considered this academic session. The admission of students under DASA will be through the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) from 2021-22. Sources said the National Testing Agency (NTA), which has been conducting the JEE (Main) computer-based test, will prepare the merit list for admission under the DASA category separately. Out of favour SAT, developed and published by the college board in the U.S., has been falling out of favour in many institutions over various allegations, including hiring of imposters to take the examinations, sources said. At the same time, the existing 5% supernumerary seats (within 15% of supernumerary quota of DASA) reserved for children of Indian workers in the Gulf — UAE, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia — will continue like in the previous years. Students securing admission under the Children of Indian Workers in Gulf (CIWG) quota need to pay $300 non-refundable registration fee and semester fee at par with the fee prescribed for other regular students. The DASA category applicants should have a minimum total valid score of 1,800 out of 2,400 in SAT-2 subject tests (Mathematics Level 2, Physics and Chemistry) to secure admission to the NIT. This apart, there should be a minimum of at least 60% aggregate marks or 6.50 CGPA (on a 10 point scale) or equivalent in the qualifying examination. IIT admission However, a candidate can secure admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) only through the JEE (Advanced) conducted by one of the seven zonal IITs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-sat-score-for-dasa-from-next-year/article32477952.ece

An ambience of jubilation hung over the hospital as doctors and nurses came congratulating the supercentenarian on surviving the pandemic. Pathu became the oldest person to recover from COVID-19 in the State. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja was in the forefront to congratulate the woman and the health team that took care of her at the Manjeri hospital. Ms. Shylaja said it was a moment of pride for the State and its health staff. Minor symptoms Hailing from Randathani, near Kottakkal, Pathu was found to have contracted the virus from her daughter on August 18. Although she had minor symptoms, she never showed any sign of panic. “She responded well to the treatment,” said M.P. Sasi, Principal of the medical college. The excitement was palpable among the staff when she was discharged after recovery on Saturday. She was administered plasma therapy too. “Our plasma bank got a shining feather in its cap when Pathu got cured,” Dr. Sasi told The Hindu . Plasma therapy Manjeri is the sole MCH in the State to have a plasma bank. “We have been offering plasma to other medical colleges in the State. The plasma bank we set up here is a sign of the gratitude and camaraderie being displayed by the people of Malappuram,” Dr. Sasi said. Pathu has dwarfed the recent records set by centenarians such as Asma Beevi (105) from Anchal, Kollam, and Pareed (103) from Aluva, Kochi. When Asma Beevi had recovered from COVID-19 at Government Medical College Hospital, Kollam, Pareed had recovered at Government Medical College, Ernakulam. She will now have to stay in home quarantine for two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/supercentenarian-does-state-proud/article32477950.ece

K.B. Sivadasan is known in the region as a messiah of charity. Mr. Sivadasan defeated the joblessness he faced during the COVID-19 season by finding resources to reach out to dozens of poor women with Onam food kits and new cloth. Mr. Sivadasan’s gesture, even when he faced a fall in his work, has gained him appreciation. “True that there is a drastic fall in our earnings. But think about the poor people out there living in more pitiable conditions than us,” he said. It has been the ninth year since Mr. Sivadasan began offering new cloth and food kits to poor women during Onam. He has named his gesture Ammakkoru Onakkodi. He keeps aside a share of his daily wages for charity. He has also become an object of inspiration for others too. He believes charity is not the prerogative of the rich alone. Half-Tamil and half-Malayali, this headload worker is a one-man army of charity at Changaramkulam. “Every mother who needs care is mine,” Mr. Sivadasan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/charity-gets-the-better-of-lockdown-joblessness/article32477962.ece

30 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||KPCC cracks the whip on public comment||Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran has cracked the whip on combative statements and opinionated social media posts on organisational matters by party members. His diktat comes in the wake of reports that there is disagreement within the All India Congress Committee (AICC) over the “lack of visible, full-time and elected leadership.” Changes in AICC sought As many as 23 senior Congress leaders had demanded wide-ranging changes in the AICC. They reportedly included Shashi Tharoor, MP, and P.J. Kurien, former Deputy chairman, Rajya Sabha. The Congress had called for a halt on public discussions regarding the "letter of dissent" as it sensed that attempts to portray the demands made by the so-called "reformists" as "mutinous" might further deepen the fissures in the party. Directive to State units The party had issued a direction to State units to desist from tit-for-tat statements and accusations. The Congress did not want the "letter" to be portrayed as a rebellion against the current leadership.  In Kerala, the rumblings of disagreement that reportedly convulsed the AICC manifested as what appeared to be targeted attacks against Mr. Tharoor from within the fold of the Congress. Mr. Kurien was largely spared of any criticism. Kodikunnil Suresh and K. Muraleedharan, both MPs, appeared to suggest that Mr. Tharoor existed in a state of privileged exclusion far removed from the party at the grassroots. The two leaders later withdrew their comments at the instance of the KPCC. Tharoor silent Mr. Tharoor himself has remained silent about the matter. But, United Democratic Front convener Benny Behanan, MP; and V.D. Satheeshan and Roji M. John, MLAs; came out openly against the tendency to single out Mr. Tharoor for the attack. However, some leaders said the signatories to the letter might face criticism on the charge of having handed over a propaganda victory to political detractors who have tried to portray the Congress as an organisation in disarray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kpcc-cracks-the-whip-on-public-comment/article32477941.ece
30 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Unaided colleges set for big intake||Anticipating a surge in demand for higher education courses this year, the government has sanctioned 6,866 seats for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) programmes in unaided arts and science colleges. Several new courses have also been greenlit to cater to the growing requirement for a diverse bouquet of courses in the sector. The widespread uncertainty that prevailed in the country has prompted the government to significantly hike the number of seats in arts and science colleges to benefit several aspirants, many of whose plans to seek admissions in other States and abroad came undone by the pandemic. The intake to the UG and PG courses will go up by 6,866 seats in private colleges affiliated to four universities, viz, University of Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi University, University of Calicut and Kannur University. Calicut University is the biggest beneficiary with 2,588 seats (2,256 UG and 332 PG seats). New courses have been sanctioned in 98 affiliated colleges. Among the others, Kannur University has been allotted 1,520 seats (1,282 UG and 238 PG seats) in 37 affiliated colleges. Mahatma Gandhi University has been sanctioned 1,372 seats (920 UG and 452 PG seats) for new courses in 50 unaided colleges. As many as 1,386 seats (1,094 UG and 292 PG seats) have been approved for 39 colleges affiliated to Kerala University. Seats have also been enhanced permanently in 10 colleges, while additional batches have been approved in three institutions functioning under the university. The move to implement a massive increase of seats in the unaided sector would facilitate more students to gain admissions, even while incurring no additional financial burden for the State exchequer. While a marginal increase in intake within the sanctioned limits is expected in government and aided colleges as during the previous years, a section of academicians have criticised the decision to turn down recommendations made by universities to commence new courses in such government-funded institutions, thereby enabling more students to get education for lower fees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unaided-colleges-set-for-big-intake/article32477957.ece
30 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Probe role of Minister in gold smuggling case: LDF||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has urged the Centre to investigate the ‘suspicious role’ of Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan in the smuggling of gold via air cargo consignments addressed to the UAE consulate here. LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan said on Saturday that court filings by the accused in the case had pointed to the role of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in the international racket. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had attempted to shield the BJP from the charges by attacking the Chief Minister's Office and lying that the government had abetted the economic offence. A statement given by Swapna Suresh, second accused in the case, has revealed that BJP leaders had foreknowledge of the crime. The knowledge of wrongdoing was in itself a prosecutable offence, Mr Vijayaraghavan said. He alleged that the head of a pro-BJP channel where TV presenter Anil Nambiar worked as coordinating editor had information about the racket. He also alleged that the channel head had directed Mr. Nambiar to tell Swapna to lie that the incriminating air consignment found to contain contraband gold was a personal cargo and not diplomatic baggage. An influential person in the MEA had asked the channel head to do so, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-role-of-minister-in-gold-smuggling-case-ldf/article32477942.ece

30 August 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||An app to ensure zero contact administration||With the pandemic raging in the country, the importance of staying indoors and maintaining physical distancing cannot be stressed enough. While educational institutions and companies have shifted to working from home, there was a need for a contact-less administration too. To bridge the gap, ‘Mana MLA’ – a QR Code-based Android app – was launched at Valmikipuram, the hometown of Piler MLA Chintala Ramachandra Reddy, on Saturday. The app is the brainchild of MLA’s son and a business management professional C. Sai Krishna Reddy. It addresses issues at the doorstep and people need not run around offices or persons to get their work done, says Mr. Krishna Reddy. The need for such an app came about when cases in the district were on the rise, he adds. “The Android app encompasses every duty an MLA discharges, a grievance address system, government projects-related data, appointments, schedules, and digitalized letters to name a few. It also reduces the burden of carrying files and paperwork for an MLA,” he explains. Apart from ensuring zero-contact communication, it also offers a digital panacea to remove political bias in extending the government’s welfare schemes to all. “The objective is to have accountability, transparency and effective utilization in government services,” he says. How to use The public can scan the QR code on stickers which would be strategically pasted in government offices, bus stands, tea shops and prime public places. A link will show up which leads to the webpage. The individual will need to enter their name, phone number, choose the concerned department, choose village volunteer, and can also attach a document or photo which is optional. The public are thoroughly guided by step-by-step instructions on every sticker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/an-app-to-ensure-zero-contact-administration/article32478047.ece

The fifth consignment consisted of 800 litres of honey, collected and processed by the District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) through Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) women self-help groups. Collector Gupta said that the Aranya Brand honey of the Chittoor DWCRA groups had won the accolades of a cross-section of public and consumer groups for its high quality. In the past, the TTD had tested the quality of the honey and placed and order for regular supply of the produce for the Tirumala temple. So far, the DRDA had supplied 6,100 liters of honey to the TTD, which included the fresh batch of 800 litres.

30 August 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Community radio makes waves in Guntur district||A relaxed, cheerful voice greets listeners in rural parts of Guntur district as they tune in to their favourite source of news in the morning — a community radio station called Radio Ranjan. ‘Radio Ranjan 90.4 FM welcomes you!’, says the anchor, who covers current events and speaks on opportunities in education, government programmes and welfare schemes, and also gives suggestions on public health — all in a three-hour session. A community radio station, Radio Ranjan is promoted by the Community and Rural Development Society (CARDS), and licensed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. Since January 2020, the community radio has gone on air connecting rural areas across the district. Given the unparalleled reach of the humble radio, the Centre has given licences to a few community radio stations across the country to disseminate news and hold programmes on a wide range of topics that are of public importance. Guntur-based CARDS, an NGOfounded by P. Ranjan Babu, has been involved in community empowerment since 1979, and was given a licence to start a community radio station in 2000. The radio station is located at Santhosh Nagar and has trained radio jockeys, reporters and technical assistants and operates throughout the year.  Variety of shows “We air a variety of shows, but the thrust is on community empowerment. There are several specialised programmes. ‘Kisan Mithra’ gives suggestions to farmers on good agricultural practices, while ‘Randi Marg’ gives information about welfare schemes instituted by the government. ‘Bala Bata’ is an educational programme for children while ‘Swarna Mahila Marg’ has content aimed at women empowerment and skill development training. We have also widely covered women protection laws like Disha Act-2019 and the POCSO Act,” said M. Satya Vani, director of Radio Ranjan 90.4 FM. Educational programme The radio station has also proved to be effective during the pandemic as many bulletins on health, guidelines by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have been aired for over four months. “Radio Ranjan 90.4 FM is now a partner in Unicef Mission Corona — an interactive educational programme in Telugu. Through this, we want to reach out to remote areas in the district,” said CARDS directors P. Franz and K. Mary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/community-radio-makes-waves-in-guntur-district/article32477623.ece
30 August 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||A pleasant surprise awaits students of Kuchipudi government school||A paved metal road leads to a manicured lawn facing a school building at Kuchipudi village in Amruthaluru mandal. The school itself has been given a complete makeover with a fresh coat of paint. Classy tables and chairs greet students inside the classroom. Outside, the washrooms are neat and tidy and the play area too has been improved. Well, this is not a school showcased by corporate brands, but is among the 1,158 government schools that have been given a complete makeover by the district administration under the Nadu-Nedu programme. For years, the government schools have been in a dilapidated condition with worn-out walls, rusted benches and pot-holed roads, hardly an incentive for students. The State government under the ambitious Nadu-Nedu programme has taken up in a mission mode the task of giving a complete facelift for all the government schools. Areas of focus The government also intended to revamp the school curriculum and introduce English medium from this academic year. “In Guntur district, 1,158 schools have been chosen under the programme,” said District Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar. “We have focussed on drinking water, toilets, benches, lights, fans, flooring, kitchen and play ground and will be completing the works before the schools reopen. I congratulate the headmasters and parents’ committees that have worked tirelessly to make this happen,” he said, after inspecting the Kuchipudi school. The Collector also visited schools in Vemulapadu in Phirangipuram mandal and 75 Tyallur in Pedakurapadu mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-pleasant-surprise-awaits-students-of-kuchipudi-government-school/article32478049.ece

With this, the combined death toll rose to 539 with Nellore accounting for 268 deaths and Prakasam district 271, a health bulletin released by the Medical and Health department said on Saturday night. In Prakasam district, 870 persons tested positive taking the tally to 21,425. Ongole accounted for a maximum of 267 of the fresh cases. A house surgeon was among those who got infected in Ongole.

30 August 2020||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||No slaughter units within 10 km of Rajahmundry airport||The Committee on Rajamahendravaram Airport Safety on Saturday decided to serve notices on those who run poultry and slaughter units within a radius of 10 km from the Rajamahendravaram airport, and have announced a ban on such activities keeping in view the safe operation of flights at the airport. In a meeting held to discuss operational challenges and safety here, Rajamahendravaram Airport Director Manoj Kumar Naik said: “Monkeys are being sighted on the airport runway. However, the movements of the monkeys and other animals on the runway are being monitored through the CCTV cameras for safe operations of flights.” Responding to the challenges being faced by airport authorities, East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy asked Rajahmahendravaram Sub-Collector Anupama Anjali to serve notices on those who are running the poultry and slaughter units within a distance of 10 km from the airport. Officials on Saturday decided to alert the villagers and seek their cooperation in shutting down the slaughterhouses close to the airport as their presence would attract birds in large numbers, thus posing the risk of bird hits to aircraft. A bird hit often causes damage to the aircraft and forces the pilot to return to the airport as there is a risk of engine failure. Officials also reviewed the management of solid waste and other safety measures in the villages surrounding the airport — Madhurapudi, Gummuluru, Bucchimpeta, Burugupudi and Mirthipadu. Revenue, police and other officials have been directed to create awareness among the locals on the need to restrict certain activities that would impact airport operations. Mr. Muralidhar directed officials to rope in ONGC and GAIL to provide necessary facilities for the better solid waste management in the villages surrounding the airport. Rajamahendravaram Municipal Commissioner Abhishikth Kishore, Airport Assistant General Manager (Communication) Ch. Bhaskar and Additional District Medical and Health Officer O. Komala and other officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-slaughter-units-within-10-km-of-rajamahendravaram-airport/article32477626.ece

30 August 2020||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Save Srikakulam’ campaign gathers momentum||Agitated over the government’s decision to appoint sub-committees over the reorganisation of districts, many academicians, representatives of various political parties and social organisations have come together to prepare a note to protect the interests of Srikakulam district. They have been undertaking the exercise for the last three days to apprise the sub-committee of the possible injustice to the northern part of the district. Etcherla and Rajam Assembly constituencies will come under Vizianagaram district and Palakonda will be under the jurisdiction of Araku which will be made a new district. Only southern part of the district has witnessed development in the last two decades with the establishment of pharmaceutical companies, Dr. B.R.Ambedkar University, IIIT, polytechnic colleges and many private engineering colleges. All of them come under Etcherla. The Rajam Assembly constituency is known for sugar and jute industries. Ambedkar University Sadhana Samithi members Gunta Tulasi Rao and Jami Bhimasankar, who fought for the establishment of Ambedkar Universtity at Etcherla in 2003-2005, said students would be the worst hit with the loss of the university and other educational institutions located at Etcherla. ‘Youth stand to lose’ “The then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy sanctioned the university for the district after a protracted struggle. It will go to neighbouring Vizianagaram district with reorganisation of the districts,” said Dr.Tulasi Rao, who is currently Director (Admissions) of the university. Mr. Bhima Sankar, who worked as Andhra University Executive Council member between 1988 and 2004, said the sub- committee would be urged to treat Srikakulam as a special case. Srikakulam BC Welfare Association president P. Chandrapati Rao and Srikakulam Hakkula Parirakashana Samiti member Ganji Ezra said youth would not get jobs in future as the Jagan Mohan government issued orders for reservation of jobs for locals. “Many residential areas, including PN Colony of Srikakulam town, are now part of Etcherla. Inclusion of Etcherla in Vizianagaram district would lead to denial of administrative services to many citizens of Srikakulam,” said Hanumanthu Lajapathi Rai, former Vice-Chancellor of Ambedkar University. Meanwhile, Palakonda Zilla Sadhana Samiti President Buditi Appala Naidu said Palakonda had great history even before the British regime but its needs had been ignored by successive governments. “Palakonda alone has irrigation facility and it can be easily developed as a district. It will also benefit the tribal people of Sithampet, Patapatnam and other areas,” Mr. Appala Naidu said. Association secretary V. Kurma Rao and coordinator Nutalapati Bharata Bhusana Raju said roundtables were being organised in all 13 mandals of the divisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/save-srikakulam-campaign-gathers-momentum/article32477619.ece
30 August 2020||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||When the bank comes to your doorstep||Many banks in the district have been depending upon business correspondents to continue transactions in villages, as many of the customers are unable to come to the branches on account of COVID-19 pandemic. Many bank branches have come under containment zones in Tekkali and other places, disrupting the entire banking activity for the last one month. Many bank officials and staff have been affected by the virus, leading to a dearth of staff in many branches. In this background, Andhra Pradesh Gramin Vikas Bank has been utilising services of business correspondents. “Customers used to throng our branch for withdrawal of their money deposited by Andhra Pradesh government under various schemes, including Cheyutha and others. In this background, we are utilising the services of business correspondents who are able to disburse money in villages. Some of them are able to disburse up to Rs. 10 lakh,” said Jhadtheela Srinivasa Rao, APGVB-Tekkali Branch Manager. Many customers of Polavaram, Borubadra and other villages near to Tekkali are depending on these business correspondents for all their transactions. State Bank of India Chief Manager (Srikakulam District Sales-Hub) Sistla Srinivasa Rao and SBI channel facilitator C. Koteswara Rao had conducted a training programme for business correspondents in disbursement of money through Aadhaar-enabled Payment System. According to them, the system is helping villagers to continue their transactions at any time since business correspondents are available in their neighbourhood.  SBI Tekkali Branch Manager Mungara Srinivasa Rao said that COVID-19 protocol, including social distancing and wearing masks, was made compulsory at facilitation centers and the branch also to protect the customers from COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-the-bank-comes-to-your-doorstep/article32477627.ece

30 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Whistleblower doctors being harassed: APCC||The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) has petitioned the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to take cognisance of the “harassment of the whistleblower doctors by the YSRCP in the State.” In a letter addressed to the NHRC Chairman, APCC president S. Sailajanath represented the case of APCC vice-president G. Gangadhar, a practising paediatrician, against whom a case had been booked under Sections 54 and 58 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and a notice asking him to appear before the CID for investigation on August 30 (Sunday). Mr. Sailajanath said that Dr. Gangadhar, in an interview to a vernacular TV channel on April 16, had expressed anguish over how doctors and health staff were getting infected with coronavirus, and how a few of them had succumbed due to short supply of PPE kits, masks and sanitisers. He had also expressed fear that if the situation did not improve, the State might lose the battle against the virus. ‘Infringement of rights’ The APCC president said if one listened to the audio, it would be clear that Dr. Gangadhar was only putting forth his views in a constructive way rather than “unduly criticising the government or creating panic” as was being projected.  The Congress leader said the government’s action tantamount to curtailing the freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. He said the callous management of the pandemic by the government was also violative of Article 21 of the Constitution, which promised “protection of life” to all citizens. Stating that the government had been curtailing the rights of responsible, law-abiding citizens by slapping cases against them, and endangering the common man through its “callous, negligent and unscientific management of the coronavirus,” he said the NHRC should intervene to provide relief to the activists such as Dr. Gangadhar, and also to the people at large.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/whistleblower-doctors-being-harassed-apcc/article32477655.ece

A decision to this effect was taken during deliberations which JSP president Pawan Kalyan had through a teleconference with party leaders on Saturday. Counter affidavits He said the High Court suggested to political parties to file counter affidavits in three weeks if they were interested and that the party needed to reiterate its position that the government should not mete injustice to the farmers who gave their lands for construction of the capital in Amaravati. ‘Breach of trust’ He insisted that shifting the capital was tantamount to a breach of trust which was reposed in the government by about 28,000 farmers on whose lands infrastructure costing thousands of crores of rupees was created by the previous dispensation. Party’s political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar said the farmers were not even paid lease for several months. Party leaders Thota Chandrasekhar, Bolisetty Satyanarayana, T. Siva Sankar and P. Hari Prasad were among those who took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/capital-row-jana-sena-resolves-to-file-affidavit-in-hc/article32477656.ece
30 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Atrocities against Dalits a reflection of lawlessness in State’||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday demanded that the mobile phone call list of Om Pratap, an autorickshaw driver in Chittoor who died under mysterious circumstances after allegedly criticising Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy openly, should be made public to expose the YSRCP leaders involved in the incident. Mr. Naidu alleged that the YSRCP cadres had threatened Om Pratap with dire consequences. In a teleconference with party leaders on the atrocities against Dalits and other downtrodden sections in the State, Mr. Naidu said efforts were being made to hush up the Om Pratap case. Another Dalit who was killed in the same district allegedly by those close to the ruling party is being shown as an accident, he alleged. “Minister P. Ramachandra Reddy is responsible for the atrocious behaviour of his partymen in the district,” Mr. Naidu alleged, and observed that the tonsuring of two Dalits, one in East Godavari and the other in Visakhapatnam, reflected the sordid state of affairs. “The growing atrocities on Dalits have brought back memories of the triple murder at KV Palli (in Chittoor district). The rape of Dalit women is another menace. But the government is trying to gloss over the realities,” Mr. Naidu said, and called upon human rights activists to take cognisance of such incidents and fight against the “lawless governance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/atrocities-against-dalits-a-reflection-of-lawlessness-in-state/article32478061.ece

30 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VPT embarks on a project-launching spree||Despite suffering a slump in the first quarter of this fiscal, the Visakhapatnam Port Trust has flagged a number of development projects in this year. The projects have been designed to make VPT more competitive and gain an upper hand in handling bulk cargoes, in the port sector. The Chairman of the Visakhapatnam Port Trust, K. Rama Mohana Rao, told The Hindu that in the first quarter of this fiscal the overall handling has dropped to 15.33 million tonnes from 17.10 mt, during the corresponding period of the previous year, mainly due to the sluggish market owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The exports have gone up marginally, but the imports have seen a dip. But we are going ahead with all our projects,” he said. Explaining about the upcoming projects, he said the techno-economic feasibility report has been completed for mechanisation of three berths. “We have identified WQ7, WQ8 and EQ7, for mechanisation. This is necessary, if we have to compete with private ports and even major ports such as Paradip,” he said. Once all clearances are obtained, tenders will be called for mechanisation on DBOT (design, build, operate and transfer) basis. The overall project cost is estimated to be between Rs. 420 and Rs. 450 crore. According to Mr. Rao, mechanisation will not only facilitate quick turnover of cargo, but will also reduce pollution. “We will have conveyors and they will be capable of handling variety of cargoes,” he said. Terminal extension The ongoing extension of the existing container terminal on PPP mode will be ready by March 2021 at an estimated cost of Rs. 633 crore, with a capacity of 5.4 lakh containers per annum. Accordingly, we are now planning to build a truck parking facility, he said. About 30 acres near the VPT’s solar plant area will also be given on DBOT basis for development. “The truck parking will have all amenities from a food court to a service centre and will be able to accommodate over 800 vehicles at a time. This will also bring down the traffic congestion,” said Mr. Rao. The additional oil handling facilities in the inner harbour will be completed by March 2022 with an investment of Rs. 168 crore, facilitating an additional capacity of 5.25 million tonne. Two HMCs (Harbour Mobile Cranes) of 100 tonne capacity each in the inner harbour would be installed by December. “We are doing well in iron ore despite the pandemic impact and that is why we have already created five new railway sidings,” he said. Staff hit by COVID-19 So far, 13 employees have succumbed to the coronavirus while 175 staff have tested positive. “We have sanctioned posts for doctors and staff nurses for our VPT Golden Jubilee Hospital and also are procuring a few ventilators,” said Mr. Rama Mohana Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vpt-embarks-on-a-project-launching-spree/article32478063.ece

The domestic and international passenger traffic, and cargo movement from the airport has been badly affected due to the cancellation of international flights and restrictions on domestic operations. Cargo movement The cargo movement through the airport has fallen by 46.29% in the second three months of the calendar year compared to the first three months. “The airport handled 608 MT in the second three months against 1,132 MT in the first three months of the calendar year,” according to AP Air Travellers’ Association leaders K. Kumar Raja, O. Naresh Kumar and D.S. Varma. Passenger footfalls Similarly, the passenger movement fell by 92.21% during the period.

30 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||HRF, Left parties slam tonsuring of Dalit youth||A day after a 20-year-old Dalit youth was allegedly tonsured by the inmates and staff of a house in Sujatha Nagar under Pendurthi police station limits, Dalit organisations staged a protest near the house and outside the police station demanding action against the accused. The youth was allegedly assaulted by the wife of ‘Big Boss’ fame Nutan Naidu and six others and tonsured with the help of a barber, alleging that the youth, who earlier worked at the house, had stolen a cellphone. Reacting strongly to the incident, V.S. Krishna of Human Rights Forum, said tonsuring is a repugnant caste atrocity and often done to humiliate Dalits who stand up for their rights and seek to assert their dignity as human beings. The case must be pursued vigorously and meticulously so that all those who committed this crime are convicted, he said. CPI (M) City Secretary Gangarao said that despite after so many years of independence, atrocities against Dalits continue unabated. CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said that atrocities against Dalits are increasing due to vote bank politics. “In the Pendurthi case, we demand that justice be delivered through a fast-track court, so that it acts as a deterrent. The videos that surfaced clearly show that the accused were enjoying, while the boy was being tortured,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hrf-left-parties-slam-tonsuring-of-dalit-youth/article32478075.ece

30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Moharram majlis goes online||Moharram is known as a month of azadari, or mourning the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain, Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, in Karbala. The month also witnesses one of the oldest processions of the city. But, given the pandemic, a lot has changed. For instance, for over a century the Hussaini Kothi palace in the Old City has been home to the annual Moharram majlis (congregational remembrance meeting), an inalienable occurrence of the month. As per decades of tradition, a Shia Muslim scholar from Uttar Pradesh used to be invited to the majlis, who then spoke of the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain, and of the importance of prevalence of justice and a just society. But this year was different. The majlis , due to the COVID-19 pandemic, went online. Syed Mohammed Muzaffar Khan, a descendant of Shamsheer Jung-II, a nobleman from the erstwhile Hyderabad State, who now organises this majlis in Hussaini Kothi palace, says that Maulana Syed Mohammed Aqeel from Banaras in Uttar Pradesh and his family have been speaking at the majlis for many years. Since they did not want to break this tradition, they preferred moving it online. “Maulanas from UP have been coming to Hussaini Kothi for over 60 years. Maulana Syed Mohammed Aqeel’s family has been here coming for 28 years. But due to the pandemic, we thought it best to have this particular majlis online. The Maulana addresses us from UP. Majlis happens from the 1st of Moharram to the 9th. Then, since the 10th of Moharram is the Ashoora, there is a day’s break. Then we have the majlis on the 11th and 12th,” he said, adding that the maulana’s lecture was streamed on YouTube and Zoom. Similarly, the historic Badshahi Ashoorkhana, one of the oldest Shia places of mourning, witnessed a change. According to its mutawalli Syed Abbas Moosvi, given the pandemic, the ashoorkhana was accessible to the public round-the-clock. “This was done so that there would be no crowding. Generally, there is a rush in the evening. But since the ashoorkhana was open throughout the day and night, the public arriving here was distributed across a span of several hours. We ensured that precautionary measures such as social distancing was maintained. Sanitisers and masks were also made available,” he said. Mr Moosvi observed that a large number of people were seen engaged in azadari at homes as well. Syed Mounis Jafar Abidi, a lawyer, observed that doure ki majlis (moving remembrance meeting)  became more frequent. This majlis travels from house to house in the neighbourhood, and the meeting lasts for around 10 minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/moharram-majlis-goes-online/article32477873.ece
30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Orders of Telangana, AP HCs set aside||A division bench of the Telangana High Court set aside the orders passed by the High Courts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh rejecting the request of 10 retired employees of the erstwhile Hyderabad HC for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to opt for Andhra Praresh High Court at Amaravati. The judgment was delivered by a division bench of Justices M. S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Amarnath Goud in a writ petition filed by 10 retired employees of the erstwhile Hyderabad High Court. The petitioners, who had retired before November 1, 2018, contended that not giving them an opportunity to opt for Andhra Pradesh High Court at Amaravati was unconstitutional. Pronouncing the verdict, the bench said the Telangana HC had the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the petition. The bench made it clear that November 1, 2019, (the date on which Andhra Pradesh High Court at Amaravati was constituted) could not be the ‘appointed day’ as per Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. “We declare that there can be only one ‘appointed day’, which is June 2, 2014, and November 1, 2019, cannot be the ‘appointed day’ with regard to employees of erstwhile Hyderabad HC,” the judgment said. ‘Single class’ All employees of the composite Hyderabad HC as on June 2, 2014 constitute a ‘single class’. Exclusion of persons who retired before November 1, 2018, was violation of the Constitution, the order said. The Hyderabad HC had erred in law by declaring that only those employees who were working with it as on November 1, 2018, were eligible to be given an option to opt for either the Telangana HC or AP HC (which were supposed to be created subsequently), the judgment said. The bench directed that Registrars-General of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh High Courts should pay Rs. 3,000 towards costs to each of the 10 petitioners within four weeks since they were denied the right to exercise the option of choosing the HC. The verdict said the petitioners were deemed to have been allotted by the Union of India to the AP HC at Amaravati. Since the AP government enhanced the retirement age from 58 years to 60 years, the HCs of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were directed to pay in 1:1 ratio the salaries and other benefits the petitioners would have earned from January 1, 2019. (when Andhra Pradesh High Court at Amaravati came into existence) till reaching the age of superannuation of 60 years. An interest of six percent should be paid to them from the date on which the said payments were due.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/orders-of-telangana-ap-hcs-set-aside/article32477878.ece

Punnaiah at St. John’s Coaching Foundation here on Saturday. The scooter, costing about Rs. 70,000, was presented to the young cricketer on behalf of former India junior selection committee chairman V. Chamundeswaranath, who actually donated it. In fact, Chamundi, former Andhra Ranji captain, spotted the talent and encouraged him to play in the HCA Leagues for New Blues team. After impressing the selectors, Punnaiah was picked to represent Hyderabad in the under-19 grade. Among those present on the occasion were Indian team fielding coach R.

John Manoj, who is also vice-president of HCA, appreciated Chamundi’s gesture reminding that the latter has reputation of helping many needy sportspersons before they made a mark and others lined up to bask in the success story. “These kind of gestures help young talent and I am sure Punnaiah will go places,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/electric-scooter-presented-to-budding-cricketer/article32477893.ece
30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Cases must dip for city buses to ply’||Bus commuters will have to wait longer as the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) is unlikely to resume its city bus services any time soon. While the Telangana government gave the TSRTC the green light to resume its inter-district and intra-district operations, its city operations continue to remain suspended due to the pandemic. While the Unlock 4.0 guidelines issued on Saturday have permitted resumption of metro rail services from September 7, the State government is yet to take a call on the resumption of TSRTC’s city bus services. Speaking to The Hindu , Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar said resumption of operations is contingent upon a reduction of COVID-19 positive cases in city limits. He acknowledged that there has been a drop in the number of cases here as recorded in the daily COVID-19 bulletins, and resumption of operations will be considered after the city witnesses a further drop. “We are expecting a further drop in cases in the city. Till that time, the decision remains the same. The number of cases should be 100 or less for us to consider a resumption of city operations. The issue is that there is a possibility of bus overcrowding which can lead to a spread,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cases-must-dip-for-city-buses-to-ply/article32477875.ece
30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Avoid alcohol-based sanitiser to disinfect eyewear: LVPEI doctor||Alcohol-based regular sanitizers which are used to sanitise hands should not be used to disinfect eyeglasses as repeated application of the sanitisers can damage lenses as well as the frame, said Akshay Badakere, an ophthalmologist at L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. Besides, he said ammonia bleaches and high content of acids like lemon juice and vinegar should not be used to clean glasses as those too can spoil the lens coating and frame material. While it is inevitable for people with refractive error to continue using prescription glasses, some wear plain eyeglasses (without any power), specially designed protective goggles, or sunglasses to prevent aerosols (particles present in air) from entering into their eyes. “Ensure that eyeglasses are perfectly adjusted to your face to avoid unnecessary adjustments by hand . Don’t touch eyeglasses frequently other than to take them off. When taking off your glasses, use both hands to remove them from your face. Hold the glasses by the temples instead of the rims around the lenses,” Dr Badakere said. Face masks and gloves are disposable barring some which are reused after thorough washing. Prescription glasses, sunglasses and plain glasses are not disposable and are used regularly which makes it imperative to take measures so that the glasses do not become carriers of the virus. To disinfect the glasses, he has suggested dishwasher soap to be used under running water and to wipe it with micro fiber immediately to avoid smudges and scratches. “You can also use branded lens spray and wipes available at optical stores to keep the lenses and frames disinfected,” the ophthalmologist said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/avoid-alcohol-based-sanitiser-to-disinfect-eyewear-lvpei-doctor/article32477862.ece
30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Work on 10 of 37 missing link roads completed||To provide better infrastructure facilities to citizens, GHMC is taking up 37 missing link roads in the first phase at a cost of Rs. 313 crore, said Mayor Bonthu Rammohan here on Saturday. Of 37 missing link roads, 10 works have been completed and 18 works are under progress. The Mayor and Government Whip Arikepudi Gandhi, Zonal Commissioner N. Ravi Kiran and Chief City Planner Devender Reddy inspected various places in Serilingampally Zone. Speaking on the occasion, the Mayor said in order to reduce the traffic on main roads, missing link roads are being formed connecting IT and Business centres. Also, with this, commercial activities will be improved on these link roads once they formed, he added. There is good response from the people in giving land required for development works and most of them opted for TDRs in exchange of land, thereby reducing financial burden on GHMC exchequer. So far, about Rs. 500 crore worth TDRs were issued. Under SRDP, the Mayor said, apart from developing missing link roads, construction of flyovers and underpass, construction of skyways were undertaken to reduce traffic problems. Some of them are Kamineni Junction, Biodiversity Park, Biramulguda, Chintal Kunta and L.B Nagar, already open for public. During inspection, Mr. Rammohan and Mr. Gandhi visited the proposed link road from Nallgandla Main Road at Ratnadeep to Old Mumbai Highway, connecting with 100 feet width distance of two km length. With the formation of this link road, the distance will be reduced up to 2.5 km. Formation of link roads will help save time, fuel and reduce the traffic burden on main roads. The Mayor said the natural lake Nallagandla is to be developed into a picnic spot. For beautification of the lake, the Mayor directed the officials to put up estimates for development with all facilities like walking track, lung space, construction of boundary wall, etc. Later, he visited the site proposed to provide missing link road of 150 feet width of 2.10 km length from Serilingampally Zonal office to Chandanagar Railway track. This link road is being formed by HRDCL at Rs. 11 crore. Of the 2.10 km Road length, 1.75 km length has been completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/work-on-10-of-37-missing-link-roads-completed/article32477865.ece
30 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS govt. has failed to add to hospital infra in 6 years: Bhatti||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka has accused the government of failing to increase the number of beds at government hospitals in the last six years and added that the existing hospitals and infrastructure were created by the previous governments. On the fourth day of his 11-day visit of government hospitals, Mr. Bhatti visited the Kamareddy district hospitals along with former Minister Mohd. Ali Shabbir, and Medak government hospital on Saturday. He said the hospital was converted into a 100-bed hospital by the Congress government in 1994 and continues to be in the same state. Even after Kamareddy was created as a district, its capacity was not enhanced though Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said it would be upgraded to a 35-bed hospital. Mr. Bhatti said it was “shameful” that both hospitals that serve two big districts don’t have even CT scan facility, leaving poor and middle-class people to their fate. Of the 10 civil surgeon posts, nine are vacant in both hospitals, he said, asking whether this government has any sense of responsibility towards public health. Criticising the Chief Minister, he said he had forgotten the same people who assisted him during the Telangana agitation and gave him power with lot of hope. “But the CM instead has chosen to rest at his farmhouse than being among them giving confidence. People are so annoyed with the government that they are resorting to abuses,” he stated. He said the situation in the districts was dismal and doctors are also helpless as they are unable to meet the demands in view of shortage of manpower and infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-has-failed-to-add-to-hospital-infra-in-6-years-bhatti/article32477871.ece
30 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Tap potential of Nizamabad’||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has stressed the potential to transform Nizamabad from a purely agrarian economy into an agrarian and industrial economy through a combination of measures, including a cluster approach for food processing units and facilitating customs clearance in the district itself. “The profile can be transformed from a purely agrarian economy to an agrarian and industrial economy. This will facilitate value capture at the point of produce, provide livelihood opportunities, economic development of the district and eventually inclusive growth,” said the Nizamabad District Development Plan brought out by CII and launched at the ‘Make in Telangana’ conference earlier this week. Food processing, livestock, agriculture, tourism and minerals were the sectors that could accelerate economic development, the report said. Devoting considerable space to food processing – Nizamabad is an important hub for turmeric, contributing to nearly one third of the State’s turmeric output –, the Confederation of Indian Industry document said “to jump-start development, it is essential to create job opportunities by inviting anchor industries, especially in the food processing value chain.” Towards facilitating value addition opportunities with lower per capita investment, it favoured a cluster approach, as the district was not very large, so that small units were benefited from the common facilities. Making land available at viable costs is another aspect the CII Plan favoured to help attract investments in the value chain of the district produce. “There is a critical mass of quantity and variety of produce which can justify promoting investments in food processing sector. More industrial estates can be set up specifically for food processing. Land can be made available in the industrial estates at reasonable and financially viable costs,” it said. The document also referred to a mega food park set up at Lakkampally village, Nandipet mandal, that has not been utilised. Another recommendation is to facilitate customs clearance in Nizamabad district so that export consignments can be sealed in the district and cleared. “It will eliminate multiple packing and logistics cost thereby enabling ease of exports and also reducing transaction costs associated with exports,” the report said. On the ease of doing business measures, it said while the single window clearance had eased the stress, it could be improved “if all approvals/registrations are given on a single date so that renewals and compliances thereof can be synchronised and will be easier to fulfil by small and medium enterprises.” Industries Minister K. T. Rama Rao, in the foreword, said Nizamabad was an important tier-II city and State government was keen on promoting the district into an attractive investment destination. The government was focusing on promoting food processing and IT sectors in a big way in Nizamabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tap-potential-of-nizamabad/article32477879.ece
30 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||20 transformers gutted in fire||A major fire broke out in the electricity store of Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSNPDCL) in Karimnagar town on Saturday. Fire officials suspect that fire broke out due to short-circuit. No casualties were reported. More than 20 new transformers were gutted in the fire, causing a loss of around Rs. 18 lakh. District Fire Officer T Venkanna said that at 9.35 a.m. they received a call and a multi-purpose fire tender was rushed to the spot. “A few minutes later, two fire tenders, from Manakondur and Choppadandi, were sent to the spot to doze off the flames,” he said, adding that the entire operation was carried out for more than an hour. He suspects that sparks emanating from power lines above could have led to the fire. “The exact reason can be known only after the investigation by both departments,” the DFO said.

30 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Effort to support women in distress||Sanghamitra, an initiative launched by the women’s forum of Society of Cyberabad Security Council, is getting an overwhelming response. “The COVID-19 outbreak confined people to homes, so women who are subjected to domestic violence can find a friend in Sanghamitra, which will bridge the gap between victim and the police,” Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar said on Saturday. The initiative started with a pre-assessment on August 15, followed by training sessions that started on August 29 (Saturday). “The first session was conducted by ‘My Choices’ in providing perspectives and skills to help the 145 Sanghamitras who have enrolled in this training session,” he said, adding that it was well-received by the Sanghamitras who understood the abuse and its prevalence. “Sanghamitras’ role is to listen without any judgement, emotionally be available for the survivor, reflect feelings, empathise, be genuine, be confidential and ask open-ended questions so that the survivor can tell their story, know that they are being cared, respected, understood,” he said. Mr. Sajjanar said that to register for the next Sanghamitra programme, one has to download ‘Shesafe’ app on IOS and Android.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/effort-to-support-women-in-distress/article32477898.ece

30 August 2020||TEKUR (SANGAREDDY DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Introducing uncultivated greens to urban populace||With heavy rains taking place, the entire area, though rocky terrain, was like a green carpet on either side of the road at Tekur village in Nylakal mandal. The crops include jowar, foxtile millet and pulses. On the right side of the muddy road, two women farmers – Byagari Sangamma and Sugunamma — -explained uncultivated greens to more than a dozen people who came from Hyderabad to know about it. The Deccan Development Society (DDS), in association with Beyond Organics, an NGO based at Hyderabad, organised the programme at this remote village on Saturday. In addition, a similar programme was arranged at Arjun Naik Tanda and Lachhunak tanda where farmers are cultivating millets with the input cost being provided by consumers. “These greens will develop on their own and carry huge health benefits. Some carry iron and folic acid and there are even greens which will prevent abortion. Black Punti kura, red punti kura, Tummi kura, Uttareni, Nagarichou, Gangavailu (three varieties), Pedda Totakura, Nalla Doggala, Jonna Chanchali, Peddavayilu, Chinnavayilu and Sannavayilu. We regularly cook them in our food. These greens have to be cooked differently,”said Ms. Sangamma. She explained to guests how to prepare food with each variety. All the guests visited the crops. Dr. P. Janaki Srinadh, Assistant Professor, College of Community Science, at Agriculture University, said Ganagvayilu leaf would protect pregnancy. P.V. Satheesh, Director, DDS, said that they had gathered about 100 farmers who had been cultivating millet since 2018. In each season, a farmer is getting Rs. 12,500 per acre as input cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/introducing-uncultivated-greens-to-urban-populace/article32477890.ece

30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Preserving the essence of Delhi||Ek roz apni rooh se poocha, Dilli kya hai?, to yun jawab mein keh gaye: yeh duniya maano jism hai aur Dilli uski jaan(One day I asked my soul, What is Delhi?, it replied: suppose this world is a body, then Delhi is its essence). The famous couplet by Urdu and Persian poet Asadullah Khan, better known as Mirza Ghalib, enshrines his love for what is now the Walled City — at the heart of which lies Chandni Chowk, one of the largest and oldest markets in India. Built in the 17th Century, the market has undergone countless changes to accommodate more shops and people — all while retaining its historical character. The latest iteration of modifications — proposals for which were floated nearly two decades ago but implemented only in 2018 — is being carried out under the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project. A 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is being turned into a car-free zone, and beautified keeping the Mughal-era architectural style in mind. The project is part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Walled City, which involves fixing up the Jama Masjid area; Daryaganj area, from Delhi Gate to Nukkad Faiz Bazar; Lothian Road, from Lothian Bridge to Kashmere Gate; and improvement of various connecting roads in the area such as Esplanade road, reads a detailed project report made in 2017. The pedestrianisation project has been especially tough given the multitude of stakeholders and agencies involved. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal (the local traders’ association), who has been closely involved with the project over the years, said: “It has been due to our efforts that this [the project] has finally happened.” He stressed that the new face of the locality is not the consequence of any political intervention. Instead, it has been the culmination of years of petitioning and directions of the High Court. In particular, he highlighted the role played by Justices Ravindra Bhatt and S. Muralidhar, in monitoring the project and having brought it this far. How it all started In 1998, a festival to revive the cultural grandeur of Chandni Chowk (Moonlit Square) sparked enthusiasm to restore the area, said Mr. Bhargava. As per details on the Delhi government website, proposals were floated to make streets pedestrian friendly and revive Chandni Chowk not just as a market street but a space for public gatherings and a centre for festivities. A special purpose vehicle, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), was set up by former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit in 2007. Though various politicians connected with the area such as BJP’s Vijay Goel and Congress’s Kapil Sibal attempted to kick-start the project (Mr. Sibal inaugurated a phase of the project in 2011), the work started only in December 2018 under the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. At least 12 agencies are involved in the project apart from the traders’ body. “The problem with heritage areas in the city is two-fold: there is extreme neglect of historical significance and civic amenities,” said Abhinandita Mathur, who grew up in Old Delhi and is an adviser to the Delhi government. She added that in a city with many markets and a burgeoning population of migrant residents, the project has provided an opportunity to bridge the gap between the old and new residents of the Capital. A template “We live in a city where every second building has heritage. There are layers of history that need to be taken care of and cherished but not many are aware of how to go about doing so. Given these circumstances, the project has opened up a possibility in the face of things which may seem irreversible. It may be a small road but it has opened up large possibilities. It has also re-established Chandni Chowk as an important part of Delhi,” she said. “We have brainstormed about similar heritage locations in the city such as Mehrauli and some villages. This project will not only set an example for such sites in Delhi but across the subcontinent which hosts much heritage that needs to be preserved,” she added. Brief history Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan when he shifted his capital here from Agra, the Walled City was built around two key features: Red Fort and Jama Masjid, according to the Detailed Project Report (DPR). Chandni Chowk was an important road that connected the fort’s Lahori Gate to the city gates. It also hosted a system of canals that drew water from the Yamuna. It is said that the clear water in a canal running through the middle of Chandni Chowk reflected the moonlight, which gave the market its name. The canals still line the area, and part of the redevelopment work reportedly involves desilting and relining them. The Walled City was a centre of arts and craft, especially in ivory and miniatures, for a very long time. But after the 1857 war, the city went into a decline. Following the Partition, several refugee settlements mushroomed in the area and today is one of the most underdeveloped and densely populated parts of Delhi. Its mesh of overhead electric wires nearly block out the sky, the traffic jams are legendary, and the walls of heritage buildings crumble as the number of people continue to swell. Despite this, Chandni Chowk continues to thrive, especially as a wholesale market and a tourist destination. The redevelopment is an effort to “help conserve its heritage and improve the quality of the public realm in the area”, reads the DPR. Redevelopment project The 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is being turned into a vehicle-free zone (no vehicles will be allowed between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.) though non-motorised vehicles will be allowed. There will be tree-lined footpaths on either side of the road as well as a wide central verge. There will also be seating space for visitors. Most of the work is being done in red sandstone, keeping the Mughal-era architectural style in mind. LED streetlighting is also a part of the plan. All overhead wires have been taken underground and sewer lines have been rehabilitated. There will be four parking areas for traders and visitors who come by vehicle. Most people come to the market via metro; there are two stations (Lal Quila and Chandni Chowk) that cater to the area, said Mr. Bhargava. Work remains Redevelopment has been carried out till Sis Ganj Gurdwara; instead of a canopy of wires and congested roads, visitors are greeted by large open pathways lined with sandstone and bollards. The stretch ahead of the gurdwara, however, turns into a veritable obstacle course as construction work is on in full swing. Construction material is strewn on the sides of the dug up road with iron rods, stones, and open electrical boxes everywhere. At Nai Sarak, which connects Chandni Chowk to Chawri Bazar, a large section of the road is dug up. The Nai Sarak Road has been blocked off and is jam packed with two-wheelers taking up space behind the barricades for parking. A familiar web of overhead wires criss-cross this place. The project was scheduled to be completed by March 2020. With the COVID-19 outbreak as well as other delays, the government now expects to finish the project by November. Government sources, however, said the work might go on till December. Multiple stakeholders Gautam Sachdeva, who had been part of the architectural firm in-charge of the project, headed by the late Pradeep Sachdeva, said that the main intention of the project was to make it pedestrian-friendly, with a future-oriented vision of making space for non-motorised transport. Apart from surface changes, electric wires, telecom, gas lines, drainage systems have been carefully set under the pathway. While negotiations had to take place between nearly 24 stakeholders, the original vision for redevelopment remained mostly intact, he said. Many had raised the hopes of being able to see Red Fort from one end of the road. Mr. Sachdeva argued that at the end of the day a “logical approach” had to be taken and that it was simply not feasible to be “lost in the poetry” of it. Critics, however, argued that historically, the street was a grand processional avenue and as such the redevelopment ought to have adhered to this in its design. Once the development is complete, Mr. Sachdeva hopes more visitors will flock to the area. Architect and conservationist A.G.K. Menon, who had raised objections to some of the redevelopment proposals in 2018, admitted that it was remarkable that the work had been pulled off and that “a good project had been executed”. Two lessons have been learned from the exercise, said Mr. Menon. One, historical areas, especially those in a dilapidated condition, have to be redeveloped, “but the intervention has to be of a certain kind”. And two, projects must evolve through dialogue and participation of various stakeholders; unlike in other redevelopment projects, such as the Central Vista plan which was being pushed through without consultations, he said. Following a petition filed in the High Court by Mr. Menon and other conservationists, which led to further interventions by the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (which has been involved in different parts of the project), various transformers, public toilets and police chowkis set up in the area, especially on the central verge of Chandni Chowk, were moved to ensure aesthetic integrity. The height of a multilevel parking facility being built by the North Corporation at Gandhi Maidan was also kept in check for similar reasons. Following intervention, the number of transformers in the area were reduced from 18 to single digit, said Mr. Menon. The petition filed by heritage conservationists had thrown a spanner in the construction, with complaints flooding in about the project being delayed further. Mr. Menon, however, argued that experts should have been consulted earlier to avoid such a situation, especially in a place like Chandni Chowk, which was demarcated as a heritage zone according to the master plan. Residents upbeat Seventy-year-old Ajit Yadav, whose family has been based in Haider Kuli Haveli area near Fatehpuri Masjid for 150 years after migrating from Alwar in Rajasthan, said this was the first time “any major work” had been taken up in the area. Mr. Yadav hopes the revamp will bring more business, visitors and tourists. He is also hoping that old neighbours and friends, who had left the area, return. “There is no place in the city more significant than Chandni Chowk, whether in terms of heritage or commercial activity. Once this project is complete, people will come to see the area in all its glory. As and when things in the area improve, who knows, maybe all those people who had left the area long ago due to civic issues, will decide to come back too,” said Mr. Yadav, pradhan of the Sarvodaya Samiti RWA, Haveli Haider Kuli. “Just half of the work has been done so far, but wherever it has been done there was no waterlogging. This is not only the first time that any work, especially of this scale, has been taken up in Chandni Chowk but also the first time that there was no waterlogging in the area during monsoon as far as I can remember,” he said. Mohammad Nafees (57), a resident of Lal Kuan, said the project is more than welcome as it has opened up the possibility of families going out on morning and evening strolls in the area — something unimaginable since his childhood. Religious harmony The stretch has the distinction of hosting places of worship of four major religions practised in the country. “This is the first time that such work has been taken up since I was born. It will not only give locals an opportunity to experience the area’s historic glory; but visitors can also visit a mandir, mosque, gurdwara and church — all walking distance from each other,” he said. “What we are also looking forward to is the construction of a mall as part of the project. We will no longer need to visit malls far from home. All this is subject to maintenance of the new infrastructure and facilities. Everyone, especially the residents, will have to understand that they are equal stakeholders and need to work on maintenance together,” he added. Mukesh Kumar, a rickshaw puller, said he was looking forward to more on the redeveloped stretch. “I have been here for 50 years and never thought that anything could improve, especially at this scale. I know the area enough to say that this will bring in more tourists and business, which will help us all. That is certainly something to look forward to after how badly everything was affected due to COVID-19,” he said. Dheeraj Dubey, a resident of Novelty Cinema area who operates a computer store, however, said the pedestrianisation of the area would eventually lead to problems. “What about the mobility of senior citizens and movement of schoolchildren? There should be provisions for them. After the redevelopment is complete, there will be a need to ensure that there is proper maintenance of what has been created, not only for our sakes but also that of future generations,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/preserving-the-essence-of-delhi/article32477815.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||‘We have tried to replicate Lal Qila infrastructure’||Delhi Public Works Department Minister Satyendar Jain talks to The Hindu about the challenges faced during the implementation of the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project.   Chandni Chowk is among the most popular heritage locations in the Capital, how did the idea to redevelop it come about?   The idea to redevelop Chandni Chowk was proposed a long time ago but no government had done anything to take the proposal forward. I held many review meetings with departments concerned and assigned new architects on the project. I personally monitored and resolved many issue such as shifting of transformers, which could have cost Rs. 15 crore in annual rent. We had to work on the construction and infrastructure for the public toilets. We have tried to replicate Lal Qila infrastructure for the project. There used to be a canal that later got converted into a lane. We have maintained a similar pattern by expanding the width of the lane and constructing broad 8-10 metre footpaths on either side, where vehicular traffic is allowed only at night. There was huge resistance from various stakeholders on several proposals, but I held meetings with many of them and took steps to ensure the area was well-developed.  There are multiple agencies involved in the redevelopment project, how challenging was it to bring all of them on the same page?   There were many complexities and challenges while we were carrying out the redevelopment plan. For instance, all the electric cables had to be untangled and arranged properly. The electric substations and transformers had to be shifted and I had to personally monitor the locations and readjustment. I remember overseeing the readjustment of a transformer installed on the road between Lal Mandir towards Jama Masjid. It was challenging to ensure ample coordination between the agencies working on the project.  Has the COVID-19 outbreak impacted the project? Will it be able to meet its deadline by October-end this year?      It is true that that novel coronavirus has impacted various projects. There is also scarcity of labour. The project might take a little more time but it will be completed by the end of this year.     Will the project also involve facelift of structures, including facade of shops on the arterial stretch?     This is not part of the current phase of the redevelopment project, but we will surely include this in a future redevelopment phase.  Will the redevelopment be restricted only to the arterial road and its immediate vicinity or will the bylanes connected to it also be redeveloped?   The current phase of the redevelopment plan involves the stretch from Lal Qila to Fatehpuri Masjid. Extension of the project will be discussed at a later stage and we will see which other areas can be redeveloped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/we-have-tried-to-replicate-lal-qila-infrastructure/article32477817.ece
30 August 2020||LUCKNOW,||HC refuses permission to hold rituals for Muharram||The Allahabad High Court on Saturday refused to grant permission to hold mourning rituals for Muharram in Uttar Pradesh, saying complete prohibition of religious practices through an extraordinary measure was very much in proportion with the unprecedented situation owing to COVID-19. The court dismissed PILs challenging the government orders dated August 10 and August 25. “...it is with a heavy heart that we hold that in these testing times, it is not possible to lift the prohibition by providing any guidelines for regulating the mourning rituals/practice connected with the 10th day of Muharram,” the court said. “We must hope and trust that God would perceive our restraint, not as a slight, but as an act of compassion for our brothers and sisters and give us the opportunity to celebrate all festivals in future,” a Division Bench of Justices Shashi Kant Gupta and Shamim Ahmed noted. The petitioners had argued that the orders were “discriminatory in nature” as they provided for a complete ban in taking out the processions and target only one community. Their counsels also submitted that the Supreme Court had allowed the devotees access to the places of worship and permitted the annual chariot procession at the Jagannath Temple in Puri besides recently permitting the offer of Paryushan prayers in three Jain temples in Mumbai. The petitioners had also argued that the proposed rituals could be regulated by prescribing reasonable restrictions like limiting the number of people to carry out the taziyas till Karbala for burial. Additional Chief Standing Counsel opposed the contention and said the orders were in no way discriminatory. Restrictions have also been imposed upon the Hindu community and they have been prohibited from raising any pooja pandals or installing statues or idols or even taking out processions during Ganesh Chaturthi, the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-refuses-permission-to-hold-rituals-for-muharram/article32477824.ece
30 August 2020||Mumbai,||Migrant workers want to stay put in Maharashtra: CITU to HC||The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) informed the Bombay High Court on Friday that migrant workers want to stay back in Maharashtra and not return to their home towns as economic activity is resuming with the gradual lifting of lockdown measures. The CITU had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking relief measures to alleviate the plight of migrant workers stranded in the State amid the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Senior advocate Gayatri Singh told a Division Bench of Justices A.A. Sayed and Nitin Borkar on Friday the CITU now wishes to withdraw its PIL. Ms. Singh said many migrants opted to return to their native places after the lockdown was imposed in the State, but the remaining workers do want to return home owing to the lifting of lockdown measures. The court allowed the CITU to withdraw its PIL and granted it liberty to approach the Labour Commissioner if any difficulty arises with regard to online registration of migrant workers. On August 5, Maharashtra Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told the High Court that the Maharashtra government incurred a loss of Rs. 42 lakh as not enough migrant workers boarded the special trains that were operated to transport them to their home towns. He said 4,969 migrant workers did not board the trains. He said six trains were arranged between July 16 and 31 for 8,520 migrants and the State had paid Rs. 69 lakh to the Railways. However, only 3,551 people boarded the trains. He said now the workers want to stay put and those who left are planning to come back. He said over 12 lakh migrant workers have returned to the State through 842 trains so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/migrant-workers-want-to-stay-put-in-maharashtra-citu-to-hc/article32477823.ece
30 August 2020||Mumbai,||HC: don’t take action for tweets against CM||The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court on Friday directed the Maharashtra government not to take any coercive steps against a Nagpur resident booked for tweeting against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. A Division Bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote was hearing a criminal petition filed by businessman Sumeet Thakkar, through advocate Rashpal Singh Renu, to quash the FIR against him. Mr. Thakkar had tweeted about the actor’s death and accused the State government of inaction in the case. A Shiv Sena worker then filed a complaint against Mr. Thakkar. An FIR was registered and he was booked under Sections 500 (punishment for defamation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act. The complaint said the tweets made offensive comments against the Chief Minister and State Minister Aaditya Thackeray for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred and ill will.

30 August 2020||Nagpur,||HC orders Maharashtra govt., Nagpur varsity to pay Rs. 5 lakh each to Shoma Sen||The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court has directed the Maharashtra government and Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University to pay Rs. 5 lakh each to former professor Shoma Sen, who is an accused in the Elgaar Parishad case, as part of her retirement benefits. ‘Dues withheld’ Ms. Sen had approached the court claiming that the varsity had withheld her gratuity and Provident Fund dues since her retirement in 2018. The court earlier this month directed the varsity to pay a sum of Rs. 5 lakh to Ms. Sen as an interim arrangement. Nagpur university, however, filed an application seeking to deposit the sum with the court’s registry instead of paying it directly to Ms. Sen. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Ravi Deshpande on Friday said the varsity delayed the processing of Ms. Sen’s pension documents. “It is most unfortunate that during testing times, a retired teacher has been left to fend for herself without the university taking adequate care and interest to clear her dues,” the court said. Ms. Sen’s advocate, Prakash Meghe, told the court that she was entitled to Rs. 14 lakh as part of her gratuity. The Bench dismissed the varsity’s application seeking to deposit the money with the court’s registry. “We direct the varsity to pay Rs. 5 lakh to the petitioner within a week,” the court said. The Bench also directed the Maharashtra government to release an additional Rs. 5 lakh to Ms. Sen on ad hoc basis within a month. ‘Entitled to more money’ The court said Ms. Sen was entitled to a higher amount. “The university shall process all papers and forward them to the government within one week. The State department concerned shall take necessary steps,” the court order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-orders-maharashtra-govt-nagpur-varsity-to-pay-rs-5-lakh-each-to-shoma-sen/article32477971.ece
30 August 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Three held for stealing credit card data||Three men from Mumbai, who were nabbed by the Panvel police with the help of the Mumbai Crime Branch over suspicion of their involvement in a cyber crime, turned out to be part of a different racket altogether. In June, a Panvel resident lost around Rs. 1 lakh without even sharing any OTP with anyone. While investigating the case, the police came across Mudassir Shaikh (38), Rafiq Ansari (58) and Salman Ansari (27) from Mumbai, with the help of technical evidence. Suspecting the three of being involved in the crime, the Panvel police, with the help of the Crime Branch and the V.B. Nagar police, detained them on August 25. “During the investigation, we found out that they were not the culprits in the case that we were investigating, but were involved in another racket, for which no FIR had been registered as the victims are not residents of India,” an officer privy to the investigations said. The trio was running the scam with three others, who would steal debit and credit card details and share it with the accused. These three would then use the data to shop from various e-commerce websites. After realising that there would be no complainant in the case, the Panvel police took suo motu congnisance and registered a case under Sections 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 66c (identity theft) of the IT Act. The police are now on the lookout for the other three accused. “They were the ones who stole the data. Once they are arrested, we can get all the details on how they stole the data,” the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/three-held-for-stealing-credit-card-data/article32477819.ece

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The land lost between the river and the sea||In June 1967, after winning the Six-Day War, Israeli Defence Minister Gen. Moshe Dayan announced standing before the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, ‘We have returned to our holy places... and we shall never leave them.” Since the war, Israel has made several peace agreements with Arab countries as well as the Palestinians and held many more rounds of dialogues, but what Dayan said has been its de facto policy when it came to territories. The only territorial concession Israel made was with Egypt when it returned the Sinai Peninsula as part of the 1978 and 1979 agreements. In other deals, Israel has recognised Palestinian self-rule and committed itself to the two-state solution, but stopped short of making actual land concessions. The agreement Israel reached with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) earlier this month reinforces this Israeli approach of ‘peace without giving up land’. The UAE has offered political and diplomatic recognition to Israel, in return for Israel’s decision to halt a plan to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, not for any actual territorial compromise. Roots of the conflict This leaves the Palestinians in a difficult spot. If more Arab countries are ready to make peace with Israel without addressing the question of occupation, the Palestinians, already weak and divided, will be left with themselves in their quest for freedom and sovereignty. The roots of the conflict in modern times can be traced back to the Jewish immigrations ( aliyah ) into historical Palestine, the land between the Jordan River in the east and the Mediterranean Sea on the west, in the late 19th century. Faced with persecution in Europe and elsewhere, Jews started migrating to Jerusalem and its surrounding areas, which were part of the Ottoman Empire. By the onset of the First World War, Palestine had a sizeable Jewish population. To ensure the support of the global Jewry in the war efforts against the Ottomans, the British reached out to the Zionists. In November 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote a letter to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, in which he stated that the His Majesty’s Government backed “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. The letter came to be known as the Balfour Declaration, which Arab historian Rashid Khalidi called “the first declaration of war on Palestinians”. After the War, Palestine became a British-mandated territory. In 1929, the World Zionist Organisation had established the Jewish Agency as its operative branch. The Agency became the de facto administration of the settlers in Palestine, while the aliyah continued. After the Second World War, the UN proposed a plan to partition Palestine into an independent Arab state, an independent Jewish state and an international Jerusalem. The plan, which was welcomed by the Jews but rejected by the Arabs, never got implemented. On May 14, 1948 — on the last day of the British mandate over Palestine — David Ben-Gurion, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency, declared the establishment of the state of Israel. The declaration, in the midst of raging violence between Jewish militias and Palestinians, led to the first Arab-Israeli war. By the time the war was over, Israel had captured 23% more territories than what the UN partition plan had proposed, including West Jerusalem, while Transjordan took the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt the Gaza Strip. Till the 1967 war, Arab nations had put up a united face against Israel. But the war permanently changed the nature of the conflict. The weakening of the Arab collective vis-a-vis Israel allowed the Palestinians to come to the forefront of the conflict. As Ahmad Samih Khalidi, a former Palestinian negotiator, noted in an essay in the Cairo Review of Global Affairs , “A central paradox of 1967 is that by defeating the Arabs, Israel resurrected the Palestinians.” The Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), formed in 1964, emerged as the torch-bearer of Palestinian nationalism. The PLO, under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, initially operated from Jordan. But when King Hussein cracked down on the Palestinian guerillas in September 1970 (Black September), the PLO moved to Lebanon. The Israelis went after them. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, finally forcing the PLO to leave Lebanon. Arafat shifted to Tunis, and called for an intifada (uprising). In the Oslo Accords, signed between Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin in 1993, the PLO and the Israeli government offered mutual recognition. Israel agreed to the formation of a provisional government (the Palestinian Authority). The plan was to take the Oslo process to a final settlement based on the two-state solution. But in 1995, Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated. Outstanding issues After Oslo, there were multiple efforts to find a solution to the conflict. U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted a peace talk in Camp David between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000, the failure of which led to the violent second intifada in the occupied territories. In 2002, Saudi Arabia made a proposal — peace with Israel in return for an independent Palestinian state. In the same year, the Quartet — the U.S., the UN, the EU and Russia — unveiled the three-phase Roadmap for Peace. None of these took off. Primarily, there are three outstanding issues. One, boundary. The Palestinians and Arab countries say a Palestinian state should be formed based on the 1967 border (the Green Line). But Israel has already redrawn this border on the ground by building huge security walls that cut into Palestinian territories and expanding Jewish settlements deep inside the West Bank. Two, capital. The Palestinians see East Jerusalem as their future capital, but the entire city has been under Israeli control. The Old City houses the Church of Holy Sepulchre (Christians believe the church stands on the hill where Jesus was crucified); Haram al-Sharif (or Temple Mount), which houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam and the Dome of the Rock, from where the Prophet is believed to have ascended to heaven on a winged horse called Buraq; and the Wailing Wall, which is believed to be the remains of the Second Temple of Jews. Three, refugees. The first Arab-Israeli war has led to the displacement and exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, which they call Nakba (catastrophe). Israel has never accepted their right to return, because if they return, it would alter the demographics of the Jewish nation. While the peace processes failed to find a solution, Israel continued to deepen its occupation. The Palestinians are now a divided lot. The Fatah party, once led by Arafat, is heading the truncated Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, while the Islamist Hamas is ruling the blockaded Gaza. Palestinian youth often launch lone-wolf attacks on Israeli troops, only to be shot dead or their houses to be demolished. The Islamists who fire rockets into Israel from Gaza invite Israeli bombings on the Gazans. Israel is practically controlling the movement of Palestinians through the walls, checkpoints and blockades. And in the absence of any peace process, the status quo is here to stay.  In focus The roots of the conflict in modern times go back to the Jewish immigrations ( aliyah ) into historical Palestine which was under the Ottoman control  After the Second World War, a UN partition plan proposed dividing Palestine into three regions — a Jewish state, an Arab state and an international Jerusalem  On May 14, 1948, Zionists unilaterally declared the establishment of the state of Israel, triggering the first Arab-Israeli war||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-land-lost-between-the-river-and-the-sea/article32477514.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Xi Jinping calls for building ‘impregnable wall’ for Tibet||China’s President Xi Jinping on Saturday outlined plans to “solidify border defence” and build an “impregnable wall” to ensure the stability of Tibet. Speaking at the Central Committee’s two-day central symposium on Tibet, the Party’s most important policymaking event for the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), he called for “sinicising Tibetan Buddhism” and deepening the government’s “patriotic education” initiatives to combat separatism. His remarks in Beijing also underlined the need to “solidify border defence”, but did not specifically mention the ongoing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Earlier this month, China’s Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi made a rare visit to inspect “border infrastructure” in Tibet, which Chinese media has linked to the recent tensions. Mr. Xi called for “efforts to ensure national security and enduring peace and stability, steadily improve people’s lives, maintain a good environment, solidify border defence and ensure frontier security,” state media reported. ‘Patriotic education’ Mr. Xi also highlighted the need for “maintaining the unity of the motherland and strengthening national unity as the focus” of the Party’s work in Tibet, and outlined a number of initiatives to expand what the Party calls “patriotic education”. “It is necessary to strengthen the education and guidance of the masses, extensively mobilise the masses to participate in the struggle against separatism, and form an impregnable wall for maintaining stability,” he said. “Ideological and political education” will be strengthened in schools at all levels, with the idea, Mr. Xi said, of “burying the seeds of loving China in the depths of the hearts of every youth”. He called on officials to “actively guide Tibetan Buddhism” and “promote” its “sinicisation”. The initiatives are part of wider moves by the Communist Party to strengthen what it calls ideological discipline. In Tibet, “anti-gang” campaigns by the authorities, ostensibly aimed at law and order, have further reduced the space for “dissenting views”, a Human Rights Watch report said in May. Under the campaign, courts in Tibet have used “gang crime” charges to sentence at least 51 Tibetans to up to nine years in prison since 2018, the report said, including for “protesting issues related to religion, environmental protection, land rights, and official corruption”, all of which have been labelled as crimes related to what the party calls “splittism”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-jinping-calls-for-building-impregnable-wall-for-tibet/article32477518.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The fountainhead of terror||The chargesheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on the 2019 suicide attack in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, which left 40 security personnel dead and pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war, has once again turned the spotlight on the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and its founder, Masood Azhar. The NIA has called the attack a “well-planned criminal conspiracy hatched” by the Jaish. According to top officials of Jammu and Kashmir’s counter-insurgency cell, the Jaish has exhibited two features ever since it was founded by Azhar in 2000, within a year of his release by India after the Indian Airlines flight IC-814 was hijacked — its ability to reinvent itself and take the centre-stage of Kashmir militancy with “spectacle attacks”. It was the Jaish that introduced the first ever suicide bombing in J&K, according to police officers. In May 2000, the 17-year-old local recruit, Afaq Ahmad Shah, rammed an explosives-laden car into the Valley’s main Chinar Corps headquarters at Badamibagh, killing four soldiers. From the 2001 Parliament attack to the 2019 Pulwama attack, Jaish carried out high-profile attacks every time its cadre came under pressure in the Valley. The group was also believed to be behind the Uri attack that killed 20 soldiers in 2016. Drawing its ideology from the Pakistan-based Deobandi school of thought, Harkat-ul-Ansar, which gained guerilla warfare expertise in Afghanistan, was the earlier avatar of the Jaish. The group was banned in 1997, after the kidnapping of foreign nationals in Kashmir seeking the release of Azhar. The Jaish did draw scores of its recruits from Afghanistan for “the Kashmir jihad” and remained a militant force inside Afghanistan for around a decade. The group was banned by Pakistan in 2002 during the Pervez Musharraf regime. Reinventing itself The killing of Adil Pathan and Chota Burmi in Awantipora in October, 2015 was a body blow to the Jaish. However, the group reinvented itself by creating the Al-Shohada Brigade or Shaheed Afzal Guru Squad, named after the Parliament attack convict who was hanged in 2013. “The squad carried three major attacks in Baramulla’s Uri and for many years remained focused on border areas and the border action teams (BATs), backed by the Pakistani Army,” said one senior official. It may not be a coincidence that the Pulwama attack was carried out in the Lethpora area, just 32 km away from Anantnag’s Khanabal where Azhar was arrested along with Afghan war veteran Sajad Afghani in 1996. The Jaish’s strong base remains in the Awantipora-Pulwama axis in south Kashmir and most of its commanders hailed from this region. Over 45 Jaish militants have been killed, including its specialist and well-trained team of nine commanders, since the Pulwama attack in Kashmir. The Jaish has emerged as the third strongest militant organisation in 2020 after the Hibzul Mujahideen and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Around 30 Jaish militants have been killed this year, according to the police. The biggest success of this year for the security forces was making the Tral area in Pulwama, the ‘capital’ of the Jaish, a militancy-free zone after the killing of Jaish ‘commander’ Qari Yasir and his two associates. Azhar, 52, is believed to be living in an undisclosed location Pakistan and suffering from kidney ailments, but his online speeches continue to strike a chord with angry and alienated local youth. In February, the J&K police held three local youth, including the nephew of a former Peoples Democratic Party legislator, who, inspired by the speeches of Azhar, were planning to attack the security forces in Srinagar. Unlike 20 years ago, when the Jaish mounted an attack on the Indian Parliament to deliver a message that the group had the reach and capability to strike the target of its choice in any part of India, the outfit has limited itself to the BAT actions along the Line of Control and attacks in the hinterlands of Kashmir, said one police officer. “The killing of Ghazi Baba in 2003 and Saif-ullah Qarri, who plotted an attack on a temple in Ayodhya in 2005, in 2007 brought an end to Jaish’s attempt to organise attacks outside J&K. However, it remains a potential threat to India and its assets across the country,” said another police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-fountainhead-of-terror/article32477509.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Japan’s eternal Prime Minister||Shinzo Abe on August 25 marked his 2,800th day in office — a record for a country that, in the five years in between Mr. Abe’s short-lived one-year term in office that ended in 2007 and his coming to power in 2012, had seen five different Prime Ministers. And then, on his 2,802nd day, Mr. Abe announced, out of the blue, that he would be stepping down. He said he was “no longer in a condition to respond confidently to the mandate of the people” because of health reasons. His first term in office had also been affected by illness — a chronic intestinal disease called ulcerative colitis — which had resurfaced in June. Mr. Abe, 65, was Japan’s youngest post-war Prime Minister when he came to office in 2006. The grandson of a former PM Nobusuke Kishi, and the son of a former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, he was destined for politics. In 2006, he took over from fellow Liberal Democratic Party leader Junichiro Koizumi and was seen as being very much in the same mould — a charismatic reformer who hoped to revive the economy, and a nationalist who wanted Japan to be free of many of its post-War shackles, particularly elements of its U.S.-imposed pacifist Constitution. When he returned to power in 2012, he famously declared that “Japan is back”, outlining his ambition to inject life into its economy and raise Japan’s profile abroad. Mixed legacy On the home front, Mr. Abe leaves behind a mixed legacy. What came to be known as the “three arrows” of “Abenomics” — looser monetary policy, big fiscal stimulus, and economic reforms — briefly boosted sentiment, but its limited gains have been eroded by the impact of the pandemic. The longevity of Mr. Abe’s rule is in itself an important political legacy for Japan, observes Yoshikazu Kato of the Asia Global Institute, heralding an era where the Japanese public seeks greater stability in its politics. Mr. Kato expects continuity, and not radical change, from Mr. Abe’s successors. Mr. Abe’s biggest legacy, however, may have been on the foreign policy front. When he took over in 2012, relations with China had collapsed over the “nationalisation” of the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands. By visiting the controversial Yasukuni shrine in his first year in office, he placated the nationalists, although angering China and South Korea. The shrine honours Japan’s civilian war-dead but also enshrines 14 Class-A war criminals. At the same time, he went ahead with a visit to China in 2014 for the APEC Summit — and sought a meeting with President Xi Jinping that would mark the thaw in relations. Mr. Abe also pushed for a reinterpretation of the Constitution, enabling Japan to deploy its troops on foreign soil to protect its allies, although he failed in his long-term quest to revise the Constitution. Hiroyuki Akita, a commentator at Nikkei in Tokyo, says Mr. Abe more than his predecessors pushed the idea of an “Indo-Pacific” region governed by rules and international norms, and “established a base for regional security cooperation by the U.S. and Japan, India, Australia.” Mr. Abe particularly backed closer ties with India, the one relationship that had broadly escaped the ups-and-downs that marked Japan’s other close ties, including with the U.S. Beyond his belief that India had a fundamental role to play in the region — a view that Mr. Abe articulated in a 2007 address to India’s Parliament on the “confluence of the two seas”, an early invocation of the Indo-Pacific concept — part of his affinity was also personal. During a visit to India, Mr. Abe revealed the deep impact that Jawaharlal Nehru’s warmth towards his grandfather, who had been accused of war crimes, had left on him, at a time when Japan’s standing in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War couldn’t have been lower. “As a young boy seated on his knee, I would hear him telling me that Prime Minister Nehru introduced him to the biggest audience he had ever seen in his lifetime,” he recalled. Mr. Abe set a new template for dealing with China. He raised Japan’s profile abroad, invested in countering Chinese influence in the neighbourhood, and deepened relations with India, the U.S., and Australia, all while repairing relations with Beijing and not compromising on territorial issues — a formula that may well hold lessons for India and the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-eternal-prime-minister/article32477511.ece
30 August 2020||Tokyo,||Race for new Japan PM kicks off||The race to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe kicked off informally on Saturday, with several contenders announcing their plans to stand, a day after Japan’s longest-serving leader announced his resignation. Mr. Abe said he was suffering a recurrence of ulcerative colitis, the condition that forced him to cut short his first term in office, but that he would stay on until his successor is decided. Exactly how the process will unfold was still unclear, with local media reporting on Saturday that several options were being considered. Mr. Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party could opt for a more traditional leadership election, involving lawmakers but also members of the party nationwide. But the urgency of the situation, as well as the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, could see the party instead opt to poll only its lawmakers and regional representatives — a faster process. Decision on election A decision on how the election will be held, and when, is expected early next week, along with more clarity on who will stand for the post. A few would-be candidates have already thrown their hats into the ring, including party policy chief Fumio Kishida, a former Foreign Minister considered Mr. Abe’s personal choice for successor, and ex-Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is seen as more popular with voters but commands less party support than some other candidates. Finance Minister Taro Aso, himself a former Prime Minister and long considered a likely successor to Mr. Abe, has announced he will not stand. Other possible candidates include powerful Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, viewed by many as a frontrunner, and current Defence Minister Taro Kono, a former Foreign Minister who is seen as something of a longshot. One woman is among those expected to stand so far: Seiko Noda, a former Cabinet Minister whose chances are thought to be slim. Whoever comes out on top, analysts said, little major shift in policy is expected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/race-for-new-japan-pm-kicks-off/article32477522.ece
30 August 2020||Cairo,||Muslim Brotherhood leader Ezzat held||Egypt’s Interior Ministry said on Friday that a security services raid on a Cairo apartment had captured Mahmoud Ezzat, the acting leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, who had been on the run for seven years. The capture of Mr. Ezzat, 76, was the rare arrest of a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest and largest political movement, which has been crushed by a fierce wave of state-led repression in recent years. Since the military takeover that ousted Egypt’s first democratically elected President, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013, most Muslim Brotherhood leaders have been cast into the country’s crowded maximum-security prisons or forced into exile. Mr. Ezzat was the exception. A deputy to the Brotherhood’s leader, Mohammed Badie, Mr. Ezzat was appointed as an acting leader in 2013 after Mr. Badie was arrested. He promptly vanished from public view, and many Egyptians supposed he had fled to Turkey, which is home to many exiled Brotherhood leaders and media outlets. Captured at apartment Instead, he was in Egypt for at least some of that time. In the statement issued on Friday, authorities said he had been captured by officers from the National Security Agency at an apartment used by the Brotherhood in the Fifth Settlement, an upmarket district of eastern Cairo close to the American University in Cairo. Authorities said they found computers and telephones with encryption software used by Mr. Ezzat to communicate with Brotherhood members in Egypt and abroad. They did not say when he was arrested. A photo distributed by the Interior Ministry showed a frail looking man in his 70s, identified as Mr. Ezzat, sitting at a table and wearing a track jacket. Mr. Ezzat joined the Brotherhood in the 1960s and spent time in prison during the rule of Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Hosni Mubarak. Since 2013 he has been convicted in absentia on terrorism-related charges and twice sentenced to death. Under Egyptian law, he will now face retrial under the same charges. In hiding, Mr. Ezzat struggled to exert influence over the group as it was driven underground by Egyptian authorities. Under Egypt’s current President, Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, tens of thousands of political opponents, mostly Brotherhood supporters, have been detained in the country’s crowded prisons, often on dubious charges, according to human rights groups. On Friday, the Interior Ministry said it had discovered documents at Mr. Ezzat’s hiding place that indicated the Brotherhood’s “destructive plans,” without providing further detail. But Abdelrahman Ayyash, a researcher on Islamist movements, said that Mr. Ezzat had remained committed to the policy of non-violence. “While some leaders wanted to resort to violence, his group completely rejected it,” Mr. Ayyash said in an interview.NY Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/muslim-brotherhood-leader-ezzat-held/article32477521.ece
30 August 2020||Stockholm,||Violence breaks out in Sweden after ban on far-right leader||At least 10 people were arrested in southern Sweden and several police officers were injured in violence which broke out after an anti-Muslim Danish politician was blocked from attending a Koran-burning rally, police said on Saturday. Protesters threw stones at police and burned tyres on the streets of Malmo late on Friday, with violence escalating as the evening wore on, according to the police and local media. The demonstration of about 300 people was connected to an incident earlier in the day in which protesters burned a copy of the Islamic holy book, police spokesman Rickard Lundqvist told Swedish tabloidExpressen. Arrests and release Between 10 and 20 protesters were arrested late on Friday and “have all been released,” said police spokesman Patric Fors. The violence subsided by Saturday morning. Rasmus Paludan, who leads the far-right Danish anti-immigration party Hard Line, was due to travel to Malmo to speak at Friday’s event, which was being held on the same day as weekly prayers for the Muslim sabbath. But authorities pre-empted Mr. Paludan’s arrival by announcing he had been banned from entering Sweden for two years. He was later arrested near Malmo. “We suspect that he was going to break the law in Sweden,” said Calle Persson, spokesman for the police in Malmo. But his supporters went ahead with the rally, during which six people were arrested for inciting racial hatred.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/violence-breaks-out-in-sweden-after-ban-on-far-right-leader/article32477524.ece

Even in the midst of the pandemic, many felt compelled to join civil rights advocates in Washington to highlight a scourge of police and vigilante violence that gave way to what many feel is an overdue reckoning on racial injustice. They gathered following another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man — this time, Jacob Blake, 29, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday — sparking demonstrations and violence that left two dead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-gather-in-lincoln-memorial-after-kenosha-shooting/article32477527.ece

The speech, filled with hyperbolic and inaccurate descriptions of life under the Democrats, followed Mr. Trump’s White House address to the Republican convention late on Thursday where he warned that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America.” Mr. Trump told the crowd assembled at the airport in Manchester, New Hampshire, that he was sure of victory on November 3. “Does anyone have any doubt?” he asked to a chorus of support. Much as he did on Thursday at the White House, Mr. Trump claimed to be single-handedly protecting the country from Democratic anarchists. And he again said that COVID-19, which has killed more than 1,80,000 Americans already, was under control.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-attacks-biden-says-virus-under-control/article32477525.ece

30 August 2020||New Delhi,||GST: States can borrow without hurting economy||The Centre on Saturday wrote to States suggesting options of borrowing money to make up the Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenues expected in the ongoing fiscal. Two days after first suggesting to States to borrow money to make up for the shortfall, at the GST Council meeting, the Finance Ministry wrote to State Governments saying they could borrow either via a special window it would facilitate through the RBI, or raise debt from the market. While the Centre has reasoned that it is already saddled with a large borrowing requirement, given the slowdown in revenue collections due to a slump in the economy, non-BJP ruled States such as Punjab, Kerala, Delhi and West Bengal have already stated that raising debt is not an option for the already stretched State finances. In a letter to Finance Secretaries of all States and Union Territories, Union Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said while additional borrowing by the Centre influenced yields on Central Government securities (G-secs) and has other macro-economic repercussions, yields on State securities do not directly influence other yields and do not have the same repercussions. ‘Interest of the nation’ “Hence, it is in the collective interest of Centre and States and in the interest of the nation and of all economic entities including the private sector, not to do any avoidable borrowing at the Central level when it could be done at the State level,” Mr. Pandey wrote. Compensation payment has been an issue since August 2019 with GST collections faltering. In the current fiscal, the compensation requirement of States has been estimated at Rs. 3 lakh crore, of which Rs. 65,000 crore would be funded from the revenues garnered by levy of cess. In the GST Council meeting on August 27, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that COVID-19 was an “Act of God” and it was necessary to differentiate between GST shortfall and pandemic-related shortfall. States have said that such a distinction is not constitutionally valid. Detailing the borrowing options to meet the shortfall, Mr. Pandey wrote that under the first option, if the States choose to borrow Rs. 97,000 crore, which is the shortfall arising out of GST implementation, under a special window, the Centre will endeavour to keep the cost at or close to the G-sec yield. “The interest on the borrowing under the special window will be paid from the cess as and when it arises until the end of the transition period... The State will not be required to service the debt or to repay it from any other source,” he added. “The borrowing under the special window will not be treated as debt of the State for any norms which may be prescribed by the Finance Commission etc.” Under the second option, the entire shortfall of Rs. 2.35 lakh crore will be borrowed by States through issue of market debt. “The wording of the Constitution and statutory preamble make it clear that the spirit of the law is not to compensate States for all types of revenue losses, but rather for that loss arising from GST implementation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gst-states-can-borrow-without-hurting-economy/article32477503.ece
30 August 2020||CHENNAI,||‘Gold prices less reactive to geo-political tensions’||Gold prices are less reactive to factors such as geo-political tensions when compared with oil, according to a former IMF official. “With the emergence of electric vehicles (EVs), oil no longer has a monopoly. Whereas, there is no substitute for gold,” said Sitharam Gurumurthi, former staff member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and founder-chairman, Sri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel School for Monetary Economics. “Gold prices have continued to move upwards,” Dr. Gurumurthi said speaking on the topic ‘The Role of Gold in Currency Markets,’ organised by MSE Financial Services Ltd. West Asia situation Citing an example, Dr. Gurumurthi pointed out in case of a war-like situation in West Asia, both oil and gold prices move upwards. “Gold prices might go up to $500 from $400. But, it never again corrects to $400 levels and will remain at $475 or so,” he said. Dr. Gurumurthi, a former bureaucrat, also reiterated his call to move back to the Bretton Woods-fixed exchange rate system (based on dollar and gold) and removing the current system of Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, which comprise a basket of currencies. He pointed out that SDRs had not been an effective alternative for the earlier system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gold-prices-less-reactive-to-geo-political-tensions/article32477501.ece
30 August 2020||MUMBAI,||Mid to low-rated corporates call for level-playing field in bank interest rates||The practice by commercial banks of charging differentiated interest rates from borrowers based on their credit ratings has made corporates with moderate to low investment-grade ratings to call for rationalisation of rates that are now ‘5 to 6% higher than those offered to top-rated companies.’  “In principle, this may appear logical, but in practice, the difference is so huge that no company can make money and will continue to be in a high-cost debt trap,” said a corporate borrower. “While credit rating is important, in any case, collaterals and other securities are taken while disbursing loans. Hence, banks must be more considerate,” he said. According to borrowers, if in case of retail loans and investment-grade U.S. dollar bonds, the differential is 0.5% to 1% and in some cases 2%, then, then the same yardstick could be applied to corporate loans. “High interest rates have consistently eroded the competitiveness of Indian products; it fuels inflation,” said Essar Ports MD and CEO Rajiv Agarwal. “It increases risk and reduces the leverage, thus making default imminent and debt servicing difficult.” “Infrastructure funding cannot sustain double-digit interest and capital-intensive projects can never get high rating due to high debt service and are thus prone to failure. It’s a vicious cycle, therefore interest rates need to be capped for industry.” “Bankers end up complying with guidelines using credit rating as an academic assessment measure for creditworthiness but start-ups do not have a track record, leading to low credit ratings,” said Mohnish Wadhwa, founder, Wadhwa & Shah. He said with lack of debt exposure due to inadequate credit rating, start-ups dilute equity at a cheaper valuation with private equity. Vishal Rathi, partner, S.K. Patodia and Associates said “a corporate that has a good credit score should get the benefit and in case a corporate improves on the rating later, they can seek revision in the rates.”  Backing the banks, Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director, Crisil Ratings, said the world over, this had been an accepted practice. “It is a classic example of linking risk with returns. A borrower whose credit profile is weaker is more risky from a default perspective, and to compensate for that, the lender charges a higher interest rate,” said Mr. Sitaraman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mid-to-low-rated-corporates-call-for-level-playing-field-in-bank-interest-rates/article32477496.ece
30 August 2020||COIMBATORE,||Remove anti-dumping duty on viscose staple fibre: SIMA||Textile mills and fabric manufacturers have sought the removal of anti-dumping duty on viscose staple fibre to make the textile industry internationally competitive. Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) chairman Ashwin Chandran said textile manufacturers, who use viscose staple fibre supply products to niche markets where there is a huge demand for viscose fabric. Align with global prices “Removal of anti-dumping duty on the viscose fibre will make the domestic prices align with the global prices,” added Mr. Chandran. While viscose fibre attracts 5% import duty besides anti-dumping duty, viscose yarn attracts only import duty. Hence, powerloom weavers are dependent on imported viscose spun yarn to compete in the international market. While 2,022 tonnes of viscose spun yarn was imported in 2016-2017, the import in 2019-2020 was 56,262 tonnes. Almost four lakh spindles in India, with a production capacity worth Rs. 1,000 crore, lost the opportunity to tap the potential. This is because of the high cost of viscose fibre available in the domestic market which is Rs. 20-Rs. 25 more per kg in the domestic market compared with the international prices, the Association said. Import of viscose staple fibre attracts $0.103 to $0.512 of anti-dumping duty per kg for imports from countries such as Indonesia too. According to M. Senthil Kumar, former chairman of Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council, viscose fabric was highly in demand in the fashion segment. For the last four-five years, leading brands had sought more viscose products in the women and children apparel segment. According to Indian Texpreneurs Federation (ITF) , countries such as Vietnam are looking to source more fabrics from India, especially man-made fibre and blended fabrics. While polyester fibre is available in India at international prices, viscose fibre is priced higher in the country because of the anti-dumping duty protection.  While 2,022 tonnes of viscose spun yarn was imported in 2016-2017, in 2019-2020 it was 56,262 tonnes||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/remove-anti-dumping-duty-on-viscose-staple-fibre-sima/article32477497.ece

(RRVL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd., has announced the acquisition of the retail and wholesale, and logistics and warehousing businesses of the Future Group, on a slump sale basis, for a lump sum of Rs. 24,713 crore.

The country’s beer market has been strengthening on account of higher disposable income, rising preference for low alcohol beverage and gradual social acceptance, the report said, adding that these factors will propel “huge growth in the coming years.” Besides, UBL, a market leader in the segment, also expects the export of beer to grow with support from the government. “The maturing beer market, combined with the support of government incentives on exports, will positively open up higher export potentials for Indian beer brands,” it said in its FY20 annual report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/beer-market-may-see-acquisitions/article32477507.ece

30 August 2020||Chennai,||Raina pulls out of IPL 2020||One jolt after another. The Chennai Super Kings is going through a challenging phase ahead of the upcoming IPL in the UAE. After being hit by COVID-19 — two of its players, swing bowler Deepak Chahar and young batsman Ruturaj Gaikwad, have tested positive — CSK lost its batting mainstay Suresh Raina on Saturday. The southpaw has pulled out of the tournament for “personal reasons”. There, reportedly, has been a bereavement in his family. CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan said in an official release, “Suresh Raina has returned to India for personal reasons and will be unavailable for the remainder of the IPL season. Chennai Super Kings offers complete support to Suresh and his family during this time.” Replacement sought According to IPL rules, if the reason for a player withdrawing from a team is genuine, a replacement will be provided. CSK has already sought one. But then, Raina’s will be big shoes to fill. The left-hander has been hugely influential over the years. With 5,368 runs, he is the second highest scorer in IPL history. He figured in 158 successive games for CSK before missing a match owing to an injury. Simply put, the 33-year-old Raina has been a game-changer for the popular and successful franchise. Meanwhile, the BCCI, in a release, said, “13 personnel have tested positive, of which two are players. All the affected personnel as well as their close contacts are asymptomatic and have been isolated from the other team members.” 1,988 tests conducted A total of 1,988 RT-PCR tests were carried out between August 20 and 28. And tests will continue at regular intervals throughout the tournament. A majority of those who have tested positive are from CSK. Apart from the two cricketers, some members of the support staff, social media team and possibly net bowlers have also failed the COVID-19 test. They will be quarantined away from the side for two weeks and then will have to clear two tests before they can join the secure ‘bubble’ of the team. The competition begins on September 19 and the CSK cricketers will be able to begin their practise sessions only from September 1, after spending more days under quarantine in the hotel where they are not allowed to mingle with one another. Meanwhile, CSK’s experienced off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will join the team only on September 1 due to ‘personal’ reasons. He will be quarantined away from the rest of the team for seven days, and, apart from clearing two COVID-19 tests in India, will have to pass three of them in the UAE, on arrival in Dubai and on days three and six, before he can join the team. The last few days have tested CSK’s resolve. Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s men have a fight on their hands.

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||President presents National Sports Awards||President Ram Nath Kovind recalled the spectacular journey of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand, who rose from humble beginnings to win an incredible three Olympic gold medals, to inspire the youth on National Sports Day. Patiently sitting through the function, which lasted about an hour, and applauding every award winner when the citation was read, the President expressed admiration for the three female athletes, Manika Batra, Vinesh Phogat and Rani Rampal, who won the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. He was equally happy about Mariyappan Thangavelu, the paralympic gold medallist, being part of the five awardees for the highest sporting honour. Sports power Addressing the nation from Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President was confident that India was on its way to becoming a sports power and meeting the target of figuring among the top-10 in the medals table of the Olympics in 2028. The Arjuna and Dhyan Chand awardees, coaches, the Tenzing Norgay adventure award winners, the representatives of organisations that won the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar had assembled in Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, Itanagar, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Pune and Sonepat. Connected online They were all connected online by the National Informatics Centre, and the awards function was telecast live by Doordarshan. Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju was at Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi along with some of the awardees and made a welcome speech. He also announced an enhanced cash award of Rs. 25 lakh for the Khel Ratna, Rs. 15 lakh for the Arjuna and Dronacharya lifetime awards, and Rs. 10 lakh for the regular Dronacharya and Dhyan Chand awards.  The Sports Minister said that the hike from Rs. 7.5 lakh for the Khel Ratna and Rs. 5 lakh for the other awards was because they needed a revision, having been fixed in 2008. The 60 awardees were given the citation, with the promise that the bronze statuette would be presented at a later date. Addressing athletes and coaches who missed out, the Sports Minister reiterated that the awards took into account “the cumulative performance” over a span of four years, and therefore the deserving candidates had a bright chance of getting the award next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/president-presents-national-sports-awards/article32477639.ece

30 August 2020||KOLKATA,||Bindra all praise for the Odisha Model||Olympic gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra on Saturday said the ‘well-being of athletes’ was important while seeking high performance. “Athletes are busy bodies. Sitting at home for five months is extremely challenging not just physically, but mentally. We have to create a psychologically safe environment for them because that is the core of high performance. “The well-being of athletes has to be put at the heart and centre of high performance. The pandemic is a great reminder for all of us, because in normal circumstances the whole ecosystem of the sports world is pretty guilty as we just focus on the performance aspect of the athlete. “Until and unless we really focus on the human well-being of that person, performance may not be optimum,” Bindra said during an online interaction — India’s podium dream: The Odisha Story — organised by FICCI. Praising the ‘Odisha Model’ for its quick decision-making and using sport as a power to influence people’s lives, Bindra said, “High performance is not just about getting 50 people together and expecting them to get gold. The core lies in creating an environment and culture of sport. “We will be able to increase our medal tally in the Olympic Games or world level (events) when we just have more people participating in sport for the sheer joy of it…that's when high performance will be a by-product,” said Bindra.  Top badminton coach P. Gopi Chand agreed. “The use of technology has come in more quickly because of the pandemic. Otherwise, it would have taken five to 10 years.” Gopi, nevertheless, said the biggest impact would be on gaining back the confidence of kids and their parents to return to tournaments. Olympian Dilip Tirkey, chairman of Odisha Hockey Promotion Council (OHPC), said the pandemic had taken a toll on the athletes and hoped for an early start to training at the academy. Odisha Sports Minister Tusharkanti Behera sounded confident about hosting the women’s under-17 football World Cup in February next. “The infrastructure work will be finished by September last,” said Behera.

30 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Trouble brewing in KSWA||A crisis is brewing in the Kerala State Wrestling Association (KSWA), with its secretary Anil Vasan challenging the decision of the special general body to dismiss him from the post. A special general body meeting of the KSWA was held online on Friday and it was attended by 32 executive committee members from 13 district units. “The decision to dismiss Anil Vasan was unanimous as he had been indulging in anti-association activities for quite some time,” said KSWA president V.N. Prasood. “He changed the official email address of the association without informing anyone and was taking all the decisions himself. He was given enough time to apologise and finding no response we decided to convene a special general body meeting and dismiss him. The KSWA will soon convene its AGM to elect a new secretary.” However, Vasan, a former State wrestling champion, termed his dismissal “illegal”, adding he will challenge it in court. “The president has not followed the standard procedure for holding a special general body meeting. I was not informed of the meeting officially. It was held on the sly and attended by a few of his supporters. They have given flimsy reasons for my dismissal,” said Vasan. “The president V.N. Prasood is vindictive. Following a complaint, the Kerala State Sports Council (KSSC) in a letter to KSWA had sought clarity on the president’s eligibility to continue as per the new sports code. I had given a reply as KSWA secretary and antagonised the president and his supporters. I have written a complaint to Kerala Sports Minister E. P.

30 August 2020||MADRID,||Barcelona not willing to let Lionel Messi go||Barcelona is unwavering in its intention to keep Lionel Messi, who told the club earlier this week that he wanted to leave. Spanish media says Messi has contacted the club to try to resolve the situation, but Barcelona confirmed to AP on Saturday that it will not negotiate to allow the Argentina great to depart before his contract ends next year. Earlier this week, Messi said he wanted to invoke a contract clause that allowed him to leave at the end of last season, but the club said the clause had already expired. A lengthy legal battle may ensue as the 33-year-old forward is expected to say the clause was valid until the end of the season, which was pushed back because of the pandemic. Barcelona is not willing to give up on the player, especially not for free. Messi’s contract, which ends in June 2021, has a buyout clause of €700 million. He has been with the club for nearly two decades, leading it to more than three-dozen titles and holding most of its individual records. Spanish media said Messi and his team contacted the club late this week to try to discuss his situation. He had announced his intention to leave by sending the club a burofax, a certified document similar to a telegram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-not-willing-to-let-lionel-messi-go/article32477631.ece

But Humpy did better, she won. The World No. 2 from Vijayawada made it a memorable finish for India with a 73-move win over Monika Socko in the Armageddon game (tie-breaker). After Poland won the first match 4-2, the Indians had to win the second. They did it in style, with a 4.5-1.5 scoreline. Viswanathan Anand, skipper Vidit Gujrathi, Humpy and Dronavalli Harika won their games, more than making up for R. Praggnanandhaa’s loss and Vantika Agarwal’s draw. In the Armageddon game — the player with white pieces gets five minutes, one more than the rival, but White has to win and Black needs only a draw — Humpy won the toss and chose black.

30 August 2020||Hyderabad,||HFC and Roca part ways||Hyderabad Football Club (HFC) and coach Albert Roca have mutually agreed to terminate his two-year contract on Saturday, according to co-owner Varun Tripuraneni. Tripuraneni said that the decision was taken to relieve the 57-year-old Spaniard, who had formally taken charge of ISL club HFC in January this year, to facilitate him to rejoin Spanish giant Barcelona. “Albert was part of that club between 2003-08 and will link up with newly-appointed coach Ronald Koeman at FC Barcelona,” he said. Tough call “I congratulate Albert as he is set for his new role at FC Barcelona. While parting ways with him has been tough to come to terms with, he had shown utmost professionalism in his approach and working ways with us right from the start in January, to date. “Albert leaves us, putting the club in a good position from where we can build upon. I wish him all the success with his new role,” Tripuraneni said. Roca, meanwhile, said it has been a tough decision to make. “I wish HFC the very best for the upcoming season and the future and I am extremely positive that Hyderabad FC will be one of the top sides this season. I will be assisting the management during the transition phase,” Roca said. HFC’s new head coach will be named in the next few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hfc-and-roca-part-ways/article32477852.ece

30 August 2020||Manchester,||Banton shines in washed out first T20I||England rising star Tom Banton made a fine 71 before Pakistan fought back in the first T20I at Old Trafford on Friday only for rain to reduce the match to a no-result washout. England had threatened a huge total while the 21-year-old Banton was compiling his maiden fifty in four T20s at this level. But his exit left England on 109 for three and sparked a collapse that saw the 50-over World champion lose four wickets for 14 runs — all to spin — off 19 balls. Rain fell with England 131 for six in 16.1 overs. The umpires held a lengthy inspection but decided that the outfield was too wet for the match to continue. “It was good fun,” said Banton. “I struggled to begin with, they bowled quite well and then I backed myself when the spinners came on. There was a small boundary on one side.”  The scores: England 161 for six in 16.1 overs (Tom Banton 71) vs Pakistan. Match abandoned.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||An alaap in Chandigarh||It was 2018, the days heavy with the promise of rain. I was at work when I received an e-mail from someone who introduced himself as Navjeevan Khosla. It was a charming mail, inviting me to attend the Chandigarh Sangeet Sammelan, an annual affair staged every October in Le Corbusier’s city. The man had taken my email address from professor of music Gurinder Singh, a student of Kishori Amonkar, who had once written a moving tribute to her guru for this newspaper. “Gurinder is an excellent singer,” wrote Khosla, “and I strongly suggest that you take a flight and be here to listen to her.” The man was in his 90s, it was an endearing missive, but I didn’t really take it seriously. Chandigarh is too far away from Chennai to visit on a whim. Then, last year, in August, my phone rang. On the other end was Khosla saab. This time he had decided to call — “early enough so that you will have time to make travel plans”. The nonagenarian’s enthusiasm and warmth were touching and also intriguing. I found myself booking a ticket to Chandigarh, somewhat to my family’s bemusement. But my instinct hadn’t let me down. What I found was not just a gracious man and a music festival, but something larger. Something that stuck in my head and slowly dawned into a clearer understanding of that elusive creature we call ‘patronage of the arts’. In Chandigarh, Khosla had organised my stay in his home, an old-style bungalow surrounded by an ebullient garden whose fruits and vegetables unfailingly found their way to the dining table. Staying with us were three others — the lovely Gurinder; Hari Sahasrabuddhe, the late classical singer Veena Sahasrabuddhe’s husband; and music critic Manjari Sinha. We were all there for the 42nd edition of the Chandigarh Sangeet Sammelan, organised by the Indian National Theatre, an organisation founded in 1968 by a bunch of the city’s culturati and inaugurated by Prithviraj Kapoor. Festival of passion In 1978, urged by Khosla, the INT launched the annual Sangeet Sammelan. And in the 42 years since, driven almost entirely by one man’s passion, the best of Hindustani music’s singers and instrumentalists have regularly wound their way to this city to regale a small but ardent circle of listeners. “Dhondutai Kulkarni, Vilayat Khan, Bhimsen Joshi, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Shivkumar Sharma, Gangubai Hangal, Kishori Amonkar, Kumar Gandharva…” Sitting in the morning room with the sunlight pouring in through the French windows, Khosla reeled off the names of the stalwarts the Sammelan had hosted over the years. The former IAS officer was still at the centre of it all but had roped in Vinita Gupta, singer and teacher, to take over much of the responsibility. He remains chief curator and critic — a role he plays with formidable skill — keeping his nervous coterie on its toes. That week, for instance, he raged and stormed during the performances of Raghunandan Panshikar and Ravindra Parchure, both of whose talent is undoubted but whose concerts were marred by an over-long rendition in one case and tussles with shruti in the other. Khosla saab left the venue early, walking stick in one hand, faithful retainer on the other. But his frail health conducted itself with honour during the largely unknown but supremely gifted Shalmali Joshi’s concert, as her confident voice poured forth notes of pellucid beauty. “The big singers charge too much these days,” he told me. “And when they come here, they don’t take the audience and the city seriously. These days, I look for the small and upcoming names, artists who care only for the music and are hungry to perform.” From the first, the Sammelan has worked on meagre budgets. “In those days,” said Khosla, “nobody spoke much about money; they came for the love of music, accepting whatever we offered.” Courtly tradition On the walls are imposing pictures of turbaned men; Khosla’s great-grandfather was a dewan in the court of Patiala’s Maharaja Mahendra Singh. His grandfather was a Cambridge-educated barrister and judge. Khosla’s love for music seems to have come from his father, Niranjan Prashad, who was close to the legendary Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, helping him with funds when he set up the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in 1901, a music school that was open to all and among the first to run on public donations rather than royal funding. Paluskar was then one of the first singers to scandalously give paid public concerts. At one time, encouraging the arts was proof of a ruler’s discernment and refinement. Kings surrounded themselves with poets, singers and dancers, gifting them land and wealth. Rich families followed suit. Recitals were held in royal courts or private homes. Temples adopted performers, their music and dance considered offerings as much as incense or blooms. With democracy and the abolishing of royal families and the zamindari, the wealth that supported such cultural effulgence was lost. The baithak , where the cognoscenti would congregate at private homes, was supplanted by auditoriums and a paying public. While this democratisation of classical music was welcome, it also meant that committed patrons were replaced with intermittent corporate sponsors. The burden of long-term support for the arts thus fell upon the government, a duty it took upon itself enthusiastically in the early years (setting up various awards and Akademis) but soon let crumble under bureaucratic indifference and corruption. Until today, when we have reached a point where the very idea of state support for the arts is regarded with resentment and ‘culture’ is equated with religion, propaganda and diplomacy. Crumbling edifice The pieces of this crumbling artistic edifice have been left then for trusts and individuals to pick up. People like Ashok Vajpeyi in Delhi, another former IAS officer, whose Raza Foundation does more for the arts than the entire government. Or the late K.V. Subbanna, whose Ninasam trust in Heggodu, Karnataka, has sustained a cultural movement over five decades. Gira Sarabhai’s extraordinary Sarabhai Foundation in Ahmedabad, the late Ebrahim Alkazi’s Foundation for the Arts, O.P. Jain’s Sanskriti Foundation, the late Vijaynath Shenoy’s Hasta Shilpa Heritage Museum, the late Komal Kothari’s Rupayan Sansthan, Laila Tyabji’s Dastkar... ...And people like Khosla whose remarkable effort to preserve and promote classical music in his hometown is backed only by passion, some personal wealth and public donations. Khosla’s note in the invitation card that year was characteristically acerbic: “But we cannot survive on fresh air, tea and kind words alone. So kindly bring your cheque books along.” As around us the pandemic wreaks havoc on the livelihoods of innumerable musicians, the absence of structured state support is felt sharply. The government and its ‘cultural’ arms are again missing in action. As I see concerned individuals step into the fray once more, I think of Khosla saab, who has just turned 98. Across India’s bylanes and back streets, but for a handful of such committed individuals, the pulse of classical music might not have kept throbbing under the great ambient hum of mass entertainment.  When the burden of long-term support for the arts fell upon the government, it took on the job enthusiastically in the early years (setting up various awards and Akademis) but soon let it crumble under bureaucratic indifference and corruption||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/an-alaap-in-chandigarh/article32477410.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||No silly point in life||Having followed cricket for so long, I have become more convinced than ever that it is this game, more than any other sport, which mirrors life. For one, cricket, like life, continues to have an element of fascination, intrigue, mystery, thrill and uncertainty about it. As in life, fortunes in this game have often swung from one end to the other more than in any other sport. The vicissitudes of emotions manifested by the pain and agony of a heart-wrenching defeat to the thrill and ecstasy of an exhilarating victory and all that falls in between are as much a part of cricket folklore as it is of life. And again, as in life, so in cricket, equanimity in thought and action is a great virtue to have. Let me recount a few examples featuring India. In the Cricket World Cup of 1983, India was down and out against Zimbabwe with the scorecard reading a miserable 17 for 5. India’s captain, Kapil Dev, a man endowed with supreme self-belief, was, however, not quite done yet and with some support from the lower order helped India set a competitive total. Zimbabwe fell short of the target, and India won that match, living to fight another day. In the same tournament, India reached the finals and was pitted against the West Indies, arguably the best team in the world then. Hardly anyone ever gave India a chance. It was billed as a no-contest and yet India was able to stop the Caribbean Calypso and lift the World Cup. The “diminutive” David had once again put it past the “gigantic” Goliath! ‘Final frontier’ Eighteen years later, an all-conquering Australian team had come to India to play a three-match series. Steve Waugh, the then Australian captain, considered the contest to be his team’s “final frontier”. Having won the first match quite comprehensively, and having enforced a follow-on in the second, the Australian juggernaut appeared coasting to victory. Two of the finest men ever to have played for India now rose to the occasion. Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman stitched together a partnership which took the wind out of Australia’s sails and in the wake of some splendid and inspired bowling by Harbhajan Singh, India went on to win that match and later the series as well. Incredible things have been achieved in life with self-belief, and none more than when one is down. The cricketing examples cited above are testimony to the power and strength of self-belief. On another dimension, complacency can confound and many a bubble has burst because of this! Life is replete with examples of people “falling” from comfortable positions and “rising” from near impossible situations as has happened many times on a cricket field too. West Indies and Australia, two teams, seemingly invincible, “fell” from dizzy heights while the “underdog” India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat reaffirming the axiom that cricket indeed mirrors life. ashokwarrier27@gmail.com  Incredible things have been achieved in life with self-belief   Complacency confounds; many a bubble has thus burst||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/no-silly-point-in-life/article32477451.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Not Lolita||All through this book, from the dedication at the beginning to the acknowledgements at the end, and again and again in between, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita is referenced. Evidently, Lolita is that upstanding member of the community of books whose existence ‘validates’ what Kate Elizabeth Russell is doing in My Dark Vanessa . But the recourse to Lolita is a deception, like almost everything in Russell’s book. In actuality, it is the dangling thread by which Vanessa unravels. Let me explain what I mean. My Dark Vanessa is a fictional account of a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old schoolgirl and her 45-year-old English teacher, Jacob Strane. The eponymous Vanessa, now in her 30s, is poring over all that happened to her in the wake of later sexual abuse allegations made against Strane by other girls. But Vanessa doesn’t consider herself a victim; she regards Strane as her first love. She had lied to protect him when their relationship was first discovered in her school-days, and she never cut off contact with him since. So is she sadly deluded? Or is she right in maintaining that she simply matured early, with a (superior) preference for a literary man over callow boys? Distressing experience This is an interesting premise, and it is drawn out for close to 400 pages, with certain details of Strane’s selfish behaviour raising red flags of abuse in the reader’s mind, while Vanessa’s stubborn insistence on having wanted the relationship continuously complicates the issue. The quandary seems believable enough, especially in light of Lolita, which both Strane and Vanessa keep talking about. But the reader who buys this premise is in for a purely confusing and distressing experience. Given a weakness for mere sensations, such a reader might praise and thank Russell for the ordeal (as is happening in many quarters). Even someone more critical, like the reviewer in The Atlantic , who revisited Lolita and then wondered: “How could any of this ever have been understood — by Vanessa or by Russell — to be a love story?” will remain ambivalent (“[Vanessa] is an immensely difficult person to spend time with. Is she a valuable one, in the end? I still can’t decide.”), if unable to assess the size of the lie. It’s abusive For My Dark Vanessa is indeed a lie, one that involves such a meretricious use of fiction that it calls for a fuller exposure than is possible here. The clue to the lie is how flagrantly Russell mischaracterises Lolita . To begin with, Nabokov is hardly renowned for his empathy. Lolita is something of a self-conscious exercise in seeing how far the lyricism of sentences (in which matter Nabokov has few peers) can obscure essential ugliness. No serious thinker would go to Lolita , in the first instance,  for a psychological understanding of child sexual abuse. Yet even so, Nabokov had enough psychological sense to avoid depicting Dolores Haze in love with his narrator, Humbert. Humbert romanticises Dolores, but she merely endures him, being also dependent on him. The person for whom Dolores does fall head over heels and risks everything is not the well-spoken, well-mannered Humbert (on whom her mother, contrariwise, had a crush), but the flagrant pornogapher and paedophile, Clare Quilty. Thereby, one thing is made clear: Dolores Haze really was 12 years old. But Vanessa Wye is not 15, or to put it in another way, she is purely fictitiously 15. It is obvious that, in terms of the actual psychology of this character, we are reading about a much older woman. Let us recall that fiction does not invent its own truth; it must answer to reality. A world of reality separates an adolescent, including an adolescent who is “old for her years”, from an older woman role-playing an adolescent, which is what Russell’s literary creation is. Once this is grasped, the banality of this portentous book also springs into view. Vanessa’s knowingness (which is synchronous, and not in hindsight) of every intimate nuance and strand of power play ongoing between her and Strane is seen to be commonplace, as is their whole relationship and the course of it. To wit, a powerful psycho-sensual attraction, a period of lust and mushiness, a perverse episode or two, signalling the absence of real understanding, and the fact that both parties have been living within their own heads all along, followed by a potentially indefinite time of recrimination, pride and possessiveness. That all this, though commonplace, really is damaging, and at any age, is the ironic basis of My Dark Vanessa’ s emotional valence. But it is not edifying to be sucked into the whirl of an ordinary toxic relationship, now role-played as child abuse, demanding from readers the role-playing of horror-struck therapists. It is abusive, and like all abuse, should be called out as firmly as possible. There is more to be said about My Dark Vanessa and all that is linked with it — the curiously twisted fiction coming out of MFA programmes; the compulsive associations of modern classrooms with power play; the compulsively pathological imagination of sex. But those are longer discussions. The writer is the author, most recently, ofThe Outraged: Times of Strife.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The usual suspects||A photograph of a young man, presumably tribal, or a returning migrant, or both, with the carcasses of two hares slung over his shoulder, was recently emblazoned on the cover of a report by a reputed wildlife NGO. The report — based on nothing more than a cursory look at social media posts — claimed that the rates of poaching in India had doubled during the COVID-19-induced national lockdown. Within days, it was widely broadcast by media both in India and abroad. If only research were so easy and its results so simple. Indeed, the social and economic impacts of a crisis like the current pandemic and lockdown are more than likely to escalate hunting and harvesting of natural resources, including wildlife. But for many rural communities, the village commons and forests yield the only easily available source of protein. And a dubious mix of bad science, elitist ideology and social media has demonised these most marginalised people. The pandemic has brought renewed focus on our relationship with nature, especially the negative aspects of human-wildlife interactions. Conservationists have been quick to join the blame game. Those with links to bats, pangolins and other wildlife — hunters, ‘poachers’, wet market operators, meat eaters — have all been implicated. In the midst of the challenges posed by COVID-19, there has also been an outbreak of agenda-driven campaigns about the environment that tend to further marginalise the poor and those different from the mainstream. Customary rights The problem begins in part with the history of conservation in our country. Thanks to lobbying by elite conservationists, India adopted a series of exclusionary legislations, such as the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which banned hunting and many forms of forest use. Overnight, such blanket protection criminalised traditional hunting practised over centuries. For the Soligas, for instance, who practised shifting cultivation, collected minor forest produce and hunted small game in the Biligiriranga Hills, the establishment of the BR Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in the 1970s meant relocation and a ban on hunting and forest produce collection. Only more recently did the Forest Rights Act, 2006, restore some customary rights to the community. Even in spaces outside the purview of protectionist legislation, for example, in parts of the Northeast and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, hunting has been condemned by an urban public disconnected from the realities of resource use. Recently, a video titled ‘Shocker from Nagaland’ was circulated widely on social media, showing a ‘lockdown festival’ where villagers feasted on hunted meat in Zunheboto district. Accompanying it were debates on the ‘abhorrent’ bat-eating or dog-eating habits of Naga communities — and about meat-eating in general. One is reminded of the recent film Axone , which highlights the travails and stigma that people from the Northeast experience in just cooking their traditional dishes when they live in other parts of the country. This targeting of culinary choices and cultural norms is often symptomatic of wider processes of racial targeting and marginalisation. So far, the response from several conservation groups to COVID-19 has primarily been a call for reducing contact at the human-wildlife interface. A lot of conservation PR has sensationalised links with emerging infectious diseases and called for immediate bans on hunting, meat-eating, and wildlife trade. Much of this is strongly ideological and reflects differences in fundamental values. Such claims neglect the broader contexts and root causes of disease emergence and spillover, raising concerns about equity. And this could have significant ramifications on the ground — loss of livelihoods, of food security and rights. Conservation refugees When we look back at India’s conservation history, we see that on the one hand we are happy to ride roughshod over traditional systems, move people out of forests on a whim, relocate them callously and sever their ties to land and culture, which likely had inbuilt checks and balances for using wildlife. On the other hand, when distress return migrations occur, as in the case of the current pandemic, there is widespread concern about the imminent decimation of wildlife. During the lockdown, there was apprehension from tiger conservationists that poaching of prey would escalate and affect tiger numbers, with little acknowledgement that poorly thought-out tiger conservation had perhaps itself created a large number of conservation refugees in the first place. Consequently, the incidents of hunting and poaching by forest communities and fringe-dwellers during the lockdown are highlighted as the primary drivers of forest denudation, while there has been a glaring lack of deliberation on the many fast-tracked environmental clearances given during this period for dams, highways and mining projects, whose environmental impact will be vastly more damaging. Misconceptions about pandemics also abound. For example, there have been claims that zoonotic diseases are caused only by eating meat. But in several southern States, each year, unknown to most of us, the Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever — a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever with significantly higher rates of human mortality than COVID-19 — wreaks silent havoc, and has been linked to large-scale deforestation. First reported from Shimoga district in Karnataka in the late 1950s, KFD has now spread to other States (Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa) despite the best efforts of health officials. The disease is especially prone to spread within forest-plantation mosaics. Complicated truths There are parallels with Ebola in Africa, where the conversion of smallholder oil palm agroforest units into industrial plantations helped concentrate bat populations and bring them closer to habitations. Once ridiculed as sensationalism, the agroeconomic impetus behind ‘neoliberal Ebola’ is now well accepted and has been used as a framework for understanding disease dynamics and land use in the context of other pathogens such as the KFD virus. KFD, Ebola and many such zoonoses, therefore, show that the picture is much more complicated. Habitat alteration, including conversion of forests to plantation, and other forms of market-oriented deforestation play a significant role in increasing human contact with zoonotic diseases. What is at play is prejudice combined with an inability to look at the ultimate drivers and causes of deforestation. Instead of training our guns on ‘poachers’ and forest-dwellers, we have to deal with our own hypocrisy. Most of us, with our urban lifestyles and demands, are a far greater threat to the environment: whether it is apples or chocolate flown from halfway across the world, or rice and soy grown on land where they should not be. Fast fashion, global travel, new gadgets, and not to mention, ecotourism — the go-to solution of a certain section of conservationists — all add to the problem. A recent study by researchers at the University of Sydney attributes 30% of global threats to species from international trade in everyday items such as coffee, tea, sugar, textiles and other manufactured goods. However, this finds little mention in these polarising narratives. Viruses have been on the prowl for millennia. Many have affected humans, resulting in small-scale infectious disease ‘events’. However, for any one of these events to become a pandemic, a set of additional conditions is necessary. That is what COVID-19 and the Spanish flu had — significant catalysts in the form of human mobility and globalised economic activity. While consumption cutbacks and sustainable practices are indeed important, we cannot ignore the risks arising from increased global and regional connectivity. As a group, conservationists are known for their proclivity to scapegoat tribal communities and the rural poor for the destruction of forests and wildlife, while ignoring other issues that stare them in the face. Both low-level hunting and meat-eating are often the product of necessity and of cultural choices. Though challenging, they can be inclusively managed and regulated to protect habitats and species. By far, the greater challenge is to curb the large-scale diversion of forests for industrial use that is occurring with such impunity. In the war against disease and deforestation, let’s make sure we fight the right adversaries. Kartik Shanker is faculty at the Indian Institute of Science.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The age of illiberalism||It would be a truism to say that liberalism is in crisis. Not too long ago, when the Iron Curtain fell, the West’s — and by default the world’s — foremost intellectuals proclaimed the “end of history”. That is, human civilisation had apparently reached the end point of its socio-political evolution. This end point, we were told, is a society organised on the principles of individual freedom, democracy, and free market capitalism. Peddled by a set of predominantly Anglo-American intellectuals, this cocktail of ideas and ideologies, clubbed under the rubric of liberalism, has largely shaped the 20th century. For half a century, it did face a challenge from communism. But when the communist bloc collapsed in 1989, history, presumably, ended, and the entire non-Western world was set to remake itself in the image of the liberal West by embracing democracy and the free market. Discredited idea However, in the thirty years since history ‘ended’, not only did this not happen, the exact opposite has come to pass: illiberalism has reared its ugly head in the West’s own backyard. How do we explain this? While the flag-bearers of liberalism do not have a cogent answer to this question, they continue to remain influential. These dogged evangelists of a discredited liberalism are the eponymous ‘bland fanatics’ of Pankaj Mishra’s new book. According to Reinhold Niebuhr, the American theologian who coined the term, they are “fanatics” because they regard “the highly contingent achievements” of western civilisation as “the final form and norm of human existence.” In Bland Fanatics: Liberals, Race and Empire , Mishra  has selected and repurposed previously published essays to advance a searing critique of western liberalism. In the 16 essays that make up this volume, Mishra uses the works of liberal ‘thought leaders’ — from economic historian Niall Ferguson and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson to Salman Rushdie and The Economist magazine — as a point of departure to expose the undercurrents of racism and illiberalism that permeate actually existing liberalism. Mishra argues that liberalism has always been the handmaiden of powerful national elites. From the 17th to the 19th century, it was politically aligned with white supremacy, slavery, genocide, and imperialism. It played a dual role for the imperialist states. At home, liberalism’s paeans to individual liberty served to protect the class interests of the propertied elite by creating an ideological front against socialism. Abroad, liberal shibboleths about progress helped recast colonial conquests as a civilising mission, ‘the white man’s burden’. This legacy of liberalism as an all-weather ideological armour to protect the interests of domestic power elites has been replicated across geography and time. Hypocritical stance Mishra zeroes in on historical moments that illuminate the discrepancy between what liberalism preaches and what it does. One such was the ‘Wilsonian moment’ of 1919. When the American President, ahead of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, made a passionate case for national self-determination and democracy as one of the founding pillars of a new world order, anti-colonial leaders all over the world were filled with hope. Indian, Korean, Egyptian and Chinese nationalists even sought a meeting with Wilson in Paris. Not only were their overtures rebuffed, they had to endure the humiliation of seeing their white liberal messiah play along as European imperialists carved up colonies amongst themselves. Quoting Ereze Manela, author of The Wilsonian Moment , Mishra writes that “Wilson’s apparent complicity with old-style imperialists united many educated Asians in what Manela calls “cynical hostility to Western civilisation.” But liberals in New York and London remained unperturbed. On the contrary, they utilised the ‘Wilsonian moment’ to generate an enduring ideological cover for American empire-building and white supremacy: liberal internationalism. Politics of resentment Having carried out combat missions against the “barbarism” of the Orient in the colonial era, and the barbarism of communism in the Cold War era, liberal internationalism needed a new enemy in the post-Cold War era. It had no problem manufacturing one: Islamo-fascism. Western liberals who justified the torture and killing of brown bodies in far-off nations in the name of a ‘war against terror’ are now aghast to see their countrymen respond to the brown immigrants in their midst with xenophobic rage — a rage that has given a new lease of life to an old politics of resentment. This ‘populist’ politics seeks legitimacy by presenting liberalism (and in India, secularism too) as the decadent ideology of a self-serving elite. If today, “blond bullies and bunglers are perched atop the world’s greatest democracies,” concludes Mishra, it is because “the barbarians, it turns out, were never at the gate; they have been ruling us for some time.”  Bland Fanatics: Liberals, Race and Empire Pankaj Mishra Juggernaut  Rs. 599||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-age-of-illiberalism/article32477469.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Do we need elections?||Are elections really a means to democratic polity? Do elections actually facilitate democracy? What if I were to deny that they do? The basic premise of democracy is the equal right of all adult citizens to decide the laws and rules of collective public life. This political equality of all citizens is the bedrock of democracy: the right not only to be governed but also the right to govern. Democracy comes from two Greek words, demos (people) and kratia (rule), meaning people ruling over themselves. Democracy then actually stands for self-rule or self-governance. However, that is precisely what elections have become an obstacle to. Elections are not only undemocratic, I believe they are anti-democratic by their very character. This might sound absurd on first reading, for the institution of elections has come to be so universally accepted as an indispensable part of democracy that it is treated as synonymous with it. Samuel Huntington, for instance, writes. “Elections, open, free and fair, are the essence of democracy, the inescapable sine qua non.” I believe this is a mistaken view of democracy and needs to be challenged. The idea, however, has burrowed deep into modern consciousness and it is not easy to argue against it. Yet, I attempt to do so here. Athens — the mythical birthplace of democracy — was acutely conscious of the danger of elections undermining the democratic practice, and that is why it developed two robust institutions to keep democracy safe. One, Athenians drew lots for choosing public officials. This gave all citizens an equal random chance to assume charge of public offices, the logical corollary to the fundamental right of all adult Athenians to stand for public office (it did not include women and slaves). Elections, Athens seems to have recognised, would sabotage this because they allow only a few people with the art of sophistry and means to assume power. Demagogue alert Second, Athens banned anyone from the city who could become too powerful or influential in the public sphere. Athenians knew the potential of such people to manipulate the masses by their influence, thereby eviscerating democracy from within. So, whenever such a person surfaced, he was voted out of the city for at least 10 years. This kept out potential demagogues who people might blindly follow and surrender their democratic rights and responsibilities to. From this model, democracy has slowly morphed into the opposite — the rule of a few. Modern election is a charade that mostly facilitates the election of a few wealthy or prominent people, replacing democracy with plutocracy. Theoretically, of course, everyone is still free to join the fray, but in practice the system lets through only a miniscule number with means and material resources. The counter argument is that modern states are incredibly large, in size and population, and elections are the only efficient solution. But is it really beyond human imagination to conjure up a system where it’s not just a few prominent people or ambitious careerists who are able to assume public office? Are there no other ways to organise our collective political lives and keep the substance of democracy intact? Of course there are. It is just that they have not been tried or given a fair chance. To begin with, we can structure our units of political organisation at manageably smaller levels — maybe the size of a small town or even smaller — thus ensuring real devolution of powers. These small units could be non-hierarchically connected with other units in a territorial arrangement, with fair distribution of powers and resources at each level for people to deliberate on questions of common good. This would also establish democracy as ‘the exercise of public reason’. Democracy, after all, is fundamentally a government by discussion and participation. The difference would be substantial. In smaller units, ‘people’ would no longer remain an abstract concept but something real and identifiable. Laws could be passed after people have listened to and participated in discussions, where expert opinions and professional advice are also sought and given. Implementation could be carried out by what we can call ‘public trustees’ under the supervision of citizen committees or task forces, getting rid of the menace of bureaucracy. A mechanism of consensus could be adopted to decide on policies and programmes. On other issues, a specific percentage of people would be involved, depending on the nature of the issue. Indeed, consensus wouldn’t be easy to come by, but nothing is. Democracy, they say, is a messy affair. Let it be messy in the right way. Outsourced citizenship In the current system, people rarely experience democracy in their everyday lives. If democracy is a constant engagement with public affairs at the ‘public square’, it can’t end with casting votes on a particular day every five years. In fact, with the casting of a vote we outsource our democratic responsibilities, burdens and benefits to a few representatives. With this alternative — a sort of community-management model — democracy could make a comeback. It could mean that instead of the short-sighted focus on parochial issues encouraged by the electoral system, people begin looking at long-term interests and questions through collective reasoning and arguments. This might be an idealised view, but with supportive institutions and procedures, it could become a ‘realistic utopia’. Some mechanisms of a deliberative democracy are already in use, such as participatory budgeting in New York City; or rural Minnesota where three counties are using a Citizens Jury Method to discuss climate change. In Charlotte, North Carolina, city officials talk to community members to learn first-hand about people’s preferences. These methods could be replicated with necessary modifications for the alternative model of governance that I am advocating here. This isn’t romantic nostalgia for some ancient polities but a real, meaningful and possible alternative we can seriously consider. The reduction of democracy to the mere procedure of balloting has impeded the broader understanding of democracy as ‘government by discussion’ — this has made democracy itself grossly inadequate and immoral. Viable change Those who think this is a fatuous exercise need only to remember that until a few months ago, defunding the police was unimaginable in the U.S. Now, it has almost become a mainstream idea in American political discourse. We never know when crises might occur, and when they do, ideas lying dormant get a chance to be pushed through. We have been conditioned to believe that the present organisation of our body politic into massive nation-states is the only way to order our political systems. It isn’t. There is a need to replace gigantic structures with small units controlled and understood by people. Ernst Schumacher has shown us how in his influential work Small Is Beautiful . To paraphrase Schumacher, gigantic organisational structures pave the way for dehumanisation, loss of control, and lack of comprehension. Who is better placed to understand and address people’s issues — a few representatives who are at a remove from them? Or the people themselves who breathe and live these daily problems and would be constantly engaged (through this alternative model) in deliberations about ways to fix them? Perfect democracy may well be an illusion. It isn’t something fixed once and for all time. Democracy is always, as Derrida said, something that remains to come — never fully present, always deferred. In that spirit, let’s not allow it to rot by being identified forever with its present form. This “to come” underscores the transformative and disruptive potential at the heart of democracy. It is a signal towards the potential for change from within. To suffocate democracy within the current electoral form is to asphyxiate its very spirit, along with ours as well. Our future is inextricably entwined with the possibility of a ‘democracy to come’. The Kashmir-based author has a doctorate in Political Science.  Are there no other ways to organise our collective political lives and keep the substance of democracy intact? Of course, there are||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/do-we-need-elections/article32477408.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||How many will you unfriend?||There is an ongoing debate as to whether Facebook in India has been deliberately soft on hate-speech posts by the BJP-RSS and sundry Hindutva figures and organisations. The BJP-RSS deny this, while the Congress and others, triggered by a report in The Wall Street Journal , say the accusation is true. For many of us who are unequivocally against the BJP-RSS’s politics, and who find the ongoing Hindutva heist attempt against our Republic and Constitution unacceptable, this raises a question: if one assumes that Facebook actually has a bias — which many say is clearly observable — then what do we do about our own use of the social media monster? I’ve seen more than a few posts now asking if people of some convictions should remove themselves altogether from FB. Other friends, in private conversations, have conveyed serious intentions of signing out of Facebook forever. Preceding this, there was FB-related turbulence after the ceremony for the sthhapana of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: many friends and acquaintances put up posts declaring they would unfriend anyone celebrating the inauguration of the temple. While sharing the disgust at the power circus on display in Ayodhya, I have not rushed to cut off the few people on my friends list who I know were exulting in this ‘great victory’ for the ‘mainstream,’ as many of them saw it. One day soon The reason for this is simple. I’m convinced that one day, not too far into the future, the gross folly of this whole cruel, cynical exercise in mass manipulation will become painfully obvious to many of those who have been manipulated. When this happens, I don’t want to be blocked off from watching the acrobatic about-turns, the shamefully thin excuses, the ridiculous obfuscations, the puppet-jumps to cleave to some new dispensation that these contacts will be forced to conduct. A lot of these will count on the amnesia of others, the absence of witnesses, so to speak, and I want to make sure I’m able to remind these friends and relatives of mine of what they were proclaiming and cheering at this blackest moment of their moral failure. Far more important than this projected schadenfreude, I think it is important to be aware that all the votaries of Hindutva can’t be turned into outcasts and ostracised when the wheel of history turns. The Sangh Parivar’s toxic ideology and their project of painting over our society with orange-metallic paint must be resisted with everything we’ve got. But the riddance of this amoral regime will be meaningless unless we win the next stage of the struggle, which is to bring society and polity afresh to a place where genuine debate, argument and dialogue can flourish. Shutting down, blocking off, dividing, isolating, atomising are acts to which this regime is addicted; when we eventually manage to pull the Republic out of this deep trough, we will have to embrace the opposite tendencies: opening up, communicating, allowing diverse voices saying uncomfortable things to be heard by everyone, participating in forming links and coming together. To do this, we will have to disable the many different unfriend buttons that are hard-wired into us. Noisy marketplace Coming to entities such as Facebook, one view is that Mark Zuckerberg tends to favour those he thinks are likely to stay in power, while another argument is that FB is a commercial entity and its algorithms will, unsurprisingly, tend to favour the groups and advertisers who give it the most money. Now, whether either of these theories is true or not, one has to look at what Facebook and indeed social media as a whole provides us. At the very least FB, Whatsapp, Instagram (all owned by Facebook), and Twitter provide us with channels of instant or rapid communication and platforms for expression. Far from perfect they may be, but they are what we have in today’s reality. There is no reason for critics and opponents of the powers that be to cede ground as far as these channels and platforms are concerned. Particularly as nothing would please the Hindutva troll squads and their paymasters more than to see all or many critical voices forced off the social media road, so to speak. Imagine a noisy marketplace where there are many arguments and discussions. A lot of these are loud, bordering on brawls, but there are still large areas and corners and pockets, where people communicating uncomfortable truths are able to speak, able to be heard above and below the cacophony of lies and hatred. You can chose to avoid this messy marketplace altogether or regularly visit it and see what you can hear and say. For me, the latter is the obvious choice.  There is no reason for critics and opponents of the powers that be to cede ground as far as social media channels and platforms are concerned||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/how-many-will-you-unfriend/article32477481.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The missing bark||Our daschund, whom we named Kavi for his poetic eyes, was perhaps as old as us or even older, biologically. Sometimes we wonder whether others will ever be able to bear with our idiosyncrasies as we get older. But we and our canine partner had developed a near perfect relationship. We could not leash him at will, beyond the usual cycle of three times a day; and if he was not in the mood, he would go into hiding. In particular, when trying to leash him in preparation for the visit of friends who did not like dogs, he would disappear. His favourite quarantining locations were a mat, his cot or the mattress on which he slept. And he would come out of hiding only after the guests had settled down, and try to make conversation. Even otherwise, he would growl, bark raucously and even bite if made to do things not to his liking. Even we had not been spared. One big no-no for leashing is when he had to be taken to the doctor or when the doctor was called home for his annual pokes. The doctor would say that we had spoilt him. His food intake went down. My wife had to occasionaly feed him with her hands in small bites or morsels. When we would request him to come out for his jobs, both of us had to accompany him, one in front and the other behind him. When I used to take him out for a walk on the leash, he would walk slowly. I had to adjust my pace accordingly. Affection, very often, was a function of time. The irony with old-timers is that less the time available to them, the more of it they want from others. He developed this rather touching habit of following me room to room. If we are at the dining table, he sat between the two of us at our feet. If we were in the bedroom, he would be resting somewhere to keep us in the line of his sight. If I was in my study, he would come and sit at my feet, occasionally using them as a pillow. In short, he refused to socially distance himself from us. He did not complain, only whimpered (which sounded like “please, please”). As life ebbs away, attachment grows. He has stolen a march over us in our quest for a face-up with our Maker. He departed taking a part of us and our circadian routine too with him. A strand of our attachment had snapped. He rests eternally now very close to the wall of our bedroom. We often mistake the chirping of a particular bird for his “please, please”. vkagnihotri25@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-missing-bark/article32477446.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||On a dynamic planet, migration is integral for life to flourish||“A wild exodus has begun. It is happening on every continent and in every ocean.” Sonia Shah quotes scientists who studied everything from plankton to frogs and found that of the 4,000 species they had tracked, between 40% and 70% had altered their distribution over the past few decades, around 90% into cooler lands and waters in sync with the changing climate. The science journalist herself travelled far and wide to understand this phenomenon. For instance, at McLeodganj with the looming Dhauladhar mountain range and its “heart-stopping panoramas,” and where Tibetans settled after crossing treacherous routes, she discovered that young saplings in the forests established themselves a little bit higher up the slopes every year. Since 1880, the forests had steadily climbed the mountainside, moving 19 metres uphill every decade. Exodus and panic In her insightful new book, The Next Great Migration , she points out that like “our wild cousins, people are on the move too,” and argues why it is necessary for the survival of the planet, contrary to popular belief. Migrations are as old as history and run deep into the complex past, as new genetic techniques have revealed, and “a growing body of evidence suggests they may be our best shot at preserving biodiversity and resilient human societies.”  Yet, the prevalent idea of migration is that it is a disruptive force even though it is the migrants who often end up living in pitiful conditions. Images of African migrants fleeing the continent on ramshackle boats across the Mediterranean, Syrians pouring into Europe, people from Honduras and Guatemala on the long walk towards the U.S. border have filled newspapers. Social panic invariably follows stories of movement, with migrants often associated with criminality, disease and economic drain. Shah tracks these commonly-held theories and quashes each with research and data. Shah says scientific ideas that cast migration as a form of disorder were widely disseminated, and not only did they influence countries like the U.S. which closed its borders in the early 20th century, they also “inspired the fascist dreams of Nazis.” Some of that fervent nationalism and divisiveness are on display around the world right now. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has been stridently anti-migrant; Britain voted to leave the European Union and several politicians opposed to migration have climbed into power. Hollow narratives Using a metaphor from nature, she ruminates that narratives used to justify anti-migrant policies are bloated and hollow. Shah compares these policies to an unusual species of mushroom called Calvatia gigantea which explode into a smoky cloud on maturity, leaving behind nothing but an empty, crinkled shell. “With even the lightest scratch on their surfaces, they [anti-migrant moves] dematerialised into a cloud of smoke.” Rich in stories from nature and life, particularly the migrant experience, Shah builds a powerful argument on why walls of hatred against the outsider must be torn down. Over the long history of life on earth, migration’s benefits have outweighed its costs, she explains. Historians of disease have never found “any systematic association between infectious diseases and modern migration.” The relevant question to ask, according to Shah, is what we are going to do about this “force of nature,” because the next great migration will have to overcome more “purposeful barriers.”  The Next Great Migration: The Story of Movement on a Changing Planet Sonia Shah Bloomsbury  Rs. 599    Rich in stories from nature and life, particularly the migrant experience, Shah builds a powerful argument on why walls of hatred against the outsider must be torn down||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/on-a-dynamic-planet-migration-is-integral-for-life-to-flourish/article32477473.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Notes from Bulgaria||In early June this year, as demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd gained momentum in the U.S. capital of Washington DC, it was reported that secret service agents spirited President Donald Trump away to a White House bunker. Though denials of this were issued forthwith, it is said that Trump spent nearly an hour ensconced in the heavily fortified subterranean structure. All this, as protesters rallied outside the executive mansion, resorting to everything from lobbing stones at the world’s most famous residence to destroying police barricades. But Trump is not alone. Tech billionaires, celebrities, world leaders and corporate czars have one thing in common — plush underground bunkers equipped with all the mod cons. Safe havens to seek refuge in, in case of nuclear warfare, civil unrest and... yes, raging pandemics too! If there is one place in the world that gives a whole other meaning to the term ‘bunker lifestyle’, with its abundance of repurposed bunkers, then that would have to be the Balkan country of Bulgaria. Basement ‘bar’gains Both the country’s capital of Sofia and Plovdiv have plenty of subterranean marvels to sink your cultural teeth into. From the former’s recently unearthed Roman city of Serdika to the latter’s resurrected grand Roman stadium, a relic from the time when Plovdiv was known as Philippopolis. However, it was the country’s communist era bunkers and erstwhile bomb shelters that fascinated me the most on my trip to Bulgaria last summer. In Sofia, I found myself getting down on my knees to buy everything from chewing gum to local sweet treats like the fig jam-smeared mekitsi fried dough from the rather strange looking pavement-level klek shops. With their name borrowed from the Bulgarian word for kneel ( klek ), these squat shops have an interesting history. During the cold war, the Soviets repurposed basements of apartments throughout Sofia to serve as bomb shelters, with designated separate spaces for each family to seek refuge in. After the fall of communism in Bulgaria in 1989, residents of the apartments converted these basement shelters into an assortment of commercial spaces like shoe repair shops and haberdasheries to bakeries and mini convenience stores. Shops that could serve just one kneeling customer at a time through small sliding windows, with the shopkeeper’s head at the level of the customer’s feet. Very similar in idea to the social distancing-friendly, bubonic plague era buchette del vino wine windows of Tuscany, Italy, that are now back in use, one could say! However, there are only a handful of these klek shops left in Sofia today. New life is being infused into the shops with several being transformed into diminutive art galleries, basement cafés and even a few two-person only speakeasy-style cocktail bars. Going with the flow! I soon learn that Bulgaria’s subterranean wonders are not just limited to remnants of the country’s Roman and communist eras. And once again, Sofia is a notable example of this. With over 30 mineral hot springs that can be found within the city and its surroundings, hydrogeology is something that is taken very seriously here. In fact, the city’s ancient coat of arms even has a figure depicting the Greek god Apollo bathing at one such mineral spring. Speaking of bathing, the Regional History Museum behind the grand Banya Bashi Mosque in the heart of downtown Sofia was once the old Turkish public mineral bath house, functional till 1986. Adjacent to the museum, at a red and white-bricked water fountain, is where one can find several people partaking in the city’s mineral-rich water bounty by filling up huge bottles and jerrycans with the free, slightly salty-tasting warm water that flows from rows of ornate brass taps that don’t even freeze in Sofia’s sub-zero winters. ‘What lies beneath’ truly takes on a whole other meaning in Bulgaria, it seems. The Mumbai-based writer and restaurant reviewer is passionate about food, travel and luxury, not necessarily in that order.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1On August 30, 1968, this gigantic plane was rolled out by Boeing and shown to the public for the first time. It was their fourth commercial aircraft and the first twin-aisle aircraft. Since that day it has flown more than five billion people and has logged more than 78 billion kilometres, equivalent to 101,500 trips to the moon and back. During an evacuation operation one flight even managed to carry an astonishing 1,087 people. It is so long it would take Usain Bolt seven seconds to cover its length. Which plane, known as a ‘jumbo jet’, was this? 2The lifespan of an airliner is not truly measured in time. Instead, it is counted based on a certain process done regularly during takeoff and landing that causes stress to the fuselage and wings, and over time results in issues. However, it must still be done because it protects the pilot, crew and passengers from hypoxia. The process is carried out by pumping in air to mimic a certain condition found at sea level. What condition is this which at sea level is 14.7 PSI? 3In 1999, Alaska Airlines (AA) became the first airline to offer an option that is commonplace now. The main function of this process is to accept luggage that is to go in the aircraft’s cargo hold, and issue boarding passes, and AA made this easier and faster by embracing technology. When done correctly, the passenger doesn’t need to meet any airline staff till they board the aircraft. What is this option that frequent fliers are very grateful for? 4There are two theories about the strange name of this section of an aircraft. One was that it’s an old navy term for a space at the rear of a boat, occupied by the coxswain. The other is that it supposedly resembles the small round arena used for an ancient bloodsport between two animals (which still takes place in India). What alluring but off-limits section of an aircraft is this? 5In August 1979, Qantas announced a new way to travel on routes between Australia and the U.S. For an increase of 15% above the standard, you could enjoy a new cabin with bigger seats that were arranged in pairs and had more legroom. Passengers also got a special menu and free headsets to listen to the radio. What was this the first instance of in flying history? 6The noses of military aircraft are pointed because the sharper the nose, the faster the aircraft can travel. But a longer nose keeps pilots from seeing the runway properly, which is why passenger jets have rounded noses. In the 1960s Russian engineers solved this problem for the Tupolev Tu-144, and the iconic Concorde too had the same system installed. Known as a ‘droop nose’, what does this system allow an aircraft to do? 7Various rules are imposed by different airlines during flight. However, there is one rule that is common to most of them, concerning the food served on board to the crew. This rule was introduced after a case of food poisoning almost caused a disaster on board a flight. What is this rule that ensures that responsibility for the aircraft is always maintained even if one member is compromised? 8Some airlines have strict rules for their pilots when it comes to a certain characteristic, because in case of an emergency, pilots must stay conscious to be able to save people’s lives. The reasoning is that if a pilot had this feature it may stop the oxygen mask from fitting securely on his face and operating properly. A 2018 study done by Simon Fraser University using a hypobaric chamber proved that under certain conditions this feature can be allowed. Based on this, Air Canada allowed its pilots a maximum length of 1.25 cm. What is this feature that wouldn’t be a problem if the pilot was a lady? 9The world’s first commercial jet airliner was the Comet by de Havilland, but it had several structural integrity issues. One major discovery was that pressure built up more around the corners of a particular part of the aircraft, and at high altitudes this led to damage. This issue was solved by simply changing the shape from square to round or oval. What is this part that is usually square or rectangular in buses, trains and cars but characteristically round in planes? 10Liverpool airport in 2001 became the first airport in the U.K. to be named after an individual, when it renamed itself after one of the most famous residents of the city. The dedication is further emphasised by the fitting motto of the airport, ‘Above us only sky’, which is a line taken from one of the most famous songs written by this person. Who is the airport named after and from which song is the motto taken? A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/easy-like-sunday-morning/article32477492.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Train to India||I grew up listening to tales about Partition from my mother. In May 1946, when just 20, my mother and her 22-member joint family fled to India from Lyallpur (now Faizalabad). She had just graduated in maths, having come second in the then Panjab University. What could have been a happy life was suddenly torn asunder. My mother’s family had lived in Lyallpur for three generations, and there could be no other place they could call home. But then the Muslim-Hindu riots and clashes began to grow more frequent and bloody. Giving up One day, her eldest brother, the head of the family as they lost their father at a young age, told them they should leave. “Mother, if something happens to these girls, we will be left nowhere,” he sad. She instantly agreed. There were three young women about my mother’s age. The family was told to pack just two pairs of clothes each and leave the following day. “Everyone understood the seriousness of the situation. Our old Muslim servants disappeared one night. We feared our homes would be set on fire, and marauding crowds would slaughter us. It was a predominantly Hindu-Sikh lane, and the menfolk would keep vigil at night, but a day came when everyone knew nothing would work,” my mother would say. “And we left. We packed in two small trunks, untied our cows and buffaloes so they wouldn’t starve, unfettered our horse, and walked out of the house leaving the door wide open. We left with a stone in our hearts.” The family boarded a train for India. No one was talking, not even the children. Every passenger in the coach was staring out of the window as they passed trees and canals, knowing full well that they were seeing their beloved land for the last time. The train chugged on and began to cross Lahore. Everyone’s heart was in their mouth. “The skies were red. No one spoke.” After two days and 166 km, the train crossed into India. The refugees reached Amritsar. “It was then that the tears began to flow. It had dawned on us what we’d gone through.” Torn ties My mother, a Sikh, and Khalida, a Muslim, were like sisters, inseparable. They had to meet every day. When my mother had typhoid, Khalida sat by her daily. Khalida returned from Lahore University two months before the final exams, and asked my mother to coach her in maths. “I’d finished studying all the topics which Khalida didn’t know. In teaching her those, I couldn’t complete my revision. Maths is such a subject, you can’t depend on past study. I lost the first rank. But it’s all right. If I hadn’t coached Khalida, she’d have failed. We were so happy she’d passed,” my mother would recollect. She described the last day of their lives together. They only held hands and wept. Both knew it was their last meeting. Khalida and she exchanged letters for some years. Then the letters suddenly stopped. Khalida died in 1980. My mother died in 2013. She always talked of her, invariably ending with, “Pakistan should never have been created.” ceogiit@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/train-to-india/article32477438.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Like father, like son||When Freddy Trump, the oldest brother of the Trump siblings, was critically ill, Donald Trump dialled Linda to inform her that her husband won’t make it. Linda rushed to the Trump House and found Freddy’s parents sitting in the library; they were not in hospital with their son. And Donald had gone to the movies. Warped sensibility If this anecdote shows Donald Trump as insensitive, it is equally a comment on his father, Fred Trump. In her blistering book Too Much and Never Enough , the President’s niece writes that the Trump siblings are who they are largely because of their father — “a high-functioning sociopath”. He had no time or patience for his wife, Mary, who had chronic health issues, or his children. He was singularly obsessed with expanding his business through political connections and government largesse; yet the children spent their lives craving for his respect and love. His ruthless, controlling nature left them with a warped sense of right and wrong and arrested their growth in various ways. Rob was always eager to please. Donald learnt that being brash, boastful and disrespectful was the only way to gain his father’s acceptance. Freddy, a quiet rebel, chased his dream of becoming a pilot only to be degraded and humiliated. Eventually, depression and alcoholism cost him his life. Mary’s no-holds-barred attack on the family stems from the deep hurt of losing her father to emotional abuse and from being completely cut out of Fred’s will. If Freddy tried to be different, Donald mirrored his parents in many ways. Fred engaged in hyperbole: “everything was ‘great’, ‘fantastic’, and ‘perfect’”; lying and cheating were acceptable business practices. When the first Italian-American family moved into a white neighbourhood in the 1950s, “Fred was scandalized.” Donald’s mother, Mary, was horrified that Elton John, a “little faggot”, sang at Princess Diana’s service. If an old Fred once pulled out a photo of a topless young woman from his wallet in front of his granddaughter, Donald gawked at his young niece in a bathing suit and said: “Holy ***t, Mary. You’re stacked.” Under the scanner What Mary is at pains to emphasise is that Donald Trump is not a self-made man. Constantly supported by his father, he rose to the top only through self-aggrandisement and charisma, she says. Armed with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, she puts the President under the scanner. He is a “narcissist” with an “antisocial personality disorder” and “an undiagnosed learning disability”. In short, he is not fit to lead a country. When he won the 2016 presidential election, “it felt as though 62,979,636 voters had chosen to turn this country into a macro version of my malignantly dysfunctional family,” she writes.  Too Much and Never Enough is a strategically timed book: revenge, it seems for Mary, is best served cold. What sets it apart from other books about the President is an insider family perspective. Mary is a gifted storyteller. She is scathing, yet empathetic; a Trump, yet not one; immersed in the narrative, yet on the margins. This is both a memoir and a cautionary tale — if Donald Trump is given a second term, Mary is unequivocal about its result: “it would be the end of American democracy.”  Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man  Mary L.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The Caribbean pennants||“What are those flags,” I asked. “They are in houses belonging to Hindus,” my young colleague replied. “Is there any religious or cultural significance?” “I don’t know much, sir; but usually, the Hindus here do puja to various gods and goddesses, and after the puja, they stump flags of different colours mounted on bamboo poles dedicated to them.” “Oh! Maybe, to ward off evil spirits,” I murmured. These were my initial queries as soon as I started travelling within Trinidad and Tobago after taking over as the High Commissioner of India. In the course of my interaction with people, including priests and academics, I understood that the triangular flags, locally called jhandi in Hindu households, have socio-religious significance. They are considered the auspicious and divine guardian of the houses. Each colour represents a god or goddess. For instance, white represents Saraswati, red Hanuman, yellow Krishna and pink Lakshmi. Throughout the year, a household conducts pujas and stumps a jhandi . The flag, usually with a picture of the god or goddess printed or stitched, is placed in one corner of the courtyard where some households have a small family temple. Old flags are replaced by new ones, and the former floated in a river or sea. Migration stories The practice has moorings in migration history, going back to the arrival of Indians to this land from 1845 to 1917. The first ship, Fath Al Razack , arrived from Calcutta with 225 indentured labourers at the Gulf of Paria on May 30, 1845. Subsequently, 1,43,939 people from Bhojpuri, Awadhi and Hindi speaking regions of colonial India (present-day eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar) migrated to work on the sugar plantations. Almost 85% of them were Hindus, and about 14% Muslims. During their travel, the indentured Indians, in their jahaji bundle or carry bag, brought things close to their identity and day-to-day use. These articles included the Ramayana of Tulsidas, plants such as tulsi and cooking utensils. It’s entirely possible, therefore, that the custom of jhandi has remnants of Hindu practices in northern India in the 19th century. During the days of their struggle, the jhandi identification must have been solacing for travellers. The jhandi ritual uses three main elements — vermillion, sandal paste and turmeric. In today’s Trinidad and Tobago, of the 1.3 million population, 43% are of Indian descent, of which 18% are practising Hindus. Temples of different sizes exist inside private courtyards and in public places. Ritual is an integral part of many Hindu households, and it appears, in the past 175 years, the jhandi has reminded them of the essence of the Hindu way of life.

Looking at four losers — three top trumps and the ace of diamonds — South went all out. He let the opening club lead run around to his jack — a good start! He then led a heart to dummy’s jack. He was living the good life. South discarded two diamonds on the ace-king of clubs, then cashed two top hearts, following once and discarding the jack of diamonds on the second. South was down to only trumps and he liked his chances. East covered the jack of spades from the dummy and South conceded two more trump tricks to claim his contract. North took some time to brag about his bidding. Could the defense have done better other than by leading the ace of diamonds? Yes! The hand was an open book, or should have been, at the point where South led the jack of spades. Declarer was known to have seven spades and West had to have the ace of spades and probably the queen also. It all came down to West’s third spade. If it was the 10, nine, or eight, the defense could prevail. East should not cover the jack, but rather let it run to West’s queen. East can then ruff a heart as South under-ruffs. A club from East finishes the job. South can ruff high, but West just discards and waits for two more trump tricks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/asleep-or-awake/article32477484.ece

Shall I explain the details? Listen carefully. Will any sympathy be there? Morning 7 o’clock sharp alarm is going like anything. I woke up and after doing morning programmes like brushing teeth and all I went to living room and took newspaper. After sometime stomach is making sounds as if Yesudas. I thought ok what is time? Breakfast time is it? Then I look at the wristwatch. What did I see Madam/ Sir? I saw that according to Made in Japan Citizen wristwatch time is only 4:25 a.m. Means what? Means morning itself I have to go to the market and change the watch battery. Karumam of all karma. Where is Mrs. Mathrubootham? I don’t know. So just like that I shouted into atmosphere: Kamalam, I am going to the market to change battery. Any other shopping is necessary? My second son At that moment my second son suddenly entered into living room from his bedroom as if Mir Jafar is entering Battle of Plassey. Appa, he said, looking at me. Kanna, I said, looking for nearby heavy object to throw. Madam/ sir, you are knowing everything about second son who is working from home nonstop for whole life since college graduation. I will not repeat that sad Ramayana anymore. He said: “Appa, this is golden opportunity. For two years I am waiting for this day.” I said, what nonsense you are talking, kanna?

No. I said, is it headphones that is so big that Kathakali dancer feeling is coming? He said, no no, appa, do you remember I gave you one fitness watch for measuring steps and calories and all? At that moment Kamalam entered the living room without any warning as if rainy season short circuit in roadside transformer. Whole family whether even one person will enter room with warning? It is the curse of Mathrubootham. Immediately, Mrs. M said, “Kanna, superb idea. For two years I am telling old man please wear fitness watch. Walk 10000 steps. Whether your father will listen. No. It is like reciting Shakespeare to hippopotamus.” I said, ok stop this nonsense. Morning itself eating head. Ok give watch I will wear immediately. Madam/ Sir, you thought headache over? Now real headache started. First it took one hour to find watch. Then after finding watch charging it for two hours. Then when watch is switched on, new problem. Son is saying watch needs special app on phone. Please install urgently. I said, you take my phone and install. But now new problem, memory is not there in phone it seems. I said, Kanna, just remove some game or something. Whether he will listen? Ha ha ha. Better to feed cucumber to cow and wait for raita in the morning. He took two hours to install app. Superb! Now I can wear watch? Never. Watch is needing new update. Another 45 minutes. Finally at 4 p.m. everything is ready. I put watch on my hand. Time is correct. Date is correct. Watch is looking beautiful. I said ok, Kamalam shall I go for one evening walk and measure steps and everything? She said, old man, whether brain is gone like watch battery? During corona time who will step out of house? No need to go for walk and all for minimum 2-3 months. New watch means you will walk whole country or what? I said ok. What else was there to say?

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Memory T cells may only reduce COVID-19 severity||At least six papers published in reputable journals — Cell, Nature, Science, and Science Immunology — have found that 20-50% of people who have not been infected with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) harbour memory T cells derived from previous exposures to common cold coronaviruses. The memory T cells were found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. With Mumbai, Delhi, London and New York witnessing a peak weeks after the coronavirus blazed through the cities, people have wrongly assumed that the pre-existing memory T cells have been providing the much-needed protection from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, leading to a mistaken assumption that herd immunity can be achieved when just 20-30% of the population is infected. Reduce disease severity “Pre-existing T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 could be relevant because it could influence COVID-19 disease severity. It is plausible that people with a high level of pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells that recognise novel coronavirus could mount a faster and stronger immune response upon exposure to the virus and thereby limit disease severity,” Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty from La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, California say in a Comment published in Nature Reviews Immunology.  Unlikely to prevent “The memory T cells are extremely unlikely to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. That is just not what T cells generally do. We (Prof. Sette and I) speculate that they may reduce COVID-19 disease severity and prevent deaths,” Prof. Crotty says in an email to The Hindu. But in a paper published in Cell, a team led by Dr. Marcus Buggert from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden found robust memory T cell responses even in healthy people. Based on this, they noted that memory T cells indicate a “previously unanticipated degree of population-level immunity against COVID-19”, which contradicts the observation by others. In an email to The Hindu, he clarifies: “I completely agree with Prof. Crotty and Prof. Sette that T cells are not going to protect against infection [by SARS-CoV-2], but may prevent recurrent severe COVID-19. That’s what T cell immunity is all about.” In a communication to The Hindu, Gagandeep Kang, Division of Gastrointestinal Sciences at CMC Vellore, echoed the views expressed by Prof. Sette and Prof. Crotty. “Memory T cells generated by seasonal coronavirus alone are very unlikely to prevent [SARS-CoV-2] infection. It is plausible that they play a role in reducing [COVID-19 disease] severity,” Prof. Kang says. In a series of tweets, Prof. Crotty further clarified the misconstrued role of memory T cells in achieving herd immunity. “Even if our most optimistic speculations about cross-reactive T cell memory were found to be correct, it would mean that just as many people would get infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fewer would become severely ill and die from COVID-19,” Prof. Crotty says. Killer T cells Explaining how the memory T cells may help reduce the severity of the disease, virologist Dr. Shahid Jameel, CEO of DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance, says: “The cross-reactive memory T cells on activation would help in the development of plasma cells and thus antibody production, and in the development of killer T cells that would kill virus infected cells. The latter reduces the reservoirs of infection. This would most likely reduce disease severity.” Herd immunity A few researchers have also been mistaking pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells to be playing a part in achieving herd immunity even when only a small percentage of the population is infected. In a bid to clear the misconception regarding cross-reactive memory T cells and herd immunity, Prof. Crotty commented that “there are various tweets misinterpreting COVID-19 ‘pre-existing immunity’ and making dangerous claims about herd immunity”. He says cross-reactive immune memory, which avoids the word immunity, may sometimes get misinterpreted as “protective immunity”. Dismissing the possibility of cross-reactive memory T cells producing herd immunity when only a small percentage of the population is infected, Dr Jameel says: “The [cross-reactive memory T cells] would not provide protective immunity from infection but may mitigate or reduce severity of disease. In fact, most vaccines also don't prevent infection. They reduce or eliminate disease. How successful this is would depend upon the cross-reactivity at the T cell level.” “Herd immunity is complicated, and most models have used calculations only for antibodies (and only stable antibodies at that). Hard to predict how much of a difference T cells would make,” Prof. Kang adds. “T cell immunity will not generate herd immunity, but I truly believe that there could be an “unanticipated” degree of immunity against more severe forms of COVID-19 in the population... and maybe T cells play a role here, but so far this is based on associations,” Dr Buggert says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/memory-t-cells-may-only-reduce-covid-19-severity/article32477602.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||The use and re-use of N95 masks||In the case of infectious diseases like COVID-19, hospitals have to make sure that their patient-facing employees are safe by using Personal Protective Equipment, in particular, N95 masks. N95 masks can stop up to 95% of particles that are as small as 0.3 microns. Yet, not only are N95 masks expensive, they also cannot easily be reused immediately. A collaboration between Mumbai-based institutions, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and Tata Memorial Hospital, has spawned a workable solution to the problem of expense and decontamination. Moist heat Chance and a shared interest in optimising the use of N95 masks brought together Arnab Bhattacharya, a TIFR professor, and C.S. Pramesh, the director of Tata Memorial Hospital. After discussing various routes for decontamination of the masks, such as the use of UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide and so on, they concluded that using moist heat was a good bet. They realised that heat treatment at temperatures beyond 65-70 degrees C for about 60 minutes in dry air or for just about 30 minutes in moist air with humidity over 50% was sufficient to decontaminate the masks, even with SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this method of decontamination, the pathogen is reduced by 99.9%. “We play safe and use 70 degrees C for more than 60 minutes, with some humidity anyway,” says Prof. Bhattacharya. “We have checked that the filtration efficiency of various masks is not impacted over five such one-hour decontamination cycles.” Time, a decontaminant If the used N95 mask is left alone and exposed to air for 96 hours, it will get decontaminated. If a person had five masks to use, and used a different one each day, then by the sixth day, the mask used on day one will be decontaminated. As Prof. Pramesh explains, in TMH, they use a combination of the two approaches for best results. “To date over 6,500 N95 masks have been decontaminated using this method at our hospital. Not only has this resulted in a huge saving, the integrity and reliability of the masks are not compromised,” says Prof. Pramesh. Before using the masks, the group ascertained that the right temperature and right duration of heating eliminated the viral load, and the mask was decontaminated and its integrity intact. The TIFR group also tests the masks beforehand to make sure that they indeed qualify to be called N95. As Prof. Pramesh explains, “This is because as the pandemic grew in impact, we needed many more masks than our usual suppliers could provide. We had to purchase them from new manufacturers and needed to check the quality.” This has two aspects – checking the filtration capacity and also the fit, and the TIFR team obliged. Low-cost solution In fact, Prof. Bhattacharya and coworkers have developed, in collaboration with Manu Prakash’s team from Stanford, a low-cost method of decontamination of the masks that simply uses two vessels, one of which fits into the other, and a cotton cover that insulates the outer vessel. Water is placed in the outer vessel, heated and then the smaller vessel with the mask in it is placed within and the moist air works its magic. “The outer vessel a 5 l capacity aluminium one, and the inner one an approximately 2 l capacity stainless steel one. A Venus 4400 N95 respirator, one of the most common brands used in India, was chosen for the experiments,” says Prof. Bhattacharya. “COVID-19 has brought people together in amazing ways to try to tackle problems in a constrained environment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/the-use-and-re-use-of-n95-masks/article32477597.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Second case of confirmed coronavirus reinfection reported||About five days after the first case of confirmed reinfection by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in a 33-year-old adult was first reported, a second such case has now been reported in the U.S. Like the first reported case of reinfection in Hong Kong, the second case of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 virus in Nevada, U.S. was confirmed through genetic sequencing. “It is likely that there are many re-infections that happen which are asymptomatic but are not identified, such as the Hong Kong case, who was identified based on routine screening at entry,” Gagandeep Kang from the Division of Gastrointestinal Sciences at CMC Vellore says in an email to The Hindu.  The results of the confirmed reinfection case in Reno in Nevada have been posted on a preprint server. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals. While the Hong Kong adult exhibited overt symptoms when infected for the first time in March but was only asymptomatic during the second infection in mid-August, the adult in Nevada had overt symptoms during both infections. In fact, the second infection caused severe symptoms, including hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the body) and breathlessness. Symptoms recurring The Nevada adult first tested positive for the virus on March 25 and needed hospitalisation. Symptoms included sore throat, cough, headache, nausea, diarrhoea. The symptoms resolved on April 27 and the patient twice tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR on May 9 and May 26. But one month after recovering, the patient once again exhibited symptoms and sought care on May 31 and was hospitalised on June 5 when found to be hypoxic. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Genome samples Researchers at the Reno School of Medicine, University of Nevada sequenced the genome of the samples collected during the first and second infections and found themdistinctly different. Though the genome sequences from both infections belong to the same clade (20C), there are distinct differences in mutations between the two. The authors rule out the possibility of the virus experiencing mutations to become the virus that caused the second infection within the patient’s body. They conclude that the “odds of this occurring are vanishingly remote and virtually assure that these are two distinct viral infection events”. “The [case of the] U.S. person who was re-infected is likely to be a rare event; this is apparently a young person who was symptomatic twice, with more severe symptoms the second time. For young people to be symptomatic is not unusual, but for a second symptomatic infection in a short time frame means that this person was not protected by the first infection,” Prof. Kang says. The fact that the first infection did not reduce disease severity on reinfection is surprising. “This is unusual and I do not expect it to be the norm for everyone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 on a second exposure. The response is dependent on the host, and there is heterogeneity. Some people are better able to handle certain kinds of pathogens than others,” says Prof. Kang. On vaccines Explaining what the implications of symptomatic reinfection in the U.S. adult would mean for protection from vaccines, she says: “This variation is likely to be seen with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, as it is with other vaccines as well. Some people will respond well, others not so well and a subset may not respond and be protected at all. Does the finding of symptomatic reinfection in one case mean that vaccines will not work? No, it does not.”  Does the finding of symptomatic reinfection in one case mean that vaccines will not work? No, it does not.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||Acronyms and abbreviations in scientific publications||Whenever I turn to the business page of the newspaper, I notice acronyms which I do not know the meaning of, such as NCLT or MCLR, and need to go on the Web to understand what they are (NCLT stands for National Company Law Tribunal, and MCLR for Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate), though they are obvious to the professional businessman. They are the business lingo while not mine. Likewise, how many of us citizens can expand ‘PMCARES Fund’ or ‘ATAL’, or AYUSH, which are used by the government? Please go and look for them. In fact, ATAL is an acronym of an acronym. Incidentally, an abbreviation or contraction is typically a shortened form of a word used to represent the whole (e.g. Prof. for Professor, or Dr. for Doctor) while an acronym is a set of the initial letters from a phrase that usually form another word, such as DNA for Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid, CBI for the Central Bureau of Investigation, or NDTV for New Delhi Television Ltd). Spate of acronyms Sadly, such acronyms have become commonplace, indeed increasing, in scientific papers and presentations. One may understand if acronyms used by astrophysicists are not understood by life scientists, but this happens to be true even within the life science and medical community! Adrian Barnett and Zoe Doubleday have recently published a paper titled, “Meta-Research: The growth of acronyms in the scientific literature” in the journal eLife which caters to biologists and medical scientists, and is well worth reading. Access it at DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60080. A meta-research is the study of previously conducted research itself: the reports presented on the topic by earlier researchers, their reproducibility, and evaluation. Such a meta-analysis is useful, for example in arriving at the optimal dosage of a drug. Increasing complexity Let me quote what this paper points out in this meta-analysis: “As the number of scientific papers published continues to grow every year, individual papers are also becoming increasingly specialized and complex. This information overload is driving a ‘knowledge-ignorance paradox’ whereby information increases but knowledge that can be put to good use does not! Writing scientific papers that are clear to read could help in closing this gap and increase the usefulness of scientific research”. Widespread use of acronyms makes scientific papers difficult to read and understand their message.  The authors have concentrated on the titles of papers in biological and medical journals between 1950 and 2019 (a total of 24 million during these almost 70 years), and 18.25 million abstracts among these. These papers were extracted from the source PubMed. They found 1.1 million of these had unique acronyms. An acronym here was defined as a word in which half or more of the characters are in capital or upper case letters. mRNA and BRCA1 are acronyms but N95 (the mask we wear) is not. Overuse of acronyms leads to ambiguities, misunderstandings and inefficiencies they cause. For example, the acronym UA seems to have 18 different meanings in medicine. (Here are a few: Uracil-Adenine, umbilical activity, urinalysis, universal anaesthesia). The authors also quote several such papers with multiple acronyms that hinder understanding; one such is an example, which states: “Applying PROBAST showed that ADO, B-AE-D, B-AE-D-C, extended ADO, updated BODE , and a model developed by Bertens et al were derived in studies assessed as being at low risk of bias” . An exercise Since, try as I might, I could not understand its meaning, I wanted to challenge my biological science colleagues to teach me what this sentence means. (On an aside, I sent it to 8 young colleagues across the country, and offered the one who came out first with the answer a glass of wine or a cup of cappuccino coffee, and my thanks in the article. The first to come out, within 18 hours, was Manniluthra Guptasarma of PGI Chandigarh. For those who wish to read the article, she asks us to use the link: doi:10.1183/13993003.01485-2015. I thank her and shine in reflected glory as her doctoral thesis mentor!). More reader-friendly Many analysts have offered potential solutions towards this. (1) Do not use more than 3 acronyms per paper. (2) Use only established acronyms, and not those which could cause confusion; for example the acronym HR might mean heart rate or hazards ratio; it is best to spell out the word of relevance to the paper. (3) When using a newly constructed acronym, make sure what word it is meant for and why is it needed at all. (4) Lastly, regarding the use of abbreviations, do not abbreviate as far as possible. Often, in a scientific review for the public, or policy makers, and often in doctoral theses, many acronyms and abbreviations are used in various chapters. It is best in these that the list of these be added as a separate chapter in the beginning or at the end. dbala@lvpei.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/acronyms-and-abbreviations-in-scientific-publications/article32477592.ece

Bird migration has always fascinated scientists, and the behaviour of billions of migratory birds has been studied for decades. One important question was how these migratory birds coped with adverse wind conditions when flying over deserts, large lakes, seas and oceans. Recent studies have shown that migrants can choose when to fly in order to avoid adverse conditions and also increase their travel speeds. Birds can also avoid drifting off-course by migrating in favourable tailwind conditions; however, it costs extra time and energy when these tailwinds are infrequent. Researchers from the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, U.S. examined the flight strategies of nocturnally migrating birds (February 2016, Scientific Reports ). During the autumn of 2013 and 2014, they used radars to collect data about bird behaviour every five to ten minutes for 55 nights. They found that migratory birds in flight often drifted sideways when facing cross-winds or wind blowing across their direction of travel. These birds also actively assessed the degree to which they need to compensate for wind. They noted that when facing cross-winds, birds at inland sides preferred drifting, while those flying near the Atlantic coast oriented and tracked away from the coast. These behaviours suggest that birds migrate in an adaptive way to conserve energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/flying-high-against-all-odds/article32477596.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||What is the new idea on supply chains?||The story so far: With COVID-19 and trade tensions between China and the United States threatening supply chains or actually causing bottlenecks, Japan has mooted the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) as a trilateral approach to trade, with India and Australia as the other two partners. The initiative is at the strategy stage and has some way to go before participants can realise trade benefits. What does supply chain resilience mean? In the context of international trade, supply chain resilience is an approach that helps a country to ensure that it has diversified its supply risk across a clutch of supplying nations instead of being dependent on just one or a few. Unanticipated events — whether natural, such as volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes or even a pandemic; or manmade, such as an armed conflict in a region — that disrupt supplies from a particular country or even intentional halts to trade, could adversely impact economic activity in the destination country. What is Japan proposing? It is significant that Japan has taken the initiative to include India and Australia, and potentially other Asian and Pacific Rim nations later, in a strategic dialogue, despite India having pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that Japan helped stitch together. What has changed now is that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus what was already known — that when assembly lines are heavily dependent on supplies from one country, the impact on importing nations could be crippling if that source stops production for involuntary reasons, or even as a conscious measure of economic coercion. While Japan exported $135 billion worth of goods to China in 2019, it also imported $169 billion worth from the world’s second-largest economy, accounting for 24% of its total imports, according to data from tradingeconomics.com. Electrical and electronic gear, and machinery, nuclear reactors and boilers were sectors that clocked up significant imports into Japan. So, any halt to supplies (as it happened when China had to shut down factories in regions hit by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic) could potentially impair economic activity in Japan. A Bloomberg report said that Japan’s imports from China fell by half in February, a period when the latter was battling the peak of the virus impact. In addition, the U.S.-China trade tensions have caused alarm in Japanese trade circles for a while now. If the world’s two largest economies do not resolve their differences, it could threaten globalisation as a whole and have a major impact on Japan, which is heavily reliant on international trade both for markets for its exports and for supplies of a range of primary goods from oil to iron ore. A Reuters poll of 32 economists published in August showed a majority 80% expect Japan’s growth and Japanese companies’ productivity growth to be affected if Washington and Beijing move towards creating their own economic zones. As part of the country’s economic stimulus package, the Japanese government recently earmarked $2.2 billion to incentivise its companies to move their manufacturing out of China. This was not a protectionist move — the manufacturing could, but did not have to, return to Japan. This was a nudge to diversification of risk — where those manufacturing lines could be relocated out of China to other third countries. What is likely to have spurred Japan to eye India as a partner for the SCRI? Japan is the fourth-largest investor in India with cumulative foreign direct investments touching $33.5 billion in the 2000-2020 period accounting for 7.2% of inflows in that period, according to quasi government agency India Invest. Imports from Japan into India more than doubled over 12 years to $12.8 billion in FY19. Exports from India to the world’s third-largest economy stood at $4.9 billion that year, data from the agency showed. The corporate stand-offs between the Tatas and Japan’s DoCoMo or the Ranbaxy-Daiichi Sankyo case notwithstanding, trade experts point out to the almost 1,400 Japanese companies operating in India as a clear reflection that the two countries are unlikely to allow individual cases to cloud an otherwise long-standing and deepening trade relationship. Where does Australia stand? Australia, Japan and India are already part of another informal grouping, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad, which includes the U.S. Media reports indicate that China has been Australia’s largest trading partner and that it counts for 32.6% of Australia’s exports, with iron ore, coal and gas dominating the products shipped to Asia’s largest economy. But relations including trade ties between the two have been deteriorating for a while now. China banned beef imports from four Australian firms in May, and levied import tariffs on Australian barley. In June, China’s education Ministry warned its students aspiring to study or already studying in Australia, of ‘rising racism’ in that country, urging them to re-assess their aspirations. China’s chagrin stems from Australia’s push for an enquiry into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. What does India stand to gain, or lose? Following the border tensions between the two highly populous Asian neighbours, partners such as Japan have sensed that India may be ready for dialogue on alternative supply chains. Earlier, India would have done little to overtly antagonise China. But an internal push to suddenly cut links with China would be impractical. China’s share of imports into India in 2018 (considering the top 20 items supplied by China) stood at 14.5%, according to an impact analysis by the Confederation of Indian Industry in February 2020. In areas such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients for medicines such as paracetamol, India is fully dependent on China. In electronics, China accounts for 45% of India’s imports, the analysis showed. Chinese supplies dominate segments of the Indian economy. Sectors that have been impacted by supply chain issues arising out of the pandemic include pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, electronics, shipping, chemicals and textiles. Over time, if India enhances self-reliance or works with exporting nations other than China, it could build resilience into the economy’s supply networks. While India appears an attractive option for potential investors both as a market and as a manufacturing base, trade experts point to the need for India to accelerate progress in ease of doing business and in skill building. Tax incentives, as the one recently announced to compete with the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines for investments in manufacturing, alone may not suffice.  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus what was already known, that when assembly lines heavily depend on supplies from one country, the impact on importing nations could be crippling if that source stops production||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/what-is-the-new-idea-on-supply-chains/article32477515.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||‘I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinks I’m a country in Africa’||At the crack of dawn, a distraught Masaba Gupta, dressed in a bright scarlet gown, walks down an empty Mumbai street to her mother’s home. She has just announced her separation with her husband on Instagram after a short-lived marriage. This opening shot of her semi-autobiographical series, Masaba Masaba , aptly sums up her relationship with her mother, Neena Gupta, who raised her single-handedly. When life throws her a curveball, the 31-year-old fashion designer and entrepreneur runs to her mother for comfort. Growing up, she was at the centre of media attention for being Neena and West Indian cricketer Viv Richards’s child out of wedlock. She has been vocal about body image issues on social media, the discrimination she faced because of her skin colour and the scars it has left behind. In 2018, her divorce from producer Madhu Mantena once again brought her personal life under the spotlight. While her life seems to be far from the ordinary, Masaba insists that behind the high-walls and controversies, they are regular people, experiencing the same heartbreaks as us all. “Celebrities are made out to be larger-than-life figures, untouchable and intimidating and you can’t get a sense of what their lives would be like. But we are all normal human beings,” she says. The intent of making the show was to demonstrate how ordinary their lives are. Setting the story straight She goes on to observe, “You can’t control the narrative when you are somewhat of a public figure.” However, this project enabled her to finally tell her story the way she wanted to and “come clean about her life”. Even though the show has elements of fiction, it captures several milestones, anecdotal information, and character traits. “The part where I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinking I’m a country in Africa, mum posting on Instagram that she is looking for work and being asked to design clothes for a dog on a film set... It has all happened to us,” laughs Masaba. To make a series like this and reveal aspects of one’s life requires vulnerability, adds Neena, who was initially confused about the show’s intentions when her daughter approached her. “It sounded like a great idea, but I didn’t know what they wanted to do, was this a documentary on her life?” recalls the 61-year-old actor. But her primary concern was whether Masaba would manage to act, without any formal training. “It’s like my kid has just given an exam,” she grins. ThedesiKardashians? This doting mother-daughter relationship is at the centre of the series. In the pilot episode, when a tabloid prints blind news of Masaba’s separation, Neena jumps into action to mollify her daughter. Would it be safe to say we have our own Indian Kardashians with the show? “Not at all,” says Masaba. “The Kardashians had a basic formula of putting a camera on their lives and following them day and night. Ours is a heavily scripted show and is a new genre.” Masaba considers it to be closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Master of None . “I hope it wouldn’t be tied to something as common as Keeping up with the Kardashians — which I like — but our show is far deeper,” she says. Alongside Masaba’s struggles, the show chronicles the challenges faced by older women to find prominent roles in Hindi cinema, as Neena struggles to be cast as a lead actor. In real life, her role in Badhaai Ho renewed her otherwise flailing career. “I now get roles that are unbelievable. During the lockdown, I got three amazing roles. It is a golden period for actors, directors, and writers now with OTT and young filmmakers,” says Neena. Masaba too forayed into acting to cash in on this boom, which allowed her to play herself on-screen. “Playing yourself is both easy and hard,” she says. “There’s a fine line between being natural, which can be a bit dampening, and going over-the-top, which the audience can’t relate to.” She recalls, as a child, spending time on the sets of shows and films with her mother and observing how actors behave. She was inspired by her mother’s co-actor in the 1995 series, Gumraah , Irrfan Khan, who passed away this year. “I picked up from him that the greatness of an actor is how relaxed he or she is,” recalls Masaba. Being surrounded by women — director Sonam Nair, writers Punya Arora, Nandini Gupta, and Anupama Ramachandran — during the making of this show, brought in a sense of comfort for Masaba. “When we were writing, I don’t think we had to turn around and tell a male producer that this actually happens in our lives,” she recalls. “Had a man directed it, it would have been a different kind of a series,” adds Neena, as they both agree that the sensitivity with which women can tell women’s stories is indispensable.

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Metro to resume services from Sept. 7||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to resume operations from September 7 after over five months, following Unlock 4.0 guidelines issued by the Central government on Saturday. Metro services in the city have remained suspended since March 22, following the imposition of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “As per the latest guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Unlock 4.0, the Delhi Metro will be resuming its services for the public from September 7 onwards in a calibrated manner,” it said in a statement. Further, the statement added, “Details on the Metro functioning and its usage by the general public will be shared once the detailed SOP on metros is issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in the next few days.”  Longer halting time for trains at stations, limiting the number of people in lifts, discontinuation of tokens, alternate seating inside coaches and a distance of one metre between commuters standing were some of the tentative protocols drawn up by the public transporter. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “I am glad that metro has been permitted to start its operation from September 7 in a phased manner.” The DMRC had last week said that it shall be prepared to resume operations whenever directed by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-metro-to-resume-services-from-sept-7/article32477771.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||‘I’m enjoying this odd disconnection’||At 31, Québécois auteur Xavier Dolan has had a career most indie filmmakers would take a lifetime to build. He has made eight films in a decade, starting at 19, and acted in Hollywood ventures like Boy Erased (2018) and It Chapter Two (2019). At 20, his directorial debut, I Killed My Mother (2009), took him to Cannes, a film festival he has frequented several times since with movies like Laurence Anyways (2012) and Mommy (2014) (he shared the Jury Prize with Jean-Luc Godard). His latest film, Matthias & Maxime , in which he plays one of the titular roles, premièred at the French Riviera last year. The early success was followed by critics mauling his later films like It’s Only the End of the World (2016) and The Death & Life of John F. Donovan (2018), provoking the filmmaker to publicly speak out against the “culture of trolling, bullying, and unwanted hatred”.  Matthias & Maxime is a return to a world most familiar to him — Québec. The film, lauded for its strong performances and emotional power, dropped on Mubi India on August 28. It competed for the Palme d’Or, delving into the questions of latent attraction and homo-eroticism among male friends. Matthias (Gabriel D’Almeida Freitas) and Maxime (Dolan) kiss for a student short film, unearthing a world of emotions and attraction they hadn’t experienced before. Excerpts from an interview. How much of this film is personal? They’re all personal at some level. But that doesn’t mean they’re stories or experiences I’ve lived out. Some characters, some storylines can sometimes be very close to me and things I’ve seen, heard, witnessed, and some others romanticised or fictional. I write films with everything that comes to mind and that means fiction and reality are bound to intertwine. Alongside self-discovery, the movie is about sexual identity and unrequited love. Are you fascinated by ambiguity and unhappy endings?  Do you consider the ending to be unhappy? I think it’s actually quite optimistic! But yes, I am fascinated by ambiguity, of course. And contradictions, irony, absurdity. They’re all so rewarding narratively speaking. With conversations around authenticity in cinema being the hot topic, what’s your view on the discussion about trans/queer actors playing queer/trans characters?     Oooh, here comes trouble! Trans actors deserve opportunity. We’re talking about gender rather than sexual identity. So yes, trans actors should play trans characters. Had I been more aware and educated in 2012, I would have cast a trans actor for the part of Laurence, in Laurence Anyways .The conversation has evolved so much since. However, I’m still flummoxed by the fact that gay people insist on being the only legitimate choice to play gay characters. Does that mean, if we’re being fair, that as a gay man I’ll never get to play straight characters? Or should the industry accept that gay people are entitled to more opportunities than straight actors because we’ve been struggling for years to build careers that seem destined to failure because of our sexual identity? There is no right answer. I’m just thinking out loud. What has been the biggest learning for you as an actor who directs himself?  Although it’s almost impossible when you direct a film and act in it as well, the key is to stay in character as much as you can. I’m excited to explore more of that in the next few years. It seems like an obvious truth, but not if you’ve never entirely believed in the process in the first place. What are the films you’re working on now?     A mini-series. I’m also adapting a French horror short story set in the late 1800’s and working on a new script. Trying to keep myself busy and be ready to jump in with both feet whenever I can work again. For someone who has seemingly worked incessantly in the last decade, has the pandemic been a time for you to recharge your creativity?  Sort of, yes. I crave creation and being around the people I love. At the same time, I’m enjoying this odd disconnection.

30 August 2020||Bhopal,||M.P. calls in Army, IAF for flood relief work||As many as 6,577 persons from 394 villages of nine districts in Madhya Pradesh were rescued within 36 hours of heavy rain that lashed southern areas on Friday and Saturday. Seven deaths had been reported, the State government said. Two columns of Army had been requisitioned to help with moving people to safer spots in Raisen and Hoshangabad districts, Manish Rastogi, Revenue Commissioner, told The Hindu . The Air Force had also been roped in. “Rain is unprecedented like the previous year, but it didn’t rain this much in 24 hours last year,” Mr. Rastogi said. He added in 36 hours, most of the southern districts witnessed very heavy rain, such as Narsinghpur which received around 30 cm rain. “In Chhindwara and Sehore districts, we had to undertake air-lifting,” he said. Rescuers were trying to reach two villages in Hoshangabad and Raisen districts which had become islands. “The Chief Minister is reviewing rescue efforts village-wise. District administration and State officers from Home, Revenue and Water Resource Departments are coordinating with the Army and the National Disaster Response Force,” said Mr. Rastogi. “Through dense clouds and rain, we tried to conduct an aerial survey along the Narmada,” CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Saturday. “We reached the river but couldn’t see anything, and had to return.” Owing to heavy rain, flood-like situation had developed in parts of Jabalpur, Bhopal and Hoshangabad divisions where heavy rain was expected to continue for the next 48 hours, he added. “By 10 a.m. the Narmada had breached the danger level in Hoshangabad,” he said. Almost all dams across rivers were full to the brim, the CMO said. All 13 gates of the Tawa dam, 22 of the Indira Sagar dam, 21 of 23 gates of the Omkareshwar Dam and 17 of the 21 gates of the Bargi Dam have been opened. At present, the well marked low pressure area is located around the central-north Madhya Pradesh and the associated cyclonic circulation is active with a south-west tilt up to an altitude of 7.6 km above the sea level, said Ved Prakash Singh, Scientist and Head (DWR / Seismology) at the India Meteorological Department, Bhopal. IMD Bhopal’s senior meteorologist G.D. Mishra said only one district, Mandsaur, had received below normal rain from June to August 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mp-calls-in-army-iaf-for-flood-relief-work/article32477808.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Bids invited to upgrade railway station||Putting into motion the Rs. 6,500-crore project to upgrade the New Delhi railway station, the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has invited online bids from private players to redevelop the station into an integrated commercial, retail and hospitality hub. The project, which is targeted to be completed in four years, will include infrastructure upgrades such as multi-level car parking, refurbished platforms and passenger amenities including lounges and food court, besides office complexes and five-star hotels in the vicinity. “New Delhi railway station will be transformed into a world-class, one-stop destination for retail, commercial and hospitality business. The development will boost the tourism potential and accentuate real estate as well as investment prospects in New Delhi and surrounding regions,” Ved Parkash Dudeja, Vice Chairman at RLDA, said. The New Delhi railway station is the largest and the second busiest in the country. It handles approximately 4.5 lakh passengers and about 400 trains per day. The project will be developed on a Design-Build Finance Operate Transfer (DBFOT) model for a concession period of 60 years. The project will include station redevelopment, development of associated infrastructure, upgrade of social infrastructure as well as refurbishment of railway offices and railway quarters. “Some of the planned redevelopment include an elevated concourse with segregation of arriving and departing passengers; refurbished platforms with easy access from concourse level; mezzanine level exclusively for passenger facilities such as lounges, food courts and restrooms; an elevated road network with multiple entry and exit points; a multi-level parking facility and Green Building provisions such as optimum use of natural ventilation and lighting,” it said. Commercial component The project will also include a significant commercial component, incorporating a mix of retail, office, and hospitality developments such as 5-star hotels, budget hotels and serviced apartments on approximately 30 acres of land.

30 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||DCW rescues girl from prostitution||The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Saturday said they along with the police rescued a 20-year-old woman, who was allegedly forced into prostitution, from Rohini. DCW officials said action was taken after the woman reached out to the commission for help. “She informed that one of her old acquaintances had lured her with a high-paying job but instead pushed her into prostitution. He had told her that he could help her earn easy money. She went with him and on reaching the house in Rohini, she was asked to engage in prostitution,” the DCW said. The woman also said she was threatened and beaten up when she refused to engage in prostitution. “When the DCW team reached Rohini, they found that there were three girls and some men in the house apart from the main perpetrator — Jitesh. He was found inside a room in objectionable circumstances. They accepted that there was a sex racket operational from the house,” the women’s panel said. DCW Chairperson Swati Maliwal said: “Young girls are pushed into prostitution on the pretext of jobs and easy money. While we were able to rescue the girl, DCW also busted the sex racket. There are several sex rackets operating in many houses in Delhi which need to be immediately shut down.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dcw-rescues-girl-from-prostitution/article32477783.ece

30 August 2020||New Delhi,||AAP accuses BJP-led civic bodies of making Delhi ‘the dirtiest city’||The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday held protests against the BJP-ruled municipal corporations at different parts of the city after Delhi ranked poorly in the latest Central government’s cleanliness survey. Around 150 large banners were installed in 36 Assemblies of Delhi, on major flyovers, foot-over bridges and underpasses, the party said. “Delhi is the dirtiest city”, “Shame on BJP”, read the banners installed at different areas of the city. Many AAP councillors and MLAs organised protests at their respective areas, the party added. “It is very unfortunate that Delhi, the capital of the country, has found to be the dirtiest city due to BJP. Tourists from different countries of the world come to Delhi, the Prime Minister of this country — Narendra Modi — lives in Delhi, all the Cabinet Ministers of the Centre and all the MPs live in Delhi. But the reluctance and the corruption of the BJP-led civic bodies, Delhi is now the dirtiest city,” said AAP leader Durgesh Pathak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-accuses-bjp-led-civic-bodies-of-making-delhi-the-dirtiest-city/article32477781.ece
30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||U.S. vote amid COVID||The story so far: Last week, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted to provide the cash-starved United States Postal Service (USPS) with $25 billion ahead of the November 3 presidential election. The legislation also aims to block policy cuts and curbs that critics said would thwart the mail-in voting system. The vote attracted a sharp response from U.S. President Donald Trump who was critical of the infusion plan. What is the controversy? There are two aspects to the ongoing controversy. Mr. Trump and his supporters allege that the expansion of postal voting in the November elections will lead to malpractices. Democrats and a section of the Republicans disagree. Parallel to this, the Democrats allege that a set of measures announced (and now suspended) by the 75th Postmaster General of the United States and the Chief Executive Officer of the world’s largest postal organisation, Louis DeJoy, is a deliberate effort to disrupt postal voting at the President’s behest. Allies of Mr. DeJoy argue these measures were pending for long, and he had just fast-tracked them. How expansive could the mail-in voting be this time? Several States have relaxed postal voting rules in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, to enable and even encourage people to not visit the polling booth. All States allowed some form of postal, absentee voting earlier too but this time it is historic. According to an analysis by The New York Times , around 80 million votes might arrive by mail. In 2016, the total number of votes cast was 136.8 million. The same analysis found that 21% of voters will receive ballots by mail even if they do not ask for it; 57% will get if they ask for them; and the balance 22% will get if they ask for them citing a reason. The pandemic is a valid reason in many States. Some States have allowed ballots arriving after the polling day also to be counted, which could delay results there. On July 30, Mr. Trump said on Twitter: “With Universal Mail-In Voting …2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA.” He also suggested the polls could be delayed until “people can properly, securely and safely vote”. The Trump campaign has vowed to fight relaxation in mail-in voting at every step, as they view these changes as unconstitutional. What changes were announced by the USPS and what were the reactions? Mr. DeJoy took charge in June, and announced changes in operational practices that soon became controversial. These changes related to retail hours of post office operation, scaling down of mail processing facilities, collection boxes and overtime for workers. The changes snarled up mail movement, and the Democrats alleged the disruption could effectively disenfranchise people. At least 20 States have challenged the measures in court. Mr. DeJoy was summoned by the House of Representatives and the Senate for hearings. Following the upheaval, the USPS suspended all changes until after the elections are over. But questions remain regarding measures that were already effected, such as removal of sorting machines and mail boxes. What verification is done of ballots arriving by mail? According to an AP fact check on the possibility of malpractices in postal voting, only people with current voter registrations can receive a ballot by mail. “Voters must fill out the ballot, sign the envelope, then mail it or drop it off at a designated location by a certain deadline.” States have various methods of verification. Some States verify the signature on the envelope with that on the file, some do not verify the signature. Some States require a witness signature or a notarised signature of the voter. What has been a perennial issue with the U.S. voting procedure? The voting procedure is diverse across the U.S., which has no central authority as the Election Commission of India that lays down the rule for the whole country. A total of 36 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, 35 of which are in force in 2020; of them, only 18 ask for a photo-ID (although North Carolina’s is on hold based on a preliminary injunction from a federal judge). In 16 States and in the capital Washington DC, voters are not asked for an ID, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republicans, and most vocally Mr. Trump, have been making claims of voter fraud. They want stricter identity checks for voting. More than 10 million residents are unauthorised in the U.S., and of its 35.2 million legal immigrants only 20.7 million are naturalised citizens and hence eligible to vote. Democrats on the other hand argue that stricter rules could disenfranchise minority populations and the less educated and further suppress voting. The U.S. has one of the lowest voting rates among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries — 55.7% in 2016.   The Trump campaign has vowed to fight relaxation in mail-in voting as it views these changes as unconstitutional.

30 August 2020||August 30 2020 00:00 IST,||CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT BORDERS A kaleidoscopic view into the festival of Onam||Festivals are meant to be celebrated by everyone. It doesn’t matter what religion you belong to because it is a time for joy and kindness. And that is universal. In a world which is greatly divided, festivals bring us all together. Onam is one among many where people of different beliefs join together to celebrate. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Christian, Hindu or Muslim, Onam is secular. Onam is a real cultural extravaganza, also known as the harvest festival of Kerala that symbolizes the homecoming of King Mahabali. The rich festival, with a grand history of celebration, brings together a multitude of colours and arts. Onam is always filled with nostalgic memories of the primitive Kerala, rich and green, serene and clean, encompassed with a legendary ideal society. There are no borders when it comes to celebrating the harvest festival. It is celebrated everywhere, in different parts of the world. From its home state, Kerala to the other end of the world, Onam is a spirit. It has come leaps and bounds from its unknown past, sailing through waters like the graceful snake boat race, into the present where almost everyone who’s heard of Kerala, knows about the festival of Onam. It connects people in a way that is special. People open their homes to everyone, sharing their food and customs. As you smell the aroma of the sadhya wafting through the air, the hosts welcome everyone as a part of their family to enjoy and share a traditional, authentic sadhya on a banana leaf with rich curries, hot rice, flavorful vegetables, tantalizing pickles, crunchy snacks and buttermilk which cleanses your palate. The final feather in the cap of the meal is payasam, a delicious and light dessert. Kerala has been gifted with a potpourri of cuisines, and it would be an enjoyable journey just exploring through the distinctiveness, especially during Onam season. The cuisine of Kerala is an entirely different story, and cannot be summed up in a few phrases. Arguably the best shopping season that coincides with the state’s harvest festival, the market is carefully analysing the multitude of attractive offers and discount schemes coming its way. Companies, brands and dealers are vying with each other to be heard over constant, loud buzz while offering gifts and schemes as varied as gold coins and more. Regardless of Covid pandemic, people still retain joie de vivre by being a part of Onam’s vibrant culture. One can see people roaring with untamed vigour like the tigers painted on their chests and women looking as pretty as the delicate pookalam decorated everywhere. It marks the homecoming of not just the legendary king, Mahabali but also many people who left Kerala and are coming back to celebrate the festival with their families. Onam is an embodiment of all festivals put together; with lights, fireworks, dances, colours, food and action. It is like looking through a kaleidoscope of life. Onam imbibes a sense of culture that awakes a spirit of love and harmony among all, showing equality among the people because that’s what King Mahabali wanted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/celebrations-without-borders-a-kaleidoscopic-view-into-the-festival-of-onam/article32477904.ece

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel was informed by the urban body that the land belonging to the DDA had boundary walls around it. Disposing of the plea, the Bench noted, “Underground reservoirs had been constructed to replace the borewells. Protected forest area was five acres which was not demarcated. Labour camps were removed from the place.” In the plea it was alleged that despite objections from the Deputy Conservator of Forest in 2015, the DDA was constructing a building in an area recorded as a green belt. “The green belt is a five-acre forest area and is declared protected under the1980 forest notification. The DDA has started a project in the area making concrete structures, clearing the land of foliage and trees,” the plea stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/havent-encroached-upon-green-belt-dda-tells-ngt/article32477772.ece
30 August 2020||New Delhi,||Waive fixed charges on electricity bills, says BJP||The Opposition BJP on Saturday alleged that power charges in the Capital were among the highest in the country and the Delhi government had added to the financial burden of the people by Rs. 98 crore by increasing the pension charge component in these from 3.8% to 5%. Every year, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said, a public hearing was conducted before the implementation of new power tariffs, but this time, the DERC, “in collusion with Delhi government”, increased the pension charge without a public hearing. “Delhi BJP demands that the Delhi government waive off fixed charges and give credit of subsidy on electricity bills for domestic consumers for electricity consumption during lockdown,” Mr. Gupta said. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said that electricity rates in Delhi were among the highest in the country. Consumers of all categories, domestic, industrial and commercial were not only paying hefty electricity bills, but huge amounts of fixed charges also. “The Chief Minister must waive off the fixed charge for the last five months of industrial and commercial electricity consumers in Delhi considering the lockdown,” Mr. Bidhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/waive-fixed-charges-on-electricity-bills-says-bjp/article32477773.ece

It is now the responsibility of the ruling BJP-JJP government to give compensation to the farmers,” he said. Mr. Hooda said earlier the rabi (winter) crop was hit in many districts due to untimely hailstorm, but the farmers have not yet received compensation. “The government should take stern action against the officials responsible,” he said.
