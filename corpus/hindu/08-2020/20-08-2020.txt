20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. to set up National Recruitment Agency||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the creation of a National Recruitment Agency (NRA) for conducting a Common Eligibility Test (CET) for various government jobs. Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Cabinet had taken the “historic” decision at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to benefit crores of young people who applied for jobs every year. About 2.5 crore to 3 crore candidates applied for the 1.25 lakh Group B and C jobs advertised by three agencies every year, with separate schedules and fees. Secretary of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) C. Chandramouli said that to begin with, three of the over 20 Central government recruitment agencies would be brought under the NRA. Preliminary round The preliminary test for the Railway Recruitment Board, the Staff Selection Commission and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection would be conducted by the NRA, after which the candidates can use the scores to apply to the individual agencies for the next round. Gradually, all Central government recruitment agencies would be brought under the NRA, Mr. Chandramouli said. “A common eligibility test would enable these candidates to appear once and apply to any or all of these recruitment agencies for the higher level of examination. This would indeed be a boon to all candidates,” a government statement said. The exam would be held online in 12 languages to begin with, and centres would be set up in every district to increase access, it stated. “The CET score of the candidate shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of declaration of the result. The best of the valid scores shall be deemed to be the current score of the candidate,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-set-up-national-recruitment-agency/article32398826.ece
20 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||State’s case burden crosses 50,000||Kerala’s engagement with COVID-19 crossed a major milestone when the cumulative case burden of the disease reached 50,231 in the State on Wednesday. The State’s daily case graph also reached a new high when the trend of the past two weeks of 1,500-1,700 cases suddenly spiked to 2,333 cases. Post-lockdown scene The exponential case graph of the State post lockdown has been no different from that of the rest of the world, indicating that none of the public health interventions could stop or even slow down the epidemic tide. The number of patients currently undergoing treatment in various hospitals has swelled to 17,382. The State reported 1,217 recoveries and the total recoveries till date have been 32,607. Alongside the increase in the number of active cases, COVID-19 death rate has been showing a steady increase. The official death toll has reached 182, with the Health Department confirming seven more deaths which occurred between August 12 and August 17. Three of the deaths were reported in Ernakulam, two in Thiruvananthapuram and one each in Kollam and Pathanamthitta. Of 2,333 new cases, 2,175 cases (93%) are locally acquired infections. These include 17 cases of health-care workers. In 53 cases, the source of infection is yet to be pinpointed. Capital continues lead The capital district of Thiruvananthapuram shows no signs of bucking the trend of reporting the highest number of cases daily and has logged 540 cases on Wednesday, of which 526 are locally acquired infections. According to prison officials, 470 prisoners at the Central Prison, Poojappura, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 till date. The district jail has reported 40 cases in all, and the special subjail, two. Malappuram too shows a steady rise with 322 new cases. Of these, 302 are locally transmitted infections. Three more districts registered over 200 cases on Wednesday, Alappuzha had 253 cases, Ernakulam 230 and Kottayam 203. Among other districts, Kasaragod reported 174 new cases, Kannur 126, Thrissur 97, Pathanamthitta 87, Kozhikode 78, Kollam 77, Palakkad 65 and Wayanad 17. System capacity The sudden spike in hospitalisations could trigger health system capacity issues in some districts, especially in Thiruvananthapuram, where the number of active cases has reached 4,621. Malappuram has 2,411 active cases, Ernakulam 1,698, Alappuzha 1,595 and Kozhikode 1,338. In rest of the districts, the active case number is still well below the 1,000 mark. The State has quarantined over 1.69 lakh people, of whom 13,759 with mild flu-like symptoms are isolated in hospitals. The number of tests performed in the last 24 hours reached 36,291. At present, 572 localities have been designated as hotspots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-case-burden-crosses-50000/article32399157.ece
20 August 2020||Bengaluru,||CET results postponed by a day||The results of the Common Entrance Test (CET), which was initially scheduled to be announced on Thursday, will now be declared on Friday. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan cited technical reasons for the delay. Students will be able to access the results on http://karresults.nic.in after 12.30 p.m. on Friday. The CET was held amid a slew of precautionary measures on July 30 and 31. The exam, which was originally scheduled to be held in April, was postponed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 1.9 lakh students had registered for it. COMEDK UGET Meanwhile, COMEDK UGET and Uni-Gauge 2020 entrance tests were conducted in 73 centres across the State, including 36 in Bengaluru, on Wednesday. According to a release from the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK), 43,331 candidates out of the registered 61,290 attempted the exam across the country. “In Karnataka, the number of candidates who attended the test stood at 14,280 out of the 17,776 registered, which works out to 80%,” the release stated. In four centres in the city, a few students reported problems while logging in, but they were provided the stipulated time of three hours to complete the test. Many students complained that social distancing norms were not followed after the exam was over, and there was crowding at the areas where bags were stored. “But other precautionary measures, including thermal checking, providing sanitisers, and safe distance between two students were maintained,” Inish T., a student, said. Too far A few students and parents also complained that the examination centres were too far from their residence. “We stay near Bommanahalli and my son was allotted a centre near Ullal, which is over 20 km away. They should have given a centre closer to our residence,” said Thiyagu P., a parent. According to COMEDK, provisional answer keys will be notified on the COMEDK website on August 23 along with forms for challenging the answer keys. “The final answer key will be made available on August 31. The score cards will be made available to the candidates in their respective applicant login on September 4,” the release stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cet-results-postponed-by-a-day/article32398873.ece
20 August 2020||Belagavi,||60-year-old man dies as roof collapses in rain||A man died when his roof collapsed in heavy rain in Sadalga town in Belagavi district on Wednesday. Kallappa Paragouda (60) died within minutes of a part of his wood and tile roof falling on him while he was asleep. This is the second death in the district due to floods this year. MLA Ganesh Hukkeri visited the house of the deceased. He announced that he had ensured that the district administration released Rs. 5 lakh to the bereaved family in a few hours. He also said that Annapurneshwari Foundation, which his family runs, had donated Rs. 1 lakh to the family. Officials said that water levels were receding in six villages that were inundated in the last three days. Revenue and Police officers had evacuated Sunadholi village that was surrounded by water on three sides. Policemen were deployed at the Jadi Siddeshwar temple to warn devotees against venturing into the river nearby. Water levels were also receding on the Lolsur bridge between Gokak and Chikkodi. The police are likely to allow traffic to resume on the bridge on Thursday. Water levels were also reducing in parts of Gokak, including Uppar Galli and Dohar Galli, that were inundated by the Ghataprabha waters on Tuesday. Residents of Ramdurg celebrated the Palaki festival of Sunnal Hanumappa temple after the flood waters receded on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/60-year-old-man-dies-as-roof-collapses-in-rain/article32399051.ece
20 August 2020||MUMBAI,||Harley-Davidson may exit India||Barely a decade after its entry, Harley-Davidson Inc. is looking to wind down its assembly operations in the country as a result of weak sales and a lack of visibility for future demand, industry executives said. The iconic U.S. motorcycle maker has sent out feelers to a few automakers through consultants for a possible outsourcing arrangement using its leased assembly facility at Bawal in Haryana, a person privy to the preliminary talks said. The decision is in keeping with its latest ‘rewire’ strategy to focus on about 50 markets, mainly in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific that represent the “majority of the company’s volume and growth potential”.  In a statement accompanying its second-quarter results last month, Harley- Davidson said: “The company is evaluating plans to exit international markets, where volumes and profitability do not support continued investment in line with the future strategy.” Harley-Davidson India sold fewer than 2,500 units in the last financial year, industry officials said. If the company, which saw U.S. President Donald Trump passionately lobby India for lower tariffs on its two-wheelers, does indeed exit, it would mark the second departure of an American automaker, after General Motors wound up its domestic operations and sold its Gujarat plant in 2017. The company declined to comment on its immediate plans for India and an external spokesman said it “does not comment on speculation”. The motorcycle maker is expected to continue to run a skeletal operation to provide after sales support for the motorcycles already on the road in the country, to support its dealers and likely sell fully built imported bikes, the person said. Harley-Davidson India sold only about 100 bikes between April-June 2020, industry officials said, making India one of its worst-performing international markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/harley-davidson-may-exit-india/article32398824.ece
20 August 2020||T. Appala NaiduDOWLESWARAM (EAST GODAVARI),||Relief as Godavari flood level recedes||The flood in the river Godavari has come down from a dangerous level by Wednesday evening, prompting the Godavari Flood Conservator to withdraw the “Third warning”, as the discharge of flood water fell below 18 lakh cusecs at Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage at Dowleswaram in East Godavari district. At Bhadrachalam, the water level in the river was 43 feet with the discharge of less than one lakh cusecs, which would arrive at the barrage by Thursday morning. The irrigation authorities have decided not to let the flood water flow into the irrigation canals as it may lead to breaches of the canal bunds. Instead, the flood water is being released into the branches of river Godavari as it will go into the sea. However, the flood water has cut off over 21,000 houses, affecting 81,000 people directly, mostly downstream of the barrage, apart from the entire mandal of Devipatnam in Rampa Agency and four mandals in Chintoor Agency that are upstream of the barrage.  The flood mitigation report issued by East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy said that 168 habitations had been affected by the flood and 82 of them were under water by Wednesday. There was no casualty, but at least 50 heads of cattle had died. In a major blow to the farmers, the flood water damaged horticulture crops in over 7,227 hectares and banana was the most affected crop in the Konaseema region. At least 251 boats remained in operation across the district, mostly to supply essential commodities and food and drinking water packets to those who did not leave the affected habitations and to conduct the survey of the affected families for medical and other timely care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/officials-relieved-as-godavari-water-level-comes-down/article32398770.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Spillway gates of Srisailam dam lifted||The authorities of Srisailam project, a common reservoir for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and a source for several irrigation and drinking water systems in the two States, lifted the spillway gates of the dam on Wednesday evening to commence discharge of flood. Three gates of the spillway were lifted for 10-foot height each to discharge a flood of over 79,100 cusecs after Nandyal MP P. Brahmananda Reddy and Srisailam MLA S. Chakrapani Reddy, along with the engineers of the dam performed pooja and offered prayers before switching on the motors to operate the radial crest gates. Scenic view A scenic view was unveiled as the water slipped off the tall spillway and touched the bucket below to rebound into the air before falling into the river course. The decision to commence the spillway discharge was taken as the water level in the reservoir crossed 881 feet against its full reservoir level of 885 feet. At 7 p.m., water storage in the Srisailam dam was 195.21 tmcft against its capacity of 215.81 tmcft. Last year, the spillway gates were lifted on August 9 itself as the project received surplus water in a matter of 10 days since the commencement of flood to the reservoir began only on August 1 late night. This year, flood water from the reservoir is already being let into the river course with power generation in the Left Bank power house by Telangana Genco since July 20 and AP commenced power generation in its Right Bank power house from August 18. Another 72,000 cusecs water was also being let into river with power generation by Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. According to the Central Water Commission (CWC) forecast, Srisailam reservoir is expected to get a flood of nearly 16 tmcft in the 12-hour period up to 6 a.m. on Thursday with average inflows of about 3.64 lakh cusecs both from Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers. At 7 p.m. on Wednesday, the discharge of flood from Tungabhadra at Sunkesula Barrage was nearly 55,400 cusecs and that from Krishna at Jurala was over 3.14 lakh cusecs including 2.98 lakh cusecs from 39 spillway gates and another 21,000 cusecs with power generation. An advisory issued by the CWC stated that outflow from Tungabhadra dam would go up to 88,000 cusecs and the water level in the river at Ollenur in the downstream was rising rapidly. Subsequently, water level in the river at Mantralayam may cross the warning level of 310 metres by Thursday morning. It crossed 309 metres on Wednesday evening. It has also put the authorities of Kurnool on alert and advised them not to allow any activity in and near the river banks of Tungabhadra that flows abutting the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/spillway-gates-of-srisailam-dam-lifted/article32399079.ece

20 August 2020||New Delhi,||Hotels, weekly markets to reopen in Delhi||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday gave approval for reopening of hotels and weekly markets in the city. The weekly markets will be opened on a trial basis to assess the situation on the ground. The decision was taken in a meeting of the DDMA, chaired by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal and attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal through videoconferencing. Gymnasiums, however, will remain closed for the time being. According to the Delhi government, hotels contribute to 8% of the Capital’s GDP while weekly markets provide employment to 5 lakh poor families.  ‘Persistent efforts’ Mr. Kejriwal credited the “persistent efforts” made by the Delhi government for the DDMA’s decision. He said the COVID-19 situation in Delhi was much better now and the economy of the city had to be brought back on track. “For this, we had propo-sed opening all the hotels in Delhi, which was rejected by the Central government. We again requested the Central government and we are happy that now the proposal has been approved. Now all hotels in Delhi will be opened,” the Chief Minister said. “At the same time, the weekly markets will be opened on a trial basis. Everyone must exercise precautions and follow social distancing,” he added. According to Raj Niwas sources, the DDMA also allowed delinking of banquet halls from hospitals. The Chief Secretary has been directed by Mr. Baijal to prepare standard operating procedures and monitor the implementation of social distancing norms at weekly markets in the city. The hospitality industry welcomed the DDMA decision to allow hotels to resume operations. Delhi Hotels and Restaurant Owners Association president Loveleen Anand and chairman Sandeep Khandelwal wrote: “The decision to open the hotels is a new ray of life given to us by our Chief Minister... It is a step to provide livelihood and employment opportunities. The move will also make migrant workers happy.” In the last week of July, the Delhi government had decided to allow hotels and gyms to reopen in the city besides allowing weekly markets to start on a trial basis for seven days, with social distancing and all other COVID-19-related measures in place. However, on July 31, the L-G rejected the decision to allow hotels and weekly markets under Unlock 3 citing the fragile situation because of the pandemic. On August 6, the government sent a fresh proposal to the L-G stating that the COVID situation in Delhi was improving. It also argued that economic activities needed to start again so that those who had been suffering due to the lockdown could resume their jobs and businesses, albeit with restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hotels-weekly-markets-to-reopen-in-delhi/article32399031.ece
20 August 2020||JAIPUR,||Egyptian mummy survives flooding at Jaipur museum||A 2,300-year-old Egyptian mummy was among the rare objects of historical interest which were saved from drowning at the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur during the torrential rains that lashed the city last week. The mummy was taken out of its glass box in the museum’s basement and shifted to another hall in the building. The rainwater, which inundated several roads and residential colonies of the State capital on August 14, entered the museum’s basement and submerged artefacts, paintings, maps, files and documents. Just before the water at four-foot level could touch the mummy, the staff broke the glass and carried it to a dry area on the upper floor. The mummy, named Tutu, a female member of a family of priests, dates back to Egypt’s Ptolemic period from early 300 B.C. to 30 B.C. It was excavated from a pyramid in Akhmim area of the ancient city of Panopolis. It is one of only six mummies in India and was gifted by the Museum of Cairo for an exhibition in Jaipur organised by the then ruler of the princely state, Sawai Madho Singh II, in 1887. Three experts from Egypt’s Ministry of Culture, who came here in 2011 to conserve the mummy, had concluded that it was in good condition. Main attraction The mummy has been one of the main attractions of the museum, which functions in the historic building constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style. The museum is named after King Edward VII during whose visit to the city as the heir apparent to the British throne its foundation stone was laid in 1876. After the rains, hundreds of documents and antiques have been strewn on the floors of the museum for drying. The entry of tourists has been closed for seven days, said Prakash Chandra Sharma, Director, Department of Archaeology and Museums. Diya Kumari, a member of Jaipur’s erstwhile royal family and a BJP MP from Rajsamand, expressed shock at the damage caused to the artefacts in the museum. “Torrential rains and rampant disregard by the government have damaged the treasures of the past... That adequate measures for their protection were not taken is a sad commentary on the departments concerned,” she tweeted. State Art and Culture Minister B.D. Kalla, who visited the museum on Tuesday, said the staff were vigilant and had rescued the mummy and other important objects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/egyptian-mummy-survives-flooding-at-jaipur-museum/article32399033.ece
20 August 2020||Kolkata,||COVID-19 cases in West Bengal cross 1.25 lakh mark||West Bengal on Wednesday recorded 3,169 new cases of COVID-19, taking the total case tally to 1,25,922. The State also recorded 53 fatalities in the past 24 hours, taking the death toll to 2,581. While the number of active cases in the State increased to 27,678, the recovery rate also increased to 75.97%. Of the 53 deaths reported, 16 were in North 24 Parganas and 11 in Kolkata. The city also recorded 666 new cases of the viral infection in the past 24 hours while North 24 Parganas recorded 657 new cases. Meanwhile, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission on Wednesday said allegations of medical negligence against Desum Hospital in Kolkata are serious. The commission directed the hospital to deposit Rs. 10 lakh, which will be given to the family members of a patient once the allegations are found to be true. The family members of a COVID-19 patient from Purba Medinipur had alleged that the hospital failed to admit the patient as the family could not deposit the advance amount. The patient died while waiting in the ambulance outside the hospital. During a virtual hearing, the commission representatives said the licence of the hospital should be cancelled but considering the welfare of admitted patients, it is not taking such a step. Probing irregularities Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has formed a three-member panel to probe allegations of irregularities in the purchase of materials to upgrade the State health infrastructure after the Finance Department relaxed norms of tender process amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior official said. The panel comprising home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, finance secretary Hari Krishna Dwivedi and health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam was formed by Ms. Banerjee after her office received several complaints of irregularities since the pandemic broke out about five months ago. The State has allocated over Rs. 2,000 crore for health infrastructure upgradation. “It seems the irregularities took place after the tender (bidding process) was relaxed,” the official said.

20 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Centre-State ties may turn turbulent over airport||The Union Cabinet’s decision to hand over the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to Adani Enterprises Ltd. (AEL) of the Adani Group, which won the bid to manage and operate the airport for 50 years, is likely to affect the Centre-State relations badly. The much-delayed decision came even after the State fought tooth and nail against the move to hand over the 88-year-old premier airport of the State to the AEL.  Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain the airport in the public sector and to run it on the lines of Cochin International Airport Ltd and Kannur International Airport Ltd. The State government had floated Thiruvananthapuram International Airport Ltd (TIAL) to support the claim and take over the airport. The government was also under the impression that the Adani Group, which is also involved in the development of the Vizhinjam international deepwater seaport, will not rub shoulders with the State as it had already missed the four-year deadline given as per a concession agreement to complete Phase I of the seaport. With the Centre not budging to the State’s request and the Adani Group all set to take over the premier airport, all eyes are on the next move of the LDF government and the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), which lost the bid to the Adani Group and the Airports Authority Employees Union (AAEU). The State will have to sign the State Support Agreement to handover the airport and the stance of the State in signing the State Support Agreement is crucial. The government will also back out from the acquisition of eight hectares of land needed from Vallakkadavu-Vayyamoola area for the proposed Rs. 600-crore integrated terminal on the city side. Official sources said the privatisation of the airport and the Centre denying the State request to run the airport will turn the Centre-State relations sour. To fight legally Though the State has not spelt out the future course of action to prevent the airport going to the private player, AAEU secretary S. Ajith Kumar said they had decided to proceed with the case filed in the High Court and challenge the decision. The AAI employees will also proceed on agitation against the move, Mr. Ajith kumar who is also convener of the Joint Forum of Unions and Associations, told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-state-ties-may-turn-turbulent-over-airport/article32399155.ece
20 August 2020||KOCHI,||‘COVID-19 cases may triple in Ernakulam in a month’||The number of COVID-19 positive cases in Ernakulam could nearly triple from the present total count of 3,643 cases from March onwards to a maximum of 10,575 cases cumulatively a month from now, according to a projection made by the district surveillance unit for COVID-19. The COVID-19 analysis report prepared by the surveillance unit with data till August 17 estimates that the cases could increase from the current 826 cases per week to an average of 1,575 to 1,725 cases per week in a month. Of these, the cases through contact and the number of healthcare workers turning positive per week are likely to double. With 16 healthcare workers turning positive weekly now, by next month, a minimum of 31 and a maximum of 63 workers could test positive every week. “Long working hours without a full PPE kit at non-COVID hospitals leave healthworkers exposed to patients who might be carrying the virus,” said Dr. Deepa K.H., district president, Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association. Decentralised system To deal with the increase in patient load, effective utilisation of a decentralised system of testing and first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) at the panchayat level with the cooperation of the local bodies would be crucial, she added. With a recovery rate of 64.10%, a total of 3,796 people are likely to be receiving treatment by around mid-September, a sharp increase from the current number of 1,572 people being treated in the district. With most patients likely to be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, the district’s telemedicine system will prove useful while monitoring infected people who are likely to remain in quarantine at home, Dr. Deepa said. Going by the report, the district has recorded 27 deaths attributed to the disease so far, and the most number of deaths have been of people aged between 61 and 70 years of age. The maximum number of positive cases, however, is within a younger age bracket of 21 to 30 years. Around 70% (2,567 people) of positive cases in the district so far have been through contact. The source of infection in 238 persons is unknown. “This figure is of people with an unknown source of infection at the time of reporting the case. Later, the source in a few cases might have been traced,” a member of the surveillance unit said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-cases-may-triple-in-ernakulam-in-a-month/article32399153.ece

20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Prashant Bhushan urges Supreme Court to defer sentence hearing||Advocate Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to defer the sentence hearing in a suo motu criminal contempt case in which he was convicted on August 14. The sentence hearing is scheduled before a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra for August 20. Mr. Bhushan, represented by advocate Kamini Jaiswal, said he intended to file a review petition against the August 14 judgment within the stipulated 30 days as provided under Order 47 of the Supreme Court Rules of 2013. First appeal He said his review petition, when filed, should be treated like a first appeal against conviction. He argued that a conviction by the Supreme Court in suo motu contempt proceedings had no avenue for appeal. Thus, a review filed against the conviction should be considered as the first appeal and heard accor-dingly. Otherwise, it would be gross injustice to not provide an occasion to examine the correctness of the findings in the August 14 order. “In criminal contempt proceedings, the Supreme Court functions like a trial court. It is also the last court. Section 19(1) (of the Contempt of Courts Act) gives a statutory right of appeal to a person found guilty of contempt by the High Court. The fact that there is no appeal against an order of the Supreme Court makes it doubly necessary that it takes the utmost precaution to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done,” he argued. Mr. Bhushan highlighted the need to appeal the conviction as “human judgment is not infallible”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prashant-bhushan-urges-supreme-court-to-defer-sentence-hearing/article32399034.ece
20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Cabinet approves leasing of 3 airports||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved leasing of three airports — Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthpuram — through public-private partnership (PPP) for a period of 50 years. At a press conference after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said: “The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is not giving these airports permanently to the private operator. After running them for 50 years, the private operator would be handing over the airports back to the AAI,” said the Minister.  AAI to get Rs. 1,070 crore The Minister said the AAI will receive Rs. 1,070 crore as an upfront amount from the private operator for leasing the airports at Jaipur, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and this fund will be used to develop airports in smaller cities. These three airports were among a total of six where Adani Enterprises Limited emerged as the highest bidder last year during the privatisation process initiated by the AAI. Private player While Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru were approved for handing over to the private player, the remaining three airports weren’t because of legal cases. Adani Enterprises Ltd. had earlier this year sought an extension of six months for taking over Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru airports citing uncertainty due to the pandemic. Extra window The extra window was extended by the AAI and it remains to be seen whether the private entity will be able to take over within the mandatory six months period of being awarded an airport.

20 August 2020||Krishnadas Rajagopal NEW DELHI,||SC confirms CBI probe into Sushant’s death||The Supreme Court on Wednesday approved the CBI investigation recommended by the Bihar government into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The court flexed its extraordinary constitutional powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to order that any future FIRs registered into the death, including by the Mumbai police, would be investigated by the Central agency. “Sushant Singh Rajput was a talented actor in the Mumbai film world and died well before his full potential could be realised. His family, friends and admirers are keenly awaiting the outcome of the investigation so that all the speculations floating around can be put to rest,” a single judge Bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy observed. The court upheld the validity of the FIR registered by the Bihar police on the complaint filed by Sushant’s father. At the same time, Justice Roy said, the Mumbai police had jurisdiction in the case owing to the fact that certain incidents, including the death, happened there. However, the court said the acrimony between the Bihar and Maharashtra police forces over the case was all too obvious.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-confirms-cbi-probe-into-sushants-death/article32398837.ece
20 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||SEC moots postal ballot, proxy voting||The State Election Commission (SEC) has proposed to make the postal ballot and proxy voting provision accessible to the electorate extensively during the elections to local self-government institutions (LSGIs) in November. It has written to the government to consider an Ordinance to amend the Kerala Panchayati Raj and Municipalities Act for the purpose. The SEC appears concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic could bring down the voter turnout and wanted to ensure that the contagion did not disenfranchise voters under treatment or in quarantine. There could be a surge in demand for postal ballots, if allowed, given the pandemic-impelled restrictions on physical contact. The SEC has proposed that the elections be held in phases and that the polling time be extended by at least by two hours to space out the voting process to prevent long lines in front of booths. State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran sent the proposal to the office of Minister for Local Self-Governments A.C. Moideen recently. Only after consultations An official attached to Mr. Moideen’s office said the government would decide on the proposals only after extensive consultations. The SEC’s suggestion to amend the law to alter the voting process has triggered a political debate in the State. The first indication of growing resistance to the move came from Congress leader K.C. Joseph, MLA. He said the SEC had opened the door for widespread electoral frauds. Booth capturing and bogus voting were not unheard of in Kerala. Often, a slender margin of votes decided victory or loss in local body polls. Mr. Joseph asked whether the SEC could ensure that postal ballots and proxy votes were cast honestly and without fear or favour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sec-moots-postal-ballot-proxy-voting/article32399158.ece

20 August 2020||Patna,||Vindicated: Nitish on CBI probe||Soon after the Supreme Court allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday told mediapersons, “The Supreme Court’s order proves that there is no political interference in this matter. Our stand has been vindicated. We have full faith now that justice will be done to the family of Sushant Singh Rajput.” Leaders of all political parties in Bihar also welconomed the SC’s decision.  The Chief Minister further said, “Since the beginning, everyone knows that whatever Bihar Police did was proper. Everyone knows how an IPS (Indian Police Service) officer of the State was treated there [in Mumbai]. The CBI will get all the help they need from Bihar Police in the case. Nyay ki jeet hui hai (the truth has won).” Mr. Kumar also said the decision of the Bihar government to hand over the case to the CBI had been “justified and legally proper, though some people wanted to give it a political colour”.  Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi also welcomed the decision. “We have been demanding since the beginning that the CBI should probe the case for justice to be delivered to Sushant Singh Rajput’s family. The Bihar government though had woken up to the case after 42 days, but we’ve been demanding it since the beginning. Now we hope for speedy probe and justice in the case,” said Opposition leader in the State Assembly and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. Rashtriya Lok Samata Party’s Madhav Anand and others too echoed the same. Family thanks CM Later, Sushant Singh Rajput’s family said in a statement: “We, Sushant’s family, thank our friends, well-wishers, media and millions of fans worldwide for their love for Sushant and support for us. We are particularly thankful to Shri Nitish Kumar, hon’ble chief minister, Bihar for setting the wheel of justice in motion.” Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on June 14, and his father K. K. Singh, later on July 25, had filed an FIR against actor Rhea Chakraborty and five others in Patna under various sections of the IPC, including abetment of suicide and cheating. Ms. Chakraborty had urged the Supreme Court to allow the case to be transferred to Mumbai. However, the Bihar police and the State government opposed her plea and recommended a CBI probe into the case. Meanwhile, in an answer to a question posed by journalists, Bihar Director General of Police (DGP), Gupteshwar Pandey said, “Rhea Chakraborty does not have the aukat (stature) to comment on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. What the Bihar Police did was correct and according to legal and Constitutional provisions.”  The SC order proves there is no political interference in this matter Nitish Kumar Bihar Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vindicated-nitish-on-cbi-probe/article32398785.ece
20 August 2020||New Delhi,||Centre set up PM CARES, indicates memo||The Centre has repeatedly insisted that the PM CARES fund is not answerable to citizens under the RTI Act, as it is not a public authority. However, on the same day the fund was announced in March, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) had made the case for PM CARES being a fund set up by the Central government. File notings accessed through RTI show that the MCA’s late night memo on March 28, clarifying that Indian companies’ contributions could be counted for their corporate social responsibility obligations, depended on the reasoning that the PM CARES fund was set up by the Central government. Otherwise, the thousands of crores immediately pledged by India’s biggest corporates from both the public and private sectors could not have been counted against their CSR obligations. Two months later, on May 26, the Companies Act was retrospectively amended, so that the validity of CSR donations was now no longer dependent on the fund being set up by the Centre. It was three days later, on May 29, that the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) first stated that the PM CARES Fund is not a public authority under the RTI Act, in a delayed response to an RTI request filed by law student Sri Harsha Kandukuri. Institutions established by the government are defined as public authorities under the RTI Act. The PM CARES fund was registered on March 27 as a public charitable trust, and announced through a press release issued by the PMO at 4.36 p.m. on Saturday, March 28. Donation pledges began to pour in instantly. At 9.52 p.m. that evening, Aparna Mudiam, a deputy director in the MCA’s CSR cell, drafted a circular clarifying that corporate contributions to PM CARES would be considered eligible CSR activity, and passed it up the chain of command. After a series of emails, Corporate Affairs Secretary Srinivas Injeti approved the circular for issuance at 11.29 p.m., according to records accessed through an RTI request filed by activist Anjali Bhardwaj. The circular cited Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013, which lists permissible CSR activity, including “contribution to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund or any other fund set up by the Central government or the State governments for socio-economic development and relief…” The file noting on the circular makes the Ministry’s reasoning clear. “Item no. (viii) of the Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013inter aliaprovides for contribution to any fund set up by the Central government for socio-economic development and relief. Contribution to PM CARES fund is therefore an eligible CSR activity,” it says. On May 27, however, the MCA amended Schedule VII, directly inserting the PM CARES fund into the list, so that there was no more need to depend on the fund being set up by the Central government. The amendment was applied retrospectively, from March 28. “If MCA was relying on the fact that PM CARES was a fund set up by the Central government, then how is the PMO repeatedly denying information under the RTI Act claiming that the fund is not a public authority?” asked Ms. Bhardwaj. “What was the need for the retrospective amendment?” Ms. Bhardwaj also questioned the Ministry’s rush to issue the circular late on March 28, Saturday night, with just two working days left until the end of the financial year. Data on the PM CARES website shows that Rs. 3,076 crore had been collected by March 31. RTIs filed by the Indian Express have also shown that a number of public sector companies donated to PM CARES using their unused CSR allocation for the 2019-20 financial year, which ended March 31.  The Hindu ’s queries to the MCA regarding the circular, and whether any company or government department had requested the clarification, were not answered. Ms. Bhardwaj filed RTI requests regarding the PM CARES fund with other government departments. The Law Ministry did not respond to a query on whether its comments were sought on the fund, while the Cabinet Secretariat said “there was no agenda item in any Cabinet meeting specifically related to the creation of the PM Cares Fund.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-set-up-pm-cares-indicates-memo/article32398802.ece
20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||India offers vaccine to Bangladesh on priority||Bangladesh will receive COVID-19 vaccine from India on a priority basis, a top diplomat of Dhaka said on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh Masud Bin Momen raised some of the contentious issues, such as the recent spurt in border killings and condition of the detained Tablighi Jamaat members from the country, with the visiting Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla in Dhaka and the two sides agreed on an early meeting of the India-Bangladesh Consultative Committee. “The vaccine will not be limited to India. We have been assured that India will provide the COVID-19 vaccine to us on a priority basis and the pharmaceutical companies of our country will be able to collaborate on this,” Mr. Bin Momen told presspersons about the vaccine from India’s Serum Institute. The COVID-19 related discussion between the two sides comes weeks after the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC) allowed China to carry out the Phase III human trial of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. China had also sent a medical team to assess the pandemic preparation of Bangladesh during the first week of June. During the talks, Mr. Bin Momen raised the issue of increase in the killings of Bangladesh nationals along the border by India’s BSF. “I drew his attention on this undesirable irritant and urged for stopping these killings altogether,” said Mr. Bin Momen. A highly placed source said Ms. Hasina raised the issue of Rohingya refugees in the Chittagong hills and urged India’s support for “early and safe repatriation” of the 1.2 million Rohingya citizens of Myanmar. Bangladesh has asked India to use its non-permanent membership at the UN Security Council during 2021 to increase pressure on Myanmar for the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees. Mr. Shringla also discussed the proposal for a travel bubble for flights with Bangladesh that will allow smooth movement for business, official and medical personnel. The source also informed that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary discussed security issues of mutual interest. Mr. Shringla’s visit, however, will not include a meeting with Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen who is away in his parliamentary constituency in Sylhet. Speaking to reporters in Sylhet, the Minister said there was no sign of fracture in India-Bangladesh ties. Mr. Momen had said last week that like China, India too should provide tariff-free facility for exports from Bangladesh. The visit by Mr. Shringla is being viewed as extraordinary because of the pandemic scenario and has been interpreted as India’s attempt to prevent growing Chinese influence in Bangladesh. Teesta project The Sheikh Hasina government has recently reached an agreement with China over building of a $1 billion irrigation project at the Teesta which will benefit the country’s farmers in the Rangpur region during the lean seasons. Construction of the project will effectively neutralise the Teesta water negotiations with India. Over the last few months, allegations were levelled against Ms. Hasina’s government about slow pace for sanctioning projects that are supported by India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-offers-vaccine-to-bangladesh-on-priority/article32398816.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||‘India is capable of getting back to 7% growth’||While healthcare professionals and scientists scramble to cope with the human toll of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers worldwide and in India are racing to stabilise their economies and mitigate the damage that has already been inflicted upon livelihoods, especially of the poorer sections. Ranil Salgado , India Mission Chief at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), discussed the big questions on macroeconomic policy, growth dynamics and poverty alleviation that the country faces. Edited excerpts:  How would you characterise the fall in growth in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Globally, this is the impact of COVID-19, the lockdowns and the follow-on effects included a supply-side hit but also [an impact on] consumers and corporations that could not work. As a result, spending falls. India implemented a very strict lockdown, probably one of the strictest lockdowns. We had already revised down India’s growth in April 2020, not as much as globally because we thought the pre-emptive lockdown would achieve better results than [what we] ended up [with]. Unfortunately, India has not been able to gain full control of the COVID-19 situation. So, when we looked at the numbers again in early June 2020, we revised down India just as many other countries were revised down. The next time we do a forecast will be for the October 2020 World Economic Outlook. We will wait until we see the first quarter fiscal year GDP before making a forecast. What macroeconomic strategy could India follow to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its poorest? In India, decisions regarding fiscal expenditure or stimulus are more difficult, given its initial condition of generally high level of government or public debt. We think a large part of this stimulus should be focused on vulnerable households. Especially if the impact of the pandemic continues, we have been emphasising that the fiscal space that India has needs to be used to support vulnerable households. This includes in-kind transfers and food transfers that have worked quite well, the support for rural employment but also efforts to support urban employment. Do you think this is the right time to push forward on the conversation about the Universal Basic Income? That is a difficult question in India, again because of the fiscal space issue. There have been proposals, including by the previous Chief Economic Advisor, about a more limited form of that. There is scope for something like that — a limited form, I would not call it universal. But it has to be combined, given the fiscal issues, with more extensive subsidy reforms. You essentially end up taking some of that money that goes into subsidies and then better targeting it toward more vulnerable and poorer households. That is the way to reconcile providing that income support while maintaining a sustainable fiscal path. Given the sharp drop in aggregate demand, do you think there is any potential for deficit monetisation by the RBI? It is a very unusual circumstance and a few countries and emerging markets have been doing that recently, including Indonesia for example. But we still think for India that should be a last resort. So far, partly because of the shortfall in demand, there seems to be plenty of savings available for the government to tap into right now. So far, the government has not had to do this. Once the COVID-19 crisis has passed, India has to get back to its long-term fiscal consolidation strategy. That could also potentially ease concerns in markets and keep rates relatively low. That could help avoid any need for consideration of monetisation by the RBI. What structural reforms are necessary to see India through in the longer term, given that the economy was already on a sticky wicket before the coronavirus struck? A few years back there had been substantial steps taken, whether it be the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), forming a national GST, steps to improve businesses which are ongoing, as evident in the World Bank ease of doing business indicators, and issues relating to FDI. These are areas where progress has been made with reforms. Reforms are still needed in those areas and some in other areas, [including] a step-up in infrastructure spending, [and] further progress on labour market reforms and land reforms. Looking at the banking and liquidity crisis that had hit earlier, what would be a fresh, post-COVID-19 perspective on reforms needed there? I refer back to the previous Chief Economic Advisor and his four ‘R’s. Three of the four R’s were done fairly well, that is Recognising stressed assets, putting together the Resolution framework or the IBC, and the Recapitalisation by the government of public sector banks. The recapitalisation of public sector banks, while important, also means that the government will own more of these banks again. That has to eventually be unwound, somewhat. The fourth step, where we see less progress, is the reform of governance issues — and I would also extend this to private sector banks. By this I mean how banks manage operationally and how banks manage risk. That is a key area where progress needs to be made afterwards. If there is one silver lining for India on the economic front, how would you characterise it? When you think of India about two years ago, the country was averaging 7+% growth, over the previous decade. We think India can get back toward that, even we are not sure how quickly it will. Partly, that reflects demographics — India has a relatively young population. Second, India has large potential for catch-up, [in terms of] productivity levels, through structural reforms and infrastructure investment.   There is a potential for catch-up through structural reforms and infrastructure investment||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-is-capable-of-getting-back-to-7-growth/article32398818.ece
20 August 2020||New Delhi,||Many able persons in Cong.: Priyanka||Rahul Gandhi will always be her leader but there are plenty of good people to lead the party, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has said in an interview that is a part of a new book on next generation of political leaders. Ms. Vadra said “nobody had fought Modi [Prime Minister] like my brother” but she was willing to endorse his earlier stand of a non-Gandhi leading the party and didn’t see any difficulty to work in such an arrangement. The book, India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next generation of Political Leaders, written by U.S. -based academics Pradeep Chibber and Harsh Shah, has interviews of young leaders from across the political spectrum: from Union Minister Smriti Irani to Aaditya Thackeray, Asaduddin Owaisi to Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jignesh Mevani to Sachin Pilot The interviews have been done over a period. Congress functionaries claimed that the interviews with Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra were done last year, a couple of months after the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Rahul’s explanation Asked about his decision to quit as Congress chief, Mr. Gandhi said he did so to instil a culture of accountability in the party Mr. Gandhi insisted that he didn’t require the post to strengthen the Congress or to take on the BJP. Extensive interview Ms. Vadra, in her most extensive interview, talked about her growing up years, entry into politics, the impact of allegations against her family on her children and her willingness to lead the party. “Firstly, I would like to say that, to me, my brother is my leader and he will always be. Secondly, I see hundreds of people in U.P. and in different parts of the country who are very well equipped to fight the BJP. There are young and good enough leaders. I cannot tell the future, I do not know what is going to happen in the future. But, I think there are plenty of people who are capable to lead the party as well,” she said in response to a question if she was ready to lead the Congress. “As my brother said very clearly in his resignation letter post the elections that he thinks that he should take responsibility for the last election. And perhaps not in the letter but elsewhere, he said that none of us should be the president of the party and I am in full agreement with him. I think that the the party should find its own path also,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-able-persons-in-cong-priyanka/article32398810.ece
20 August 2020||Mumbai,||Bollywood stars welcome verdict, say let CBI do its job||Bollywood personalities on Wednesday took to social media to laud the Supreme Court’s (SC) decision to uphold the transfer of Patna Police’s FIR in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case to the CBI. Actor Akshay Kumar wrote, “SC directs CBI to investigate Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. May the truth always prevail. #Prayers.” Kriti Sanon, Sushant’s close friend and his co-star in the film Raabta , said the last two months had been “extremely restless”, and urged people to stop speculating about the cause of Sushant’s death. “So many versions, facts and opinions floating, except the whole truth. Supreme Court’s order for CBI investigation of Sushant’s case is a ray of hope that the truth will finally shine. Let’s all have faith, stop speculating and let the CBI do their work now!” Ms. Sanon said on Instagram. Ankita Lokhande, the actor’s former partner and co-star, tweeted that the SC order was the “first step” towards justice for Sushant. “Justice is the truth in action. Truth wins .... #1stStepToSSRJustice,” she wrote. Parineeti Chopra, who had also worked with the actor in a 2013 film, said, “This is a positive step. Please let’s respect this moment, and let the CBI do their work now! Please let’s stop speculating and coming to conclusions on our own.” Other artistes, including Rakul Preet Singh, Sharad Kelkar and Tisca Chopra, welcomed the SC order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bollywood-stars-welcome-verdict-say-let-cbi-do-its-job/article32398787.ece
20 August 2020||mangaluru,||Trial run of RoRo service conducted||Southern Railway (SR), in collaboration with Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., (KRCL), successfully conducted a trial run of a “Roll On Roll Off” (RoRo) service for trucks between Surathkal in Karnataka and Kozhikode in Kerala on Wednesday. SR had sought extension of KRCL’s existing RoRo service between Kolad, off Mumbai, and Surathkal to destinations in Kerala. The trial run was conducted to examine the operational feasibility of the service wherein trucks are taken on BRN wagons. Palakkad Divisional Railway Manager Pratap Singh Shami told The Hindu the intention was to take the RoRo service till Thiruvananthapuram. However a road overbridge just before Shoranur Junction could be an obstruction. “We will attempt to pass beneath the RoB today and if it is not successful, the services will run till West Hill (Kozhikode),” he said. KRCL has said it was positive to run the services as demanded by SR. Beginnings KRCL introduced the service between Kolad and Verna, off Madgaon in Goa (417 km), on January 26, 1999 and subsequently extended it till Surathkal(721 km) from June 15, 2004. Starting with one rake, the services were augmented with five rakes and at present daily services were operated based on demand. The service has been hailed as a win-win situation for the railways as well as truck operators. On the one hand, it saves considerable amount of fuel used by trucks and also reduces road accident risks and on the other, offers regular income to the Railways. Up to 50 trucks were transported at a time under this arrangement. sThe BRN wagons were suitably modified to carry the trucks ensuring that the consignment conforms to the maximum moving dimensions of the rake for safe passage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trial-run-of-roro-service-between-surathkal-and-kozhikode-successful/article32398919.ece
20 August 2020||Mumbai,||Satyamev Jayate, says Parth Pawar||Days after creating a flutter over his letters contradicting the party line, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s son, Parth Pawar, raised eyebrows again with his reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision handing over the investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the CBI on Wednesday. Mr. Parth on Wednesday tweeted ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (truth alone triumphs), after the court announced its verdict. Mr. Parth, who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from the Maval constituency, had demanded a CBI investigation in the case and had also written to State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, when asked about his grandnephew’s demand, had said, “He is immature. There is no value to what he says. I have 100% trust on Maharashtra and Mumbai police. But if anyone wants to make a demand then nobody has any objection.” The senior politician’s snub to the aspiring young leader had raised concerns that all is not well within the Pawar family. A day later, there was a meeting between Mr. Parth and other members of the Pawar family, and since then none of them have made any comment on the issue. The incident, however, had raised questions over the stability of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The snub to the young leader was also seen as a warning to Ajit Pawar, whose earlier bid to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party had misfired.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/satyamev-jayate-says-parth-pawar/article32398790.ece
20 August 2020||Mumbai,||Maharashtra promises cooperation||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday welcomed the Supreme Court decision to transfer the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and promised cooperation from the State. State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said, “We welcome the Supreme Court judgment of transferring the probe to the CBI and will surely cooperate with the probe team.” Mr. Deshmukh said the top court in its judgment mentioned that the investigation carried out by the Mumbai police had no wrongdoing. “It is clear that investigation from the police was not flawed,” he said.  The Minister, however, added that the judgment also shows the need for experts in the Constitution and judiciary to initiate a discourse on the federal structure drawn in the Constitution. The Mumbai police, in its affidavit in the Supreme Court, had highlighted the federal structure and argued that since the incidents related to the death of the actor had taken place in Mumbai, it was the prerogative of the local police to conduct the probe, and not of the Bihar Police to register an FIR. ‘Protecting people’ The BJP welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision, but hit out at the ruling alliance in the State. Taking an aggressive stance, Ashish Shelar, BJP MLA and former president of the party’s Mumbai unit, said the verdict proved that the Mumbai Police protected people and hid facts while it was investigating the case. He said, “The State government forced the Mumbai police to hide facts. At least now, it should cooperate with the CBI in its investigation. Otherwise, it will have to face the people’s anger.” Mr. Shelar said, “Who did not let the Mumbai Police speak? While the police are bound by the law, who stopped the Mumbai Police in this case? Will the Maharashtra government take the responsibility for the hide and seek played by the Mumbai Police?” BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam said the SC, in its order, did not give any importance to the submission made by the State government in the case. “The State government has failed in its responsibility. Now the truth will come out,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-promises-cooperation/article32398792.ece

The Navy said in a statement that the conference assumed greater significance in the backdrop of recent events on the northern borders, coupled with the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19 and would provide the higher naval leadership a forum to discuss conduct of operations, sustenance and maintenance of assets and procurement issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-prepared-to-meet-any-challenge-rajnath/article32398814.ece
20 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka moves High Court to recover damages from rioters||The State government on Wednesday moved the High Court of Karnataka seeking initiation of a suo motu case to appoint a claims commissioner to assess damages caused to properties and injuries to persons during violence at D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli on August 11 night, and to investigate the liabilities and determine compensation in terms of the Supreme Court’s guidelines. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shriniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi said it would take up the petition for hearing on Thursday. This is the first time the State government has moved the HC invoking the Supreme Court’s 2009 guidelines for dealing with the instances of mass destruction of public and private properties and to recover damages by from persons responsible for causing the damages. The petition was filed based on the recommendation made on August 17 by the city Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. The SC had issued guidelines to appointment a claims commissioner through the respective High Courts for assessing damages caused not only to public and private properties but also damages causing injury or death to a person or persons; and cost of action by the authorities and the police for preventive and other actions. Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi mentioned the petition before the Bench while citing the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court and an order passed by the High Court in February this year appointing claims commissioners to assess damages caused during calls for bandhs and agitations in 2018 in relation to the Mahadayi water dispute, and against arrest of the former Minister D.K. Shivakumar last year. K.V. Jagadish, Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Office of the DG&IGP, has represented the government in the petition, filed through Additional Government Advocate Vikram Huilgol. Damages In the petition, the government pointed that 33 government vehicles and 109 private vehicles were either completely burnt and destroyed or extensively damaged. In additional to the damages caused to the buildings of the D.J. Halli and the K.G. police stations, and the residence of Pulakeshinagar MLA R. Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy, damages were also caused to eight other buildings during acts of vandalism and arson, the government said in the petition. A self-loading rifle, stun grenades, tear gas gun, tear gas shells, wood piercing shells, and rubber bullets were among the arms and ammunition destroyed by the violent mob, the government said while pointing out that walkie-talkie, body protectors, and wireless sets were among other properties of the government either destroyed or looted by the mob. Around 910 grams of gold, 750 grams of silver, liquor worth around Rs. 15 lakh, and electronic and electrical goods were among the private properties either destroyed or looted, the petition stated while pointing out that extent of destruction and estimation of value of the properties are still under progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-moves-high-court-to-recover-damages-from-rioters/article32398765.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Dr. Reddy’s launches Avigan tablets, priced at Rs. 99 each||Pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories on Wednesday launched Japanese firm Fujifilm Toyama Chemical’s anti-viral drug Avigan (Favipiravir) that has been approved for use in treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in India, at Rs. 99 per tablet. It is the original, innovator’s product with a shelf life of two years, CEO-Branded Markets (India and Emerging Markets) M.V. Ramana said, seeking to justify the price of the imported drug from Japan. Compared to prices of Avigan in some countries, it still is less, he said. Over the past four months, many drugmakers in the country have rolled out generic versions of Favipiravir and priced them – one even revised downwards – from Rs. 33 to Rs. 75 a tablet. With Dr. Reddy’s expecting to begin manufacturing Avigan in India, once Fujifilm transfers the technology and regulatory approvals for APIs and formulations are in place in about three months, the price might undergo a change. Domestic manufacturing is likely to deliver cost advantages that the company will consider passing on to the customers, he told a virtual media conference, which was also addressed by co-chairman and MD, G.V.Prasad and Global Head of PSAI Deepak Sapra. The launch follows a licensing agreement between Fujifilm, Dr. Reddy’s and Dubai-based Global Response Aid (GRA) for development, manufacture and sale of Avigan 200mg tablets in all countries except Japan, China and Russia. Several clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety of Favipiravir were under way globally. It will also seek regulatory approvals in many countries, such as that received from Drugs Controller General of India, for Avigan. The company has launched the product in a pack of 122 tablets and is offering a free home delivery service in 42 cities across the country. It is also planning to develop a higher (400 mg) strength tablet. To queries, senior executives said the company will launch a generic of Remdesivir, the investigational drug of Gilead Sciences for COVID in September first week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dr-reddys-launches-avigan-tablets-priced-at-rs-99-each/article32399101.ece
20 August 2020||New Delhi,||‘Lockdown hit 9.2 lakh women in need of abortion services’||A staggering 90% or 9.2 lakh women in India estimated to require abortion services could not access them between January and June because of the stringent COVID-19 lockdown. They are among the 13 lakh women who couldn’t get any kind of sexual and reproductive health services, many of whom were impeded because of domestic abuse, according to a report launched by Marie Stopes International on Wednesday. The inability to access sexual and reproductive health services in India could lead to as many as 10 lakh unsafe abortions, 6.5 lakh unintended pregnancies and 2,600 maternal deaths in the country. India accounts for 75% of the total disruption in family planning and safe abortion care services across 36 countries served by Marie Stopes International because of the lockdown, said the report. The study also showed that there were 73,500 fewer adolescents across 36 countries who accessed reproductive health services, though their overall proportion at 15% of total clients remained consistent. The MSI report warned that as the lockdown-related restrictions are eased “the need for sexual and reproductive health services will only increase especially for safe abortion and post abortion care as there is likely to be an increase in need for second trimester abortions following the lockdown”. The survey also showed that one in 10 women surveyed in India reported needing domestic abuse services during the pandemic and a fifth of respondents seeking an abortion service reported not being able to attend a face to face appointment for fear of leaving their home due to domestic abuse. The survey recorded responses of 1,000 women aged 16-50 in India on their experiences and awareness of sexual and reproductive healthcare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lockdown-hit-92-lakh-women-in-need-of-abortion-services/article32398796.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||3 SC courtrooms to be set for hearings||The Supreme Court has informed that three of its bigger courtrooms are being prepared for hosting physical hearing of cases on a trial basis. The courtrooms are being refurbished in compliance with physical distancing norms and medical advice. They would be ready in a week. The hearings would be held in a limited number of cases after 10 days. Prior written consent to participate would be taken from the parties. The information came in a letter from the Registry addressed to senior advocate Dushyant Dave, the Supreme Court Bar Association president. Some of the courtrooms, as viewed through TV screens while watching virtual court hearings, have already been fitted with glass partitions, dividing the judges from the rest of the courtroom. A seven-judge committee of the Supreme Court, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, had “in-principle” recommended the beginning of physical court hearings in two or three courtrooms on a trial basis. This was after a meeting held among the committee, Mr. Dave, senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, the chairman of the Bar Council of India and advocate Shivaji Jadhav, who is the president of the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association. Mr. Mishra had informed The Hindu that the Bar leaders had conveyed the anguish of lawyers, many whom are in dire straits, financially and professionally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-sc-courtrooms-to-be-set-for-hearings/article32398797.ece
20 August 2020||Srinagar,||Militant killed in Shopian operation||Security forces killed a militant in an ongoing counter-insurgency operation in south Kashmir’s Shopian on Wednesday. The Army paid tributes to two soldiers who engaged Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) ‘commanders’ in a gunfight in Baramulla. An official said the unidentified militant was killed during a joint operation of the J&K police, the Army’s 44 Rashtriya Rifles and the CRPF in Molu Chitragam area of Shopian district. “A militant was killed when the search team came under fire. The operation is on,” the police said. Lt. Gen. B.S. Raju, Chinar Corps Commander, and DGP Dilbag Singh were among the officials who paid tributes to the two soldiers, killed in the two-day long encounter on Tuesday. An Army spokesman said Grenadiers Ravi Kumar Singh and Prashant Singh were leading the search team in pursuit of terrorists, who had opened indiscriminate fire on a joint checkpoint of the CRPF and the J&K police at Kreeri on August 17. “The soldiers were the first to come into contact with the terrorists during the pursuit. In the ensuing firefight, three terrorists were eliminated. However, the two soldiers sustained gunshot wounds. Despite being grievously injured, they continued to fight,” the spokesman said. Two top LeT ‘commanders’ were among the slain militants.  The Army also paid tributes to Havildar Rajendra Singh, 39, who was died in a severe snow blizzard on January 8 in the Rampur Sector along the Line of Control in north Kashmir. “The rescue teams were unable to reach the spot which had got buried under snow,” the spokesman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/militant-killed-in-shopian-operation/article32398819.ece
20 August 2020||Kochi,||Police require only tower details of COVID patients, Kerala tells HC||The government on Wednesday informed a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court that to find out the location of COVID-19 patients, the police require only the tower details from where the calls are made and received and not more than that. Erased The government submitted that the call records received to that extent were erased after 14 days of the quarantine period. The submissions were made by Additional Advocate General K.K. Ravindranath when a public interest litigation by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala challenging a circular by State Police Chief (SPC) Loknath Behera on collection of call data records (CDR) of COVID-19 positive persons came up before the Bench. T. Asaf Ali, counsel for Mr. Chennithala, submitted that the police were collecting CDRs of COVID patients and those in quarantine. Privacy He contended that under the guise of preventing the spread of the pandemic, the police could collect all details of call records of anybody, infringing the right of privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. This was an illegal expansion of police powers, he added. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P.Chaly, while directing the government to file a statement in response to the petition, observed that the circular had been issued on a specific objective of COVID-19 unlock 3.0. Prima facie all clauses in the circular deal only with COVID-19, its spread, and prevention. Mr. Chennithala sought to quash the State Police Chief’s circular. Further hearing The court posted the petition to August 21 for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-require-only-tower-details-of-covid-patients-kerala-tells-hc/article32398767.ece
20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Over 80% of students depend on mobiles for learning: NCERT||School education in the time of COVID-19 is heavily dependent on mobile phones, with 80-90% of older students in Central government schools saying they use mobiles rather than laptops to access digital schooling during the pandemic, according to an official sample survey. Almost 30% said absent or intermittent electricity connections hindered their learning, and half the students said they did not even have access to their textbooks. The survey was conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), using a sample of 18,188 students from Classes 8-12 from Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samitis and schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. More than 16,000 parents, teachers and principals also took part. In KVs, 84% of students used mobiles, while 19% used laptops for learning, similar to the ratio in CBSE schools. In the Navodaya Vidyalayas, which are meant for gifted students from rural areas, less than 10% of learners used laptops, while 88% were dependent on mobile phones. Less than 6% used TV or radio. Of course, the situation is likely to be far grimmer at state-funded schools and the poorer private schools where the majority of students study. Only four States have completed mapping of the devices available to students — smartphone, basic mobile, radio, TV, personal or community computer — according to the Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines released by the Education Ministry on Wednesday.   The Centre directed States to develop detailed plans to reach every child and ensure continuous learning for the whole academic session, indicating that universal school reopening may not be on the cards in the immediate future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-80-of-students-depend-on-mobiles-for-learning-ncert/article32398800.ece
20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ex-judge Kurian calls for intra-court appeal||Former Supreme Court judge, Justice Kurian Joseph, said the court should decide whether a person convicted in a suo motu contempt case should be granted an intra-court appeal as a safeguard “to avoid even the remotest possibility of miscarriage of justice”. Justice Kurian said persons convicted in ordinary criminal matters got a second chance in the form of an appeal. “So, why is a person convicted by the Supreme Court in suo motu contempt proceedings not entitled to another opportunity by way of an appeal?.” “Under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, an intra-court appeal is provided where the order is passed by the single Judge of the High Court and in case it is by the Division Bench, appeal lies to the Supreme Court of India,” he said in a statement. Civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan was recently convicted in a suo motu contempt proceedings by a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra for his tweets. The case was heard via the virtual court system. ‘Elaborate hearing’ “Important cases like these need to be heard elaborately in a physical hearing where only there is scope for a broader discussion and wider participation”, Justice Kurian pointed out. He said suo motu contempt proceedings, which involved substantial questions of law and fundamental rights, should be heard by a Constitution Bench. Article 145 (3) of the Constitution mandated that there should be a quorum of minimum five judges for deciding any case involving substantial questions of law. It was decided by the full court of the Supreme Court to set up a seven-judge Bench to hear the contempt case against former Madras High Court judge, C.S. Karnan. “The present contempt cases are not cases involving just one or two individuals; but larger issues pertaining to the concept and jurisprudence of the country regarding justice itself”, Justice Kurian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-judge-kurian-calls-for-intra-court-appeal/article32398808.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||KCR initiates preparations for Apex Council meeting||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will write a letter to the Centre expressing his preparedness to attend the meeting of Apex Council on water disputes with Andhra Pradesh on August 25. The letter will contain agenda items that the State government wants in the virtual meeting to be chaired by Union Water Resources Minister and with himself and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy as members. A release later said Mr. Rao welcomed the meeting on August 25 and it will be used as a platform to clear the doubts of the Centre and AP governments. He will also raise the State's objections in utilisation of river water by the neighbouring State. He asked officials to gather information about all the doubts raised by Centre and AP government on projects taken up in Telangana. In fact, Telangana did not take up any new projects as all of them were conceived in erstwhile Andha Pradesh. Some of them were only redesigned to meet the requirements of the new State. The same will be conveyed at the meeting with evidence. He wanted them to go into details as when were the projects sanctioned? How much money was allotted to them? How much was actually spent by the time Telangana was formed? How much land was acquired? How much water was allocated to the projects? . Mr. Rao expressed his resolve to present a data-based picture at the council meeting about the grounding of projects in Telangana in tune with the award of Bachawat tribunal on construction and water utilisation. He would also raise a strong objection to the expansion in the carrying capacity of the canal from Pothireddypadu head regulator and the implementation of Rayalaseema lift irrigation project by AP. He would confront AP government on going ahead with projects even without permissions and water allocation. The AP government drew water from Krishna and Godavari rivers in violation of the award by tribunal. He wanted officials to gather documents on these aspects in support of his argument. The objections raised by Centre and AP government on projects in Telangana were meaningless. The injustice to Telangana on river water utilisation was highlighted on several occasions in the past. The letter that he would write will seek these issues be be addressed at least this time by including them in the agenda for the meeting, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kcr-initiates-preparations-for-apex-council-meeting/article32399125.ece
20 August 2020||GUWAHATI,||Congress, AIUDF pre-poll alliance likely in Assam||The Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), led by perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal, have indicated they may form an alliance ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections in Assam. The two parties have also appealed to other “like-minded” entities to take on the BJP together. Core committee meet Former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president Ripun Bora had after the party’s core committee meeting on Tuesday said a pre-poll alliance with “anti-BJP parties including the AIUDF” was on the cards. The Congress is also not averse to having the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), one of the BJP’s two regional partners in alliance government, back on board. The BPF had ruled Assam with the Congress before switching over to the BJP but there have been fissures in its ties with the latter of late. ‘Doors open’ “We have opened our doors for all the parties, including the AIUDF, who are opposed to the BJP,” Mr. Bora said, adding that the Congress would lead the proposed alliance. Mr. Ajmal did not rule out the possibility of any such alliance but said it would have to be based on the principles of democracy where each constituent would have an equal say. AIUDF general secretary Aminul Islam said there have been discussions with the Congress for a possible pre-poll alliance. “We appeal to all other like-minded parties to come forward against the BJP,” he said on Wednesday. The Congress has 23 MLAs in the 126-member Assembly while the AIUDF has 14. The BJP leads the table with 60 legislators in the ruling alliance followed by the Asom Gana Parishad with 14 and BPF with 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-aiudf-pre-poll-alliance-likely-in-assam/article32399039.ece

20 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Had trouble with a few local leaders, says MLA||Pulakeshinagar MLA R. Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy recorded his statement in relation to the D.J. Halli violence, in which his house was set afire, with the Central Crime Branch on Wednesday. He is learnt to have named a few local leaders from two parties as having trouble with him, but stopped short of naming them as suspects behind the violence at his residence, sources said. This comes a day after two Congress councillors from his Assembly constituency — Sampath Raj and Abdul Raqeeb Zakir — were questioned. The councillors are expected to be questioned again shortly. Police sources said that the MLA was asked about the political situation in his constituency, whether he had any rivalries and also his relationship with his nephew P. Naveen Kumar, whose social media post triggered the riots. The police investigating the violence said the entire sequence of events — from the time a large crowd was organised outside D.J. Halli police station, which later turned violent — has more or less now been established. What has remained intriguing is the mob outside the MLA’s home. “We have recovered several WhatsApp messages from the accused, which are appeals to people from the community to gather outside the police station to demand the arrest of Naveen Kumar. But we are yet to find the answer on who organised the crowd outside the MLA’s family home,” said a senior police official. Senior police officials said they suspect some forces may have misused the situation at the D.J. Halli police station and decided to target the MLA. The mob at the police station and the MLA’s house gathered simultaneously. Based on mobile tower locations, the police have arrested a few individuals who were involved in the violence at the MLA’s house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/had-trouble-with-a-few-local-leaders-says-mla/article32398762.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||SC confirms CBI probe into Sushant’s death||However, the court said the acrimony between the Bihar and Maharashtra police forces over the case was all too obvious. It noted that the furious trading of allegations between the two governments would “only render truth a casualty and justice a victim” in the case. Their slanging matches had brought the legitimacy of the investigation “under a cloud”. Further mud-slinging would misdirect investigation, lead to more finger-pointing, weave new conspiracy theories besides triggering speculative public discourse in the media. “Political interference against both States is alleged. This has the potential of discrediting the investigation. The legal process must be focused upon revelation of the correct facts through credible and legally acceptable investigation. It must be determined whether the unnatural death was the result of some criminal acts,” the court reasoned. It said a “fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour”. It is the least that could be done for a man who has lost his only son, Justice Roy wrote in the 35-page judgment. The judgment explained why the court had insisted on naming the premier investigating agency now itself. Justice Roy said Maharashtra, having jurisdiction over the case, could either transfer its case to the CBI or launch a full-fledged investigation. The latter would clash with the ongoing CBI probe on the basis of the Bihar FIR. To avoid this scenario, the court used its Article 142 powers to divert all or any future FIRs in the case to the CBI. ‘Premature’ argument The judgment further dismissed as “premature” an argument by Maharashtra that the Bihar government’s investigation was a “parallel” one. Justice Roy pointed out that the Mumbai police were yet to register an FIR. The court said the Bihar police did have jurisdiction for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Sushant’s father tried to reach him on the phone from Patna. Secondly, allegations of misappropriation and criminal breach of trust in the case were linked to Patna. Finally, the consequence of Sushant’s death was suffered in Patna. The court held that the Patna police were also under no obligation to transfer the case to Mumbai. The judgment came on a plea by actor Rhea Chakraborty to transfer the Bihar FIR against her and her family to Mumbai. To this, Justice Roy responded that Ms. Chakraborty herself had made it clear that she would not mind if the Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe by using its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-confirms-cbi-probe-into-sushants-death/article32398777.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Harley-Davidson may exit India||If the company, which saw U.S. President Donald Trump passionately lobby India for lower tariffs on its two-wheelers, does indeed exit, it would mark the second departure of an American automaker, after General Motors wound up its domestic operations and sold its Gujarat plant in 2017. The company declined to comment on its immediate plans for India and an external spokesman said it “does not comment on speculation”. The motorcycle maker is expected to continue to run a skeletal operation to provide after sales support for the motorcycles already on the road in the country, to support its dealers and likely sell fully built imported bikes, the person said. Harley-Davidson India sold only about 100 bikes between April-June 2020, industry officials said, making India one of its worst-performing international markets. As recently as in July 2018, the company had shared its plans to tap a growing middle class by introducing “a 250-500cc motorcycle within 2 years in India”. To offload unsold inventory, the company recently offered heavy discounts in the range of Rs. 65,000 to Rs. 77,000 on two of its models.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/harley-davidson-may-exit-india/article32398778.ece

Candidates from the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes would be given a relaxation in the age limit as per the government’s policy, it noted. The government sanctioned Rs. 1,517.57 crore for the NRA for a period of three years. The CET would be held separately for three levels — graduate, 12th pass and 10th pass — for the non-technical posts of the three agencies. “Based on the screening done at the CET score level, final selection for recruitment shall be made through separate specialised Tiers (II, III etc) of examinations, which shall be conducted by the respective recruitment agencies. The curriculum for this test would be common as would be the standard,” the statement said. In 12 languages Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension Jitendra Singh said the exam would be conducted in 12 languages to begin with and the attempt would be to expand it further to all languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. He added that though the test score would be used for Central government recruitment for now, it could be used by State governments and even the private sector in the future. “Candidates would have the facility of registering on a common portal and give a choice of centres. Based on availability, they would be allotted centres. The ultimate aim is to reach a stage wherein candidates can schedule their own tests at centres of their choice”, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-to-set-up-national-recruitment-agency/article32398780.ece
20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Bhushan urges SC to defer sentence hearing||Advocate Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to defer the sentence hearing in a suo motu criminal contempt case in which he was convicted on August 14. The sentence hearing is scheduled before a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra on August 20. Mr. Bhushan, represented by advocate Kamini Jaiswal, said he intended to file a review petition against the August 14 judgment within the stipulated 30 days time as provided under Order 47 of the Supreme Court Rules of 2013. First appeal He said his review petition, when filed, should be treated like a first appeal against conviction. He argued that a conviction by the Supreme Court in suo motu contempt proceedings had no avenue for appeal. Thus, a review filed against the conviction should be considered as the first appeal and heard accordingly. Otherwise, it would be gross injustice to not provide an occasion to examine the correctness of the findings in the August 14 judgment. “In criminal contempt proceedings, the Supreme Court functions like a trial court. It is also the last court. Section 19(1) (of the Contempt of Courts Act) gives a statutory right of appeal to a person found guilty of contempt by the High Court. The fact that there is no appeal against an order of the Supreme Court makes it doubly necessary that it takes the utmost precaution to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done,” he argued. Mr. Bhushan highlighted the need to appeal the conviction as “human judgment is not infallible”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhushan-urges-sc-to-defer-sentence-hearing/article32398794.ece

The TSGenco has taken up hydel generation at the dam site . The authorities of Nagarjunasagar dam assessed on Wednesday that spillway discharge of flood could happen either on August 22 or 23. Last year, they were lifted on August 12.However, the constant increase in flood to Srisailam from Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers and the release of flood from there through the spillway coupled with the CWC forecast of more heavy rains in the Central Maharashtra, the catchment area of Krishna and many of its tributaries, for the next four-five days have made them revise the assessment by the evening. The inflows into Srisailam are expected to cross 4 lakh cusecs.“We have another 50 tmcft of flood cushion in the reservoir as of Wednesday night. The flood discharge from the spillway most probably may commence in a couple of days,” a senior engineer told The Hindu .

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Greatness of prapatti||In Kali Yuga with its attendant evil effects, it is difficult to practise Bhakti yoga as a means to moksha. So azhwars and acharyas have shown that people can opt for prapatti or saranagati that is a sure means to get released from samsara, pointed out Sri Asuri Madhavachariar in a discourse. Nammazhwar propitiates Lord Venkateswara who is always resplendent with Goddess Sri and in the famous hymn ‘Akalakillen Irayumenru Alarmelmangai Uraimarbha’ and seeks asylum under His feet, offering his entire being unconditionally to Him. Inspired by Azhwar’s example, many Vaishnava acharyas, such as Nathamuni, Alavandar and Ramanuja have sought prapatti as a means to be steeped in the Lord’s infinite auspicious qualities with the goal of attaining moksha. Ramanuja, in the Saranagati Gadya, propitiates Lord Ranganatha and His consort and is granted moksha at the end of his life. Out of compassion for the entire humanity, Ramanuja asks for release from samsara for all jivatmas who seek surrender at His feet under the acharya’s guidance. Vedanta Desika has explained in great detail the efficacy of prapatti that is the essence of Ramanuja’s Saranagati Gadya. Prapatti is the act of seeking the feet of Sriman Narayana for protection against the evils of samsara. The desire to seek moksha arises in one through the grace of God and the guru and also owing to one’s past samskaras. The acharya explains to the jivatma about his true nature and how owing to the effects of karma, he is a ‘baddha jiva’ in this world. There is no need to continue in samsara since the indwelling atma in each one is inherently divine and immortal. The acharya entrusts the jivatma into the Lord’s care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/greatness-of-prapatti/article32398813.ece

20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sholinganallur HIG flats are yet to be completed, say allottees||Allottees of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board’s (TNHB) 117 high income group (HIG) flats at Sholinganallur have alleged that the board has failed to complete the project even after nearly 10 years. The project originally started construction in 2011 and was supposed to be completed by 2013. “It’s been almost 10 years since the project started but it has not been completed yet. We have written multiple letters to the officials, and have even written to Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. Out of the payment schedule, we only have one more payment left which is to be made when the flat is handed over,” an allottee told The Hindu.  Another allottee said the quality of work was substandard, and various fitting works in the houses above the eighth floor were still incomplete. “There are 117 flats spread over 14 floors (ground plus 13). The project was started during the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s period. Now even the second term of the AIADMK government is going to come to an end. But we are still waiting for our flats,” another allottee said. The allottees said some of them met TNHB Managing Director B. Murugesh earlier this year. He assured them that the project would be completed by March and handed over to them. “Other projects in the vicinity, which started after this one, have been completed. We are paying both EMI for our loans and rent for our current premises,” another allottee said. When contacted, Mr. Murugesh said the work had been completed and the flats would be handed over in the first week of September. “Only DFRS compliance is awaited. It will be ready by this month end,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sholinganallur-hig-flats-are-yet-to-be-completed-say-allottees/article32398937.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sterlite’s closure won’t affect industrial climate, says Vaiko||MDMK founder Vaiko, who has been at the forefront of the anti-Sterlite campaign for over a quarter of a century, on Wednesday rejected the argument that continued closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter in Thoothukudi would affect the industrial climate in Tamil Nadu. He charged that Sterlite had caused enormous damage to the environment. Mr. Vaiko recalled that the company was not allowed to function at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra after farmers attacked the plant, forcing the then Sharad Pawar government to order its closure. “You should keep in mind that Sterlite did not approach courts for relief against the decision of the Maharashtra government. It was not allowed to set up a unit in neighbouring Goa. But the then AIADMK government led by J. Jayalalithaa immediately granted permission for the unit in Thoothukudi and everything was fast-tracked to help the company,” he said. Mr. Vaiko told The Hindu that the government had taken a stand against the unit only after realising the popular sentiment. “It should stand by the caveat it has filed in the Supreme Court. But I want to point out that the government has not taken any action against the police personnel who fired at protesters and killed 13 of them,” Mr. Vaiko said. The MDMK leader said the height of the stack in the Sterlite copper unit was just 60 m. “Even after the unit increased production, the height of the stack was not increased to prevent pollution. It has been pointed out in paragraph 493 of the Madras High Court order. The company is not ready to increase the height because it has to invest a huge amount of money. I was given the information by scientists who worked in the company,” Mr. Vaiko claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sterlites-closure-wont-affect-industrial-climate-says-vaiko/article32398972.ece

20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||The faces of healthcare as a profession||Healthcare has evolved from being a ‘doctor-oriented’ profession to one which involves an array of medical professions, said Ravikumar Arunachalam, Pro Vice-Chancellor, Medical and Health Sciences, SRM IST, Chennai. He was speaking at a webinar on ‘Current and emerging opportunities in nursing and paramedical sciences’, organised by The Hindu Education Plus Career Counselling series, presented by SRMIST. “Modern hospitals have professionals who are more than just doctors,” he pointed out when speaking about the importance of various specialisations within healthcare, including Allied Health Sciences. He went onto list the various jobs and roles that are in demand now globally. Roy K. George, national president, Trained Nurses Association of India, highlighted nursing as a career and some of its special features, such as nurses being among the largest set of healthcare professionals, growth opportunities in nursing, and the ever-increasing demand for nurses. He also spoke about the various higher education and career opportunities in India and around the world. “This year especially, we have seen growth in the need and importance of nurses,” he said. “It has also been getting the recognition it deserves across the healthcare industry.” Speaking about the importance of Allied Health Sciences and professions, B. Rajashekhar, founder and former dean, Manipal College of Health Professions, said that this area was relatively new to Indian healthcare, unlike in the West. “It has grown over the years, but has been overlooked when compared to professions in medicine, nursing or pharmacy,” he said. Giving an overview of the discipline, he sketched the development of the field and spoke of its myths and realities. Pointing out that globally the approach to healthcare is inter-disciplinary, he also gave the differences between Allied Health Sciences and medicine. He highlighted the various courses available to students and covered their prospects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-faces-of-healthcare-as-a-profession/article32398943.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||International flights may soon resume from city airport||The Chennai airport may soon have international flights as part of the ‘air bubble’ arrangement, wherein India has entered into bilateral agreements with other countries to resume international operations in a small way. In this regard, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has written to the State government and requested it to allow a limited number of flights to the city to recommence international flights, sources said. “The AAI has requested permission to handle 750 to 1,000 passengers a day for flights that arrive as part of the ‘air bubble’ arrangement. This means there will be about 4 to 5 flights a day to various destinations to and from the city,” a source said. So far, India has signed agreements with seven countries, including the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, the Maldives, Qatar and UAE. Italy, New Zealand, Singapore, Russia, the Philippines, Japan, Bahrain, Kenya, Israel, South Korea and Thailand are under consideration for now. However, it is still unclear as to which airlines and destinations will be considered for the city airport. More domestic flights The AAI has also asked the State government to increase the number of domestic flights. Right now, there are about 65-70 flights operating and of that only 25 flights can arrive from other States. The AAI wants to increase the daily flight count to 100 in order to handle more passengers. “They had asked us to send a proposal a few days back. We are hoping to get approval soon. There are more relaxations now and people are gradually beginning to travel for important needs. We need to have more flights in the coming weeks,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/international-flights-may-soon-resume-from-city-airport/article32398938.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco seeks Rs. 30,000 crore as loan under Centre’s discom package||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) has sought Rs. 30,000 crore as part of the Centre’s Rs. 90,000 crore liquidity injection package for State distribution companies. It will be able to avail loans from the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday allowed a one-time relaxation in working capital lending limits. As per the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) norms, banks and financial institutions can lend only 25% of a distribution company’s revenue in the previous year for working capital. Now, the Cabinet has allowed the two financial institutions to lend above the 25% cap. Tangedco sources said an official communication was awaited, and they would know the amount they would be granted and other terms and conditions once the sanction letter is issued by the institutions. Outstanding dues As of June, Tamil Nadu had outstanding dues of Rs. 18,077 crore to power generators, the second highest after Rajasthan. The Centre had announced the Rs. 90,000-crore-package in the form of State guaranteed loans (to be equally funded by the PFC and the REC). These loans will provide relief to the stressed State distribution companies and enable them to clear outstanding dues to power generators and transmission companies. It would also help in restarting the cash-flow cycle of the power sector to an extent, according to CARE Ratings. The PFC and the REC have sanctioned over Rs. 30,000 crore each as part of the liquidity package to distribution companies till July 31, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-seeks-rs-30000-crore-as-loan-under-centres-discom-package/article32398970.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Major medical college hospitals will have follow-up clinics||All major government medical college hospitals in the State will now have post-COVID-19 follow-up clinics to monitor the health of persons who have recovered from COVID-19. The first such clinic has come up at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), and one such facility is also coming up at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said. Inaugurating the clinic at RGGGH on Wednesday, he said the post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic was an “innovative concept”. This will be expanded to all major government medical college hospitals, he said. “A total of 2,89,787 persons have recovered from COVID-19 [as on Tuesday]. Though more than 80% of them were asymptomatic and have recovered, 10%-15% required oxygen and intensive care. After recovery, such patients were advised follow-ups. We wanted to have a focused approach towards them,” he said. He added that some patients required intensive care for two weeks. “In such patients, the lungs would have been affected. Even after recovery, such patients could face long-term consequences such as fibrosis in lungs, and changes in the lungs among those with co-morbidities. It is necessary to continuously monitor such patients,” he added. The Minister said that persons who undergo treatment at any hospital in the State could approach the clinic for follow-up, four weeks after discharge. Persons who require intensive care for COVID-19, hospitalisation of more than two weeks, CT findings and those with co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, can utilise the services offered at the clinics. The clinic will function from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. on all days, except Sundays. E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said being a new disease, there was no follow-up for COVID-19 as of now. The clinic has 12 counters, including for physical examination, body mass index, ECG for elderly persons and for others, if required. The persons will consult a doctor and receive appropriate advice and medication. Counters for psychological counselling and diet are part of the clinic. If they are willing, they can register for plasma donation. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan and Director of Medical Education R. Narayana Babu were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/major-medical-college-hospitals-will-have-follow-up-clinics/article32398957.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Insistence on e-pass not unconstitutional’||The Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, has refused to declare as unconstitutional a stipulation imposed by the State government requiring people to obtain e-passes for inter-State and intra-State travel to control the spread of COVID-19. Presiding over the first Division Bench, along with Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, the Chief Justice said there was nothing unconstitutional about the e-pass system since it only regulates free movement in the public interest, and does not prohibit or restrict travel altogether. The litigant, S. Aravind, a cab driver, had claimed that the State had no right to impose curbs on travel, and such action was in violation of the fundamental right to move freely across the country, guaranteed under Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution. The litigant’s counsel, S. Sendamarai Kannan, stated that people were facing immense problems due to the insistence on e-passes. However, State government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan told the court that the government had relaxed the conditions for issuing e-passes. After recording their submissions, the Division Bench pointed out that the insistence on obtaining e-passes neither restricts nor prohibits free movement. It only regulates the movement of people in order to control the spread of the pandemic. “This has been done in the larger interest of the management of the entire COVID-19 pandemic situation, and to regulate the travel of infected people coming in from other States or countries. We, therefore, do not find any reason to strike down the continuance of the e-pass system on account of any violation of fundamental rights,” the judges said. They, however, left it open to the State government to reconsider the system of issuing e-passes as and when an occasion for doing so arises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/insistence-on-e-pass-not-unconstitutional/article32398967.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Face shield, with PPE, safeguards health staff’||In a significant finding, a study conducted by a city-based physician has revealed that health workers directly interacting with family members/contacts of COVID-19 patients tested positive for the infection, despite using hand sanitisers, face masks and gloves, among other things. The use of face shield, in addition to face mask and other personal protective equipment (PPE), was, however, found to be effective in safeguarding the workers from the virus. A study conducted by M. Emmanuel Bhaskar, Professor of Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical College & Research Institute, and his research fellow Santhanam Arun on “SARS-CoV-2 infection among community health workers in India before and after the use of face shields” was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association a couple of days ago. The research was based on the belief that COVID-19 was transmitted predominantly through respiratory droplets from infected persons in close proximity to uninfected persons, although airborne transmission may also play a role. On May 3, community health workers from a research network in Chennai were assigned to counsel asymptomatic family members/contacts of patients who had tested positive for the infection, at their residences. The team, comprising 62 workers, including 40 women, were housed in separate rooms in hostels and provided food. They were not allowed to visit their houses or public places outside work, and they communicated with each other or their supervisors over phone. Before they commenced the duties as part of the study, all workers tested negative for the virus. PPE included alcohol hand rubs, 3-layered surgical masks, gloves and shoe covers. “Standing 6 ft away, the workers explained to the contacts the principles of quarantine, mask use, physical distancing, hand washing and symptoms of the infection. Family members were asked to wear face masks during the conversation, although the workers reported that some did not,” Dr. Emmanuel said. After some workers developed symptoms of COVID-19, face shields made of polyethylene terephthalate (250-m thickness) were added to the PPE provided. After each visit, the shield was decontaminated using an alcohol-based solution, and at the end of the day, soaked in detergent mixed with water. After the introduction of face shields, workers were screened for symptoms and they underwent weekly RT-PCR tests. Shield effective Before the introduction of face shields, between May 4 and 13, 62 workers visited 5,880 homes with 31,164 persons. Among the persons counselled, 222 persons tested positive for COVID-19. Among the workers, 12 (19%) were infected during the period. Eight developed symptoms and four others were asymptomatic. The 12 infected workers were moved to care centers, where four developed desaturation and mild breathing difficulties. They were treated with oral hydroxychloroquine and oxygen therapy, and they recovered. After face shields were given to the workers, the remaining 50 continued providing counselling. They visited 18,228 homes, and of the 1,18,428 persons counselled, 2,682 tested positive for the virus. No worker contracted the infection. The study found no infection among the health workers after the addition of face shields to PPE. The shields may have reduced ocular exposure or the contamination of masks or hands, or may have diverted the movement of air around the face. “I want to make it clear that face shields are not replacements for masks… it has to be worn along with it. It should be cleaned properly after use. The research is focused on frontline health workers and not the public. Since police personnel are also at the forefront in combating COVID-19, they too can consider wearing face shields along with face masks,” Dr. Emmanuel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/face-shield-with-ppe-safeguards-health-staff/article32398955.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anna varsity to begin placements||The annual placement process will begin in Anna University from Thursday. As many as 25 companies have agreed to participate in the first session that will continue till September-end. The students will undergo an online screening test based on their CGPA. It will be followed by group discussion or an online interview, said S. Iniyan, director, Centre for University Industry Collaboration. The schedule for the placement process, including internship opportunities, has been drawn up. “We have released the schedule till September-end. The next schedule will be released in October. This time the students will not have an in-person interview. They will go for internship but it will also be through the online mode,” he said. In the first session, companies such as SAP Labs, Wells Fargo, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citicorp, Arpesium, Amazon and BNY Mellon in the Information Technology sector and Larson and Toubro and Caterpillar in the core engineering sector have proposed to participate. The compensation per annum varies from Rs. 12 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh in the early slot, said T. Kalaichelvan, deputy director of CUIC. Last year, as many as 35 companies offered internships to postgraduate students and their salary compensation ranged from Rs. 6.5 lakh to Rs. 13.75 lakh. “As many as 1,600 students were placed in 2019-20,” Mr. Kalaichelvan said. Twenty companies including VISA, SAP Labs, Samsung Semiconductor, Samsung R&D, Morgan Stanley, Optum, Fidelity, BNY Mellon, Citicorp, Barclay India and Matworks India, have offered internship to students of ECE, CSE and IT branches. Companies such as Society General, VTV Software, Urjanet Energy solutions, Link Logistics, Wallmart Lab, Acolyte Software, Bharti Airtel and Infibeam have proposed to visit before September-end. A total of 2,100 undergraduate students and 1,200 postgraduate students have registered for placement this year. The entire recruitment process has gone digital, university officials said. The trend began last year with some IT companies using digital platforms to complete the placement process. “This year even the induction (work exhibition) for students would be online,” the officials said. “The message for students is that even freshers will work from home. Students must be conversant with digital transformation and they should gear up,” Mr. Kalaichelvan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anna-varsity-to-begin-placements/article32398941.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. schemes benefit over 80% households||A total of 82% households in the State — 85% rural and 80% urban — had utilised government support schemes for COVID-19, according to an official survey. Among the schemes, food transfer to ration cardholders — free rice, edible oil, sugar and pulses — was considered the most beneficial, followed by the financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 through ration cards. Other schemes such as food transfers to non-ration cardholders, provision of subsidised food at Amma Canteens and the Centre’s measures were given low marks by respondents. The State’s universal public distribution system was also used by 99% of rural population and 97% urban population during March-May. As for old age pension (OAP), the survey’s sample contained only 12% of the households, with members aged over 60. Of this figure, 64% received OAP.  Around 22% of the sample faced food security issues — lack of availability of food and higher prices. Within this sample, a majority in urban and rural areas cited a lack of income as the major food security issue. Pudukkottai (42.25%) recorded the highest number of people facing food security issues, followed by Tiruvallur (35.68%), Tiruvannamalai (33.65%) and Madurai (32.42%), whereas Karur (3.47%) and Tirunelveli (3.88%) were on the other end of the spectrum. About 33% of the households complained about facing mental health issues during the lockdown. Only 5.4% of these households sought “external help” to deal with their health problems, the survey added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-schemes-benefit-over-80-households/article32398963.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stricter quarantine for people visiting Chennai||The Greater Chennai Corporation is set to intensify measures to quarantine people who reach the city from other districts and States. Municipal Administration and Water Supply Secretary Harmander Singh on Wednesday ordered civic officials to intensify efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in zones with a rise in number of visitors from other parts of the country. The Corporation has started issuing e-passes to a huge number of people, following the introduction of the new system using Aadhaar and ration cards. The civic body has issued 13,523 e-passes, rejecting less than 1% of the applications. Zones such as Valasaravakkam and Kodambakkam are likely to register a rise in the number of visitors applying for e-pass for business-related visits. Zones such as Adyar and Ambattur are expected to get guest workers from other areas owing to industries located in the zones. The Corporation has planned to quarantine such visitors in the zones. Over 5 lakh visitors are expected to get e-passes this month. Officials said the rise in the number of visitors had already led to an increase in COVID-19 cases in a few areas of the city. E-pass breakdown Out of the 4,131 stranded persons who applied for e-passes in the last two days, just 16 applications were rejected. Before the launch of the new system, less than 1,200 were allowed into the city. As many as 1,686 people applied for e-passes for medical emergencies and just two applications were rejected. Most of the 274 applications under the category of death were approved. A total of 2,027 applications were received citing marriage participation as a reason and 2,026 e-passes were issued. All 13 e-pass applications to participate in government tenders were approved. All 46 applications to implement government projects were also approved. A total of 3,573 applications for work-related e-passes were received, and all of them were approved.  The Corporation has issued 13,523 e-passes, rejecting less than 1% of the applications||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stricter-quarantine-for-people-visiting-chennai/article32398969.ece

20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu wants higher MSP for copra||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday wrote to Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar to consider revision of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for milling copra from Rs. 99.60 to at least Rs. 125 a kg for the 2020 copra season to safeguard the interests of coconut growers in the country. In his letter, Mr. Palaniswami pointed out that coconut plantations in Tamil Nadu in the past two years had faced many challenges like the Gaja cyclone in 2018 and the incidence of Rugose Whitefly in 2019. At present, the market rate in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States was between Rs. 100 to Rs. 110 a kg. “Hence, taking the above challenges into consideration, it is felt that the present MSP for milling copra of Rs. 99.60 a kg would not be adequate to compensate their cost of production,” he said. Substantial expenditure Coconut growers incur substantial expenditure during harvesting, transportation and storage of harvested produce, he underlined and contended that the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coconut farmers. Mr. Palaniswami also pointed out that the Centre had fixed the MSP for crops such as paddy, ragi and pulses at 150% of the cost of cultivation. “The coconut farmers also need to be given adequate price for their produce, in order to enable them to overcome the increasing cost of production in the background of seasonal adversities, pest attacks and rising input costs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-wants-higher-msp-for-copra/article32398973.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||53% T.N. households lost jobs amid lockdown||A survey commissioned by the Tamil Nadu government to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the State’s economy during March-May has found that in 53% of the households surveyed, at least one member had lost his/her job during the period. The job losses were more or less evenly distributed between rural and urban households. In rural areas, 56% of families had faced this problem, while the figure was 50% in urban areas. Of the overall figure of affected households (53%), 92% of rural households and 95% of urban households had one or two members whose sources of livelihood had been affected during the three-month period. In the remaining 8% rural and 5% urban households, three to five members had been affected. Carried out by the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) and the State Department of Economics and Statistics during the third week of June, the telephonic survey covered 10,031 households spread across all the districts of the State. Called the ‘Tamil Nadu COVID-19 Pulse Survey’, the exercise was aimed at providing the government with immediate and reliable data to help design appropriate policy measures for the mitigation of the adverse impacts on key variables like work status, efficacy of government financial support schemes and reverse migration. Most of the affected persons — 83.4% of household members — were casual labourers, and could not find work. As much as 13.3% of members of households, who belonged to the salaried class in the private sector, had lost their job. As regards the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), 37% of rural households reported for work in February, before the pandemic broke out. Of them, about two-thirds — 64.68% — resumed work under the scheme in late April. This meant the rest — 35.3% — were not “completely reliant” on the scheme during the lockdown period.  As regards loss of income, the survey revealed that 67% of the sampled households had experienced it. The break-ups of rural and urban households were 72% and 64%, respectively. To cope with the loss of income, 68% of households had availed themselves of government financial assistance, while 52% had cut expenditure. A perusal of the average mean income showed that Chennai witnessed the sharpest fall — it went down from Rs. 18,996 in February to Rs. 9,757 in May. Erode was among the top three districts, with the mean income fluctuating between Rs. 19,395 and Rs. 14,914. Ramanathapuram and Thanjavur were at the bottom of the table. The State’s average mean income figures varied from Rs. 11,472 (rural) and Rs. 17,717 (urban) in February to Rs. 6,522 (rural) and Rs. 11,337 (urban) in May. As much as 8.19% of the households surveyed reported reverse migration. Of those who had returned to Tamil Nadu, 44.21% had worked in Karnataka and 22.11% in Kerala. By the time the survey was undertaken in late June, 23.19% of the returnees had gone back to their places of work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/53-tn-households-lost-jobs-amid-lockdown/article32398930.ece
20 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC to look at resuming physical courts||Judges of the Madras High Court have scheduled a meeting this Friday to take stock of the COVID-19 situation in the State and to decide on whether it would be safe to commence the physical functioning of its principal seat in Chennai and that of the Madurai Bench. Tamil Nadu Advocates’ Association president S. Prabakaran said opinion was mixed among judges as well as lawyers on the continuance of virtual courts. While some judges and lawyers were in favour of continuing with virtual courts, others were not. “Not all advocates have access to resources such as laptops, computers and seamless Internet connectivity. There are those who are forced to argue cases only through their mobile phones,” he said. He said the opinion among judges, too, was divided on the issue. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh had recently recorded in his judicial order as to how he successfully conducted the virtual hearing of a batch of cases challenging the charges levied by Tangedco on high-tension consumers. But P.S. Amalraj, chairman, Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, said a majority of lawyers were in favour of resuming physical functioning of courts, subject to safety measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-to-look-at-resuming-physical-courts/article32398959.ece

20 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Wedding organisers seek relaxation||Wedding-related associations have appealed to the State government to relax the restrictions imposed on gathering of people for weddings. Singai N. Muthu, president of the Tamil Nadu Wedding Hall Owners’ Association, said the State has nearly 3,600 wedding halls in different categories and about 20 lakh people are employed directly or indirectly in the wedding sector. The sector covers a wide range of services - catering, photography, event management and artisans. Since the lockdown in March this year because of COVID-19 pandemic, the wedding halls are seeing cancellation of bookings. “We had bookings even till November. It is all cancelled,” he said. The government permits only 50 people to gather for a wedding. It should relax that norm and permit 50 % of the wedding hall's capacity, he said. It should also reduce the GST on wedding halls to 5 % from the existing 18 % and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board should relax the mandatory requirements. The wedding hall owners need to pay for the employees, maintain the halls, pay for electricity, etc. Several students find part-time jobs in the related services, such as catering. Every one is affected because of the restrictions. The associations related to the wedding sector, numbering almost 17, have come together to form a State-level federation.

20 August 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Bed strength to be increased at Codissia||Anticipating a increase in COVID-19 positive cases in the district in the next few days, the district administration is looking at increasing the number of beds for asymptomatic patients, Collector K. Rajamani told The Hindu . The number of positive cases in the district went up from 143 in April to 3,906 as of August 16. The district had seen another 393 persons turning positive on August 17. Correspondingly, the positive rate also went up from 2.2 in April to 11.25 by mid-August. The Collector said Kuniamuthur, Karumbukkadai, Selvapuram, P.N. Pudur, Saravanampatti and Ramanathapuram were among the few areas within the city that repeatedly showed increase in cases. He said the number of cases would come down in the next couple of weeks, because more samples were being lifted by the Coimbatore Corporation. It was around 4,000 samples a day in the city. Likewise, the Corporation had also expanded the number of fever clinics it held. As of August 18, it had conducted 6,000-plus such clinics and screened six-and-a-half lakh persons. To manage the anticipated spurt in cases, the administration was looking at increasing the beds at the COVID-19 Care Centre at the Codissia complex. The addition of 500 beds would take the total number of beds there to around 1,200, Mr. Rajamani said. Similarly, the administration also looked at increasing the number of beds at State Government-run hospitals in the city’s periphery, Pollachi, Mettupalayam and Annur. The 500 beds to be increased at Codissia would be in addition to the woman-only care centre that the Corporation would establish in a day or two near Vadavalli, he added. Sub-standard masks rejected The district administration has rejected more than 2.80 lakh masks that it received from a private company for distribution to public distribution system (ration) card holders as they were sub-standard.

20 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Industry assns. seek permission to hold AGMs online||Trade and industry associations here have sought permission from the State government to hold annual general meetings for this year virtually because of the spread of the pandemic. V. Lakshminarayansamy, president of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said he had called for the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in September and had dissolved the general council. The quorum should be 75. “The Central Government has permitted limited companies to hold online AGMs. But, the Chamber is registered under Societies Act. The District Collector said he can permit only 50 people and there are no relaxations from the State government. So there is no option but to postpone the AGM,” he said. President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association R. Ramamurthy pointed out that government organisations, multi-national companies, and industries are permitted to hold the annual meetings virtually under Section 173 (2) of the Indian Companies Act, 2013 and Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. The Registration Department in Tamil Nadu has given time till December 31, 2020 for associations registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975 to hold the general body meetings. “Considering the prevailing condition of spread of COVID-19, we have requested the Registration Department to consider issuing orders to authenticate conducting of the annual general meetings, extra ordinary general meetings, and executive committee meetings virtually,” he said. Only the associations that are registered under the Societies Registration Act are facing a problem. “We wanted to hold the annual general meeting at Codissia this month. But, we will violate the government norms if we invite all the members and we cannot hold the meeting with less than 50 people. We do not know when the spread of COVID-19 will come under control and cannot hold the meeting till then,” Mr. Ramamurthy added. According to K. Selvaruju, secretary general of Southern India Mills’ Association, the association AGMs are not like that of industries. The resolutions to be passed are related to simple transactions. With uncertainty because of the spread of COVID, the AGMs are getting postponed. The State government should relax the norms and give the option of holding the meeting virtually, he said. An official of the Registration Department said AGMs of associations registered under the Societies Act involves voting for the resolutions, recording the minutes of the meeting, and taking the signature of the participants. Hence, it is not permitted virtually. The associations have time till December end to hold the AGMs, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industry-assns-seek-permission-to-hold-agms-online/article32398984.ece

20 August 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||IVRS planned for home quarantined patients in Union Territory||With more COVID-19 patients under home isolation than in healthcare centres, the Puducherry Health Department has decided to put in place mechanisms such as an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to link them with paramedical staff. The number of patients isolated at home exceeded the cases admitted at hospitals by around 80 a day ago. As on Wednesday, there were 1,621 COVID-19 in-patients and 1,700 under home isolation. Director of Health S. Mohan Kumar told The Hindu that patients with no or mild symptoms are advised to stay at home. “It is not that we are refusing to take in patients. People themselves voluntarily opt for staying at home. Even patients admitted at hospitals with moderate symptoms want to get discharged and stay at home,” he said. With cases on the rise and more patients likely to stay put at home, the Health Department will soon launch an IVRS facility and expand the mobile health team to cater to the requirements of COVID-19 patients. Approval awaited The IVRS facility will be set up at the war room inside the State Emergency Operation Centre on East Coast Road. “We are waiting for approval from the government. It will be manned 24x7 by two doctors and technicians to address clarifications and coordinate with mobile teams. The facility will act as a link between patients and paramedical staff to provide supportive medical care,” he said. More mobile teams The department will also increase the number of mobile medical teams. Currently, the department operates six teams, each comprising a medical officer, a nursing officer and an auxiliary nurse midwife staff and ambulance driver. The department plans to add six more teams, Mr. Kumar said.

20 August 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Students slam change in admission criteria for Ph.D programmes at Pondicherry varsity||A change in the criteria for admission to Ph.D programmes at the Pondicherry Central University has been condemned by the student community for being “exclusionary” and “discriminatory” towards candidates from underprivileged sections of society. In a key change in admission policy, reflected in the university prospectus for 2020-21, the entrance test has been waived only for candidates who have qualified in the National Eligibility Test conducted by the UGC/CSIR or any other national-level examination recognised by the university as equivalent, and have been awarded a Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) to pursue a PhD programme. In a departure from the practice followed earlier, the amendment excludes admission (without test) for candidates with the UGC Rajiv Gandhi Fellowship for SC/ST or DBT-BINC or the Maulana Azad Fellowship for minorities or DST-INSPIRE. The Students’ Council of Pondicherry University has petitioned the authorities to revoke the amendment to the Ph.D admission norms. “It is especially disconcerting that a change that has such important consequences for students, especially for those from underprivileged sections, was quietly implemented without any consultation with stakeholders,” Parichay Yadav, president of the council, said. Contending that this was a violation of reservation policy, the council said students with NFSC/NFST and MANF were being asked to write an entrance test, while their scholarships were being de-recognised. It stated that in departments like Anthropology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Social Work and Tourism, seats were reserved only for JRF candidates, and excluding NFSC, NFST and MANF, which are equivalent to JRF, showed the “anti-reservation attitude of the administration”. University authorities said the change was based on a stipulation by the UGC to restrict exemptions from entrance tests to fellowships that involve an entrance test. It was aimed at increasing quality control in Ph.D programmes run by higher learning institutions across the country, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-slam-change-in-admission-criteria-for-phd-programmes-at-pondicherry-varsity/article32398976.ece

20 August 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Norms for containment zones revised||The district administration has revised norms for declaring containment zones. During the initial stages of the pandemic, containment zones in rural areas covered a radius of 5 to 7 km radius. In urban areas, the street or residential locality was closed for 15 days. Since May, a locality or street was declared as containment zone only if five or more persons tested positive. Under the new norms, a street or residential colony is declared as containment zone even if three persons belonging to the area test positive. However, it will not be applicable if all three persons belong to a same family. The affected persons have to live in separate houses. The new norms have been introduced to device micro-level action plans to contain the spread of virus in specific areas, Collector S. Sivarasu toldThe Hindu. Orders are issued on a daily basis to declare containment areas based on case loads in specific areas. The declared areas are closed for public access in coordination with the local body, revenue and police. Once a locality is declared as containment zone, health and sanitary workers of the local bodies will swing into action to disinfect the affected areas and start screening primary and secondary contacts of those who tested positive for the virus. It will be followed by fever clinics, Mr. Sivarasu said. The COVID-19 positivity rate, which was hovering between 8 to 9% till a few weeks ago, has come down to around 5% in the district. Clusters were gradually coming down. On an average, 1,800 to 2,000 persons are subjected to COVID-19 test daily. The fever clinics and focused testing have started yielding results, the Collector added. According to Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian, cases have been gradually coming down in Tiruchi city. A few days ago, 98 persons tested for the virus at Edatheru. Only one tested positive. Similarly, 42 were subjected to tests on East Boulevard Road and only three tested positive. However, there is no question of complacency, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/norms-for-containment-zones-revised/article32399291.ece

20 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘No rise in bomb culture in Tamil Nadu’||Director General of Police J. K. Tripathy has asserted that there was no rise in ‘bomb culture’ in Tamil Nadu as using improvised explosives for settling scores has not increased due to sustained vigil by the police. Mr. Tripathy paid floral tributes to the portrait of P. Subramanian, 28, at the Office of Tirunelveli Range Deputy Inspector General of Police in Palayamkottai on Wednesday. Subramanian was brutally murdered by history-sheeter Duraimuthu, who hurled a country-bomb at the constable when the latter tried to nab him on Tuesday. The DGP told reporters that the policemen, after being trained thoroughly for tactfully handling hardcore criminals and tough situations, had been equipped with weapons to guard themselves from possible unexpected attacks by the criminals. When asked about the charge levelled by the kin of the slain policeman that the policeman, while chasing the criminal facing three murder cases, lacked due protection, the DGP said the training imparted and the weapons given were for their protection. “There are some unexpected situations in which they [policemen] fail to protect themselves. But it does not mean that the police personnel don’t have protection. We’ve good training module to train the policemen on handling weapons and adopting tactics. We’ll strengthen and periodically train the policemen in tackling criminals during similar situations,” Mr. Tripathy said. Vital clues from body The Director General of Police said scanning of Subramanian’s body would provide vital clues about the nails that pierced through the constable in the country-bomb attack and the post-mortem would provide answers for the type of explosives used in the country-bomb. Though sharp and unacceptable criticisms were being levelled against the police department all the time by certain sections of the society, the police, without expecting any reward and recognition, were serving the public in every possible way besides ensuring peaceful lives for everyone by enforcing better law and order situation. “So, we don’t mind the criticism levelled against us and move on,” Mr. Tripathy said. Homage As the mortal remains of Subramanian was handed over to his family at 2.45 p.m. after the post-mortem, it was taken to his native Pandaaravilai near Pudukottai in Thoothukudi district. Mr. Tripathy, Inspector General of Police, South Zone, Murugan, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu, and Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi, S. Jayakumar paid their last respects to the slain constable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-rise-in-bomb-culture-in-tn/article32398945.ece
20 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Varied solatium causes discontent||The solatium of Rs. 50 lakh announced by the State government to the family of slain constable P. Subramanian has triggered dissatisfaction among policemen and a heated debate among the public as Rs. 1 crore was given in the past to the kin of policemen killed in action. When Inspector Periyapandian was killed in 2017, when he had gone to Rajasthan to nab burglars from the State involved in heinous crimes in Chennai and its suburbs, the State government gave compensation of Rs. 1 crore, besides some benefits, to the kin of the slain police officer. He was killed accidentally when another Inspector fired at him by mistake. And the family of special sub-inspector Y. Wilson, who was shot dead by extremists when he was on duty at the Kaliyakkavilai Market Road check-post on January 8 last, was also given compensation of Rs. 1 crore. However, 33-year-old special branch head-constable S. Jagadeesh Durai, who was beaten to death by the sand mafia with shovels and crowbars near Vijayanarayanam in Tirunelveli district on the night of May 6, 2018, when he single-handedly stopped the armed gang, was given only Rs. 10 lakh. “The government, which is giving up to Rs. 1 crore compensation to the kin of slain policemen, gave only a few lakhs to the family of Jegadeesh Durai as solatium. A similar treatment was meted out to the family of (Thirupachethi) sub-inspector Alwyn Sudhan (who was stabbed to death by an armed gang during guru puja of Marudhupandiar in October 2012). Now, the State government has mocked at the supreme sacrifice of another policemen with their double standards in giving compensation,” said a close relative of Jegadeesh Durai. ‘Partial treatment’ “This kind of partial treatment will discourage us from taking adventurous steps while dealing with hardcore criminals,” said policemen deployed at Pandaaravilai and near the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital mortuary. However, Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy denied complaints that there was partiality in giving solatium to the kin of policemen killed in action. “There is no partiality in giving solatium as all cases are not similar,” he said. At the same time, the DGP added that the department had given only the preliminary report to the government on the killing of constable Subramanian and that the government would take a final decision in this connection based on the detailed report to be submitted shortly. On Wednesday evening as the body arrived at the sleepy village, residents staged a road roko in front of Subramanian’s house demanding Rs. 1 crore to the family. However, the agitation was withdrawn soon after senior police officers pacified them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varied-solatium-causes-discontent/article32398947.ece
20 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Slain constable’s wife left in utter despair||When P. Subramanian, the slain constable from Pandaaravilai, married Bhuvaneshwari of Subramaniapuram, near Sawyerpuram on November 14, 2018, she did think that all her miseries had finally come to an end. After she lost her mother, it was her grandmother, who took care of Bhuvaneshwari. Despite her age, ill health and meagre resources, the old woman gave good education to her granddaughter, who now has an M.A., M.Phil. Subramanian picked his life partner because he wanted to help a girl living in abject poverty. His death, yesterday, has plunged her into darkness again. Ever since the tragedy struck, Ms. Bhuvaneshwari, carrying her 10-month-old son, has been crying inconsolably. “Subramanian was an adamantly brave and agile youth and it was this nature that bagged him the constable post. And his bravery and dedication have ultimately taken away his life also,” said his close friend, also a police constable. After recruitment and training, Subramanian was posted in Alwarthirunagari police station, where he served for three years. “On seeing his smartness and bravery, Subramanian was included in the special team meant for special operations like arresting hardcore criminals, conducting pre-dawn surprise raids in the hideouts of outlaws etc. Even when his team saw Duraimuthu (the criminal who murdered the constable with country-bomb), it was only Subramanian who dared to chase and nab him even though Duraimuthu was carrying explosives. When he tried to arrest him after a hot chase near the Manakkarai hillock, Duraimuthu lobbed the explosives at him from close quarters,” another head-constable, who was at the scene of crime on Tuesday afternoon, said. As Pandaaravilai received the coffin containing the mortal remains of its brave son on Wednesday afternoon, the entire village broke down, along with Bhuvaneswari and her infant.

The work has begun and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Officials said the recent spell of heavy rain in the district had caused the uprooting of over 200 trees along highways that run through the district. Two persons died during rain when trees fell on them. Though both the deaths did not occur along major highways in the district, officials have ordered the cutting of trees along the highways to ensure that no life or property was lost. The trees are all located between Burliar and Udhagamandalam, and most of these are invasive or exotic trees that are uprooted and hang precariously over the highway. Officials said that these might fall over during the next monsoon, and therefore will have to be cut.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trees-at-risk-of-getting-uprooted-along-highway-to-be-felled/article32398987.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Flower sellers smell good times||The last time S. Chandra, a farmer from Sivaganga district’s Melakadu village near Nattarasankottai, sent a truck-load of frangipani flowers (sampapngi) was in March before the lockdown began. After five months, she sent a bag of flowers in a truck delivering newspapers from her village to the makeshift flower market on Race Course Road in Madurai. Like her, many farmers in the Madurai region have found it difficult to transport their flowers, including the priced Madurai Malli (Jasmine) during the peak months. A number of problems have impacted this business. “Usually we take mofussil buses and sell the flowers at the flower market in Mattuthavani. Now there is no public transport. Trucks and minivans which had to cross district borders to transport our flowers needed e-passes every day which cannot be procured easily. Moreover, there are no weddings. And temples remain closed,” Ms. Chandra says. Few managed to send their flowers to perfume factories in Nilakottai. P. Ganapathi from Mela Urulikundu used to send tonnes of jasmine to the flower market. He says the peak jasmine season has passed away, without farmers benefiting out of it. “Now we must make do with whatever little income we get by selling flowers at a cheap rate,” he says. “March to July is the best time to grow jasmine. Without demand, many farmers like me stopped harvesting the flowers. Now, we have limited flowers to offer. Without much demand, it is difficult to bounce back,” he says. But the farmers have a glimmer of hope with e-pass relaxations and reopening of the Mattuthavani flower market. S. Ramachandran, president of a flower sellers’ association, says most of the shops in Mattuthavani market will be open by August 24, in time for Vinayaka Chaturthi. “We will follow rules laid down by the Horticulture department and district administration. Hopefully, the festival time will bring more people to the market. We will not allow crowding and make this a COVID-19 hotspot,” he says. A horticulture official says barricading has been done in the market. “If masks are not worn and social distancing is not followed, we will levy spot fines. Entry points will have thermal scanners. We will place barricades and ensure that shops have hand washing facilities and sanitisers. Those who flout the rules will have their shops sealed. We will send daily reports to the Collector’s office,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flower-sellers-smell-good-times/article32399254.ece

Subramaniam for allegedly planning to defy a ban imposed by the State government on installation of idols at public places for the Vinayaka Chaturthi celebrations this year. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy refused to issue any such directions on a public interest litigation petition. They said there was no reason to suspect that the government would not implement the ban imposed by it to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The judges disposed of the petition after recording the submissions of the State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan that the government had requested people to celebrate the festival this year inside their houses and to adhere to physical distancing norms when they visit temples which have been permitted to remain open. Another case Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha, too, disposed of a similar case filed by another individual on the same terms in which the Chief Justice had decided the case before him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refuses-to-order-arrest-of-hindu-munnani-leaders/article32398952.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Agriculture Department to promote wet direct seeding in delta districts||The Agriculture Department is planning to promote direct seeding of paddy on wet fields instead of the normal practice of raising nurseries and transplantation in certain areas of delta districts on a trial basis. The department, which succeeded in promoting dry direct sowing technique during the last samba season on a larger area in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam and some parts of Thanjavur, initially planned to encourage farmers to adopt the method this season too. However, release of water from Mettur Stanley Reservoir on the scheduled date of June 12 and moderate rainfall during the last few weeks has led to a situation wherein preparing the fields for dry direct sowing has become difficult for farmers in places where samba cultivation heavily depends on surface water irrigation for subsistence in case the northeast monsoon fails to bring sufficient rain. Further, the steep depletion in storage level at Mettur during the middle of July has also caused some worries among farmers and officials. Though the storage level has now registered an upward trend, the quantum of inflow into Stanley Reservoir seems to bother stakeholders in delta districts. In order to make the most of the available storage and anticipated inflow of water into Mettur Dam, officials, who have already suggested conjunctive use of filter point sources and surface water for irrigation, have now turned their attention to encouraging farmers with filter point irrigation sources and/or having their fields close to major channels to go in for wet direct sowing instead of the normal practice of raising nursery and transplantation. Though the technique may not result in the quantum of water required for cultivation getting reduced in large quantity, raising the crop through wet direct seeding will help reduce the number of crop days by 10 to 15 days. The duration of medium-term crop varieties can get reduced to around 120 days and longer duration variety will come down to 140 or 145 days, officials feel. Endorsing the view, S. Sundaram of Maharajapuram near Thirukattupalli and G.Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, both seasoned farmers, say direct sowing method will also help cut cultivation costs to some extent. Mr. Sinivasan says he has already tested the technique and was able to cut short the expenses involved in nursery raising, transplantation and weeding by around Rs. 10,000 when he took up paddy cultivation through wet direct seeding. Further, cultivation of traditional varieties such as mapillai samba will have fewer weeds on the fields and thereby reduce the burden of weeding. Another farmer, S. Rajendran of Kannangudi Kizhaiyur near Orathanadu, who has taken up kuruvai cultivation on an acre through wet direct seeding method by using drum seeder, claims that he engaged five to six persons per day for five days to carry out the weeding operations. “Now, the crop is at the flowering stage and will be ready for harvest by the end of next month,” he says. P. Venkatesan, retired director, Seed Certification, urges farmers not to use more than eight kg of seed per acre irrespective of the method of sowing and opt for long-term varieties if they are confident of completing seed sowing/transplantation by the first week of September and go in for medium-term varieties till September-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agriculture-department-to-promote-wet-direct-seeding-in-delta-districts/article32399283.ece

They are conducting door-to-door testing through mobile fever camps in areas of high incidence. While fever camps continue to be held across the city, health officials have increased surveillance by lifting throat swabs for patients with the slightest of symptoms. “Many patients in our zone contracted the infection and some deaths were also recorded. However, since we began conducting fever camps, the numbers have reduced,” said an official in Srirangam zone. Mobile fever camps are being held in areas with a history of people testing positive, or in inaccessible areas. On Wednesday, a team of doctors from DPH and sanitary workers from the zone visited a few apartments on Melur Road and lifted throat swabs. “We contact the apartment welfare association and ask if there are residents, especially senior citizens, who are unwell and want to get tested,” a sanitary inspector at the zone said. Swab samples were lifted from apartment residents and sent to the testing centre at K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College. The mobile fever camps are held in areas where the number of attendees is small, or in slums, or even for senior citizens who want to get tested but cannot reach the camp. “The DPH has assigned four teams, one each for the four zones, who have been deputed to the 18 urban primary centres in the city. The teams travel to the area, and along with screening for fever and lifting throat swabs, they also create awareness of the importance of washing hands, wearing face masks and maintaining personal distance,” S. Shanthi, a health officer said. They are deputed to a fixed number of wards in each zone per week, and the health officers of the civic body guide them to the area where the tests need to be conducted depending upon case history. The health teams urge the public to utilise the facilities provided for free and visit the fever camps. In some areas, especially in slums, the teams are sometimes chased away by residents, a sanitary supervisor said. “They think if they give throat swab, they will test positive and then be forced to go to the hospital, and avoiding the test means avoiding the infection. Awareness in such areas is necessary,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mobile-fever-camps-make-the-rounds-in-high-incidence-areas-of-tiruchi/article32399295.ece

In the first phase, 14 out of 41 colleges managed by the State universities were converted and brought under the Directorate of Collegiate Education. Bharathidasan University (BDU), with the largest composition of 10 constituent colleges, faced a huge financial commitment towards payment of staff salaries and other recurring expenditure. The university expected some reprieve when four of its colleges at Lalgudi, Perambalur, Orthanadu and Aranthangi were converted. Though the purpose was to ease the burden on State universities and facilitate their focus on research, the government has apparently not released funds for the conversion exercise, sources said. Late last year, the Directorate of Collegiate Education sought details of constituent colleges from the State universities for carrying out the second phase of conversion. The universities furnished information pertaining to the number of regular staff, guest lecturers, hourly-basis lecturers and student strength. However, the second phase of conversion is understood to have been put on hold due to the lockdown, the sources said. The BDU constituent colleges awaiting conversion are: Bharathidasan University Model College at Thiruthuraipoondi in Thiruvarur district, Bharathidasan University Model College at Vedaranyam in Nagapattinam district, Bharathidasan University Constituent Arts and Science College at Navalurkuttapattu in Tiruchi district, Bharathidasan Univrsity Constituent Arts and Science College at Nannilam in Thiruvarur district, Bharathidasan University Constituent Arts and Science College (Co-education) at Nagapattinam, and Bharathidasan University Constituent Model Arts and Science College for Women at Veppur in Perambalur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bdu-colleges-in-limbo/article32399282.ece

Around 20,000 acres in Thirukattupalli, Konerirajapuram, Manathidal, Karuppur, Naducauvery, Thiruvalampozhil, Thirupoonthuruthi, Kandiyur, Thiruvedhakudi and Arasur were brought under kuruvai cultivation this year. With 12,000 acres brought under lift irrigation, the remaining area depended on water supplied through the Kudamuruti, branching from the Cauvery. Lack of sufficient water flow in the Kudamuruti was the prime reason for the appearance of cracks, Sugumaran, joint secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, said. He urged officials to ensure sufficient flow of water in the Kudamuruti to save the kuruvai crop. Poor flow in Kudamuruti system could also jeopardise samba cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cracks-on-paddy-fields-raise-concern/article32399286.ece

Collector P. Uma Maheswari said the exercise would be carried out by about 70 health workers, including about 30 government nursing students who had volunteered for the task. Split into teams, they would cover about 1.80 lakh population in all 42 wards. The workers, who had been given training, would also sensitise residents on how to protect themselves against the novel corona virus and clarify doubts, if any. They would also be involved in primary and secondary contact tracing of positive persons. The Collector also disclosed that a similar exercise was being conducted by over 600 personnel in all 13 panchayat unions across the district. Officers in the cadre of sub-collectors had been designated as nodal officers to oversee the surveillance carried out jointly by revenue, police, health and local body officials. To a query, Ms. Maheswari said about 1,800 samples were being drawn everyday, up from an earlier average of 1,000, in the district and urged people to go for test immediately if they had any symptoms.

His visit came a day after a delegation of Muslim leaders petitioned him over a litany of issues, including relaxation of prohibitory orders. A delegation of women relatives of the accused who have been arrested met the Commissioner at the police station and petitioned him that their family members were innocent and wrongly picked up. The Commissioner assured the women that while many were detained and questioned based on suspicion, only those against whom there is material evidence of participation in the riots were being arrested. “The vehicles that were torched during the riots are still lying there. I have issued instructions to have them lifted,” Mr. Pant said. Meanwhile, D.J. Halli and K.G.

20 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private hospital registration under KPME Act simplified||The State government has simplified the registration process for private medical establishments under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act. The new guidelines have waived private medical establishments from obtaining trade licences and uploading the Occupancy Certificate (OC) of the building where the establishment is housed. An auto renewal feature has also been introduced where registration will be renewed on payment of the fee. Verification process The verification process of the documents will also be held during the spot inspection, thereby reducing a step in the process. The system will generate a deemed approval certificate if an application is neither approved nor rejected within 90 days. Those who have already applied through DD, can make an online application paying the difference amount, the guidelines said. The KPME Act was amended in 2017 and a new portal for registration of private medical establishments began in February 2020. However, there were several complaints that the process was cumbersome and hence, after several consultations, the Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare Services issued a new set of guidelines on the registration process.  Move welcomed R. Ravindra, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said they welcomed the move. “Since the KPME amendment came into force, there was confusion of whether medical establishments should register with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and the local bodies along with the Health Department. This notification puts the doubts to rest and states that obtaining a trade licence is not necessary. However, obtaining a trade licence should be removed from the Karnataka Municipalities Act Act as well,” he said. He added that there was lot of “harassment and unnecessary documentation” that was earlier mandated by the government, which added to costs of the hospital.  Lax regulation? However, public health expert Sylvia Karpagam said that in the last few months, it is clear that the government has not been able to regulate the private sector in terms of cost or ensuring services under the Disaster management Act. “The KPME has been shown to have no teeth to regulate or hold private hospitals accountable. In this situation, what is the need to further relax norms?” she asked. “While processes for private hospitals should be made smooth and efficient, they should not be relaxed,” Dr. Karpagam added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-hospital-registration-under-kpme-act-simplified/article32398915.ece
20 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Why blame Cong. for govt. failure to control violence?’||Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah came down heavily on the State government for failing to bear the moral responsibility for the unrest, and instead blaming the Congress for its failure. In an open letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Wednesday, he demanded an inquiry into the disturbances by a High Court judge to ensure a fair and impartial probe. “If the government cannot control violence a stone’s throw away from the administrative centre of the government and cannot protect a police station and an MLA’s house, why should such a State government be there? It is evident that there has been Intelligence failure,” he said in the letter. Mr. Siddaramaiah blamed delay in police action against the person who made the derogatory social media post that sparked the violence. While saying initial reports indicated the involvement of the SDPI, he said the government must take stringent action against any individual or organisation found to be involved. “The ruling party forming a fact-finding committee is a cruel joke on democracy. Doesn’t the investigation by the police get influenced if a ruling party forms a fact-finding committee and comes out with a report?” he wrote. He highlighted two recent events — a video clip of Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai purportedly assuring VHP leader Sharan Pumpwell that all cases against him would be withdrawn and a Hindu youth being arrested for putting a masjid banner on the canopy of a Adi Shankaracharya statue — and criticised the BJP and State government for being “selective” in its action. If the masjid had no CCTV cameras, innocent Muslim youths would have been languishing in jail instead of a former Bajrang Dal worker in the latter case, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-blame-cong-for-govt-failure-to-control-violence/article32398901.ece

Though various organisations, including Karnataka State Akshara Dasoha Employees’ Association, have repeatedly written to the State government requesting them to release their wages, it has not yielded any results. Siddamma Kalgudi, a midday meal worker from Hungund of Bagalakot district, said that they have not been paid for April and May as schools were closed. “This year, we were expecting to be paid from June at least. But we have not been paid even that,” she said adding that it was the moral responsibility of the government to pay wages of April and May due to the unprecedented COVID-19 related restrictions. Another midday meal worker said many of them had even worked as cooks at isolation centres set up for people suspected to have COVID-19. “We also distributed foodgrain kits to students. But our services have not been recognised.” Malini Mesta, general secretary of the association, pointed out that the government had neither paid miday meal workers for the last few months nor provided any lockdown relief compensation. S. Varalakshmi, honorary president of the association, added that many midday workers were the sole breadwinners in their families. “Around Rs. 30 crore per month would suffice to pay the wages of midday meal workers. Can the government not afford Rs. 30 crore a month for the benefit of around 1.18 lakh people across the State,” she said. Midday meal workers who The Hindu spoke to demanded that even they be recognised as “full time labourers” so that they are eligible for minimum wage. “We should also be provided service security and get health and pension benefits,” they said. They also demanded that the government provide them with ration for at least six months.  Around Rs. 30 crore per month would suffice to pay the wages of midday meal workers.

The patients say they have been given covers with biohazard’ written on it and is meant to be picked up by the pourakarmikas from the doorstep. However, many say the waste pickers are irregular. Some say waste has not been collected for over a week.  A resident of Malleswaram, who tested positive and lives in an apartment, said he was unaware of how waste should be disposed. “I called the BBMP for sanitisation of the apartment. I also asked about waste disposal and I was put in touch with an official in charge of solid waste management and they explained the procedure. It’s been more than a week since I have been in isolation. They have collected waste twice. The process is not streamlined,” he said. With garbage piling up outside the house, their neighbours and other residents in the gated community point out that this has raised a stink. “Nobody can touch this waste as it is biohazardous, so it lies in front of the house for days together,” said another person, who has tested positive.  Kondamma, a pourakarmika who works in the city, said many of her colleagues might be scared to pick up waste as they are not provided adequate protective gear. “We are only given gloves and sanitisers,” she said. D. Randeep, Special Commissioner, BBMP, said there is a protocol to clear such waste on a daily basis for a 10-day period. “Staff in PPE collect this waste.

20 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||New portal promises to reduce waiting time for COVID-19 test results||Over the past few months, those who give swab samples for the COVID-19 test have been complaining about delay in getting the results. A new portal, now live, promises to shorten the waiting period. The State government has developed the portal where people can check their test results by feeding the 13-digit specimen referral form (SRF) ID. The portal,https://www.covidwar.karnataka. gov.in/service1, has been developed by senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil and his team at the State COVID-19 War Room. This procedure allows public to access their results without comprising their privacy. Hitherto, people had to wait for message from the labs or government officials to be informed of the results. Some had complained that it took almost a week for them to get the results. “After giving swabs, we have to be isolated even if our result is eventually negative,” said a COVID-19 patient who had to wait five days for the result. He said the new system would indeed help. Other hurdles While the new system will help in reducing the time in accessing results, it cannot eliminate the delay if there is a backlog in testing the samples at laboratory as the number of tests conducted each day is increasing. On Wednesday, as many as 63,085 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the State, the highest in a single day. Mr. Moudgil said there was no need to panic even if one tests positive. “Stay calm and isolate yourself at your home. The government of Karanataka will automatically get in touch with you on your mobile number,” he said. He added that people can call 108 for any emergency or reach Apthamitra helpline — 14410.

20 August 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah’s remarks sign of frustration: BJP||Launching a counter attack on Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah for his tweet that the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh were trying to use D.J. Halli violence to topple Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the BJP on Wednesday described such remarks as a sign of his frustration. “Mr. Siddaramaiah’s desperate attempt to drive a wedge in the BJP and the government is a sign of his frustration,” said BJP spokesperson Ganesh Karnik. Mr. Karnik said: “The fact that he has chosen to launch a diatribe on the BJP almost on a daily basis indicates that he is not only rattled on crucial issues raised by the BJP but also has something to hide.” Referring to the decision by the erstwhile government led by Mr. Siddaramaiah to close cases against hundreds of PFI and SDPI workers, he said: “It is because of this moral, legal and administrative support extended by the Congress that the PFI and SDPI workers are going on a rampage.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiahs-remarks-sign-of-frustration-bjp/article32398902.ece

20 August 2020||DHARWAD,KARNATAKA||Officials warned against poor use of TSP, SCSP funds||Taking exception to under utilisation of funds meant for the development of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Dharwad Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil has warned officials against any lapses in the utilisation of funds meant for the deprived communities. Chairing a progress review meeting of the Tribal Sub Plan and the Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (TSP and SCSP) here on Wednesday, Mr. Patil said that both the Union and State governments had made adequate funds available under the TSP and SCSP and officials should ensure the optimum utilisation of the funds. “If any department shows negligence in preparing action plan and fails to utilise the funds within the stipulated time, the official concerned will be held responsible. And, subsequently, disciplinary action will be initiated against him,” he said. Referring to the reason of delay in funds availability for not preparing action plan, Mr. Patil said that every department had to spend 24.10 % of their total budget under TSP and SCSP. Funds under the programme should be utilised for development and welfare activities and eligible beneficiaries selected for them. Every department should prepare action plan based on the funds allocated to them and immediately forward them to their respective senior officers for approval, he said. Mr. Patil said that all the departments should work in such a way as to achieve 70 % progress in utilisation of funds under TSP and SCSP by November 2020. Failure to achieve the target would be dealt with seriously, including legal action, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/officials-warned-against-poor-use-of-tsp-scsp-funds/article32399065.ece

20 August 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Withdrawal of three Ordinances sought||Criticising the BJP government at the Centre and the State for their “anti-people” and “pro-corporate” polices, farmers leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar demanded that the recent amendments made through ordinances to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act and The Essential Commodities Act be withdrawn. Addressing a media conference here on Wednesday, he said that the amendments went against the common people, particularly the farming community, to serve the capitalists. “By restricting the purchase of agricultural land by non-farmers, the Land Reforms Act so far protected the interests of farmers and kept the food security goal as the focus. With the new amendment, now anybody can purchase agricultural land. The corporate companies and individuals would purchase large tracts of agricultural land driving out the real farmers from their fields. It would be disastrous as it would have an adverse impact on the farmers as well as on national food security,” Mr. Chandrashekhar said. The amendment to the APMC Act, he added, would allow big corporate companies to enter the APMC market and take control of it driving out small traders. “Once the capitalists begin controlling the APMC, the latter would no longer be beneficial for farmers. Even the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh had made an attempt to do this same thing with APMC Act. But, it could not do it fearing the wrath of farmers. The BJP government led by Narendra Modi at the Centre has done it disregarding the interests of farmers and small traders. The government appears to be serving corporate masters,” he said. Referring to the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, he said that with the amended Act in force, the authorities would lose power to act against illegal hoarding of stocks of essential commodities to create artificial scarcity. He demanded that all the three amendments be withdrawn and the Acts restored to their previous state.  The amendments are against the common people, particularly the farming community, says farmers leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/withdrawal-of-three-ordinances-sought/article32399063.ece
20 August 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Complaint against prof. for assaulting Botany HoD of Gulbarga varsity||Head of the Botany Department, Gulbarga University, Kalaburagi, G.M. Vidyasagar, has lodged a complaint with the Gulbarga University Police Station against Professor, Department of Psychology of the university, S.P. Melkeri, for allegedly assaulting him in his chamber here on Tuesday. In his complaint, Dr. Vidyasagar stated that Prof. Melkeri, who is an uncle of an M.Phil student, Shivakumar, in the Botany Department, barged into his chamber on Tuesday to enquire with him about his nephew’s harassment, and started abusing him and manhandled him. According to the complaint, Prof. Melkeri threatened to kill him and his family members. He also mentioned in the complaint that a professor in the Botany Department, Pratima Math, provoked and instigated Mr. Melkeri against him. Meanwhile, a 2.09-minute video footage of the whole incident went viral in which Prof. Melkeri and Dr. Vidyasagar are seen exchanging heated arguments after which Prof. Melkeri loses his cool and slaps Dr. Vidyasagar. It shows staff members present in the chamber intervening and pacifying the two. Dr. Vidyasagar speaking to The Hindu clarified that the incident took place on Tuesday and that he lodged the complaint the same day. He, however, declined to share any details about the incident as he did not have permission of the Vice-Chancellor. Meanwhile, the Vice-Chancellor of Gulbarga University was not available for comments. Prof. Melkeri told The Hindu that Dr. Vidyasagar insulted Shivakumar in the presence of students. He said that Shivakumar was always “cornered” and he was depressed over the problems he faced in college as he was being tortured. Prof. Melkeri said that Dr. Vidyasagar had also threatened Shivakumar asking him to withdraw from the M.Phil programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/complaint-against-prof-for-assaulting-botany-hod-of-gulbarga-varsity/article32399061.ece
20 August 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||APMC cautions wholesale merchants||The Mangaluru Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) on Wednesday asked wholesale vegetable and fruit merchants to resume their activities at the place allotted within the APMC premises at Baikampady. They will face legal action if trading activities in the Central Market area are continued, warned APMC president K. Krishnaraj Hegde. Mr. Hegde told reporters here that most of the 160 licensed and non-licensed merchants, who were trading at the yard for the last four months, have moved back to the Central Market area after the Mangaluru City Corporation withdrew its notification of April 7 directing traders to do their business at the APMC Yard. “The notification was withdrawn for technical reasons. Traders have perceived it as permission to resume trading at the Central Market, which is in dilapidated condition,” Mr. Hegde said. He said that Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra had, on Tuesday, issued a fresh notification banning all trade activities at the Central Market area in view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. The Deputy Commissioner has asked traders to continue their activities at the APMC Yard, Mr. Hegde noted. “Yet many traders are seen doing business at the Central Market. The APMC has powers to initiate action and cancel licence. Penal provisions will be invoked against traders not having licence. Do not force us to take such action,” Mr. Hegde said. Of the 160 wholesale merchants, 60 have obtained licence from the APMC. It is mandatory for all to obtain licence, submit weekly accounts of trading and remit user charges to the APMC. The committee has spent over Rs. 1 crore to upgrade infrastructure at the yard after merchants moved there following the closure of the Central Market by the city corporation four months ago. APMC did not collect rent from merchants since then following a government directive. Now, APMC has asked the merchants to obtain licence, pay rent and user fee.  Notification opposed Meanwhile, opposing Tuesday’s notification, MLA U.T. Khader has said that traders cannot be forced to operate from APMC Yard where no facilities have been created. Mr. Khader told presspersons that as the corporation has withdrawn the earlier order, the traders had returned to the Central Market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/apmc-cautions-wholesale-merchants/article32399071.ece

20 August 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Study forecasts continued surge of COVID-19 cases in Karnataka||The surge of COVID-19 in Karnataka, which is among the badly hit States of the country, is expected to continue in the coming days with the number of cases and deaths expected to touch 4.5 lakh and 6,700 respectively by September 12, claims a study. Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India and Proxima, a management consulting firm, had deployed its pandemic management system using publicly available COVID-19 data to arrive at this forecast. The number of cases in Karnataka stood at 2.4 lakh and deaths at 4,201 on August 18, according to statistics released by the State’s Department of Health and Family Welfare. On July 20, when the number of cases in Karnataka were 67,420 and deaths 1,403, Proxima Pandemic Management System (PPMS) had predicted that the State will report 2.25 lakh cases and 6,000 deaths by August 15. Though the actual number of cases reached 2.11 lakh cases on August 15, the number of deaths were 3,718, indicating a wider margin of error, stated Mysore Sanjeev, convenor of Project Jeevan Raksha. The continuing surge in cases across the country has been attributed by Jeevan Raksha to the “auto mode” many States have slipped into. The PPMS predicted that the number of COVID-19 cases in the country would reach 45 lakh to 47.5 lakh and deaths would be in the range of 75,000 to 90,000 by September 12. “Many States have gone into auto mode. Amidst livelihood compulsions and geo-political situation, the momentum to flatten the curve is getting lost,” the analysis said, while emphasising the need to pay more attention to quarantine management. The performance review should shift to reducing the number of deaths, the study added. Silver lining The analysis, however, points to a reduction in the Moving Growth Rate (MGR) percentage of positivity from 110% on July 4 to 87% on August 15 across the country, which indicates “the slowing down of velocity of virus spread”. “Decrease in MGR will increase the doubling period and vice-versa,” the analysis said, while attributing the decrease in MGR to “a combination of intervention and increase in base value”. A similar drop had been witnessed in the MGR percentage of mortality from 110% to 56% during a 30-day period ending August 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-forecasts-continued-surge-of-covid-19-cases-in-karnataka/article32398914.ece
20 August 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru-Madikeri rail line: Officials say final location survey by March||The railway line from Mysuru to Madikeri in Kodagu, which has been mired in a maze of litigation and opposition over environmental issues, is set to make a notional progress as the authorities plan to complete the final location survey (FLS) by March 2021. Clearance for survey The project was originally proposed nearly 140 years ago (around 1880-81 as per the Mysore Gazetteer) but remained a non-starter until it received clearance for a survey in the 2016-17 Railway Budget. But since then, there has been opposition against the project in Kodagu, which has seen landslips owing to excessive rains all of which have been attributed to linear projects and reduction in green cover. At an e-press meet by the railway authorities on Wednesday, senior officials, including Divisional Railway Manager of Mysuru Railway Division Aparna Garg, said that the tender for FLS was being finalised and they hoped to complete the same by March 2021. Originally, the proposal was to link Mysuru with Madikeri and put the district on the railway map of India. But sources said consequent to opposition and environmental issues, the railway line may terminate at Kushalnagar and not go beyond it. As per the plans, the first phase is the Mysuru-Kushalnagar stretch of 87.2 km and the cost was pegged at Rs. 1,854.62 crore in February 2019. The cost per km is expected to be Rs. 21.27 crore and will entail acquisition of 247.65 hectares of dry land and 275.15 hectares of wetland. Col. C.P. Muthanna of Coorg Wildlife Society, who had approached the High Court opposing the project, said there was no objection to the survey but the court has stated that the concerns expressed by environmentalists have to be taken into consideration before the railways approve the detailed project report. Activists, opposed to the project, say the alignment of the Mysuru-Kushalnagar section may not cut through forests but the railway line will disturb the elephant movement, escalate human-elephant conflict in the area which was already high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-madikeri-rail-line-officials-say-final-location-survey-by-march/article32398921.ece

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Boost for online festive shopping||A shift in consumer behaviour usually takes years. Online shopping was no different, until the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with the festive season, the pandemic seems to have ‘fast-forwarded’ a shift in shopping habits as most people do not want to go out due to fear of the virus. There is a clear spike in the number of online orders in the city. For instance, families here, would make one or two online purchases a month until March. But during June and July, the number of such purchases spiked. Some online deals were attractive compared to their offline counterparts. But, more than that ‘deals’, ‘convenience & safety’ drove the trend, according to industry experts. B.S. Murthy, an industry expert and CEO of Leadership Capital, said, “A behavioural change usually takes years to happen, but the pandemic brought in an instant change in buyer habits. In every family, children, parents and grandparents contributed equally to this change because no one wants to go out and shop.” Asha Channegowda, a placement officer at Maharishi Markandeshwar (D) University in the city, said, “I bought clothes for my daughter, saris for my mother, puja items and lamps from online retailers.” Malathi Chettiyar, a teacher, taught herself how to order online only after the pandemic. “My husband was the only one who shopped online, and that, too, maybe a few times a year. Today, I have multiple deliveries coming home every day. Our children shop for games, pastries, pasta, cakes, desserts, ice creams on their own. My in-laws too make their purchases online with the help of grandchildren,” she said. It’s not just festive shopping that’s driving traffic. Over the past few months, e-tailer Flipkart witnessed a nearly 26-time increase in demand for health safety products such as thermometers and oximeters. Demand for household appliances, such as microwaves, has increased by four times on the platform. This period also saw an impressive growth in the adoption of work-from-home essentials, such as laptops and office furniture, which grew 2.3 and 3 times, respectively. Techie Vishal Ketaki said, “I hardly go out. I run my errands and pay utility bills online. I get laundry and tailored stuff picked up.” According to Pavan Padaki, branding and consumer insights consultant, customers experimented with online shopping and door delivery services for safety reasons. Over time, significant numbers became regular customers owing to the convenience factor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/boost-for-online-festive-shopping/article32398894.ece

This year, we thought of plant health. We haven’t done it narrowly on plant health, but took that as a starting point to think about what is it that excites us about plants,” said Dr. Jahnavi Phalkey, founding director, SGB, Stating that while the exhibition is open to everyone, she says the programming, including workshops, and masterclasses, is specifically targeted at young adults between the ages of 15 and 28.

The market will initially be accessible to wholesale dealers alone, and retail trade will be allowed after evaluation of the situation by the authorities. “The market was closed down not because anyone here turned COVID-19 positive or primary contacts of infected persons were found to have visited the market, but as part of a general decision to close down markets considering their vulnerability. We had petitioned the Minister in charge of the district, District Collector, and the Police Commissioner about the continuing closure of the market even after other markets resumed operations,” said P.V. Chandran, local councillor and chairman of the market protection committee which expects the district administration to remove the market from the list of containment zones at the earliest. The committee has taken steps to enforce guidelines issued by the police as precondition for reopening the market. Twelve wholesale traders and three meat vendors will be allowed in the market. Unloading of produce will be allowed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. and sales between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Not more than 20 persons will be allowed inside the market at a time and that too for not more than 20 minutes. “Security guards will be deployed at the entrance to ensure restricted admission and compliance with the COVID-19 protocol, including physical distancing and wearing of masks. They will also measure the temperature of those entering the market with a thermal scanner,” said Mr. Chandran. Markings with separations are being made in the market to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet. Guidelines to be followed will be announced through the public announcement system at frequent intervals. Mr. Chandran said the Thrikkakara Assistant Commissioner had inspected the market on Wednesday and expressed satisfaction with the precautionary measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/champakkara-market-set-to-reopen-with-restrictions/article32399177.ece

Expressing their dismay over the stand adopted by the State government to the notification, the organisations have pointed out that the Centre is attempting to dilute the provisions of the Environment Protection Act at a time when it should have strengthened it. Noting that the State and the country are reeling under the impacts of a climate change, the organisations have said the State should demand that the Centre bring in new legislation or notifications for strengthening the environment protection laws. New legislation and notifications should be introduced after an expert panel evaluating the existing laws, they have said. The report of the expert panel should be placed before Parliament, State Assemblies, and local self- government institutions and civil society for discussion. The views of these bodies should be considered before for finalising the legislation, the organisations demanded, they have said. The greens have also demanded the constitution of an expert panel comprising ecologists and scientists to formulate the views of the State regarding the 2020 notification.

The incident happened at the family’s home on Monday night after the accused, reportedly a habitual troublemaker, allegedly ran out of money for buying liquor. The police said he demanded money and when it was not forthcoming, asked for the mobile and forcibly took away it away in the face of resistance. Since the children were good at studies and the family could not afford to buy a smartphone to enable them to pursue online education, local residents had mobilised funds to buy them the phone. It is learnt that the man sold the mobile phone the next day and spent it in a toddy shop from where the police picked him up. He was charged with Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-charged-with-assaulting-family/article32399174.ece
20 August 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Panel mooted to monitor Periyar pollution||The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management on Wednesday submitted a report before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), recommending the formation of an independent committee to monitor the pollution of the Periyar. The report, submitted by SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, recommended that the committee report directly to the tribunal. It said the panel should have powers to inspect industrial units and other establishments on the banks of the river. The report was submitted before the Southern Bench of the NGT. The proposal to have an independent committee was made after the SLMC observed that the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) and other departments concerned had failed to curb activities resulting in the pollution of the river. “They are either afraid of someone or are guided by some other considerations. Even if action is initiated in some cases on the insistence of the public or the media, it would be namesake by sending notices and without taking any follow-up action,” said the report. The proposed committee should have a chairman and five members. The chairman can be an engineer or scientist outside the PCB, qualified in environmental engineering. The SLMC chief expressed doubts about the illegal discharge of industrial waste through underground outlets into the river. He suggested a scientific investigation to ascertain the presence of such unauthorised outlets. The report urged the tribunal to issue stringent directives to the 84 local bodies on the banks of the river to close down industrial units found polluting the waterbody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-mooted-to-monitor-periyar-pollution/article32399178.ece

It is not motorable owing to potholes. He said it was the duty of the authorities to ensure that the road was properly maintained. The failure of the authorities in doing so amounted to violation of various High Court directives. They cannot not shirk their responsibility to maintain roads and take refuge in the argument that tarring is not possible when it rains.

In view of the development, work-from-home option will be exercised for the remaining staff on duty. Over 100 officials who came in contact with their infected colleagues have been asked to go into home quarantine. The reopening of the office will be considered only after reviewing the situation by police higher-ups. Health Department officials are clueless about the source of infection of officials. Safety measures Safety measures had already been heightened at the DPC’s office following the death of one of the ministerial staff members who was undergoing treatment for COVID-19. The total staff strength on office duty had been reduced to 50% to prevent chances of spread. Apart from this, policemen from various local stations and departments who were the primary contacts of the victim had been put in home quarantine. According to Station House Officers from various rural and city stations, the number of policemen being quarantined is on the increase, affecting the functioning of enforcement activities. Daily activities, including containment zones management, are now going smoothly with the support of additional staff from nearby stations and it will not be a long-term solution, they say. In one of such incidents, 30 policemen from Thiruvambady station had been put in home quarantine following the confirmation of COVID-19 in one of their senior colleagues. The main challenge in the case was to identify the source of infection. As a large number of policemen were in a situation to opt for home quarantine, the station had to depend on the service of staff from other places. Same was the case with a Vigilance office in Kozhikode city which had been closed after two persons, an inspector and a driver, were tested positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/district-police-chief-office-closed/article32399168.ece
20 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||On 2nd anniversary, Mahila Mall on the verge of closure||Mahila Mall, claimed to be Asia’s first mall with an all-women crew, that had come under the umbrella of Kudumbashree in Kozhikode, is on the verge of closure, barely three months away from the second anniversary of its launch. The mall, with shops of over 50 woman entrepreneurs, had downed shutters when the national lockdown began in March 2020, and remains closed till date. With the management adamant on the stand that they will not reopen unless all rent dues are cleared and entrepreneurs procuring an injunction order against the closure of the mall, the future of the one-of-its-kind venture is filled with uncertainty. Despite its glorious start in November 2018, the mall could not cash in on the initial publicity for long. Lack of patronage Trouble started within a month when some entrepreneurs questioned the lack of the promised facilities in the mall, such as a super market, a cinema, a play zone and a food court, which, they said, were crucial for improving footfall into the mall. Lack of patronage forced many of the entrepreneurs to close shops or move out within a year. “To begin with, they did not keep the promises, neither did they make any efforts for better marketing. We were taken for a ride,” said Anitha Bimal who owns a boutique in the mall. The Mahila Mall is managed by the Kudumbashree’s Unity Group consisting of ten women. The entire floor area in five storeys were divided into around 80 small-to-medium shops based on the demands of the entrepreneurs who became part of the Rs. 6-crore project, the biggest in the history of Kudumbashree in the State. However, lack of adequate income stopped many entrepreneurs from paying their rents on time. “How can we function without income. We had no means to pay our loans or to pay rent,” K. Vijaya, secretary of Unity Group, said. The lockdown added to their woes and the management refused to reopen the facility even after the govt. relaxed curbs on malls. “We could not even enter our shops,” Ms. Anitha said adding that she had stock worth several lakhs in her boutique. The management’s refusal to renew contracts irked some of the shop owners, forcing them to approach court demanding reopening of the mall. “We have too much at stake here. We want it to be working again,” Ms. Anitha said. Meanwhile, the management claimed that rent amounting to Rs. 36 lakh was yet to be paid by shop owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/on-2nd-anniversary-mahila-mall-on-the-verge-of-closure/article32399170.ece

Can’t you get it from your parents?” These questions were thrown back at a woman junior doctor posted on COVID-19 duty at a village health-care facility in central Kerala when she approached a senior Health Department official to clear her salary dues. She is among the 1,000-odd doctors from the 2014 MBBS batch in government medical colleges across the State who completed their course earlier this year. The government, through an order on April 29, posted them at various health centres and around 700 joined the duty. Though the appointment is for a three-month period, many of them are yet to get the salary of Rs. 42,000 even after two months. Representatives of the Kerala Junior Doctors Association ’20-’21 on Wednesday approached the High Court seeking a direction for early disbursal of their salaries. Association secretary T.S. Krishnapriya said the government order was not clear about the designation and remuneration of the junior doctors. Short-staffed Dr. Krishnapriya pointed out that a majority of doctors posted in COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTC) belong to their group. The junior doctors were often forced to work round the clock as most of the FLTCs are short-staffed, she claimed. “The doctors appointed under the National Health Mission, who have similar designation and experience and are allotted the same duties, are getting Rs. 50,000 and 20% risk allowance,” she pointed out. Though the government on August 12 issued a direction to release their salaries, most of the junior doctors are yet to benefit from it. Sources in the Health Department said the Director, Health Services, had urged the Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, to designate these doctors as ‘medical officer (temporary)’. Right now they are designated as ‘outgoing interns’, which is not recognised by the software to release salaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/junior-doctors-yet-to-get-paid/article32399186.ece
20 August 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||For Vinod Kovoor, life imitates art in pandemic times||The comedy serial M80 Moosa may have been off the television screen for a couple of years now, but Vinod Kovoor is still identified by most people for his fine performance in the title role. He had enacted the role of Moosa, the fish vendor, in some 350 episodes. Now Vinod is all set to play a fish seller in real life. No, you won’t actually find him selling fish moving around on a Bajaj M80, but he is setting up a stall that will deliver fish to homes. One thing the coronavirus has taught him these past five months is that most performing artistes need to look for another vocation to survive. “Actors, singers, mimics and other performing artistes have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic and I too have been feeling the pinch,” Vinod tells The Hindu . “I have had no income for the last five months, and now I realise that I have to do something else to survive,” he says. Lockdown blues During the lockdown he kept himself busy by directing three short films and giving motivational talks and lessons to children on mimicry and singing through social media. “But I didn't gain anything financially from those efforts and in fact lost money while making those films. The main source of my income for performers like me is the stage. And I don’t see any live shows happening in the near future,” he says Vinod says he was recently told that it could be another two years before performers like him got an invitation from a Gulf country. “That chat with an organiser worried me,” he says. “You know it is the shows in the Gulf nations that really pay well. So people like me have to think of other options,” he adds. Vinod felt a shop to sell fresh, marinated fish could do well in the city. “So I have joined hands with a couple of friends for this venture,” he says. “We will open our business around Onam. Yes, it is strange that I am doing something similar to what I portrayed most as an actor, in the role of M80 Moosa .” Life could imitate art sometimes, after all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/for-vinod-kovoor-life-imitates-art-in-pandemic-times/article32399188.ece

20 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No syllabus cut in State schools||The State has decided that the school syllabus for the current academic year will not be reduced. The decision was taken at an online meeting of the State curriculum steering committee on Wednesday. Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath presided over the meeting. The State’s decision runs contrary to that of the CBSE, ICSE, and some State boards that have decided to slash the syllabus in view of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to academic activities. Officials said the academic session in the State had got under way in June, though the transaction was being held online.  Digital classes The First Bell digital classes could continue till schools reopened on the directions of the Union and the State governments. The State was also not keen on trimming the syllabus in a manner that Constitutional values and progressive ideas suffered. It did not feel that the present situation warranted any cut in the syllabus. The meeting entrusted State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) Director J. Prasad with setting up an expert committee to prepare an action plan for continuing teaching-learning activities even when schools reopened and submit a report within two weeks. Options such as reducing the number of holidays and even the summer vacations to cover the portions would be considered. Reopening options It was decided to explore the possibilities for reopening schools at the earliest. If classes, especially for primary students, could not be resumed, the possibility of kicking off classes for students of Classes 10 and 12 in a shift system should be considered, it was suggested. The meeting resolved to improve the ongoing digital classes and make them more attractive. A subcommittee led by the SCERT Director would review all classes to ensure quality. More focus would be given to differently abled children and those in tribal areas, especially for improving access to the digital classes with the support of the Scheduled Tribes Welfare Department. Steps would be taken for telecast of classes in select subjects for higher secondary students that were yet to begin. A programme would be rolled out to address learning gaps caused by various factors when schools reopened. Steps would be taken to address parents’ concerns about the digital classes and issues such as examinations. It was also suggested that academic and other activities ensure parents’ involvement too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-syllabus-cut-in-state-schools/article32399192.ece
20 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Fronts get set for political face-off||Opposing fronts appear to have girded themselves for a political face-off days ahead of a one-day session of the State Assembly on August 24. The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) has given notice for the leave of the House to move two politically sensitive and potentially uproarious motions against the government. The Assembly is meeting for a day under the lengthening shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic to pass the Kerala Finance Bill. The Opposition plans to use the occasion to create maximum political theatre against the government in the run-up to the local body elections. Its notice for a no-confidence motion is aimed at putting the government on the dock on four issues — the "cosy relationship" of the accused in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case with the Chief Minister's Office, LIFE Mission "bribery", poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and embezzlement of flood relief meant for displaced families. V.D. Satheeshan of the Congress has moved the notice. Speaker removal M. Ummer of the Indian Union Muslim League has given a second notice seeking the removal of Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan as Chair of the House. He has accused the Speaker of having lowered the esteem of the House by participating in a private function hosted by Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the gold smuggling case. The floor managers for the government appear wary that the no-confidence notice might have sufficient political heft to scandalise the government. The ruling front exudes confidence that it could easily defeat the no-confidence motion with numbers on its side. But, the LDF appears worried that the debate would offer the UDF a unique opportunity for political muckraking. The House requires at least 14 days to process the notice against the Speaker and it is unlikely to be allowed. In contrast, the no-confidence notice requires only three days intimation. Campaign The ruling Left Democratic Front has launched a door-to-door political campaign to counter UDF propaganda. As a precursor to the impending fight, at least two Ministers have "disowned" the actions of former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar and said he had betrayed the trust of the government.  Oppn. no-trust move seeks to highlight CM’s office links to gold smuggling case, LIFE Mission ‘bribery,’ handling of pandemic and siphoning off flood relief funds||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fronts-get-set-for-political-face-off/article32399205.ece
20 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Huge response to LIFE project||The State government’s call for fresh applications for the Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing project has received a huge response even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than four lakh applications being submitted to the mission since August 1. With the current application window remaining open till August 27, the numbers are expected to cross five lakh. As of Wednesday, the number of applications received from across the State stood at 4,37,994. Out of these, as many as 3,26,745 applications are from homeless families who own land, while 1,11,249 applications are from landless families. “It is a relief that a majority of the applicants own land of their own. Usually delays happen due to issues in identifying suitable land. Availability is scarce, especially in urban areas. We had expected only around 2.5 to 3 lakh applicants. This has gone beyond our expectations now,” said an official of the LIFE mission. The new application window for the LIFE project has been opened from August 1 to 27, to accommodate those who could not be included in earlier phases. In the previous phases, the beneficiaries were chosen based on a survey conducted by the Kudumbashree. In the current phase, those who received new ration cards till July 1 can apply.  Launched in 2016 Earlier this year, in February, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had made the declaration on completion of two lakh houses under the LIFE project, launched in 2016. Over the three phases of the project, 2,24,332 houses have been completed till Wednesday. In addition to these, the Scheduled Caste Development Department has completed 19,247 houses, the Scheduled Tribes Department 1,745 houses and the Fisheries Department 4,177 houses during this period. “At the current pace, one lakh more houses are expected to be built under the LIFE mission in the next one year. The initial plan for the third phase was to accommodate landless families in flats. But now many people are coming forward with interest to buy land and construct houses. For the government too, this is more economical as the cost of an individual house in a flat complex is around Rs. 13 to Rs. 14 lakh, while individual houses can be built at Rs. 4 lakh,” says the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/huge-response-to-life-project/article32399195.ece
20 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State makes bid to stop airport takeover||The State has approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi again to revoke the decision to hand over the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) of the Adani Group. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to the Prime Minister again to avoid the private player getting the rights of operation, management and development of the airport from the Airports Authority of India for 50 years, sources said. While the CPI(M)-led LDF, the Congress-led UDF, and the Vallakadavu-Vayamoola Joint Action Council spearheading the stir against land takeover for development of the airport had come out against the decision, the BJP, the Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Awake Trivandrum, an umbrella organisation of 25 forums supporting privatisation of the airport, have lauded the decision. “Daylight looting” Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran, who is also in charge of the district, described the decision as a “daylight looting” under the cover of pandemic. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the decision is part of privatisation of the public sector during the pandemic and the State should be allowed to operate the premier airport. Describing the decision as a “challenge” to the State, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran urged the Centre to withdraw from the decision. Local MLA V.S. Sivakumar said the Cabinet should revoke the decision as AEL would get airport land assets to the tune of Rs. 30,000 crore. “We are withdrawing from the decision to extend support to the government to acquire land for the integrated terminal as the airport is going to the hands of private player,” A. Saifudeen Haji and M. Vikraman Nair, chairman and convener respectively of the joint action council, said. Votaries of privatisation who believe AEL would usher in world-class development of the airport have supported the decision to rope in the private player. “An excellent decision by the Government of India. The airport should definitely see some progress,” G. Vijayaraghavan, former Technopark CEO said. “The AEL’s entry is following the neglect of the airport by the State and the politicians’ lethargy. The duty-free shop has remained closed for two years and land acquisition had been dragging on. AEL will change the face of the airport and exploit its potential,” says Chamber president S. Raghuchandran Nair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-makes-bid-to-stop-airport-takeover/article32399242.ece

Additional SP and OSD Ramakrishna Prasad said a report on the seizure will be sent to DGP D. Gautam Sawang who will take a decision on handing over the case to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). ‘Disproportinate assets’ Acting on a tip-off that firearms were illegally stored in a house in Gandhi Nagar of Bukkarayasamudram, Anantapur DSP G.

20 August 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Abandoned children restored to father||Three children, who were subjected to physical abuse, and later deserted by their mother, were handed over to their physically-challenged father at Thambuganipalle village, 25 km from here, on Wednesday. The woman had reportedly gone absconding with her eight-year-old daughter in the early hours, before the arrival of the police and their father. The four children were rescued by the Bangarupalem police on Monday after they got a call from the neighbourhood who found the children bruised and crying. As per reports, the mother, once a maid in Bengaluru, had lost the job due to the pandemic and returned to the village three months ago. She had reportedly been subjecting them to physical abuse, due to frustration, since then. The police had however allowed the children to stay with their mother until they found a place to rehabilitate them. Meanwhile, on Wednesday morning, on seeing the children abandoned and weeping, the neighbourhood informed the police, who rushed to the village and launched a search for their mother and sibling. The police contacted their father, Venkatappa, who had reportedly fled from the home three years ago. A Canadian NGO has come forward to sponsor dry ration to the family for the next six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/abandoned-children-restored-to-father/article32399304.ece
20 August 2020||ELAMANCHILI (WEST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Close call for TDP MLA, 14 others||Palakol TDP MLA Nimmala Ramanaidu and 14 others had a narrow escape when the boat in which they were cruising in the Godavari developed a technical snag and stopped in the swirling waters on Wednesday. The river was in spate for the last four days and was flowing at danger level, inundating hundreds of villages. Mr. Ramanaidu, his security personnel, and several party leaders planned to visit the flood-affected island villages, and so they took a country boat. On receiving information, Elamanchili SI Gangadhar and members of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team rushed to the spot in two boats and rescued the MLA and others, said West Godavari Superintendent of Police K. Narayan Naik. “The boat got stranded in the river at around 6 p.m. near Badava village. As the flood was heavy, the boat started going out of control. The sarang (driver) anchored it and alerted the police,” Narsapuram DSP P. Nageswara Rao told The Hindu . Mr. Ramanaidu and others were travelling in the boat to Puchhala Lanka without wearing life jackets. The police gave life jackets to all the passengers and rescued them, said Poduru SI Surendra, who participated in the operation. However, the MLA was not available for comment. Raft stuck Incidentally, about 15 YSRCP leaders, including former MLA Thota Trimurthulu, travelling on a raft, were trapped in the floods when they tried to visit the affected villages at Veeravalli Lanka in East Godavari district on Tuesday. They heaved a sigh of relief after the sarang successfully shifted them to the bund safely after an hour. SP’s advice “We are not allowing anybody to enter the river on country-made boats as the Godavari is in spate. People’s representatives, officials and the general public are requested not to travel on manual and motor boats in the river,” Mr. Naik said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/close-call-for-tdp-mla-14-others/article32399326.ece
20 August 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Difficult to diagnose COVID based on symptoms alone, say doctors||The challenges thrown up by the COVID-19 pandemic have brought the best of minds together. Two practising physicians based out of the U.S. have been actively involved in sharing their expertise with their counterparts in India. Sreenath Reddy Meegada and Vijay Dershan Muppidi have treated several patients in hospitals. In addition, they are involved as local principal investigators in research regarding use of convalescent plasma therapy conducted by Mayo Clinic. Dr. Sreenath Reddy said it is difficult to diagnose COVID based on symptoms alone as other respiratory viruses present with similar complaints. Diagnosis is usually done by performing a nasal swab and testing in lab to identify particles of the virus. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was believed to have spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another. “What makes it difficult to control the spread of the virus is that it mostly multiplies in throat. The patient is contagious or spreads the disease even before onset of the symptoms,’’ Dr. Sreenath Reddy said. While almost all age groups have been reported to be infected, those above 65 years, people with chronic medical conditions are affected more, Dr. Reddy said, adding that cases have been reported in children as well as pregnant women. Preventive measures include staying at home as much as possible, wearing a mask while in public or at work, practising social distancing, and washing hands frequently. Mortality benefit While a vaccine is still far away, much of the care is supportive. Recently, researchers in the UK found out that steroids (dexamethasone) have been found to impart mortality benefit. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, is being widely used in moderate to severe disease. Convalescent plasma is another modality believed to be useful. Tocilizumab is another medication used in moderate to severe disease. Based on our experience, patients who received plasma had better outcomes. Dr. Reddy can be reached on sreenathrd@gmail.com and +1 (269) 290-5396.

Chief Whip and YSRCP MLA G. Srikanth Reddy took on TDP district president and arch rival R. Sreenivasa Reddy head-on a day after the latter accused him of corruption in the execution of the Veligallu irrigation project. As the TDP charged the government with releasing Rs. 15 crore for a work already executed and paid for to the tune of Rs. 9 crore in the past, Mr. Srikanth Reddy clarified that the new release was necessitated to plug the breaches suffered in the canal and to ensure supply of water to the remote fields in its ayacut area. Mr. Srikanth Reddy accused Mr. Sreenivasa Reddy, who had unsuccessfully contested against the former in the general elections, of making “wild accusations” against him for cheap publicity without knowing the facts. He also pointed out that the TDP leader’s contract firm had allegedly been blacklisted way back in 2006. To prove his innocence and honesty, Mr. Srikanth Reddy dared him to visit Siddhi Vinayaka temple at Kanipakam or Narasimha Swamy temple at Tarigonda to swear in front of the deity. Responding to the allegations, Mr. Sreenivasa Reddy welcomed the Chief Whip to prove his charges by getting a probe ordered by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-tdp-leaders-continue-verbal-duel/article32399332.ece

20 August 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Decision to cut tobacco crop size draws flak||Tobacco growers in the traditional growing areas in Prakasam and SPSR Nellore districts, who were hoping to make good the losses incurred due to the lockdown coinciding with the peak marketing season, on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the Tobacco Board cutting the crop size. The ryots coming under the Southern Black Soil (SBS) and Southern Light Soil (SLS) auction platforms found fault with the crop regulator which at its meeting on Tuesday fixed a reduced crop of 71.34 million kg as against 86 million kg fixed during the last season. It was unfortunate that the growers in the drought-prone parts districts were equated with their counterparts in West Godavari district who enjoyed irrigation facility and given a quota of only 29 quintals per barn, they said. With lease alone accounting for Rs. 1,800 per quintal for curing, tenant, small and marginal farmers would have no option but to eschew the commercial crop which they had been cultivating all these years, said a tobacco farmer B. Ramanjaneyulu. ‘Reduce penalty’ Pressing for per barn quota of at least 37.91 quintals as during last year, another farmer T. Ramanaiah from Kandukur said they could get the advantage of economics of scale only when they took up curing at an optimum level. The board should consider reducing penalty for the excess crop from 15% to 5%, said another farmer V.V. Prasad from Chekurapadu who also pressed for restoration of per barn quota of 34.6 quintals. Former board member Ch. Ranga Rao said the board should take responsibility for marketing of the produce as the ryots had been turned into captive growers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/decision-to-cut-tobacco-crop-size-draws-flak/article32398882.ece

Horticulture Commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary says that the chilli farmers in the State have geared up to sow chilli with monsoon arriving at the right time. It is essential that they are trained on the market demand and good agricultural practices. But, it is not possible to gather farmers in large numbers in view of the pandemic. So, the digital training concept has been developed, he says.  Trial  basis Mr. Chiranjiv Choudhary says that the digital training concept was taken up on trial basis on July 31. Then, 140 participants, including 108 farmers from 17 villages of Krishna, Kurnool, Guntur and Prakasam districts took part. More than 150 farmers took part in the digital training conducted on Wednesday. "To understand the efficacy of the programme, an online assisted polling was held for participants. All participants expressed the view that the concept is useful. They have given 'Excellent' rating for the programme," he says. Services of the field staff present in villages have been used to gather five to eight farmers in one place by abiding physical distancing norm. The existing resources such as Rhythu Bharosha Kendras (RBKs), TVs, smartphones and video calling app have been leveraged to conduct the training programme. The farmers have been given a toll free number of ITC’s digital engagement center (call center), where farmers can connect to get their agriculture queries addressed at any point of time by agri experts.  To be replicated The Horticulture Department and ITC have planned to replicate the concept and continue training the farmers covering each and every stage of chilli production. This initiative is a part of “Integrated Agri Extension Platform for Chilli Value Chain Development” a successful PPP programme run by the Horticulture Department and ITC. In 2020, the 'Integrated Agri Extension Platform for Chilli Value Chain Development' project is set to cover 25,000 acres, covering 10,000 farmers with an aim to benefit 40,000 farmers in near future, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/training-for-farmers-goes-digital/article32398846.ece
20 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||ACB widens probe into ESI scam||Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) probing the multi-crore scam in the purchase of drugs, surgical equipment, lab kits and furniture in ESI hospitals and dispensaries, are probing the alleged role of 25 more persons in the fraud. The agency has so far arrested 12 persons, including former Labour Minister K. Atchannaidu. The then directors of the Directorate of Insurance Medical Services (DIMS) procured the material worth about Rs. 975.79 crore from June 2014 to March 2019. However, it was alleged that some public representatives, officers and staff of the DIMS and the Central Drug Stores formed into a syndicate, procured the drugs, surgical and lab equipment without calling tenders and note files and caused about Rs. 150 crore loss to the government. Disclosing this to newsmen here on Wednesday, ACB Joint Director (JD) P.V. Ravi Kumar said, the agency is investigating the role of some officials, medical shop owners and middlemen in the scam. “Based on call data and other sources, we are looking into the involvement of 25 more persons in the fraud. The bail and anticipatory bail petitions filed by the arrested in the ACB court were dismissed,” the JD said. The ACB has identified the role of eight more persons, including some officials and private persons, involved in Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) scam. Manhunt launched “Special teams are trying to arrest the accused, including Venkata Suresh, son of former Labour Minister Pithani Satyanarayana, staff of some private firms and proprietors of some drug stores,” Mr. Ravi Kumar added. “The accused procured the drugs and other material beyond the requirement and without any indents and violated the government orders. The equipment purchased include, digital X-rays, monitors, dental chair, BP apparatus, biometric machines, operation tables and other material,” the JD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acb-widens-probe-into-esi-scam/article32398852.ece

20 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Complaints of phone-tapping: ‘Centre will not intervene’||BJP MP G.V.L. Narasimha Rao has said complaints of phone tapping will be inquired by the CBI, or other agencies only as per the directions of the courts, or when the States request the Central government to look into such illegal acts of eavesdropping. The Centre would not order an investigation on its own, he said, referring to the letter written by former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing the media in New Delhi, Mr. Rao said Mr. Naidu had neither made a specific allegation that his phones were being tapped nor gave the names of others including judges, whose phones were under surveillance. There was no scope for the Central government to directly interfere in the matter. The courts know how to deal with it and had the powers to bring the culprits to justice, he said. The MP said the media was agog in 2015-16 that Mr. Naidu’s phones were tapped, but he never lodged a complaint. If he was worried, Mr. Naidu could ask the State to investigate, and if the State makes a request, duly backed by prima facie evidence, to the Centre, it might order a probe. Otherwise, the courts could get the complaints checked, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-wont-intervene-in-plaints-of-phone-tapping/article32398771.ece
20 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Little cheer for idol makers this year||Idol makers in the city are busy giving final touches to idols of Lord Ganesha, with just two days to go for the Vinayaka Chavithi festival. However, the usual atmosphere of festivity and cheer has now made way for gloom at the artisans’ workshops as idols remain unsold due to restrictions imposed on celebrations by the government in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kummari Veedhi, Allipuram, Simhachalam and One Town are some of the areas where idol makers are concentrated. “Two to three days before the festival, people would start coming in from various places to buy idols. There would be long negotiations and haggling over the prices, people would be taking pictures of the idols and we would be on our feet for hours handling customers. This year, it is different. Business has taken a severe hit and we are staring at unsold idols with only two days left for the festival,” said K. Gangamma, a resident of Kummari Veedhi. Small is big Every year, artisans prepare Ganesh idols of different sizes. But after the State Government issued orders restricting public celebrations in pandals, idol makers were forced to restrict themselves to making mostly clay idols of small sizes for homes. A number of NGOs and startups have placed orders for small Ganesha idols to gift to their dear ones. A number of people have set up stalls and are selling small clay idols at several places. “Due to restrictions, people are asking for clay Ganesha idols which can be immersed in a tub or bucket at one’s home itself. We have been receiving a few bulk orders, but it is nothing compared to last year. Vinayaka Chavithi is the only major festival in the year where we earn a substantial amount of money, but this pandemic has left us in the lurch,” said Madhavi, an idol maker from Simhachalam. There are some who have placed orders for Ganesha idols that are three feet in height. Artisans from Rajasthan have been working on idols at some parts in the city. Though there is no permission for setting up of idols in public places, it is learnt that people from apartments and group houses have ordered such idols to organise the festival and immerse the idol the next day. No public celebrations Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) Aishwarya Rastogi said that no permission will be given to people to organise Vinayaka Chavithi by at public places. The DCP also appealed to people to organise the festival at their homes. “There should be no gatherings or processions in view of the pandemic. Action will be taken against those violating norms,” he said. Meanwhile, the district police have also been creating awareness among the people in the rural areas, telling them that there is no permission for setting up of pandals in public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/little-cheer-for-idol-makers-this-year/article32399343.ece
20 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vexed with atrocity, tribals in AOB root for development||Vexed with the atrocities meted out to them by the banned CPI (Maoist), tribal people in the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) region are demanding that they want development and peace, not an ideology that ends in disillusionment. Police records suggest that the Maoists have killed 52 people in Visakha Agency in the last one decade. The victims include six tribal leaders, Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma who were gunned down on September 23, 2018. The latest to fall prey to the Maoist violence were M. Mohan Rao and M. Vijay Kumar from Chintalaveedhi village in Pedabayalu mandal on August 2. They died after they stepped on a pressure mine that was reportedly laid targeting the security forces. A few days later, the Moaists, in a statement, took the blame and regretted the deaths. “This is not enough. We have been enduring such violence since years. Killing people after branding them as police informers has become a norm. Ever since the Maoists have made the AOB their base, we have been caught in the crossfire between them and the security forces,” laments a senior leader of Girijan Sangham. Many youth were picked up just for speaking to a policeman or raising voice against the atrocities, he adds. ‘Living in fear’ In July 2018, Pangi Sattibabu and Gemili Bhaskar Rao were beaten to death in front of a village during a praja court (kangaroo court). The Moaists dubbed it as an act of revenge claiming that the victims had played a key role in the killing of their leader Sharat in October 2014. Sharat was lynched by a mob at Veeravaram when he, along with three of his comrades, killed a tribal priest Sanjeeva Rao on October 20, 2014. Another Maoist Kora Nageswara Rao escaped with injuries. “Such incients are common in the AOB region. We live in fear. They (Maoist) would just walk into our village and pick up anyone on suspicion,” says a former militia member, who called it quits years ago. A senior police officer who is actively involved in anti-Maoist operations says the residents of G. Madugula, GK Veedhi, Chintapalli, Koyyuru, Pedabayalu and Munchingput mandals have been bearing the brunt of such atrocities. Road connectivity More than the atrocities, the tribal people are now concerned about development. Call it political will or initiatives by the administration, development has percolated to some areas, making the people aspire for more. Yet, almost 1,400 villages in the AOB region are yet to have road connectivity . “Moists do not want roads to be laid as it will pave way for development,” observed ITDA PO S. Venkateswar. “Our coffee godowns are blown off, road laying equipment destroyed, cellphone towers torched. Even some coffee estates have been taken over by them. If we demand development, we are either tortured or killed. The Maoists say that they are people-centric, but their activities tell otherwise,” say Girijan Sangham members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vexed-with-atrocity-tribals-in-aob-root-for-development/article32399334.ece
20 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Simhachalam temple to get a new look under ‘PRASAD’||The temple of Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy atop the Simhachalam hill here is expected to get better pilgrim amenities with the Centre already giving conditional approval to the proposals submitted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh for taking up various development works under the PRASAD scheme. The project consultant and his team visited the temple, and held discussions with Executive Officer Bhramaramba, Tourism and Engineering officials recently. The Endowments Department officials explained their requirements. The Simhachalam temple has been selected under the Government of India’s Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) scheme, which envisages providing a religious tourism experience to the devotees. Works proposed The State government has already submitted proposals for Rs. 53.96 crore for taking up development works under the scheme. The proposals include widening of the 2-km narrow approach roads — the BRTS roads from Hanumanthawaka side and Gopalapatnam side — provision of a toll gate and parking facilities to those coming from the Hanumanthawaka side, construction of dormitories at the foothill, extension of the queue complex, provision of landscape and gardens, drinking water and shelters both along the ghat road and also on the steps leading to the hilltop. “The estimates will be prepared in tune with the requirements of the Endowments Department. But, the project has to satisfy the norms of the PRASAD scheme. The A.P. Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) will execute the works for the Endowments Department. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has been taking keen interest in the project,” says a tourism official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/simhachalam-temple-to-get-a-new-look-under-prasad/article32399337.ece

20 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Proposed buildings near Thotlakonda opposed by activists||Retired IAS officer and social activist E.A.S. Sarma has opposed the reported decision of the State Government to construct a housing complex and a VIP guest house in an extent of 30 acres within Survey no. 314 (old) of Kapuluppada village near the ancient Thotlakonda Buddhist site. Referring to news reports in this regard, Mr. Sarma, in a letter to Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, recalled his letters to the State Government in the past that the said site was notified vide G.O. no. 627 dated May 2, 1978, under the A.P. Ancient and Historical Monuments, Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960. Any proposal to divert any part of this stretch of land for the ‘Executive Capital’ would amount to violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned Act, he wrote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court, in its order dated November 29, 2016, had directed the State Government that no construction activity should be taken up within Survey No. 314 (old). The rationale of the statutory notification is that the entire stretch of Survey No. 314 is potentially rich in archaeological evidence, relating to the Buddhist era of the 3rd Century BC, and any attempt to interfere with that stretch is likely to efface that evidence to the detriment of public interest. The corresponding Central law and the notifications issued thereunder, another 300 m of a buffer zone consisting of ‘protected’, ‘prohibited’ and ‘regulated’ zones should also be left untouched. The Supreme Court, in its order dated January 16, 2012, reiterated this position and directed the authorities not to violate the same. The need for protecting the notified area had been justified by Lars Fogelin, an anthropologist, who carried out an extensive surface survey all around the Thotlakonda excavated site and discovered over 120 micro sites belonging to the Buddhist era, outside the fenced area of the site, and located within Survey No. 314. Mr. Sarma noted that despite several letters addressed time and again to the State Revenue Department, citing the case law on the subject, the State Government officials, either out of ignorance or for other reasons, seem to be persistent in diverting this land for construction activity, in violation of the Central and the State laws in place for the conservation of the ancient archaeological sites. He reiterated his plea to the government not to go ahead with the proposed interference with the land, failing which social activists would be constrained to seek judicial intervention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/proposed-buildings-near-thotlakonda-opposed-by-activists/article32399339.ece

20 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||High alert in Visakha Agency following heavy rains||The district authorities and the Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) are on high alert following heavy rains in the Visakha Agency area. All the 11 mandals in the Agency, which come under the ITDA, have been receiving heavy rains for the last 13 days, and a few of them such as Munchingput and Pedabayalu are the worst-affected. According to ITDA Project Officer S. Venkateswar, about 17 hamlets are cut off from the mainland due to landslips and overflowing streams. The Visakha Agency spans over 6,200 sq km and comprises 11 mandals. About 1,400 tribal habitations have no roads of any kind. During the rainy season, many of them remain cut off from the mainland. It is learnt that two small bridges, which included the one at Dumbriguda, have been washed away, cutting off a couple of hamlets from the mainland. But the ITDA has provided alternative routes to the hamlets. ‘No casualties’ “There are no casualties. But about three to four thatched houses have collapsed in a couple of hamlets,” Dr. Venkateswar has said. Landslips have occurred on the Paderu-Vizag, Araku-Vizag and Chintapalli-Vizag roads. “But the roads have been cleared for commuting in about 40 minutes,” he says. The ITDA has been on high alert since June as heavy rains are usually expected then. A number of schools, community buildings and panchayat offices in all the 11 mandals have been converted into shelter homes. ‘Medicines stocked’ “We have also stocked ration and other essential items in advance. The panchayat offices have been advised to act appropriately in case of emergencies. We have also put the medical teams on alert and ASHA workers have been told to stay put in their respective villages. Stocks of medicines have been provided to them,” says Dr. Venkateswar. Sanitation drive “The panchayat offices have been advised to take up sanitation drive to avoid outbreak of seasonal diseases after the rains,” he adds. Command control centres have been opened at all the tashildar offices in the 11 mandals and a central command control centre has been opened at the ITDA to monitor the situation. According to the PO, though there is no flood-like situation in the mandals, life has been affected to a certain extent, and efforts are on to restore normalcy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-alert-in-visakha-agency-following-heavy-rains/article32399323.ece

Kasimkota police found the body of Syamala (32), a resident of Gopalapatnam area, who was working as a medical officer at Rajendrapalem PHC in Koyyuru mandal. Suspecting it as a suicide as there were no injury marks on the body, police registered a suspicious death case. Two weeks have passed and the police are yet to arrive at a logical conclusion in the case. There are suspicions that there may be a family dispute angle. ‘No financial issues’ However, Syamala’s friends claimed that she had neither any financial issues nor any family dispute. “Syamala was a hardworking woman who always put her best foot forward for social service.

Mr Veerabhadram made a whirlwind tour of the flood affected areas in Bhadrachalam town and in Dummugudem mandal. He visited the flood affected AMC Colony and Kotha Colony, besides the flood relief camp at a local school in the temple town.

20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||6L Hyderabadis may have been infected||About six lakh or 6% of Hyderabad’s population could have been infected with the COVID-19 virus including symptomatic, asymptomatic, and also recently recovered individuals in a time window of about 35 days. A conservative estimate of the number of active cases shedding the virus may be around 2 lakh. This is according to a joint study taken up by CSIR institutions of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) after harvesting the sewage samples to estimate the number of potentially infected individuals in the city. It was carried out at 10 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and a gated community with the samples tested using the RT-PCR method. Faeces fit for study Individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 shed virus not only through nasal and oral routes but also through faeces and hence, provide an opportunity to use sewage/wastewater samples to estimate the spread of the infection in a given locality or area. SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples is non-infectious, thus making sewage samples suitable for epidemiological studies, said CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra on Wednesday. Sewage samples from major STPs were processed for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. While viral RNA is detectable in the inlet samples, the outlet (after treatment) samples of STP were largely clean (free from viral RNA) in this regard, indicating efficient treatment practices at STP. The study covers about 80% of STPs revealed that there are around 2 lakh people shedding viral materials. The findings are posted on preprint server, MedRxiv, which is yet to be peer reviewed. Many asymptomatic “Our finding clearly indicates that a large proportion of the affected individuals are asymptomatic and did not need hospitalisation. This is also in agreement with the observation that hospitalisation rush or mortality is way lower than otherwise expected with such a large infection rate at a given time. It explains why our healthcare system has been able to handle reasonably well the situation during the pandemic. Such studies if carried out in coordination with civic bodies to identify the hotspots in the city and monitor the dynamics of the infection rate can assist the system in taking necessary measures,” explained Dr. Mishra. Estimating the spread is very important in identifying the affected areas, and controlling the pandemic. Since an infected person sheds viral material in faecal samples for up to ~35 days, these studies will provide an overall estimate of the situation in a window of one month. All the experiments were conducted at the CSIR-CCMB’s COVID-19 testing facility and the teams included Hemalatha Manupati, Kopperi Harishankar and S.Venkata Mohan from CSIR-IICT and Uday Kiran, C.G. Gokulan and Santosh Kumar Kuncha from CSIR-CCMB, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/6l-hyderabadis-may-have-been-infected/article32399093.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Act against Niloufer diet contractor: HC||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to initiate action against diet contractor of Niloufer children hospital, Koduri Suresh Babu, within two weeks. A Bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the Special Chief Secretary of Medical and Health department that the action should be strictly in accordance with law. Details of the action taken in the matter should be informed to the court by September 16, the Bench said. The Bench passed the order in a PIL petition filed by Bhagawanth Rao of Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi seeking an inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds by the diet contractor. The CJ observed that the report submitted by Niloufer hospital superintendent said that the diet contractor drew excess bills and resorted to misappropriation of funds. Referring to the inquiry report findings, the Bench said that it was surprising that the government decided to entrust the diet supply works of Gandhi Hospital and Chest Hospital at Erragadda to Mr. Suresh Babu. The inquiry report was still pending for action by the government against the contractor, the Bench said. According to the report, there was huge difference between the number of diet indents and the entries in the diet supply register. Duplication of diet bills for the same patient was noticed. Random observation confirmed manipulation and tampering of diet numbers in indent slips by the diet contractor, the report presented before the court said. An excess of inpatient diet bills to the tune of Rs. 50,000 per ward per month were drawn by the diet contractor. The diet contractor’s counsel and former Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh Dammalapati Srinivas said action against Mr. Suresh Babu should be in accordance with law. He appealed to the court not to declare the diet contractor as the accused as the matter was still being heard and not adjudicated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/act-against-niloufer-diet-contractor-hc/article32399104.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||All-time high cropping in State||Telangana touched a new milestone in agriculture with sowings in the current season completed over 1.24 crore acres which is an all time high. With sowing of paddy still taking place in Suryapet, Khammam, Mancherial, Wanaparthy, Peddapalli and parts of Karimnagar and Jagtial districts for another fortnight, Agriculture Commissioner B. Janardhan Reddy expects the crop area to go up further by four lakh acres. The Agriculture Department had also foreseen the possibility of acreage going up to 1.25 crore areas when the season began. The season's normal was only 1.03 crore acres while the area was only 88.50 lakh acres till date last year. Active monsoon The cropping of paddy, red gram and cotton was completed over hundred per cent of the normal area due to an active monsoon this season even as recent heavy rains have submerged crops at several places. Paddy was sown over 58.69 lakh acres against the season's normal of 27.25 lakh acres, red gram 10.33 lakh acres against 7.61 lakh acres and cotton 45.09 lakh acres against 44.5 lakh acres. For the first time in the country, the figures were authenticated by customised phone messages to 57 lakh farmers in addition to departmental surveys, said Agriculture Commissioner B. Janardhana Reddy. The messages asked farmers to authenticate whether the information with the Agriculture Department about their land holdings and sown area were right. Mr. Reddy said the area of paddy is likely to go up further by four lakh acres as the sowing will continue for another fortnight.   He did not expect major damage to crop because it was still in its vegetative stage. Paddy, in particular, can withstand water logging in fields at this stage but cotton needed to be assessed after water receded from fields. It had to be assessed whether cotton crop will require mineral or chemical treatment. A clear picture will emerge in two or three days. A bulletin of agriculture earlier said the draining of excess water from the fields is taken up, according to the weekly bulletin issued by the Agriculture Department on Wednesday.  Nalgonda tops The State received a rainfall of 740.4 mm against the normal of 514.4 mm (74 per cent excess) till date. Most of the reservoirs also received good inflows. This led to hectic agricultural activity in villages. The sown area of all crops was the highest in Nalgonda at 10.75 lakh acres followed by Sangareddy, Nagarkurnool, Vikarabad, Adilabad, Khammam and Siddipet. The total acreage in these districts ranged from five to seven lakh. Among the districts with high cropping of paddy were Nizamabad (3.74 lakh acres), Nalgonda (3.42 lakh acres), Kamareddy (2.26 lakh acres) and Karimnagar (2.25 lakh acres). Red gram was largely cultivated in Vikarabad (1.82 lakh acres), Narayanpet (1.37 lakh acres) and Sangareddy (1.03 lakh acres). Cotton was sown in a big way in Nalgonda (7.06 lakh acres), Nagarkurnool (4.48 lakh acres), Adilabad (4.20 lakh acres) and Khammam 2.63 lakh acres. Curiously, maize which the government discouraged by warning farmers that they will not get investment support under Rytu Bandhu if they cultivated the crop was sown over 2.02 lakh acres against the season's normal of 11.76 lakh acres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-time-high-cropping-in-state/article32399123.ece
20 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Lake beds-turned-flats led to Warangal flooding||Over the past 50 years, 52 out of 247 water tanks have disappeared under the watch of the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC), according to official data of the Telangana Remote Sensing Centre. “This flood should be an eye-opener for the government. The tanks which have disappeared were part of a chain. Residential colonies which came up on these tank sites have been the most affected,” said M. Panduranga Rao, formerly with the National Institute of Technology, who has researched water bodies in the area for the past 50 years. While most of Warangal, Kazipet and Hanamkonda was flooded, the worst affected areas were Waddepally Colony, Hanamkonda bus station, Nayeem Nagar, Hunter Road, Fort Warangal, 100 feet road and many other areas where National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) personnel from Hyderabad were deployed for the rescue effort. Satellite imagery over the past 20 years shows the rapid transformation of lakes and lake beds into multi-storeyed residential complexes. What used to be called Balasamudram is now a residential colony called Sai Nagar. The disappearance of the lake sent the water flooding to other areas of Hanamkonda RTC bus station. The Kakatiya Colony on the banks of a nala that carried water to Lower Manair Dam was also flooded. Wedged between the Godavari and Krishna river basins, the district has chains of tanks that channel water to the two basins. This natural hydro-geology has been disrupted by runaway growth of residential colonies. “Four water tanks that were part of the Waddepally tank network have disappeared. This led to the flooding in the area. The storm water drains failed as their channels have narrowed considerably,” says Mr. Rao. Parts of the 100 ft road on the banks of the Waddepally tank was swept away by the flood waters. The Greater Warangal Smart City Corporation Limited has taken up a Rs. 68-crore promenade project on the Bhadrakali Lake foreshore area. The multi-crore beautification project looks like a lake reclamation project with entrance plazas, viewing decks, bird walks, rubberised walking tracks, toy train track and parking areas coming up on a space where the historical lake exists. The result has been flooding of the Hunter Colony and its surrounding areas. According to the meteorological department, the Warangal (urban) district has received 109%of the long-term average rainfall this season, while Kazipet received 158% excess rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lake-beds-turned-flats-led-to-warangal-flooding/article32399144.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rains fail to fill twin reservoirs||The twin reservoirs — Osmansagar and Himayatsagar — have dashed the hopes of city residents yet again, by receiving only a trickle of water despite heavy rains for close to a week. The city has been experiencing continual showers for the past one week, with respite of only a day. The heavy to very heavy rains which enveloped the whole state, have ensured that all the lakes are filled to the brim. Some of the lakes have begun to overflow too. Not the twin reservoirs dating back to Asafjahi-era though. They have remained as dry as ever, with grass growing far and wide within the full tank level. As per the daily report of the water board, for a capacity of 3.9 tmcft, the Osmansagar reservoir now holds mere 0.024 tmcft of water, while Himayatsagar holds 0.256 tmcft of water against the capacity of 2.967 tmcft. The same day last year, the reservoirs had 0.316 tmcft and 0.436 tmcft of water respectively. Water levels too have plummeted in both the reservoirs. Osmansagar with a full tank level of 1,790 feet, now has water up to only 1,754 feet, and Himayatsagar with a full tank level (FTL) of 1763.5 feet, is now down to 1,737 feet. Last year on the same day, the water levels hovered at about 1,764 feet and 1,741.5 feet respectively for both the reservoirs. Activists have long attributed the depleting water levels to rapid urbanisation of the catchment area, and rampant illegal construction in violation of government orders. ‘Not much rainfall’ Water board officials, however, maintain that the catchment areas have not received much rainfall, and hope is that more rains in the coming days could see the reservoirs full. Singur too has the same predicament, they said. The last time the lakes were filled up to FTL was more than 10 years ago, say experts. “Check dams constructed upstream and excavations for various purposes have contributed to the depletion of water in the reservoirs. The lakes might dry up in future, unless government takes a decision to fill them up using water from Krishna or Godavari rivers,” says G. Rameshwar Rao, a retired Director of water board and Chairman, Institution of Engineers. MD, HMWS&SB M.Dana Kishore could not be reached for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rains-fail-to-fill-twin-reservoirs/article32399118.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP leaders echo Governor’s concern over govt. strategy||Top leaders of Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rushed to the defence of Governor Tamilisai Sounderajan for her criticism of the TRS government’s handling of COVID-19 pandemic and claimed that she had expressed her views “as a doctor concerned with the health of the people”. Former BJP president K. Laxman, city president and MLA N. Ramchander Rao, and P. Sudhakar Reddy among others charged that the K. Chandrasekhar Rao-led government has been trying to browbeat and intimidate the office of the Governor by making ‘wild allegations’ and attributing motives to the office though she is the constitutional head of the State. Supporting the government and demanding an apology from the Chief Minister, Mr. Laxman said that instead of taking immediate corrective action to contain the pandemic, the TRS government has been using its MLAs to criticise the Governor. “There is a pattern. When she wanted to hold a meeting with the Chief Secretary in the past to take stock of the COVID situation, the Chief Minister prevented officials from attending the meeting and thereby tried to undermine the authority of the office,” said Mr. Ramchander Rao. The Governor had only repeated what the Telangana High Court had pointed out several times. The entire State now knows that TRS government has “miserably failed” to control COVID-19 and the people have become hapless victims to its criminal neglect, he claimed. TRS leaders were actually frustrated because BJP has been growing rapidly and therefore, it would want to attack the Governor’s office to deflect the criticism against government’s failure on public health and other issues. The Telangana government has been a “total failure” in COVID-19 management and it was clear from March onwards, Ms.Soundararajan had only stated the obvious and “exposed the obvious” nationwide, said chief spokesperson K. Krishna Saagar Rao. “She is also a doctor and had written several letters to the government about the pandemic containment but there has been no response. If citizens cutting across all sections are forced to fend for themselves during this public health crisis, what is the government for? It should answer the points raised by her,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-leaders-echo-governors-concern-over-govt-strategy/article32399095.ece
20 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||52.5 kg of narcotics seized||Officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence have made inroads into the recently busted drug racket network and unearthed 52.5 kg of narcotic drugs buried on the premises of banned Mephedrone manufacturing unit on the outskirts of the city. The operation resulted in the seizure of 45 kg of Ephedrine, a controlled substance and 7.5 kg of Mephedrone, a psychotropic substance under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The value of the seized Narcotic drugs is around Rs. 6 crore in the grey market, officials said. Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant drug generally abused for recreation and popular among the urban college-going crowd. It is colloquially known as bath salt, drone, M-CAT, Meow Meow etc. and is known for its effects similar to that of MDMA, amphetamines and cocaine. While Ephedrine is a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. On August 15, the DRI raided the Mephedrone manufacturing unit and arrested three people, including the kingpin of the gang, who was illegally manufacturing the banned psychotropic substance. They seized 142.6 kg of Mephedrone valued at Rs. 28.52 crore and 31 kg of Ephedrine worth Rs. 3.1 crore, apart from 250 kg of psychotropic drugs and raw materials worth Rs. 50 crore. Also, dollars and EUR currency equivalent to Rs. 45 lakh were seized. The drugs were meant for supply to various cities across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/525-kg-of-narcotics-seized/article32399108.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Water board launches call centre for one-time scheme||Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) on Wednesday launched a customer care centre on the premises of its headquarters, for the One Time Settlement scheme (OTS) announced a few days ago. The call centre will be available for consumers on the toll-free number of the board (155313), in order to clear their doubts about the OTS. Speaking on the launch, HMWS&SB MD M. Dana Kishore said the OTS, which was on from August 1 up to September 15, would provide the consumers an opportunity to avail themselves of interest waiver if the bill amount was paid in total. The call centre would have 45 customer care executives working on two shifts, who would let the callers know how much of the bill amount would be waived for each of them. They would also call the consumers who had their bills pending, and explain the scheme. Already SMSes are being sent to mobile numbers attached to the CAN accounts, about the pending bills. A WhatsApp chat bot account too has been launched for automatic response with regard to OTS. Consumers may send a message saying ‘HI’ to the contact number +91 9154170968 through WhatsApp, or open the link ‘https://wa.me/ 919154170968 ?text=Hi’ to know details of the scheme, pending bill amount, interest waiver applicable, and where the bill may be paid. Publicity campaign was also taken up on various social media platforms, besides electronic media, FM Radio, posters and pamphlets, to spread awareness about the scheme among public. Water tankers and autos with public address systems too were being used. Letters would be addressed to all the higher officials of the government departments asking them to pay the pending bills and avail of the interest waiver. Ten teams were formed with a total of 50 special officers to directly contact problematic consumers with high amount of pending bills and negotiate with them for payment. A dash board was established, including officials from MD to manager, in order to dynamically get information about the implementation, Mr. Dana Kishore said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-board-launches-call-centre-for-one-time-scheme/article32399116.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bus services come to a grinding halt||With the flooding in Warangal, TSRTC bus services have come to a grinding halt for the past four days. According to officials, the Warangal to Eturnagaram route sees the maximum number of buses running per day. However, after the floods, not a single service is running. “The busiest route is the Warangal-Eturnagaram (in Mulugu district) route and a majority of the revenues in the region come from here. There are around 85 services here alone. About a lakh passengers take this route per day and TSRTC makes about Rs. 8 lakh revenue per day from here. This route has totally come to a standstill because of the flooding. A large number of passengers here are working class people. As of Wednesday, it has not been restored,” an official of the TSRTC who did not wish to be named said on Wednesday. Some of the buses are being diverted from Warangal to Mulugu via Narsampet, where the detour is over 35 km, the official said. However, possible measures are being examined for resumption of services. Meanwhile, the bus services in Hyderabad district continue to remain suspended. An official in the know of developments said that apart from inter-district buses, there still is no clarity as to when city operations will be restored. “We are yet to have clarity on when the services will resume. The final call will be taken by the State government. With the lockdown being relaxed, there is movement of people across the city and we are getting to understand that residents want the resumption of services,” another official said. Meanwhile, trade unions of the TSRTC continued to demand that the corporation refer COVID positive cases to private hospitals for better treatment, even as they said that the TSRTC Hospital have a dedicated wing to treat coronavirus patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bus-services-come-to-a-grinding-halt/article32399141.ece

The mother and babe are safe, and were admitted to the isolation ward of Area Hospital in the district. Emergency Management Executive at the organisation, P. Sateesh, said they received the distress call in the evening seeking help for the 26-year-old pregnant woman. Her COVID-19 status was informed to them. She and her husband were picked up from Mallayapalli village in the ambulance and driven to the Area Hospital. Labour pain midway When we picked up the patient, she had labour pains which increased mid-way. Since we have handled deliveries in ambulances earlier, I understood she will deliver the baby. We stopped the vehicle by roadside and performed the procedure. It was a normal delivery,” said Khaja Moinuddin, an EMT. Prior experience EMTs are trained in handling maternal and paediatric emergencies as well as trauma cases. The organisation’s management said their EMTs had performed a few such deliveries on COVID-positive pregnant women earlier too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/emt-performs-delivery-of-covid-patient/article32399090.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Math prodigy clinches Olympiad gold||Far away from the madding crowds, a 20-year-old Hyderabadi clinched the first-ever gold for India as the fastest human calculator in the the world in the Mental Calculation World Championship at the Mind Sports Olympiad in London on last week’s Independence Day. Neelakantha Bhanu Prakash’s feat is also the first such by a non-European. Bhanu Prakash says the first edition of the competition was held in 1998 while last week’s was digital because of the pandemic. “It is an open event featuring 30 human calculators from 13 countries with an age limit of up to 50 years. In fact, the jury was so surprised with my score that they required me to perform a few more extra questions which I did properly,” he reveals. A Lebanese participant trailed behind by 65 points to bag the second position while a UAE participant came third. “That shows the sport picking up across Asia,” he says. An accident at the age of five had confined Bhanu Prakash to bed, but he recovered and went on to make a huge impact in the world of human calculators. “For long, I have been fascinated with math and believe it is all about doing calculations quickly and to think fast,” says the resident of Motinagar (Borabanda) here. Interestingly, Bhanu Prakash has four world records and also 50 Limca Records to his credit and is apparently delighted with the latest feat which he feels should only help his cause in eradicating the math phobia among students. “Well, when you come to know that the world record for the fastest human calculator was once held by the likes of Scott Flansburg and Shakuntala Devi, I do feel honoured to scale those heights,” he tells The Hindu . Bhanu Prakash has a start-up called ‘Exploring Infinities’ which focusses on mental calculation and popularisation of mind sports. “Given a chance I would like to make each and every student from the government schools of Telangana mathematically skilled and inculcate mathematical acumen required to crack competitive exams like Olympiads, JEE and NEET,” he added. With parents - J. Srinivas and Hema - into the food processing business, Bhanu Prakash has the liberty to focus on his passion and is determined to scale new highs in the days to come. “My goal is to change the ways maths is taught in the country and eradicate the phobia with it. I want to make Telangana the state with highest mathematical-literacy levels,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/math-prodigy-clinches-olympiad-gold/article32399099.ece
20 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Release Rs. 1,000 crore for crop damages, Revanth urges CM||Congress MP and Telangana Congress working president A. Revanth Reddy has demanded that the government give compensation of Rs. 20,000 per acre to farmers, given the severity of the crop damage due to the heavy rains during the last one week. In an open letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said the government should immediately release Rs. 1,000 crore for this purpose and save the farmers. He said agriculture fields in lakhs of acres in Warangal, Bhupalapally, Mulugu, Jangaon, Bhadadri Kothagudem, Mahabubabad and Siddipet districts were totally damaged while farmers in Karimnagar, Nizamabad and other North Telangana districts faced partial damage. The floods also led to land erosion and fields are now filled with sand dunes. Mr. Reddy criticised the government for not reaching out to the farmers so far despite realising the extent of damage done. He said it was irresponsible on the part of Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy to say that there was no crop damage and advised the Minister to speak to the farmers to assess the damage. He said the Pradhanmantri Fasal Bima Yojana has not benefited the farmers as the State government has failed to pay its share. He said last year farmers lost Rs. 960 crore from the insurance companies despite paying their share as the State government failed to pay its share of Rs. 513.5 crore. This year the scheme itself has been abolished and no new scheme has been introduced. So it was the responsibility of the government to compensate the farmers, he said. “What are the much touted Rythu Bandhu Samitis doing when the farmers are in distress?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/release-rs-1000-crore-for-crop-damages-revanth-urges-cm/article32399127.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Lawyers protest contempt proceedings against Bhushan||Several lawyers staged a demonstration outside the Telangana High Court building on Wednesday appealing to Supreme Court to withdraw contempt proceedings initiated against lawyer Prashant Bhushan. Pledging solidarity with Mr. Bhushan, who was held guilty of contempt of court by the apex court for his tweets against judiciary, the lawyers staged a silent demonstration protesting the contempt proceedings against him. “We appeal to the Supreme Court to withdraw the proceedings against Mr. Bhushan. Constitution has given right to every citizen to express his opinion,” lawyer V. Raghunath said while taking part in the demonstration. He observed that expressing one’s opinion on an action or issue cannot be construed as contempt of court. Taking up the issue of the tweets by Mr. Bhushan as an urgent matter was not a fair play, he said. Telangana Bar Council member and senior lawyer B. Konda Redy said it was the British who introduced contempt of court proceedings. While in England and other developed countries such proceedings were done away with, it was deplorable that they were being practised in the world’s largest democracy of India, he said. Mr. Reddy said that the apex court could have taken the opinion of Attorney General on the matter. Normally, people approach the courts to challenge the punishments awarded to them in any issue. “What are the options left for a citizen if the courts themselves hear an issue pertaining to them and award punishment,” he said. The lawyers appealed to Supreme Court to review its decision on Mr. Bhushan’s tweets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lawyers-protest-contempt-proceedings-against-bhushan/article32399140.ece

The Vice-Chancellor of UoH, Appa Rao Podile said the University is going ahead with this schedule after the Supreme Court gave its nod to holding JEE and NEET. The record number of over 62,000 candidates seeking admission this year will appear for the entrance exam in 38 centres across the country. The University, the Vice-Chancellor said, plans to complete the admission process and start classes for the new students latest by the first week of November. He said about 2,000 PG students will start classes online from Thursday. It has installed a Learning Management System (LMS) that can be used by faculty and students and by shoring up the ICT infrastructure at the departments and Schools. Given Internet connectivity issues faced by some students in remote locations, Prof. Appa Rao assured that online instruction will be primarily in the asynchronous mode, under the guiding principle of ‘leaving no student behind’. A Task Force headed by Prof. Vinod Pavarala outlined student welfare measures that were taken by the university to ease resumption for students, including sanction of digital access grant for disadvantaged students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uoh-entrance-exams-from-sept-24/article32399111.ece
20 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||YC activists protest at Facebook office||Activists of the Telangana Youth Congress protested at the Facebook office here, demanding action against its India Public Policy Director, Ankhi Das for her alleged discreet support to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and people associated with it. The activists led by Anil Kumar Yadav, president of TYC, sat on a protest in front of the Facebook office in Hi-Tec city and raised slogans against the BJP government at the Centre and also demanded action against Ankhi Das, who, hey said was supporting the BJP. Citing a report in the Wall Street Journal of the US, Mr Yadav said the report exposed how Ms. Ankhi Das was against taking action on the hate speeches of right wing leaders. He said the newspaper report also exposed how Facebook was helping the ruling party and because of which religious hate was being spread in the country. He said it was unfortunate that such platforms were being misused with the support of people within and they should be equally made responsible for the hatred being spread in the country by certain elements. He said the All India Congress had demanded a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) and it reflected the severity of the issue. The newspaper report cited the Goshamal MLA Raja Singh’s alleged hate speech prominently and how it was not taken out by the Facebook team due to the alleged support of Ankhi Das, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/yc-activists-protest-at-facebook-office/article32399113.ece

The driving school is envisaged to bring out the hidden talents among unemployed youth and hone their skills. It will deploy modern technologies for training youth in driving light and heavy motor vehicles. Automobile major Ashok Leyland agreed to extend its assistance in setting up the school to train unemployed youth. Accordingly, youths will be trained to drive heavy vehicles being used in irrigation, agriculture, transport and public sector undertakings like Singareni Collieries Company Limited, according to State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar. The development forms part of efforts to train youth in new technology vehicles like those complying with BS-6 standards as well as those entering the market. Youths undertaking training in the school will be given certificates by the National Skill Development Council, he said. Ashok Leyland has a tie-up with the Centurion University of Odisha from where the certificates would be issued. The certification would ensure that young people get better salaries after they get employed. Ashok Leyland Motors driving division head Mohammad Ali handed over the letter of the company’s consent to establish a training centre at Medchal to Mr. Vinod Kumar. Mr. Vinod Kumar said that the development follows the efforts he had made when he was an MP. The Central government had sanctioned a driving training centre at Mandepalli in Sircilla area of the erstwhile Karimnagar with an estimated Rs. 21.16 crore. Works on the training centre have now been fast-tracked. He said he had urged the Central government to set up similar training centres in Warangal and Adilabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-of-the-art-driving-school-to-come-up-in-medchal-soon/article32399138.ece
20 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Four held in fake certificate racket||A South Central Railway employee and his friend who were accomplices were apprehended by sleuths of Hyderabad Commissioner’s Task Force (North zone) on Wednesday on the charge of preparing fake educational certificates. The accused are Maloth Machender (46), a senior grade electrician with SC Railway from Malkajgiri, and Malladi Santosh Reddy (31), a private employee from Habsiguda. Two persons, Ammula Rajesh Kumar (30) of Mirjalguda and Akula Jayanth Kumar (39) from Parsigutta, who purchased fake certificate and secured jobs in Indian Post were also nabbed by the police. The investigators also seized 13 fake SSC marks memos, a laptop, two provisional engagement letters of Postal Department and five GDS online engagement applications from accused persons. Inspector K Nageswar Rao said the prime accused Machender was earlier arrested by Rachakonda police and Pattabhipuram police of Andhra Pradesh for luring unemployed youth on the pretext of providing Central and State government jobs. “He noticed that the postal department issued a notification in March 2018 for GDSBPM posts at various places and hatched a conspiracy to cheat people to make a quick buck,” Mr. Rao said. Acting on a tip-off, the task force team laid a trap and apprehended the accused persons, who were later handed over to Gandhi Nagar police for investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/four-held-in-fake-certificate-racket/article32399110.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC serves notices to State govt.||Telangana High Court on Wednesday issued notices to State government in a PIL petition questioning allotment of nearly 250 acres of land in Ghanpur (Mulugu) mandal of Jayshankar Bhupalpally district to different government departments.

20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Asaduddin faults UP encounters||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government has replaced rule of law with encounters so as to instil fear in communities and further Hindutva agenda. Taking to Twitter, he said: These encounters are a way of instilling fear in these communities & strengthening Hindutva ideology. Let's not forget that Dalits & Muslims are over represented in India's prisons. But in U.P., it's especially bad. 27% of undertrials - people who're innocent before law - are Muslim.” Quoting media reports, he further alleged that the U.P. government has not been adhering to rule of law, and instead, has replaced this with encounters. He said the police do not have the power to punish anybody. He further claimed that till December last year, the U.P. police was involved in as many as 5,200 encounters, and said that apart from those who have been killed, several have been shot in the legs. These people, he claimed, have been imprisoned and denied treatment. The AIMIM chief also tweeted that most subjected to these ‘half encounters’ belong to Muslim, Dalit or other Backward Classes communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/asaduddin-faults-up-encounters/article32399131.ece

20 August 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Rains dash hopes of green gram growers||Farmers, mainly green gram growers, bore the brunt of the heavy rains that lashed several parts of the district over the last one week, leaving hundreds of acres of agricultural fields drenched and mostly damaging green gram on little over 20,000 acres. Farmers cultivated green gram on about 24,500 acres in the district nurturing the hopes of good dividends with plans to invest the income from the short-term cash crop for growing other major crops. However, the green gram farmers suffered extensive crop damage in the midst of harvesting season as heavy rains dashed their hopes by causing inundation of agricultural fields in several low-lying areas along the swollen streams and other water bodies across the district. The farmers’ bodies estimate the extent of damage to green gram to be more than 20,000 acres. But official sources said the extent of damage to green gram could be little over 17,000 acres as per the preliminary assessment. On an average, each green gram farmer suffered an estimated loss of Rs. 50,000 per acre due to the damage caused by water logging of agricultural fields under the impact of the rain fury in various parts of the district, said the CPI (M) district secretary Nunna Nageswara Rao. The nature’s fury has inflicted an enormous loss to an extent of Rs. 100 crore on green gram, cotton and chilli growers, he said, adding that the government should provide at least Rs. 40,000 compensation per acre to each rain-hit farmer. Green gram, cotton and maize farmers are the worst hit by the heavy downpour that battered many parts of the district in the last couple of days, said Telangana Rythu Sangham district secretary Madineni Ramesh.The distraught farmers are desperately looking for financial aid from the government to overcome the huge losses suffered by them on account of nature's fury, he added. The exact extent of damage to green gram could be ascertained only after completion of the ongoing field visits to the rain-hit areas, said Vijaya Nirmala, Joint Director of Agriculture, Khammam, who visited the rain-ravaged agricultural fields in Beerolu and Medidapalli in Tirumalayapalem mandal on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rains-dash-hopes-of-green-gram-growers/article32399130.ece

20 August 2020||Ahmedabad,||Gujarat ATS arrests man sent by Chhota Shakeel to kill BJP leaders||The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) has arrested a sharp shooter who was allegedly sent by gangster Chhota Shakeel to kill BJP leaders, Gujarat Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said on Wednesday. Search is under way for an accomplice of the accused, Mr. Jadeja told reporters in Gandhinagar. Since preliminary investigation revealed that BJP leader and former Gujarat home minister Gordhan Zadafia was one of the targets, Mr. Jadeja said he has asked the State Director General of Police to step up Mr. Zadafia’s security.  “Based on a tip-off that Chhota Shakeel sent two men to kill BJP leaders, the ATS team raided a hotel on Relief Road in Ahmedabad on Tuesday night. The accused fired one round at the police when they tried to catch him,” Mr. Jadeja said. The accused has been identified as Irfan Shaikh, 23, a resident of Chembur in Mumbai, an ATS officer said. Two pistols were recovered from his possession. “The ATS found Mr. Zadafia’s information on the mobile phone of the accused. A video of the State BJP headquarters, Kamalam, was also found in it,” Mr. Jadeja said. Search is on for his accomplice, who was not present at the spot when the police raided the place, he said. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Shaikh first went to Gandhinagar to conduct a recce of the State BJP headquarters. “He came back to the hotel after making a video of the BJP office. He was waiting for his accomplice when we raided his room. We have learnt that the accused was in contact with his handler, whose location is unknown,” an ATS officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gujarat-ats-arrests-man-sent-by-chhota-shakeel-to-kill-bjp-leaders/article32399231.ece
20 August 2020||Mumbai,||Maharashtra, Goa Bar Council backs SC on contempt||The Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa passed a resolution on Wednesday supporting the Supreme Court’s judgement against Prashant Bhushan, holding him in contempt for his tweets against Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde. The council, which represents 1,75,000 lawyers in Maharashtra and Goa, said, “It is unfortunate that when political ends of lawyers are not served by a decision of the court, they vilify the court by making scandalising remarks. The Supreme Court of India as well as the judges are subject to both scurrilous language, malicious attacks and scandalising remarks.” It said while legitimate criticism of both judgments and the functioning of the institution have always existed, when the system miscalculated and actuated by malice, the authority of the court is undermined. ‘Must protect dignity’ The resolution, which has been signed by chairman Subhash Ghatge, said, “If the judiciary is to perform its duties and functions effectively, it is essential to protect the dignity and authority of the courts. The foundation of the judiciary is the confidence of the people in its ability to deliver justice.”According to the resolution, actions of institutional disruptors through name calling and usage of phrases such as ‘Supreme Court has destroyed democracy’ and ‘the Supreme Court is killing the Constitution’ have the tendency to destroy the faith of the public in the judicial system. The resolution also said, “We are in total agreement with steps taken by the justice delivery system of India. We unanimously state that the efforts of pressurising Hon’ble judges, by making reckless statements are in total derogation of the Constitution of India.” ‘Trend to malign SC’ It said the trend to malign Supreme Court is dangerous and must be dealt with iron hand. “Anyone who maligns the Supreme Court of India must be dealt as per law. We repose confidence in the entire judicial system and we condemn the efforts to pressurise the judiciary,” the resolution said. The council has forwarded the resolution to the Chief Justice of India, Chief Justice of Bombay High Court and Chairman of Bar Council of India. On August 14, the Supreme Court had held Mr. Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for posting tweets against the judiciary. These included a comment on a photograph of CJI Bobde sitting on a Harley Davidson, and an allegation that the last four CJIs played a role in destroying democracy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-goa-bar-council-backs-sc-on-contempt/article32399228.ece
20 August 2020||Mumbai,||MSRTC to resume inter-district services today||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced the resumption of inter-district bus services of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) from Thursday. Transport Minister Anil Parab said passengers would not require an e-pass for travel and ticket rates will remain unchanged. Mr. Parab said all MSRTC buses, including normal, semi-luxury, Shivshahi and Shivneri, will restart services. Private bus operators have not yet received permission to resume services. “However, passengers need to follow all safety norms laid out by the State government to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus,” the minister said. MSRTC’s inter-district bus operations were suspended after the lockdown was enforced in the State in March to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the State government on Wednesday allowed actors and crew members above the age of 65 to resume film and television shootings by adhering to safety protocols. State Cultural Affairs minister Amit Deshmukh said the government issued two government resolutions (GRs), on May 30 and June 23, barring artistes and crew members above 65 from taking part in film and TV shootings as they were susceptible to contracting COVID-19. “The Bombay High Court has given its directions to allow them to resume shooting. Therefore, they can now participate,” he said. On August 7, the High Court set aside the GRs after observing that they breached the fundamental rights of the artistes to practise their trade and earn a livelihood with dignity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/msrtc-to-resume-inter-district-services-today/article32399223.ece
20 August 2020||Navi Mumbai,||4 lakh tonnes of used gloves seized; one held||The Navi Mumbai Crime Branch’s Unit I seized four lakh tonnes of used gloves from a unit at Gami Industrial Park in Pawane MIDC on Tuesday. The officers said the gloves were being washed, dried and repackaged for sale. Senior police inspector Subhash Nikam formed a team and raided Sign for Safety India Private Limited based on a tip-off received by assistant police inspector Rahul Rakh from Unit I. The team seized 263 sacks with four lakh tonnes of used hand gloves and 17 packets of washed and dried gloves. Bought from hospitals The officers arrested Prashant Ashok Surve (38), a resident of Belapur, who ran the unit along with 16 workers. He said he procured the gloves from several hospitals in the State. Mr. Rakh said, “Two automatic top load washing machines and three blowers were used to wash and dry the gloves. The gloves were purchased at Rs. 300 per kg and sold at Rs. 15 per pair. The accused has sold these gloves in many States after receiving online orders. We are verifying if any other distributor is involved in the sale of these gloves.” The officers said the accused earlier ran Siddhi Sai Arts, which made digital signboards. With lockdown restrictions affecting his business, he started selling hand sanitisers, face masks and personal protection equipment kits. While the other products were purchased with an invoice, no record of buying the hand gloves was found. ‘Had bloodstains’ The officers said some of the gloves had bloodstains. The Crime Branch has launched an investigation to identify the hospitals that sold the used gloves to Mr. Surve instead of disposing them of as biomedical waste. Mr. Surve was charged under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, and relevant provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act. The accused was produced before the court on Wednesday and has been remanded in police custody till August 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/4-lakh-tonnes-of-used-gloves-seized-one-held/article32399224.ece
20 August 2020||Pune,||COVID-19: Pune’s doubling rate improves to 41 days||Even as Pune continues to report an average daily surge of over 1,100 COVID-19 cases, a silver lining is that the city’s doubling rate has improved to 41 days — the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic in March. Rubal Agarwal, Additional Municipal Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (PSCDCL), said the number of days it took for positive cases to double had improved to 41.83 days. Over 5,000 tests daily “This is certainly a heartening indicator. Furthermore, since August 7, the PMC has carried out over 75,500 rapid antigen tests, with an average of around 5,000 tests a day, besides intensively focusing on contact tracing,” Ms. Agarwal said while speaking to The Hindu . She said till date, civic authorities, as part of contact tracing, have screened 8.04 lakh people in the city, of whom 2.38 lakh are high-risk contacts. “Through household, door-to-door and mobile ambulance surveys, and flu clinic referrals, we managed to trace 2,38, 325 ‘first contacts’ or the high-risk ones. Of these, over 60,000 tested positive,” Ms. Agarwal said. As per data given by the PMC, the city’s total case tally stands at just over 76,000, with nearly 60,000 recoveries and around 14,500 active cases. The death toll stands at 1,962. Ms. Agarwal said the active cases, too, had come down from 27% to 19% in the last 10 days. “At the moment, our recovery rate stands at a robust 78.34%. Our teams are pulling out all stops, from sample testing to screening. Our focus is on bringing down the case fatality rate, which stands at 2.38%,” she said, adding that around 800 patients were in a critical condition, of whom more than 450 were on ventilator. ‘Take threat seriously’ Stressing that it was imperative for the public to take the threat of the virus seriously, Ms. Agarwal appealed to people to behave responsibly during the Ganesh Chaturthi festivities by remaining indoors and helping break the chain of transmission of the novel coronavirus. “We can go on increasing our testing capabilities and screening even more intensely, but there is only so much that the PMC and its medical staff can do. The people cannot afford to be complacent during this unlocking phase and keep roaming around the city without any cause,” she said, adding that in several cases, individuals were found congregating at places without reason and observing elementary precautions. Monitoring small pandals While the bigger Ganesh pandals in Pune, like Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati, have already declared that there would be no public ceremonies this time and are encouraging online worship, Ms. Agarwal is worried that monitoring smaller, unregulated pandals might put a strain on the civic body’s overstretched resources. “The larger pandals have already taken the lead in discouraging assembly and mass gathering during the Ganapati festival. But the case positivity rate has yet to decline drastically. So, it is up to the public to maintain order and act in a restrained fashion to reduce the rise in cases,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/covid-19-punes-doubling-rate-improves-to-41-days/article32399226.ece

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Joe Biden wins Democratic nomination||Former U.S. Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the Democratic Party’s nomination for the presidency on Tuesday night U.S. time. The nomination was expected and confirmed on Day 2 of the virtual Democratic Convention by way of a virtual roll call across 57 States and territories. The “Roll Call Across America” was a virtual substitute for what normally happens: an in-person roll call at the convention venue (in Milwaukee this year), which could not be held due to the pandemic. Delegates from diverse locations, including one standing in front of livestock on a Montana ranch and some on a beach in American Samoa, declared, for their respective territories, the number of votes cast for Mr. Biden and his main challenger, progressive candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders. Prior to the roll call, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter delivered messages of support for Mr. Biden’s candidacy. Day 2 of the Convention was also forward-looking: featuring young and future leaders of the party. The keynote address was unconventional: video messages from close to 50 individuals, including 17 elected Democratic officials, most of them young leaders. Continuing a theme introduced by former First Lady Michelle Obama, who said, “It is what it is” about President Donald Trump’s fitness for the top job, Mr. Clinton elaborated on the origins of that phrase — an Axios interview of Mr. Trump in early August. “When asked about the surge in deaths, he [Mr. Trump] shrugged and said, ‘It is what it is,’” Mr. Clinton said. “If you want a President who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man. Denying, distracting, and demeaning works great if you’re trying to entertain and inflame. But in a real crisis, it collapses like a house of cards,” Mr. Clinton said. “COVID doesn’t respond to any of that. To beat it, you’ve got to go to work and deal with the facts. Our party is united in offering you a very different choice: a go-to-work president. A down-to-earth, get-the-job-done guy,” he said. ‘Right person’ Mr. Carter spoke of Mr. Biden’s experience as a family caregiver, as a young widower — and more recently when his son Beau Biden died of cancer in 2015. Calling Mr. Biden a “loyal and dedicated friend”, he said Mr. Biden was the “right person for this moment” in America’s history. “He understands that honesty and dignity are essential traits that determine not only our vision but our actions. More than ever, that’s what we need,” Mr. Carter said. Former U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also delivered an audio message. Also featured was one of the potential future leaders of the Democratic Party, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of Queens, New York. Ms. Cortez spoke for about a minute and a half to second the candidacy of Mr. Sanders. Political movement She used her time to praise the political “movement” headed by Mr. Sanders, which she characterised in part as “a mass people's movement working to establish 21st century social, economic and human rights, including guaranteed health care, higher education, living wages and labour rights for all people in the United States”. Other speakers for the evening included former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy, and her son, as well as former Republican Secretary of State Staff Colin Powell. “With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries,” Mr. Powell said. The programming ended with a segment on former Second Lady Jill Biden (Mr. Biden’s wife). This featured clips of how Mr. and Ms. Biden met, after the former Vice-President’s daughter and first wife were killed in a car crash and Mr. Biden was raising two boys. “How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole,” Ms. Biden said. “With love and understanding — and with small acts of kindness. With bravery. With unwavering faith.” A live shot of Ms. Biden, a professor of English and a former school teacher, standing in an empty classroom followed. “Yes, so many classrooms are quiet right now,” she said. “…With Joe as President, these classrooms will ring out with laughter and possibility once again.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/joe-biden-wins-democratic-nomination/article32398752.ece
20 August 2020||Jerusalem,||Israel bombs Gaza after warning Hamas||Israeli warplanes bombed the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip overnight after Palestinians fired a rocket into southern Israel, the army said. The latest exchange came as Israel warned Hamas it was risking “war” by failing to stop fire balloons being launched across the border. Egyptian security officials shuttled between the two sides in a bid to end the flare-up, which has seen more than a week of rocket and fire balloon attacks from Gaza and nightly Israeli reprisals. “Earlier tonight, a rocket was fired and during the day, explosive and arson balloons were launched from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory,” said a military statement released by Israel. In response, “fighter jets and (other) aircraft struck Hamas military targets in Gaza”. “During the strike, a military compound belonging to one of the special arrays of the Hamas terror organisation was struck,” the statement added. There were no reports from Gaza of casualties. In Gaza city on Wednesday, demonstrators burned Israeli flags and pictures of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in protest at last week’s announcement that the United Arab Emirates was normalising relations with the Jewish state. Many Palestinians saw the move as a betrayal of their cause by the Gulf country. Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it would not follow the UAE in establishing diplomatic ties with Israel until the Jewish state had signed an internationally recognised peace accord with the Palestinians. Marchers carried placards reading, “Palestine is not for sale, down with the deal of shame.” “We reject normalisation from any country and from any regime,” senior Hamas official Khalil al-Haya said during the protest. In response to the persistent balloon launches, Israel has banned fishing off Gaza’s coast and closed the Kerem Shalom goods crossing, cutting off deliveries of fuel to the territory’s sole power plant. Power had been in short supply even before the shutdown, with consumers having access to electricity for only eight hours a day. That will now be cut to just four hours a day using power supplied from the Israeli grid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-bombs-gaza-after-warning-hamas/article32398755.ece
20 August 2020||Bamako,||Mali wakes up to military rule after President is forced out||Mali awoke on Wednesday to a new chapter in its troubled history after rebel military leaders forced President Boubacar Keita from office, prompting its West African neighbours to threaten border closures and sanctions against the coup leaders. Mr. Keita, embattled by months of protests over economic stagnation, corruption and a brutal Islamist insurgency, said he had resigned to avoid bloodshed. There were few obvious traces of the previous day’s drama in the capital Bamako — there were no troops on the streets despite the coup leaders announcing a night-time curfew. The burnt-out home of the former Justice Minister after an attack by protesters was one of the few visible signs of the overthrow. UN seeks Keita’s release Jubilant crowds had cheered the rebels on Tuesday as they arrived in Bamako, where they detained Mr. Keita along with Prime Minister Boubou Cisse. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded the “immediate and unconditional release” of both men as diplomats in New York said the Security Council would hold emergency talks on Wednesday. It was unclear whether Mr. Keita was still in custody on Wednesday at the Kati military base — a facility seized by the mutineers that was also the site of the 2012 coup that brought him to power. The coup leaders appeared on television overnight to pledge a political transition and new elections within a “reasonable time”. Malian Air Force deputy chief of staff Ismael Wague said he and his fellow officers had “decided to take responsibility in front of the people and of history”. There were no reports of casualties during the military takeover but the coup leaders announced a curfew and border closures, in effect sealing off the country. French President Emmanuel Macron was among the first to condemn the mutiny, his office saying that he still supported mediation efforts by other West African states. Mali is the cornerstone of French-led efforts to roll back jihadists in the Sahel, and its neighbours are anxious to avoid the country sliding into chaos. Colonel Wague said “all past agreements” would be respected, including Mali’s support for anti-jihadist missions in the region. “MINUSMA (the UN force in Mali), (France’s) Barkhane force, the G5 Sahel, Takuba (a European special-forces initiative) remain our partners,” he said. The coup leaders also remain “committed to the Algiers process,” a 2015 peace agreement between the Malian government and armed groups in the north of the country, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mali-wakes-up-to-military-rule-after-president-is-forced-out/article32398758.ece
20 August 2020||Brussels,||EU rejects Belarus poll result, warns sanctions are imminent||The European Union on Wednesday rejected the result of the disputed Belarus election, saying President Alexander Lukashenko’s victory was neither free nor fair, and warned fresh sanctions against his government were imminent. After an emergency video summit, EU Council President Charles Michel told the people of Belarus the bloc stood “by your side” as unprecedented protests against strongman Mr. Lukashenko entered an 11th day. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for national dialogue in Belarus — including Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years — to find a peaceful way out of the crisis. The EU has been working on a new round of sanctions against Belarus, targeting those involved in allegedly fixing the August 9 vote and in the bloody repression of protests, which have shaken Mr. Lukashenko’s grip on the ex-Soviet republic as never before. Mr. Michel said this would lead “shortly” to “a substantial number of individuals responsible for violence, repression and election fraud” being hit with EU travel bans and asset freezes. “These elections were neither free nor fair and did not meet international standards. We don’t recognise the results presented by the Belarus authorities,” Mr. Michel told reporters. “The people of Belarus deserve better. They deserve the democratic right to choose their leaders and shape the future.” Mr. Michel, along with Ms. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, all held telephone talks with Mr. Lukashenko’s close ally Russia to push for dialogue to end the crisis peacefully.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-rejects-belarus-poll-result-warns-sanctions-are-imminent/article32398753.ece
20 August 2020||Dubai,||UAE connects first Arab nuclear plant to power grid||The oil-rich United Arab Emirates announced on Wednesday that it has connected its Barakah nuclear power plant to the national grid in a new first for the Arab world. The milestone follows the successful start-up of the plant’s first reactor at the end of last month and launches the UAE on the road to meeting 25% of its electricity needs from nuclear power. “The safe and successful connection of Unit 1 to the UAE grid marks the key moment when we begin to deliver on our mission to power the growth of the nation by supplying clean electricity, around the clock,” said Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation CEO Mohamed Ibrahim al-Hammadi. “We are confident in our people and our technology to continue to progress to reach... the completion of the remaining three units, with the goal to power up to 25% of the UAE’s electricity needs for at least the next 60 years.” The plant on the Gulf coast west of Abu Dhabi had been due to go online in late 2017 but faced delays that officials attributed to safety and regulatory requirements. The UAE has substantial oil and gas reserves, but with a power-hungry population of 10 million, it has made huge investments in developing clean alternatives, including solar energy. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, has said it plans to build up to 16 nuclear reactors, but the project has yet to materialise. Barakah was built by a consortium led by the Korea Electric Power Corporation at a cost of some $24.4 billion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uae-connects-first-arab-nuclear-plant-to-power-grid/article32398760.ece
20 August 2020||Islamabad,||Pakistan rejects any possibility of diplomatic ties with Israel||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has categorically rejected any possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, according to a media report. “Our policy on Israel is clear: The Quaid-i-Azam (Muhammad Ali Jinnah) had said that Pakistan can never accept state of Israel until the people of Palestine get rights and an independent state, Mr. Khan said in an interview to private news channel Dunya TV on Tuesday. Pakistan and Israel do not have diplomatic relations and their aircraft are not allowed to use each other’s airspace. “If we recognise Israel and ignore tyranny faced by the Palestinians, we will have to give up Kashmir as well, and this we cannot do, he said. His remarks came in the backdrop of recent peace overtures between the UAE and Israel, with the former becoming only the third Arab nation to enter into a peace deal with the Jewish state. When asked to comment on the UAE’s ties with Israel, Mr. Khan said that every state had its own foreign policy. He also rejected the impression that Pakistan’s relations with Saudi Arabia were under stress due to the Kashmir issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-rejects-any-possibility-of-diplomatic-ties-with-israel/article32398759.ece

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||China-Russia ties as a major determinant||In June 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping described Russian President Vladimir Putin, as “my best friend and colleague”. At no time since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 has such public bonhomie been seen between leaders of Russia and China. It has sparked intense discussion on whether they are moving in the direction of a formal alliance, and what that could mean for the rest of the world. The key triangle The triangular relationship between America, China and Russia has, for the most part, shaped global politics since 1950. For the American Cold Warriors, the road to victory lay through Peking; today, the Kremlin seems to believe that the road to revival of Russian power and prestige similarly runs through it. India is not a part of this triangle; yet they represent our three most consequential relationships. Hence, a proper appraisal of the Sino-Russian relationship will be critical to our foreign policy calculus. Even before COVID-19, the dynamics of this strategic triangle were changing. As Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, an American expert on both Russia and China, put it, for three decades the Americans had occupied the favoured position in terms of its relations with the other two. China seems to have assumed that position. Second, the disintegration of the Soviet Union essentially negated the Russian threat in Chinese eyes. Both these trends will likely continue despite the recent tensions in Sino-U.S. relations. Columns of the partnership The three pillars on which the Sino-Russian partnership currently rests are a peaceful boundary, expanding trade and a shared distrust of American intentions. Western sanctions have tended to push the Russians closer to China. Falling oil prices and fears of new sanctions on Russian gas supplies (Nord Stream 2) are demolishing the core of Russian exports to Europe, thus compelling them to depend to an even greater degree on the Chinese. Ironically, even though it is in neither Russia’s nor the European Union’s interest to hasten a bi-polar world, western actions to punish Russia have served to strengthen China’s position in the strategic triangle. It is no coincidence, as Russian experts Alexander Gabuev and Temur Umarov have shown, that after the western sanctions, China-Russia trade has more than doubled to $108 billion, Russia’s central bank has increased its Chinese currency reserves from less than one per cent to over 13%, and China has surpassed Germany as the principal supplier of industrial plant and technology. These economic positives appear to enhance what is seen in Washington and European capitals, as a growing strategic convergence. Coordinated action in multilateral forums, increasingly sophisticated joint military exercises, and including activities with third countries such as Iran, reinforce western beliefs about it morphing into an alliance. Lost in this maze of concerns is one simple fact, namely that the growing power-gap is threatening to further reduce Russian influence in their ‘near-abroad’ and to confine Russia to the periphery of global power. Russia still regards itself as a world power and hopes to be at the centre of a Eurasian arrangement that stretches from the Pacific to the Atlantic. It considers U.S.-led hegemony as the primary threat to this vision, and this leads them on to make common cause with China. That does not automatically translate into a formal alliance, nor does it make their concerns about China disappear. China’s rise, Russia’s unease The three pillars on which the relationship stands are not as sturdy as they may seem. Take, for example, the fact of their peaceful border. Mr. Xi’s talk of “rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation” has raised fears about Chinese revanchism. In an essay published by former Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying in 2016, who is seen as an authoritative voice of influence in China, she frankly acknowledges that China’s rise has produced discomfort among some Russians. Fu Ying notes that some Chinese continue to nurse historical grievances despite the formal resolution of the border issue, and still make critical references to the nearly 600,000 square miles of Chinese territory that Tsarist Russia allegedly annexed in the late 19th century. Add to this the Russian concerns over Chinese migration in the Russian Far East, and it would not be improper to surmise that policymakers in Moscow must be concerned about the possibility of China becoming a threat Russia’s territorial integrity. Advantage China in trade As for the economic pillar, while Russia presently enjoys a nominal trade surplus, going beyond gross trade to value-added trade, China has a clear advantage going forward. Most of its exports to Russia are now at a higher technology level while the share of labour-intensive goods has declined. At the other end of the spectrum, Russian exports have continued to focus on raw materials, especially oil and gas. Despite Chinese promises, the investment relationship remains subdued except where it has suited China’s core energy interests, such as the $400 billion deal over 30 years to supply gas to China along the 1,800 miles long pipeline known as the Power of Siberia. Russia remains wary about allowing any dominating role for China in oil and gas. In fact, over the long term, their economic interests are divergent. Russia presumably thinks to control China through its energy dependency, a situation that the Chinese will not accept; and China feels that it can integrate Russia into its economy by re-directing Russian oil and gas eastwards but, while Russia needs financing, it is unlikely to give up its economic independence or sovereignty. As for their shared dislike of Washington, each still hopes to repair ties and, therefore, neither trusts the other fully with respect to the third leg of the strategic triangle. If they share a current concern over American plans for “regime-change”, it has led them to mind each other’s backs, but that does not necessarily make for a long-term meeting of minds. The supply of the S-400 missile system to China is touted as an example of the budding strategic alliance; but is it not also possible that this sale could well be one of the last chances for Russia to engage in a major sale of military equipment to China before the latter becomes self-sufficient in defence? The new reality of Sino-Russian relations is thus one where substantial expansion of bilateral cooperation is accompanied by growing asymmetry and China’s pre-eminence, including in Russian ‘backyards’ such as Central Asia and the Arctic regions. Moscow is in real danger of permanently becoming the ‘junior partner’. India and Russia ties Sumit Ganguly, in his article in Foreign Policy last month, makes out a case for India to re-calculate its relationship with Russia. His contention is that the politically reliable, trustworthy defence supplier with shared misgivings about the Dragon, that was the Soviet Union of yore, has long been replaced by a politically agnostic, commercially motivated Russia that no longer shares our concerns about China. This might be valid if China is the principal factor in our relations with Russia, but that is not the case. It never was even in the 1960s and the 1970s. A strategic partnership with Russia based on the absence of fundamental conflicts of interest and a shared belief that some form of multipolarity is better than any sort of Sino-U.S. condominium, is important for India, and this relationship deserves more attention from both sides. In the words of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Moscow on September 20, 1982, “the garden of friendship like all gardens must be consistently tended”.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Privatisation via graded autonomy||The Indian Cabinet approved the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, despite vehement opposition to several of its provisions that were earlier circulated as a draft policy document. Among these provisions is the phasing out of the system of affiliated colleges and the grant of greater autonomy in academic, administrative and financial matters to premium colleges, and essentially, to the top ranked universities of the country. This measure has drawn on the long-standing anxieties about the perils of politico-bureaucratic interference in the internal functioning of universities, and concerns about the substantial burden on universities which have to regulate admissions, set curricula and conduct examinations for a large number of undergraduate colleges. Likewise, concerns have long existed about over-centralisation, namely, the constraints imposed on the potential for premium affiliated colleges to innovate and evolve. Notably, drawing on such concerns, the earliest inclinations towards autonomy were reflected in the recommendations of different education committees from the 1960s onwards. In its report, the Mahajani Committee on Colleges (1964), for example, took the position that one way of improving the standard of higher education in India was by selecting a few colleges “on the basis of past work, influence, traditions, maturity and academic standards and give them what might be called for want of a better phrase an ‘autonomous’ status”. Perils of autonomy Even while solutions to apprehensions about over-centralisation were being discussed by stakeholders, these came to be used by successive governments to build a case for the model of graded autonomy. This model has adverse ramifications for accessibility, equity and quality for the higher education sector. In recent decades, a form of policy discourse has clearly developed in which the dominant opinion holds that the state cannot be expected to pay for the education of all. Correspondingly, there has been a serious lack of development of educational infrastructure to meet the rapidly increasing demand for higher education. In response to the widening gap between the demand and supply for education, successive governments have pushed through measures that have largely allowed for greater penetration of private capital in higher education, and its corollary, the persistent decline in per-capita government allocation of funds towards education. Consequently, private colleges and universities have grown in number, and there has been a rapid expansion of the open and distance learning (ODL) education. In line with these developments, recommendations of recent education commissions have promoted the already existing unequal structure of funding for higher education, and perpetuated the prevailing hierarchy in higher education along the lines of “centres of excellence” or metropolitan Central government-funded universities, provincial Central government-funded universities, regional universities and colleges funded by State governments, etc. The National Knowledge Commission (2005) stated that “undergraduate colleges are constrained by their affiliated status… the problem is particularly acute for undergraduate colleges that are good, for both teachers and students are subjected to the ‘convoy problem’ insofar as they are forced to move at the speed of the slowest... In fact the design of courses and examinations needs to be flexible”. Rather than bringing lower-grade affiliated colleges at par with premium colleges, recent commissions and high-powered committees have taken to projecting the relatively equitable funding from the Central/State government, common syllabi and evaluation systems, standardised teacher recruitment rules, etc. as fetters. In turn, the dominant policy discourse vocally propagates “graded autonomy” for better performing Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs), in which academic excellence can be supported through grant of special funds whilst allowing greater power to such institutions to grant degrees, start new self-financed courses, decide on fee structure, hire and fix the pay of non-tenured teachers independent of the regulatory authority, etc. This paradigm has been gradually enforced with the UGC in 2018 granting public-funded universities the right to apply for autonomy based on whether they are ranked among top 500 of reputed world rankings or have National Assessment and Accreditation (NAAC) scores above 3.26. Strengthening hierarchies In its current form, NEP 2020 as introduced by the NDA government is a curious combination of enhanced centralising features and specific features of autonomy. The thrust towards deeper centralisation is indicative in the constitution of the government nominated umbrella institution, Higher Education Council of India (HECI); corporate-style Board of Governors with powers hitherto assigned to governing bodies of colleges and to other statutory bodies of HEIs; as well as the new apex body, the National Education Commission, that is responsible for “developing”, “implementing” and “evaluating” the “educational vision of the country”. Meanwhile, the power extended to premier educational establishments to design new courses, award degrees, among other features, represent the so-called prized features of autonomy. The issue of autonomy is the key to unravelling the inherent problem with NEP 2020 in matters of higher education. By engaging with the multi-fold ramifications of this provision, a lot can be gleaned on the heavy cost that the common masses will pay in terms of growing inaccessibility of higher education. Importantly, the model of graded autonomy is not based on universalisation of educational resources and equal access to quality higher education, but on furthering the prevailing hierarchy that exists between different colleges within a public-funded university, and between different universities across the country. While the best colleges gain the autonomy to bring in their own rules and regulations, and graduate to a privileged status whereby they enjoy the benefits of special funds from the newly proposed funding agencies, it is estimated that affiliated colleges with lower rankings and less than 3,000 students face the threat of mergers and even closure. Such collateral damage contradicts targets set for higher gross enrolment ratios. A shrinking of the number of public-funded colleges will only further push out marginalised sections and relegate them to low-grade private colleges and/or to informal education in the ODL and online modes. The possibility of enhanced inaccessibility of quality higher education looms large when we also consider that the independent rules and regulations of autonomous colleges and universities shall curtail transparent admission procedures, which guarantee underprivileged students a share of seats in prestigious institutions. Similarly, graded autonomy can be expected to trigger a massive spurt in expensive self-financed courses as premium colleges, as well as struggling affiliated colleges, strive to chalk out their financial self-sufficiency. This will expectedly lead to significant expenditure by the individual learner, and, under the new proposed four-year undergraduate programme, the exclusion will simply manifest itself in the pushing out of disadvantaged sections. More than deliverance, autonomy represents the via media for greater privatisation and enhanced hierarchization in higher education.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Contempt powers, in the people’s name||Lawyer and social activist Prashant Bhushan’s conviction with god speed for contempt of court has revived the debate on the relevance of contempt law in a modern liberal democracy. The Supreme Court of India has said that his tweets, two of them, have undermined the dignity and the authority of the most powerful court and have the effect of destabilising the very foundation of Indian democracy. This controversial judgment may be technically and legally correct but has it enhanced the stature of the Court? Is it right to punish critics of the judiciary in the name of the people? Should civil contempt be given more importance? And what reforms should be introduced in criminal contempt? The basis is opinion The primary justification of contempt power has been people’s opinions. In the judgment, the word ‘people’ occurs 27 times. Consider this. On June 27, 2017, there were huge protests against mob lynching under the campaign, ‘Not in my name’ in response to film-maker Saba Diwan’s social media call. Today, there are people who are opposed to invoking people’s name to justify contempt law. The judgment tells us repeatedly that the object of contempt proceedings is not to afford protection to judges personally from the imputations. Instead, it is to protect people at large and to uphold the rule of law as distrust in the popular mind does impair the confidence of people in courts as such confidence is of huge importance for the protection of the rights and liberties of people. In paragraph 48 of the judgment, the three-judge Bench explicitly observes that ‘when the court exercises this power, it does not do so to vindicate the dignity and honour of the individual judge who is personally attacked or scandalised but to uphold the majesty of the law and of the administration of justice.’ The Bench goes on to say that ‘the foundation of the judiciary is the trust and the confidence of the people’. Gaps in the system Strangely, in paragraph 71, the Bench has proclaimed itself to be the ‘central pillar’ of democracy but has rightly said that the ‘trust, faith and confidence of the citizens of the country in the judicial system is sine qua non for the existence of rule of law’. This confidence is indeed strengthened not by the resort to contempt powers but by the Court’s orders and judgments. Res ipsa loquitur is the old maxim, i.e. the thing speaks for itself. People have observed with an element of frustration not only the Court’s reluctance in promptly hearing habeas corpus petitions, the CAA and 370 petitions, but also the Court’s initial observations on the plight of millions of poor migrant workers and stay of payment of wages order. In an election year, the Court did not consider it urgent enough to examine the validity of controversial electoral bonds but had time for an open court hearing in a review in 2019 of Sabarimala . Though no error in the judgment was pointed out, the review was still accepted. The innovative ‘sealed cover’ jurisprudence and the Court’s over-indulgence in Assam’s National Register of Citizens and then not saying a thing on its completion raised many an eyebrow. There were even four sitting judges of the top court who, on January 12, 2018, held an unprecedented press conference on a working day to ‘discharge their debt to nation’ as democracy, in their view, was under threat with the ‘credibility of [the] court at stake’. This is what worries many independent observers of our judiciary that the courts, of late, have been behaving more like the executive courts of erstwhile socialist countries. The only major assertion of judicial independence in the recent past (other than the quashing of President’s Rule in Arunachal Pradesh) was the National Judicial Appointments Commission judgment (2015) where the Court struck down the constitutional amendment and the NJAC Act, 2014. This writer does believe that the independence of the judiciary is indeed the right of people and not of judges. But then the fact remains that the top court in fact demonstrated its real mettle in basically asserting the collegium’s power to select judges. Then why has the Court not shown similar resolve in upholding people’s liberties? The High Courts in the meanwhile, just like in the 1975 Emergency, are widely applauded for passing some good orders though some of these orders eventually got stayed by the Supreme Court. Indian judges make excessive use of contempt powers. As in the Indian Judiciary Report (2016-17) published by the Supreme Court, High Courts had 96,310 civil contempt cases, i.e. wilful disobedience of court judgments and orders on June 30, 2017. Thus, civil contempt is far more serious generally committed by the government than so-called ‘scandalising of court’ by mere statement. Even the number of criminal contempt cases is also quite impressive with 586 cases. In A.K. Gopalan (1950), the majority took the positivistic view of Article 21 and expressed their helplessness as preventive detention law satisfied the requirement of ‘procedure established by law’. In ADM Jabalpur (1976), a majority, like in the Prashant Bhushan case, took the highly legalistic view and held that since Article 21 is under suspension due to Emergency, the writ of habeas corpus cannot be claimed. Subsequent decades proved that in both the cases, majority decisions did disservice to the Court’s reputation and it were dissenting judges such as Justice Fazl Ali and Justice H.R. Khanna who had really enhanced people’s faith in the judiciary. The Court itself overruled these two judgments in Maneka Gandhi (1978) and K.S. Puttaswamy (2018). In all contempt judgments, the Court has been using its powers in the name of the people and Justice Arun Mishra’s Bench merely relied on them. It cited the Brahma Prakash Sharma (1953) judgment, wherein the Supreme Court had justified contempt powers by observing that ‘it is intended to be a protection to the public whose interests would be very much affected if by the act or conduct of any party, the authority of the court is lowered and the sense of confidence which people have in the administration of justice by it is weakened’, and that contempt powers are to be invoked to restore this confidence. The top court had further elaborated that ‘such conduct is punished as contempt for this reason that it tends to create distrust in the popular mind and impair the confidence of the people in the courts which are of prime importance to the litigants in the protection of their rights and liberties’. Similarly, in Hira Lal Dixit (1955), the top court again referred to the ‘confidence of the people in the integrity of the judges’. The Bench also quoted Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer judgment in S. Mulgaokar (1978) but preferred to overlook the learned judge’s real message. Justice Krishna Iyer had observed that the normative guideline for judges to observe in contempt jurisdiction is not to be hypersensitive even where distortions and criticisms overstep the limits, but to ‘deflate vulgar denunciation by dignified bearing, condescending indifference and repudiation by judicial rectitude’. The Justice Arun Mishra-led Bench itself admitted that critics are the instruments of reform, but not those actuated by malice; instead by those inspired by public weal. Is Mr. Bhushan’s long career as as a public interest litigation lawyer not the testimony of ‘public weal’ and an absence of ‘malice’? Is it right to determine ‘good faith’ on the basis of mere extent of publication? In a country of 1,312.2 million people (estimated in 2019), Twitter users constitute an insignificant minority of an estimated number of over 34 million (2019), and Mr. Bhushan just has 1.6 million followers. In fact tweets are not taken seriously by the people. One hopes the Court will consider these in determining the sentence. For a liberalism Just like the Supreme Court’s judgment on sedition in Kedar Nath Singh (1962), a mere scurrilous attack against the courts/judges should not be punished if it does not lead to an actual obstruction of the judicial process. In Shiv Shankar (1988) and Rachapudi Subba Rao (2004), the Supreme Court itself had held that criticism of the court that does not impair and hamper the administration of justice cannot be punished as contempt. Ideally, the Bench should have given little more weightage to Justice Krishna Iyer’s observation that ‘the court is willing to ignore, by a majestic liberalism, trifling and venial offences — the dog may bark, the caravan will pass.’ Faizan Mustafa is Vice-Chancellor of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Pushing bigotry to the margins||The bhumi puja on August 5, 2020, at Ayodhya was the culmination of a long-drawn court battle that led to the Supreme Court’s final verdict on November 9, 2019. We may agree, disagree, celebrate or critique the verdict, but I stress its procedural correctness because this signifies that we are a democratic country that adhered to a judicial process. That is the only way we can hope to find some way of leaving behind animosity. However, this does not mean we forget the injustices of the past. The Supreme Court was well aware of this pitfall and hence had this to say in its judgment, “The destruction of the mosque and the obliteration of the Islamic structure was an egregious violation of the rule of law,” and that “Justice would not prevail if the Court were to overlook the entitlement of the Muslims who have been deprived of the structure of the mosque through means which should not have been employed in a secular nation committed to the rule of law.” These are very important statements that send a clear message to the citizens of this country. Yet, over the past few weeks, there have been articles in certain sections of the press that remind us of the sacrifices of the kar sevak s, turning those who lost their lives on that fateful day of December 6, 1992 into martyrs. Any loss of life must be mourned. But that should not take away from the illegality and immorality of the actions committed by those involved in the destruction of the Babri Masjid. Reconciling with the past I would place the blame for these deaths on the powerful individuals and organisations that instilled hate and anger across India. There were those who actually took part in the kar seva but many more stayed back at home and cheered. In some ways, these non-physical participants were more culpable than the actual participants because they provided the community impetus for such an action. While we need to move forward and not let old wounds fester, it cannot be by papering over the past. It has to come from publicly acknowledging and taking responsibility as a society for the injustice. Organisations that encouraged, planned and executed this violent socio-religious movement have to be seen for what they are. Any attempts to use the construction of the Ram temple for their image makeover must be resisted by civil society. They use expressions such as ‘Sanatana Dharma’ and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ to lure us into becoming part of a herd that promotes ‘othering’. I am saying all this now, only because we are already hearing voices from their quarters that Mathura and Kashi are now ‘on the cards’. Even the Supreme Court judgment is being twisted into a vindication of the events that led to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. If we allow this to happen, we will be trapped in a very dark tunnel, leading to another cycle of deaths. The Supreme Court warned us against such a possibility, by pointing to the Places of Worship Act, 1991: “Cognizant as we are of our history and of the need for the nation to confront it, Independence was a watershed moment to heal the wounds of the past. Historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking the law in their own hands. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future.” Resisting polarisation This message must reach every nook and corner of the country, enter our textbooks and become part of our cultures. We cannot allow anyone to push forward another religiously polarising agenda. For this not to happen, the judiciary too should uphold its dharma . Unless the people responsible for the demolition of the Babri Masjid are brought to justice, wounds will not heal. And this needs to happen soon. But Ayodhya is only emblematic of the deep religious gorge that has divided our society from before Independence. We have to be cognisant of our own partaking in this culture of suspicion. We need to unlearn the falsities, half-truths and parochial ideas that have been implanted in our mind. But for tangible transformation to take place, places of learning have to look inward. Secularism in the sense of a respect for every faith inheres in every religion, and we would realise that if we had an open mind. Educational institutions have to become places where inter-religious understanding is nurtured as it must be in a place of sensitivity. When that happens, students will come upon the beauty in all faiths. If our schools and colleges help children hold on to those moments of splendour, we will create an entirely new generation that will push bigotry to the fringes where it belongs. T.M.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Formalising a known reality||Several Western policymakers and analysts have touted the recently announced normalisation agreement between the UAE and Israel as a game changer in West Asia. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the agreement with great fanfare declaring, “This deal is a significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure and prosperous Middle East” and would lead to greater cooperation in the investment, tourism, security, technology, and energy sectors. UAE agreed to “full normalisation of relations” with Israel in exchange for the latter “suspending” annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank awarded to it by the Trump-Kushner Plan. While assessing the importance of the deal, one needs to answer two questions. First, is there anything really new about the agreement or does it merely formalise the de facto situation as it pertains to Israel’s relations with the UAE and more broadly with the Gulf states? Second, who is the principal beneficiary of the normalisation of relations between Israel and the UAE? A symbolic move For those familiar with the development of Israel-UAE relations over the past few years, the agreement is more like a “coming out” party, than a radical departure from the current situation. It may have symbolic importance but does not add much to the substance of relations between the two countries whose collaboration, especially in the security and technology sectors, has been an open secret. Leading Israeli establishment figures have visited the UAE in the past couple of years. The same applies to Israel’s relations with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, especially Oman. In November 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Muscat and met publicly with the then-Sultan Qaboos bin Said. The next day, the Omani Foreign Minister called on GCC members to recognise Israel. The UAE’s action opens the door for the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between Israel and other GCC states with Oman and Bahrain, who have openly welcomed the deal, likely to lead the way. Saudi Arabia may not follow suit immediately for fear that it may erode its credibility as the Keeper of the two holiest Muslim shrines, but it is clearly headed in that direction. In April 2019, the Saudi Crown Prince, endorsing the pro-Israel Trump peace proposal, declared, “The Palestinians need to accept [Trump’s] proposal or stop complaining.” ‘Suspension’ of annexation Who then benefits from the agreement? While Mr. Netanyahu has agreed to “suspend” annexation of parts of the West Bank in exchange for normalisation of relations, he has made it clear that this is a temporary measure. In any case, the U.S. has insisted that the timing of the annexation must be subject to Washington’s concurrence, which it is withholding for the moment. Moreover, Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate who is presently leading the polls, has made clear his opposition to annexation, thus acting as a further deterrent for Mr. Netanyahu’s plan. The temporary suspension of his annexation plan is a concession not to the Crown Prince of UAE but one that has been forced on Mr. Netanyahu temporarily by American policy. But, he has made it clear that he has merely postponed the plan, not abjured it completely. In the long run, Israel is likely to have its cake and eat it too. Incidentally, the Palestinians haven’t lost anything because the occupied West Bank has already been annexed in all but in name. The agreement does not change the strategic map of West Asia. Abu Dhabi’s open embrace of Israel is driven by the fact that the UAE and most other members of the GCC look upon Israel as their “protector” against Iran now that that they are unsure if the U.S., in its current retrenchment mode, will come to their aid in case of a showdown with Tehran. But this is a well-known fact. The deal merely lays bare the UAE’s and the GCC’s primary motive for courting Israel.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Data power||An investigative report by The Wall Street Journal last week has raised troubling questions about whether Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, goes easy on hate speech violations by BJP leaders so as to be on the right side of the ruling party. The Journal story specifically refers to the case of the BJP’s Telangana MLA, T. Raja Singh, who, it says, has not been yet removed from Facebook despite his controversial posts about Muslims that were found to be in violation of its own rules and also deemed dangerous. Elsewhere, Facebook reportedly does remove people with such profile and problematic actions from the platform; radio host Alex Jones and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan are examples. In this case, the supposed reason for not acting against Mr. Singh is more problematic than the lack of action itself. For, the Journal ’s report goes on to say that Ms. Ankhi Das, Facebook’s Public Policy Director in India, was against taking these posts down as well as those of three others. She reportedly told her colleagues that “punishing violations by politicians from Mr. Modi’s party would affect the company’s business prospects in the country”. The report has predictably raised the political temperature, with the Congress demanding a joint parliamentary probe. Some of its leaders have even alleged that this amounts to interfering with Indian elections. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who heads the Parliamentary panel on IT, has summoned Facebook. The BJP, responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, that “BJP & RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India”, has in turn accused the Congress of trying to manipulate data with Facebook’s help. This ought not to end as the usual war of words between two political rivals. For, there is little doubt that this report raises uncomfortable questions about the possibility of an unholy nexus between those with the power to influence millions of people and those in power. That too in the only country with a billion-plus population that is open to business for such Internet companies. It is difficult to deny that the protagonist is a powerful social network, which till date carries the taint of being the source of the data which the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, illegally harvested in its quest to sway elections. Sure, social media platforms in general, having grown rapidly with little content of their own, have struggled on the question of moderating comments and posts. This, however, is much beyond the question of capability. The nature of the relationship between Facebook and the Government, and the rules governing it, are now under a cloud. There is a need to dispel misgivings about Facebook lobbying in the corridors of power. Only a full-fledged inquiry can help reveal the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/data-power/article32398736.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Need for transparency||There is something about the nature of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund that has led to demands for its scrutiny. While the Supreme Court has rejected a writ petition calling for a funds diversion from this fund to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and also denied the petitioners’ demand that the “public charitable trust” be audited by the CAG, questions remain about its need, operation and its persisting lack of transparency. A three-judge Bench asserted that no exception could be taken to the constitution of yet another public charitable trust at a time of a raging COVID-19 pandemic. But the need for a fresh trust when there is the PM’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) with a substantial corpus in place is not clear. Since the PM CARES Fund existed independent of budgetary support or government money, the Court’s reasoning was that there was “no occasion” for a CAG audit. However, the concern is not about the legal basis or the absence of a CAG audit, or whether it is superfluous or indeed essential. As responses to RTI queries on the Fund reveal, the government is not forthcoming on questions on its transparency or accountability. Queries on the trust deed for the Fund, and its creation and operation have been summarily dismissed by arguing that the Fund was not a “public authority” even though the PM is its ex-officio chairman and three Cabinet ministers are its trustees. And, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs had also treated it as a fund set up by the Centre. Since the trust was created, lakhs of public and private sector employees have donated a day’s salary to it, with some of them claiming that this deduction was done without their explicit consent. Many public sector units and corporate entities too have made donations because of a proviso allowing uncapped corporate donations that would qualify as corporate social responsibility (CSR) expenditure. Earlier, a government panel had rightly suggested that the double benefit of tax exemption would be a “regressive incentive”. Thus far, the exact amount of donations and a clear break-up of the expenditure from the fund have not been provided apart from an announcement in May that Rs. 3,100 crore had been sanctioned from it to be spent on ventilators, migrant worker welfare and vaccine development. States have led the response to COVID-19 and their resources have increasingly been stretched by the continuing rise in infections and deaths, which have crossed the 2.8 million and 54,000 mark, respectively. At the very least, RTI requests that seek to understand how funds are being received and how they are being disbursed so far should be seen as legitimate. Also, more needs to be done by the government to publicise donations to the more accountable NDRF which allows for a transfer of funds to States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/need-for-transparency/article32398735.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||City of Bundhs||Calcutta, described by the late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as ‘a city of processions’ is now a city of bundhs. It is going to be even more so during the coming week. The various political units under the control of the Communist Party (Marxist) have declared their intention to start a series of strikes from 26th August. The party has also called for a gherao of Dalhousie Square (this is where Writers’ Building, which houses the Secretariat, is located) on August 31st; evidently, the C.P.M. is bent on paralysing the administrative machinery too, besides dislocating business life around the area where the largest business houses, including the Reserve Bank, are situated. The C.P.M. has come a cropper in Durgapur, because of the fact that the INTUC and the C.P.I.-led AITUC unions would not co-operate in the indefinite strike it called. The Union Deputy Minister for Industrial Development told the Rajya Sabha that as many as 165 factories had closed down in West Bengal till May this year because of factors among which labour indiscipline appeared to be the predominant one. But an unofficial estimate has put the number of closed factories at 300.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/city-of-bundhs/article32398745.ece
20 August 2020||LISBON,||PSG cruises into final||Paris Saint-Germain, inspired by Angel Di Maria, reached its first-ever Champions League final with a 3-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday. The big-spending PSG, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding, was a step too far for Leipzig, which had outperformed all expectations by reaching the last four. Di Maria was in fine form, constantly probing, while Neymar created from deep and Kylian Mbappe pushed on to the last defender looking to use his pace. Right from the outset, PSG looked a threat to the Leipzig defence with Neymar clipping the post after he was slipped in by Mbappe in the sixth minute. Seven minutes later, Neymar and Di Maria lined up to take a free kick on the left and it was the Argentine who floated in a lovely cross which was nodded home by Marquinhos. Paying the price It was a poor clearance from the Leipzig ’keeper which led to PSG’s second. Leandro Paredes collected the ball and then found Neymar who cleverly flicked it with the back of his heel into the path of Di Maria who made no mistake. In the 56th minute, Leipzig defender Nordi Mukiele slipped while attempting to clear, allowing Di Maria to cross the ball back in to the box and Juan Bernat’s glancing header floated into the far corner. PSG’s only other appearances in the final of a European competition came with the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup victory in 1996 and a runner-up spot in the following season.  The result:   Paris Saint-Germain 3 (Marquinhos 13, Di Maria 42, Bernat 56) bt RB Leipzig 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/psg-cruises-into-final/article32398860.ece
20 August 2020||BENGALURU,||Karnataka government’s draft stadium policy invites criticism||The move by the Department of Youth Empowerment & Sports (DYES), Govt. of Karnataka, to demand a share of the revenue generated from the conduct of private franchise-based leagues in the State has not been received well. Bengaluru has fairly successful franchises in football, kabaddi and badminton. In a draft policy formulated to govern the use of State-owned stadia, DYES has demanded a 25% share of all ticketing revenue, prohibited printed ticket sales (only online sales allowed) and directed organisers of marathons to part with 25% of all donations collected, apart from a deposit amount which is 25% of the average donations collected in the previous three years. Previously the State had no official policy, but the Karnataka High Court, while hearing a dispute over the use of the Sree Kanteerava Stadium for footballing activities last year, directed the government to devise one. Stakeholders can file objections to the contents by midnight of August 20. “This policy dissuades any of us from conducting events,” said Mandar Tamhane, CEO of Indian Super League (ISL) club Bengaluru FC (BFC), which normally plays its home matches at the Kanteerava Stadium. “No other sport apart from cricket makes money. This 25% can help us mitigate our losses. To take that away puts a spanner in all the talk about encouraging all sports. “We at BFC have maintained the turf, installed bucket seats and improved the flood lights, initiatives that have helped all sports. “The ISL is the top division of Indian football and clubs from it represent India in Asia. This move doesn’t seem to consider any of that.” Restricted access The policy also limits the use of the Kanteerava Stadium 400m track for day-to-day training to national- and international-level athletes and those residing in the sports hostels. The rest have to make do with the adjacent 200m track. Also, only those with coaching diplomas, and medallists at the Asian, Commonwealth, World and Olympic levels, can impart training. Athlete-turned-coach Pramila Aiyappa, heptathlon bronze medal winner at the 2010 Asian Games, agreed with proposed rule related to coaches’ qualification but was not keen on restricting access to the track. “You cannot become a national or international athlete overnight. Denying the 400m track to a young upcoming athlete will stop his development,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/karnataka-governments-draft-stadium-policy-invites-criticism/article32398862.ece

The star-studded squad comprises the likes of five-time World champion Viswanathan Anand, P. Harikrishna, Vidit Gujrathi, D. Harika, R. Vaishali and teen sensations Nihal Sarin and R. Praggnanandhaa. “I am happy to be part of this team and I hope it will be an exciting tournament,” Humpy told The Hindu over phone from Vijayawada on Wednesday. “India has good chances, but in rapid and blitz chess reputations don’t matter much.” India, which has been seeded directly to the top division, has some strong rivals in Group A. “China will, of course, be a tough challenge,” she said. “But I think Iran, Germany, Georgia and Vietnam also have some very good players.” She said she had begun to enjoy playing online chess more after the recent Women’s Speed Chess Grand Prix series organised by FIDE. She had reached the final of the last leg. “I wasn’t too keen about playing online or speed chess earlier, but I am more comfortable after the Grand Prix.” India opens its campaign with what should be an easy match against Zimbabwe.

20 August 2020||MUMBAI,||Former India goalkeeper Bhaskar Maity passes away||Former India goalkeeper-turned-coach Bhaskar Maity passed away at a Navi Mumbai hospital on Wednesday. Maity, 67, had suffered a massive stroke on Tuesday night. One of the most reliable and stylish goalkeepers in the country in the 1970s and ’80s, Maity made his India debut against Iraq during the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok. Besides his exploits at the international level, Maity represented Maharashtra in the Santosh Trophy from 1975 to 1979. He was a regular for Mafatlal SC from 1974 to 1980 before joining Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF) in 1981. “It is sad to hear that Bhaskar Maity is no more. His contribution provided immense value. I share the grief,” All India Football Federation president Praful Patel was quoted as saying on AIFF’s Twitter handle. After retiring in the mid-80s, Maity took over as RCF coach and played a big role in honing the skills of India regulars Khalid Jamil and Abhishek Yadav. Maity is survived by wife, son and daughter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/former-india-goalkeeper-bhaskar-maity-passes-away/article32398863.ece
20 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Waited long for this: Manjeet Singh||For Manjeet Singh, who waded through the murky waters of Hussain Sagar Lake here to leave an impact in rowing, it is a case of better late than never when he was recommended for the Dhyan Chand Award by the Union Sports Ministry on Tuesday. The 31-year-old Manjeet, one of the youngest to get this award and like many rowers in India, feels this award will motivate him to look for a third Olympics appearance (represented India in 2008 and 2012 editions). A product of Dronacharya and chief National coach Ismail Baig, Manjeet said, “this Award means a lot to me. It is for me a life-time achievement. There is a sense of achievement which comes with this Award for which I have been waiting for six years now.” And, if Ismail sir wants me to work hard to make the cut for the next Olympics, I will,” Manjeet told The Hindu on Wednesday. Early start The rower, who is employed with the Artillery Centre (Golconda) here, took to rowing at the age of 17 and having won a silver in the junior National, he was picked for the national team preparing for the Asian junior championship camp in Hyderabad. And, since then, the City has become the second home for him, who hails from Isa Panjgrain village in Firozpur (Punjab) near the border. “I must thank the Rowing Federation of India and my fellow rowers and also mainly CPS Singh Deo Sir for all his support to be in this position,” says a modest Manjeet. Now having completed NIS coaching course, Manjeet is also preparing himself for post-retirement connect with the sport too. On Ismail Baig, the quiet achiever says the chief national coach is a huge inspiration for all the rowers. “The way he teaches the techniques, tactics and puts us in the comfort zone, we all feel like giving more than 100 per cent,” he concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/waited-long-for-this-manjeet-singh/article32399076.ece
20 August 2020||Chennai,||‘Focus on camaraderie, knowledge-sharing’||Chennai Super Kings has yet again been the first team off the blocks to start its preparations for the Indian Premier League, with a six-day camp that began here on Saturday. The camp’s objective, according to former India pacer and CSK bowling coach L. Balaji, is to get the team in a functional mental space and help the players find their routines before they land in the United Arab Emirates. “The most crucial thing in cricket or any team sport is the camaraderie. When you train as a team, the interaction and knowledge-sharing becomes vital, with teammates helping each other. That is the main focus of this camp. It also gives a chance for the players to touch base with the game and re-educate their senses,” said Balaji. The team had a productive camp for close to three weeks in early March before the pandemic intervened and the CSK management wanted to pick up where it left off. Consistent The three-time champion side has made the playoffs in every edition it has competed in, and a key reason behind its success has been its ability to maximise its home conditions. Its team composition, too, often reflects that, with the focus on deploying good spinners. However, Balaji feels the team is ready for the challenge of playing in less familiar conditions, having done it in 2018, and that teams will just have to adapt. “Even in 2018, we had to move our home matches to Pune, and we won five out of six games there. It is a challenge, but it only makes us more hungry, and we want to prepare even better. You have to accept it as an opportunity to update yourself, and that will be our inspiration for this season.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/focus-on-camaraderie-knowledge-sharing/article32398926.ece

20 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Reputed curator Kasturirangan passes away||Former Mysore State cricketer and reputed pitch curator G. Kasturirangan passed away. He was 89. Kasturirangan made his First Class debut for then Mysore State just after India gained independence. A fine fast-bowler, unique in the way he bowled off the wrong foot, Kasturirangan picked up 94 wickets in 36 First Class matches for Mysore. He was picked for the Indian team to tour the West Indies in 1952, but declined due to personal reasons. After his playing days, Kasturirangan — an avid horticulturist — earned plaudits as a pitch curator. He served as the chairman of the BCCI's ground and wickets committee, and was recognised as one of the best in his craft. He also served as the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) vice-president. Former India and Karnataka player Vijay Bharadwaj recalled Kasturirangan’s impact on Indian cricket in the 80s and 90s. “He gave us fantastic pitches. Several of our Karnataka team victories in the 90s came on the wonderful sporting pitches prepared by Kasturirangan. “Not just the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, he was actively involved in turning other grounds like RSI into popular venues,” Bharadwaj told The Hindu . Bharadwaj cited the 1999 Ranji Trophy final between Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium as proof of Kasturirangan’s fine work. The match was an exciting see-saw affair which lasted five days, with Karnataka prevailing by 96 runs. In the KSCA league, Bharadwaj turned out for Bangalore cricketers, a popular club founded by Kasturirangan and his friends. “We’ve heard so many stories about what a terrific pacer Kasturirangan was. He was a thoroughly nice gentleman. He was kind and respectful to all of us players, even though we were only half his age,” Bharadwaj said. Great knowledge Noted curator Daljit Singh, who served as chairman of the BCCI's ground and wickets committee after Kasturirangan’s tenure, said: “The first BCCI ground and wickets committee was formed in 1997, with Kapil Dev as chairman. Kapil left the post in six months, and Kasturirangan took over. “Dhiraj (Parsana), myself and a few others were committee members. We learnt so much from Kasturirangan. He was an energetic, hands-on professional, who had great knowledge of soils, grass and fertilisers. Kasturirangan laid a solid platform for all of us to thrive.” Incidentally, it was during Daljit’s chairmanship that Kasturirangan’s son, K. Sriram, became a BCCI curator. Former India captain Anil Kumble paid tribute to Kasturirangan on Twitter. “Sad to hear about the passing of G. Kasturirangan. He will be fondly remembered for all his contributions to cricket. Heartfelt condolences to his family,” Kumble tweeted. Fellow ex-international cricketers Dodda Ganesh and W.V. Raman also took to Twitter to pay their respects. The KSCA condoled his demise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/reputed-curator-kasturirangan-passes-away/article32398856.ece

The World No. 132 is third on the alternate list and should there be as many pulls-outs, he will join compatriot Sumit Nagal in the main draw of the Major, which begins on August 31. “Yes, I will be travelling to New York and see if I can get in. I had planned to go back to my base in Germany either way and since it is the Grand Slam, I want to give myself the best chance of getting in,” said Prajnesh. If he does get in, it will be a sixth straight appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam, something not achieved by an Indian singles player in the last decade. Somdev Devvarman played in five consecutive Majors from the 2010 US Open to the 2011 US Open. When asked about it, Prajnesh said, “Well it would be nice, but I would like to focus more on winning my first-round matches. I am focused on my preparations and the things I need to do, and feel if I can put everything together, it will happen eventually.” Elite sportspersons across the world have found it challenging to train over the last few months, given the lockdown restrictions. Prajnesh has been able to train properly only for the last month and a half here in the city. Staying sharp “Yes it is far from ideal, but I have been able to train since the second week of July,” he said. “It helps that I have had good hitting partners like Sasi Kumar Mukund and Ramkumar [Ramanathan] to stay sharp. Being in Chennai, you always have good players around.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/prajnesh-to-try-his-luck/article32398923.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Early start time makes sense, says Silverwood||England head coach Chris Silverwood will support an earlier start time to the third Test, to mitigate the effects of bad weather. The previous Test at Ageas bowl was the shortest in England since 1987, with just 134.3 overs of play possible over five days. “There’s quite a lot of chat going on [regarding the bad light issue],” he said. “There can be a change in the colour of the ball, whether pink or not I'm not sure. Maybe a lighter shade of red. “The earlier start time makes more sense to me. We are not travelling, so it wouldn't be very hard to make it happen. “Can the floodlights deliver a set, minimum standard of light? That could be achieved.

20 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Idea mooted for separate para awards||Sensing the need to review the parameters designed for the selection committee to recommend names for the National Sports Awards, the Sports Ministry is aiming to bring about changes. Some jury members were keen on setting appropriate norms for judging performances in team and individual events separately. Others sought parity in treating performers from Olympic and non-Olympic disciplines. Further, the stress was also on separate awards for para athletes and those excelling in indigenous disciplines. One eminent jury member suggested a separate set of awards, other than the Dronacharya awards, for coaches who work at the grassroots level and harness raw talent into potential champions. The two-day meeting ended by recommending a longer list of awardees on Tuesday than ever before. Changes cannot be ruled out after Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju reviews these recommendations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/parameters-to-recommend-names-for-awards-may-be-reviewed/article32399016.ece

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Survival of the fittest||“Ready, ready, action.” Amidst a cacophony of voices, we hear stunt master ‘Siruthai’ Ganesh uttering the three golden words to his crew, giving us a feeling that the film industry is slowly getting back to the grind. But no. He is not shooting for a film, but for a video for his YouTube channel that will document the lives of senior stunt masters, in a series of first-person interviews. “Though the Government has given permission to shoot for TV serials, we still haven’t received any instruction regarding film shoots,” says Ganesh over phone. He was toying with the idea of starting his own YouTube Channel — Maga Aasan — during the lockdown. The channel will go live next month. Ganesh was choreographing the stunt sequences for a Vemal film and was supposed to start work on a Pa Vijay film before he was bogged down by the uncertainty of the pandemic. He barely managed to soldier through the nationwide lockdown in March. Then, issues began to creep in — both professionally and personally — when the lockdown was subsequently extended. Though the South Indian Cine Stunt Directors and Stunt Artistes Union was helping artistes with financial aid and essentials, it ultimately boiled down to senior masters like Ganesh, who has been supporting his core team of 10 fighters. While some technicians sought refuge in Zoom calls and executed shoots virtually, it was not an option for Ganesh, given that his line of work involves physical contact. Discussing shoots in the new normal, he says, “Have you accepted this as our reality?If actors are certified Corona-free by medical professionals on the set, why should we worry? This is just a passing cloud.” Ganesh was in the process of acquiring a piece of land and had a few commitments that were quashed in the wake of COVID-19. But he states that daily wagers were the worst affected, some of whom sought alternative routes for employment. “A jimmy jib operator started selling fruits. Some of the stuntmen I knew ventured into vegetable business and drove auto rickshaws. They needed the money for survival.”  For veteran wig maker B Natesan too, it was a question of survival. Despite the financial support provided by South India Cine and TV Makeup Artistes Union, he had to pawn his wife’s jewels, to pay rent and keep his business afloat. The wig maker also made news for coming up with an innovative ‘Corona’ wig, in an effort to create awareness. “The Corona wig is long and messy. It is sported by actors who play arakans (demon) in dramas.” Natesan sources hair from Tirupati, Tiruttani and Velankani. He says that the demand for hair has not dropped despite the pandemic. He has reopened his shop, situated adjacent to Kodambakkam bridge, although there has been a noticeable dip in the number of customers, who, he says, are mostly cancer patients referred to by doctors. “Once public transportation becomes operational, I am confident that customers will flock, as they used to before,” says Natesan, adding that he sold over 30 wigs on an average, which has come down to a maximum of five today. The way back Foley artistes S Babu and TP Purushothaman have not benefited from the relaxation either. They resumed work last month when the lockdown was further eased, and wrapped up the pending patch work for Gamanam (Telugu) and Robert ( Kannada). The duo was left with little to no projects when the Government issued permission to resume post-production work. “We usually have a tight schedule all through the year. But this has been a testing period; some of us have left for our hometowns,” says Babu from Tindivanam. They are commissioned for work by audio post production companies like Sync Cinema, Oli Sound Labs and LV Prasad Institute (for Telugu). “I haven’t paid school fees for my daughter who is in Class XII. Online classes have started and they have been insisting that we pay at least half the fee,” says Purushothaman, who would make about Rs. 40,000-50,000 a month while Babu earned anywhere between Rs. 25,000-30,000, under normal circumstances. For most technicians, the situation will only improve when theatres start functioning, since a cluster of movies is still stuck in a limbo. “How can producers pay our dues when their money is stuck? There is a lot that needs to be done when theatres reopen.” This is the fifth in a seven-part series on Chennai and its people, in lockdown, celebrating 381 years of resilience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/survival-of-the-fittest/article32398684.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The city that stayed indoors||Helping a friend out has some perks and Chennai-based photographer L Ramachandran will vouch for that. The lensman, popular for being the first Playboy photographer from India, used the last few months of lockdown to help a friend, Jayakumar, learn photography. In the process, he created a 440-page collectors’ special coffee table book, Chennai to Madras , which will be launched on August 21, capturing the sights of a city that largely stayed indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “He wanted to learn photography, and I took him to the Chennai Central station one evening. When I saw the building and sunset through the camera, it looked beautiful. I have travelled across the world for my fashion shoots, but this frame, in my city, was so pretty,” he recalls. And, thus kickstarted a project — one that saw him get Government permissions to travel in the city, and capture familiar and unfamiliar sights. The photos are black and white, and Ramachandran believes that a glance through the pages, even after a 100 years, will narrate the tale of how the city looked, during these troubled times. “These pictures might be impossible to take now with people starting to crowd the streets. During the peak lockdown months, however, all these places were silent, sans people. I just had to document this,” he explains. During this time, Ramachandran travelled the length and breadth of the city, taking multiple shots of landmarks. “I would have spent Rs. 70,000 on diesel alone,” he smiles, taking us through the pictures of the book that contain shots of landmarks such as the Government Museum, Ripon Building and Amir Mahal besides covering lesser-known places such as the Dhobikhana and Milk Bottle Tower in Madhavaram. Though the lensman has covered many magnificient buildings in this journey, his favourites include shots of a few old houses. “Usually, there’s so much noise in the frame but when I was clicking them during lockdown, there was no disturbance; no vehicles parked haphazardly. Chennai looked the prettiest in these months.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-city-that-stayed-indoors/article32398700.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||King of all hearts||What does your isolation look like? Lounging on the sofa, with hair blooming on your legs. Your home transformed into a witchy abode, filled with herbs and sunlight. Or the calm after a hurricane, with your laptop, books, pages, worn clothes and your own naked self, strewn across the bedroom. Fifty five of India’s up and coming artists have come together to design a deck of 55 cards, all under the umbrella theme of the pandemic, under the project, Cards for a Cause, by Ahmedabad-based Nidhi Jain. It all started with a game of animal flash cards with a toddler. Physical distancing back in May, Nidhi would spend a lot of her time playing with her three-year-old niece. Cards, she realised were a good way to make the forced down-time at home a bit more fun. What if they could also be used to evoke empathy and encourage people to donate for those affected by the novel Coronavirus, she wondered. Over the next two months, the idea snowballed into Cards for a Cause. “We have teamed up with the NGO, Give India, through which the profits go to a campaign called India Fights Corona. For every deck of cards that is bought, we donate 10 meals,” she explains. A copywriter by profession, she got Rhea Patel, founder of Cliq, the advertising startup where she works, to co-found this initiative. Approaching artists to volunteer for this project did not prove to be too difficult. “I run a page called Artlet Poetry, in which I post artwork, with relatable poetry in the caption, giving both artists and poets credit. It started as a poetry-first page, where I was just sharing work that I liked using the pictures in my phone gallery,” she says. But eventually she built a network of artists that she admired. In two years, the page blew up, it now has almost 38K followers. Every artist involved in the project had their own take on the pandemic and isolation, depicted in their trademark style. Chennai’s Varshini Ramakrishnan chooses to point out the sense of community in her work. The train featured on the 10 of Spades is a reference to how the Indian Railways turned the coaches of trains into isolation wards for the first time in history. Others have been introspective — Saumya Shukla, in her abstract style, talks about the towns of ignorance and islands of bliss she has built in her head. Some artists specifically requested for a card number: Delhi-based Shreya Tingal has used the Three of Spades to turn her father, mother and herself into Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles respectively, “a powerhouse of three.” Radhika Sivasankar uses the Two of Hearts to depict digital love between two partners. “I wanted to approach this from a kid’s point of view and that reminded me of the movie, Room ,” says Tabrez Alam, whose trademark is to place movie posters in the backdrop of Classical paintings. “I haven’t lived at home with my family for this long since long, so it is interesting to observe how the dynamic and our equation has changed. You’re not the same person you were six years ago!” Nidhi, on her part, has been overwhelmed by the response the project has received in just 10 days of the launch. “We are close to donating 4,000 meals already. The numbers will be up on our website soon,” she says.  Visit @theartletpoetry or cardsforacause.in to place an order. A set of 55 cards costs Rs. 700.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/king-of-all-hearts/article32398729.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Business is in full bloom||Prasannavathini, a homemaker from Neyveli in Tamil Nadu, is busy packing stem cuttings of portulacas and purslanes from her roof-top garden to despatch to Bengaluru, Chennai and Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh). “There are over 80 cuttings of 30 varieties in each consignment,” says the 30-year-old, who grows 120 varieties of the ornamental plant. In Kerala, floriculturists Seema Shamsu, Vidyadharan P and Anju Karthika Gee Nath are taking it slow on account of the monsoon. “My [social media] page has over hundred orders, most of them from outside the State. But if I take the cuttings now, they might rot by the time the courier reaches the customer,” says Thiruvananthapuram-based Seema who has nearly 200 varieties of the plant. Move over roses, adeniums and lillies: portulacas and purslanes are in. With more people planting these ornamental flowers for that signature riot of colours around their homes, on their balconies and terraces, there has been an exponential rise in the number of people selling them. Kerala is in the lead, closely followed by Tamil Nadu. For the uninitiated, portulaca plants ( Portulaca grandiflora or moss/table rose) or pathumani poo for Malayalis, has multi-petalled flowers and needle-shaped leaves, while purslane ( Portulaca umbraticola/ Portulaca oleracea ) generally has flowers with five petals and ovate-shaped leaves. Easy to grow and maintain, the plants bloom with ample sunlight. “I never imagined that my pathumani plants would eventually earn me an income. Inspired by my success story, several women in my neighbourhood have become small-scale entrepreneurs,” says Manju Hari, a homemaker from Pathanamthitta, who started her business early this year. What triggered the trend was the arrival of varieties from Thailand and Brazil. They came into the picture through social media, especially Facebook, which has a growing number of buyer-seller groups with portulaca lovers from across the globe, providing regular updates about new and exotic varieties. Riot of colours “We were used to seeing portulaca blooms in white and purple. Purslanes were in shades of yellow, white, red and purple. But the imported varieties come in mind-boggling colour combinations,” says Anju, who started out with 15 colours and now has 200 shades in her garden at Kayamkulam. She adds, “Since cross-pollination happens on its own, one can make hybrids easily. It is these cultivars and hybrids that produce flowers in a wide range of shades. Perhaps, no other flower has so many varieties.” Native to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, these flowers are now widely grown in, and sold from, Thailand and the Philippines from where nurseries and individuals buy in bulk. The stem/root cuttings or the full plant remain intact for 10-15 days in transit, which makes it convenient for the sellers to import them or send them across the country. Also there are numerous websites selling seeds of hybrid varieties. Besides the fiery, single-shade flowers, you find flowers with multi-coloured petals or a double layer of petals in different hues. Although these wither away by evening, some new hybrid varieties bloom for two days. “There are new blooms every day, all through the summer. You can make a beautiful garden with minimum investment and that’s why there is always a demand for portulacas and purslanes,” says Vidhyadharan from Palakkad, who has a steady clientèle in Gujarat, which include nurseries and individual buyers. Importing varieties is an expensive affair. “The cost can go up to Rs. 2,000 for just one variety, inclusive of transportation and courier/postal charges,” says Anju. The catch is that they cannot expect the buyer to pay the same amount. “If I pay Rs. 1,000 for a pair of cuttings I can’t charge more than Rs. 100 when I sell it because there will be another person who might sell the variety at a lower rate,” says Seema. Business has become so competitive that cuttings sell for as low as Rs. 5 for native varieties [single colours]. The current marketing strategy is to sell a package of colours. For example, 20 colours for Rs. 200 or 50 colours for Rs. 500, with two to five cuttings of each variety. Prasanna, admin of the Facebook group, Portulaca Lovers, which has members from across the globe, says that Cinderella (a puffball of petals with a ring of petals around it) and Tiger Stripe, both purslane varieties, are in demand now. “All of us are always on the look out for new varieties. There seems no end to the number of colour combinations,” she adds. Anju, for example, is trying to add six colours of Tiger Stripe that is missing from her list. Vidhyadharan adds that he dropped his plans to buy a Tiger Stripe variety from Israel after the total cost came to around Rs. 30,000! “The pandemic has affected the transport of imported varieties. But the demand keeps growing, going by the increase in number of sellers and buyers on different groups on social media,” he adds.  One petal at a time   Purslane has more of blooms in different colours and grows faster than portulaca. In addition to the commonly seen ones, portulaca comes in three more types: hybrid, tiara and jumbo. Purslane has single-colour, multi-colour, Cinderella and Tiger Stripe varieties.  Grow the plants in well-drained soil. Vermicompost, coco pith and red soil ensure better growth. Enough sunlight, for at least four hours is mandatory. Since they are succulents, water sparsely.  Prune the plant once every two months. There is no lifespan as such for a plant unless it gets destroyed by extreme weather conditions or pests. If the parent plant is repotted once in six months, it will continue to produce flowers for many years.  Use organic pesticides to protect the plants from mealybugs.   Facebook has umpteen groups that has Indian and international sellers and buyers. Among the popular ones are ONZE HORAS - PORTULACA Troca de mudas e informações (6.3k members), PORTULACA LOVERS (4.5k members), PORTULACA PHILIPPINES (5.6k members), Portulaca/Purslane Sales/Succulents exchange (2.4k members), Nature’s Colourfull Studio of Portulaca.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Sunshine in a samosa||Sometimes, you crave a samosa and you just have to eat it. No matter what. During the initial months of lockdown, the thought struck Balakrishnan Yadav, who runs Bombay Lassi on Ellis Road. He drove to a distant store to buy a samosa for Rs. 35. As restrictions were eased, his regular customers began to call him, asking when he planned to reopen. When he did, they gradually returned. Today, Balakrishnan is glad that both branches of his shop, specialising in samosas , carrot halwa , kachori , and jalebi , are back on their feet. Several of the city’s most iconic street-food ventures seem to be doing well despite recurring lockdowns. Even as giants in the business struggle to keep their kitchens running, the small street vendors seem to be remarkably resilient. Who yearns for rose milk from a corner store during a pandemic? A lot of people Chennai, judging by Kalathy’s business over these past few weeks. The rose milk served in the store, which is over 90 years old, is synonymous with Mylapore; so much so that people have been asking for it all through the lockdown. “We’re doing quite well,” says K Mani, who is from the third generation of the founding family. “People continue to come for our rose milk, especially from 11 am to noon and 4 pm to 7 pm.” He adds: “If there’s a dip is sales, it is due to cold weather and rains; not the pandemic.” Jannal Bajji shop on Ponnambala Vathiyar Street in Mylapore, is functioning with renewed vigour. The outlet, that functions out of the window of an 80-year-old house, was closed for 40 days when Sivaramakrishnan, the founder’s brother passed away due to COVID-19. Defying all odds, they reopened earlier this month, and the famed window even has a fresh coat of blue paint. In pre-pandemic days, for many in Chennai, a visit to the bajji shop was mandatory if we even stepped in the direction of Mylapore. The ritual continues. K Sargunanathan, the brother-in-law of the founder, says the eatery continues to serve its signature soft idlis , ghee pongal , crisp vadas  and translucent pooris , not to mention their sought-after onion chutney. The beaches may still be deserted, but there is no stopping Sundari ‘akka’, whose stall was always packed with customers at the Marina. She is now working out of her home kitchen at Lock Nagar, Chepauk. “Before Corona, I went in an auto to Kasimedu to buy fish every morning; now I go with my son on his bike; that’s the only difference,” laughs Sundari. “I now cook smaller quantities; that too only on order-basis.” Customers call her to place their order the previous day. Her menu is simple: fish curry, fish fry, prawns fry, squid fry, rasam , and rice. “I use fish that is available fresh: today, I’m making paarai curry,” she explains over phone, her voice coming in snatches owing to her stirring the simmering curry in between. “I’m getting a call. It might be a customer,” she signs off. Guru Mess’s mutton and chickenbiryaniare now selling out fast, thanks to people driving past the restaurant on ECR. Located in Mamallapuram and known for Chettinad-style food cooked on wood-fired stoves, the restaurant initially suffered a setback since most of their customers are tourists, according to K Pandian, the proprietor. But things are looking up now. C Kunhiraman General Stores in Royapuram too, is “limping back to normalcy”, according to Akilesh Baskaran, one of the managing partners of the shop that makes legendary mango ice-cream. Food blogger Shabnam Kamil has been documenting her experiences with these food ventures on her Facebook and Instagram account, Mytrystwithfood. She admits that it did take a lot of deliberation on her part to step out of home, at first. She went to Gopaul Dairy at George Town, known for its bun-butter-jam. And then to Thanjavur Military Hotel, Park Town. Then Kunhiraman’s. Then Sundari akka’s. Every where she went, she saw long queues. “People are going to places they were always loyal to; that they trust,” she says. And in a smaller joint like these, Shabnam feels there is a sense of confidence as one can see the food being prepared right in front of them. Restaurants have also upped their game. “Kattayan (Thanjavur Military Hotel) is over 100 years old; the owner formed a WhatsApp group, which he updates with food photos and even short videos from the kitchen,” she says. Who can resist piping hot mutton pulao ?” Finally, Shabnam drove to Kattayan to collect her order. She has more places on her list. “People are willing to visit most of them,” she says. “Initially, I thought I was the crazy kind,” she laughs. “Looks like I’m not alone.” (With inputs by Chitradeepa Anantharam) This is the fourth in a seven-part series on Chennai and its people, in lockdown, celebrating 381 years of resilience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sunshine-in-a-samosa/article32398717.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Lights, camera, stethoscope||If you have seen the recently-released Telugu film Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya , you would have noticed Ravindra Vijay. The actor plays Jognath in the film, directed by Venkatesh Maha. Though it was a small role, Jognath was the catalyst for the revenge drama. Says Ravindra, “The credit goes to Maha, who worked so hard on the film. It had a very unique flavour.” Born and raised in Bengaluru, Ravindra is a polyglot and is fluent in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu besides English. Though he has acted in over 10 films, he says acting was never on his mind when he grew up. He is, in fact, a doctor who graduated from Bangalore Medical College. “I had no exposure to arts at all. What started off as a hobby in the second year of medical school, became an obsession.” Soon, Ravindra would find himself replacing his stethoscope with scripts. He credits the theatre group, Rafiki, for instilling this passion in him. “I started working with them on street plays in 2005.” Since then, he was drawn more towards theatre and has been part of many theatre groups in Bengaluru. By 2011, he was a full-time theatre actor. When he shifted base to Chennai, working with the group Perch, he got an opportunity in the form of Odu Raja Odu, in which he played Nasser’s brother. He was also seen in movies like Kadaram Kondan and Dharala Prabhu. Work kept Ravindra busy, for, he was hopping from one film set to another. “Taking that decision was tough; the idea was to ease myself into theatre. My family was shocked and wondered how I could give up Medicine to be an actor.” It has not been an easy journey. He has worked on oil rigs and ships to keep himself afloat. “I was meant to work just for a few months, but ended up working for a year. Maybe because there is nothing more addictive than a pay packet,” the actor says with a laugh. He, however, has not yet opened his account in Kannada, but “would love to explore this industry too”. He also says that he will be seen in Season Two of the web series Family Man and Idhu Vedhalam Sollum Kadhai in Tamil.     Starting out as a medical professional, Ravindra dabbled in many fields before he became a full-time actor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lights-camera-stethoscope/article32398679.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The buck stops with the audience||The Netflix show Indian Matchmaking featuring Sima Taparia, the high profile Mumbai matchmaker, has triggered heated debates on the concept of arranged marriage. While Sima’s interactions with participants and their families have generated a handful of meme pages, the often regressive nature of these conversations have been flagged by liberal-minded netizens on social media; some called out the show’s producers for failing to suitably adjust the narrative to make a distinction between what was merely awkward family talk and clearly retrograde beliefs that fly under the garb of tradition. Smriti Mundhra, a Los Angeles-based documentary filmmaker is the show’s creator and executive producer. The Academy Award-nominated filmmaker, who was in conversation with office bearers of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FICCI FLO), Chennai Chapter recently, adds that her biodata too may have passed Sima’s hands at some point of time, and that the idea for the show came about after having observed Sima’s work from close quarters while filming feature documentary A Suitable Girl . Excerpts from the session: Your thoughts on how arranged marriage culture was presented on the show... It was important for me to not sanitise the process of arranged marriages. It does bring up a lot of unwanted conversations like casteism, colourism etc. These are issues that need to be discussed in the open, and probably families were uncomfortable talking or didn’t have the impetus to bring it up and discuss it openly until now. There has been criticism on how Sima goes about finding an alliance.  Sima’s process is a reflection of what her clients want. Participant Aparna Shewakramani has been subjected to social media vitriol. She has gone on record to suggest that the show was edited to fit a narrative. Your thoughts?  When you are live tweeting, you are going to type knee-jerk reactions. Aparna evolved over the course of the show but if she became a flashpoint for people, then it only reveals our own biases of what we expect women to be. For instance, Pradhyuman (another participant) didn’t get the same backlash that Aparna did. I’m not saying that either deserved it but they all took it in their stride because they have great support systems. It is easy to sit on a couch and judge somebody instead of looking at your own biases. So was the show not edited to fit a narrative as Aparna suggests?  There was no intention to misrepresent her. I love Aparna. I think she is amazing. Some of the things she is referring to happened off camera. We can only include things that happen on camera. In the edit room we only work with the footage we have with us. For the most part, Aparna does stand behind everything that was said and done on the show.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-buck-stops-with-the-audience/article32398711.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Song of resistance||Maalavika Manoj, or Mali as the singer’s popularly known, is taking the response to her new song with a quiet sort of joy. Her track ‘Absolute’ was premiered on YouTube five days ago, and on Twitter it has been shared by the likes of AR Rahman and Anirudh Ravichander. When asked about the song’s message, she waxes eloquent. “There is deliberate disconnect between the video and the lyrics,” she says over phone from Chennai, where the shoot for her video was wrapped up two weeks ago, “The lyrics are political and on-the-nose: if you listen to it without watching the visuals, you can pass it off as a completely different song. I didn’t want to take a political stance video-wise. I wanted to leave it to the people who really want to know, to understand what it means,” she adds. The song itself is an accusation against rulers-that-be whose “powers are absolute” — an accusation delivered in a quiet voice, cocooned by silken notes from the piano and the violin that leap to greater heights and volume than the singer-composer’s deliberately measured voice. The composition is an uplifting one; as polished as the set of video, shot at the Gymkhana Club with its velvet-lined staircases, gilded mirrors, arches and columns. Kudos to director Krishna Marimuthu for his dramatic use of light and bare space. At the visual level alone, the song can be seen as one of personal struggle, with a golden jacket waiting to be donned as a metaphor for self-confidence. Keep your ears open, however, and it is difficult to ignore the lyrics. Lines about broken backs and sickles, and an insistent “we can say what we want to say” leap out, as relatable now as they were back in 2017 when Mali had first penned them. “The song is about the kind of power we give to the people we elect, who put on a different front when they want to get on our good side. And when they get power... well, absolute power corrupts absolutely,” she says. She challenges not just a political leaning, but the clamping down of voices in general. The song has clearly struck a chord, and Mali is excited about one particular reaction more than the others. “Some of the earliest songs I knew were AR Rahman songs. And now, my song is being shared by him... it feels like life has come full circle. This is the best kind of validation I could get.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/song-of-resistance/article32398731.ece

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||King of all hearts||What does your isolation look like? Lounging on the sofa, with hair blooming on your legs. Your home transformed into a witchy abode, filled with herbs and sunlight. Or the calm after a hurricane, with your laptop, books, pages, worn clothes and your own naked self, strewn across the bedroom. Fifty five of India’s up and coming artists have come together to design a set of 55 playing cards, all under the umbrella theme of the pandemic, under the project, Cards for a Cause, by Ahmedabad-based Nidhi Shah. It all started with a game of animal flash cards with a toddler. Physical distancing back in May, Nidhi would spend a lot of her time playing with her three-year-old niece. Cards, she realised were a good way to make the forced down-time at home a bit more fun. What if they could also be used to evoke empathy and encourage people to donate for those affected by the novel Coronavirus, she wondered. Over the next two months, the idea snowballed into Cards for a Cause. “We have teamed up with the NGO, Give India, through which the profits go to a campaign called India Fights Corona. For every deck of cards that is bought, we donate 10 meals,” she explains. A copywriter by profession, she got Rhea Patel, founder of Cliq, the advertising startup where she works, to co-found this initiative. Approaching artists to volunteer for this project did not prove to be too difficult. “I run a page called The Artlet Poetry, in which I post artwork, with relatable poetry in the caption, giving both artists and poets credit. It started as a poetry-first page, where I was just sharing work that I liked using the pictures in my phone gallery,” she says. But eventually she built a network of artists that she admired. In two years, the page blew up, it now has almost 38K followers. Every artist involved in the project had their own take on the pandemic and isolation, depicted in their trademark style. Chennai’s Varshini Ramakrishnan chooses to point out the sense of community in her work. The train featured on the 10 of Spades is a reference to how the Indian Railways turned the coaches of trains into isolation wards for the first time in history. Others have been introspective — Saumya Shukla, in her abstract style, talks about the towns of ignorance and islands of bliss she has built in her head. Some artists specifically requested for a card number: Delhi-based Shreya Tingal has used the Three of Spades to turn her father, mother and herself into Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles respectively, “a powerhouse of three.” Radhika Sivsankar uses the Two of Hearts to depict digital love between two partners. “I wanted to approach this from a kid’s point of view and that reminded me of the movie, Room ,” says Tabrez Alam, whose trademark is to place movie posters in the backdrop of Classical paintings. “I haven’t lived at home with my family for this long since long, so it is interesting to observe how the dynamic and our equation has changed. You’re not the same person you were six years ago!” Nidhi, on her part, has been overwhelmed by the response the project has received in just 10 days of the launch. “We are close to donating 4,000 meals already. The numbers will be up on our website soon,” she says.  Visit @theartletpoetry or cardsforacause.in to place an order. A set of 55 cards costs Rs. 700.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/king-of-all-hearts/article32399025.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Business is in full bloom||Prasannavathini, a homemaker from Neyveli in Tamil Nadu, is busy packing stem cuttings of portulacas and purslanes from her roof-top garden to despatch to Bengaluru, Chennai and Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh). “There are over 80 cuttings of 30 varieties in each consignment,” says the 30-year-old, who grows 120 varieties of the ornamental plant. In Kerala, floriculturists Seema Shamsu, Vidyadharan P and Anju Karthika Gee Nath are taking it slow on account of the monsoon. “My [social media] page has over hundred orders, most of them from outside the State. But if I take the cuttings now, they might rot by the time the courier reaches the customer,” says Thiruvananthapuram-based Seema who has nearly 200 varieties of the plant. Move over roses, adeniums and lillies: portulacas and purslanes are in. With more people planting these ornamental flowers for that signature riot of colours around their homes, on their balconies and terraces, there has been an exponential rise in the number of people selling them. Kerala is in the lead, closely followed by Tamil Nadu. For the uninitiated, portulaca plants ( Portulaca grandiflora or moss/table rose) or pathumani poo for Malayalis, has multi-petalled flowers and needle-shaped leaves, while purslane ( Portulaca umbraticola/ Portulaca oleracea ) generally has flowers with five petals and ovate-shaped leaves. Easy to grow and maintain, the plants bloom with ample sunlight. “I never imagined that my pathumani plants would eventually earn me an income. Inspired by my success story, several women in my neighbourhood have become small-scale entrepreneurs,” says Manju Hari, a homemaker from Pathanamthitta, who started her business early this year. What triggered the trend was the arrival of varieties from Thailand and Brazil. They came into the picture through social media, especially Facebook, which has a growing number of buyer-seller groups with portulaca lovers from across the globe, providing regular updates about new and exotic varieties. Riot of colours “We were used to seeing portulaca blooms in white and purple. Purslanes were in shades of yellow, white, red and purple. But the imported varieties come in mind-boggling colour combinations,” says Anju, who started out with 15 colours and now has 200 shades in her garden at Kayamkulam. She adds, “Since cross-pollination happens on its own, one can make hybrids easily. It is these cultivars and hybrids that produce flowers in a wide range of shades. Perhaps, no other flower has so many varieties.” Native to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, these flowers are now widely grown in, and sold from, Thailand and the Philippines from where nurseries and individuals buy in bulk. The stem/root cuttings or the full plant remain intact for 10-15 days in transit, which makes it convenient for the sellers to import them or send them across the country. Also there are numerous websites selling seeds of hybrid varieties. Besides the fiery, single-shade flowers, you find flowers with multi-coloured petals or a double layer of petals in different hues. Although these wither away by evening, some new hybrid varieties bloom for two days. “There are new blooms every day, all through the summer. You can make a beautiful garden with minimum investment and that’s why there is always a demand for portulacas and purslanes,” says Vidhyadharan from Palakkad, who has a steady clientèle in Gujarat, which include nurseries and individual buyers. Importing varieties is an expensive affair. “The cost can go up to Rs. 2,000 for just one variety, inclusive of transportation and courier/postal charges,” says Anju. The catch is that they cannot expect the buyer to pay the same amount. “If I pay Rs. 1,000 for a pair of cuttings I can’t charge more than Rs. 100 when I sell it because there will be another person who might sell the variety at a lower rate,” says Seema. Business has become so competitive that cuttings sell for as low as Rs. 5 for native varieties [single colours]. The current marketing strategy is to sell a package of colours. For example, 20 colours for Rs. 200 or 50 colours for Rs. 500, with two to five cuttings of each variety. Prasanna, admin of the Facebook group, Portulaca Lovers, which has members from across the globe, says that Cinderella (a puffball of petals with a ring of petals around it) and Tiger Stripe, both purslane varieties, are in demand now. “All of us are always on the look out for new varieties. There seems no end to the number of colour combinations,” she adds. Anju, for example, is trying to add six colours of Tiger Stripe that is missing from her list. Vidhyadharan adds that he dropped his plans to buy a Tiger Stripe variety from Israel after the total cost came to around Rs. 30,000! “The pandemic has affected the transport of imported varieties. But the demand keeps growing, going by the increase in number of sellers and buyers on different groups on social media,” he adds.  One petal at a time   Purslane has more of blooms in different colours and grows faster than portulaca. In addition to the commonly seen ones, portulaca comes in three more types: hybrid, tiara and jumbo. Purslane has single-colour, multi-colour, Cinderella and Tiger Stripe varieties.  Grow the plants in well-drained soil. Vermicompost, coco pith and red soil ensure better growth. Enough sunlight, for at least four hours is mandatory. Since they are succulents, water sparsely.  Prune the plant once every two months. There is no lifespan as such for a plant unless it gets destroyed by extreme weather conditions or pests. If the parent plant is repotted once in six months, it will continue to produce flowers for many years.  Use organic pesticides to protect the plants from mealybugs.   Facebook has umpteen groups that has Indian and international sellers and buyers. Among the popular ones are ONZE HORAS - PORTULACA Troca de mudas e informações (6.3k members), PORTULACA LOVERS (4.5k members), PORTULACA PHILIPPINES (5.6k members), Portulaca/Purslane Sales/Succulents exchange (2.4k members), Nature’s Colourfull Studio of Portulaca.

20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||Lights, camera, stethoscope||If you have seen the recently-released Telugu film Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya , you would have noticed Ravindra Vijay. The actor plays Jognath in the film, directed by Venkatesh Maha. Though it was a small role, Jognath was the catalyst for the revenge drama. Says Ravindra, “The credit goes to Maha, who worked so hard on the film. It had a very unique flavour.” Born and raised in Bengaluru, Ravindra is a polyglot and is fluent in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu besides English. Though he has acted in over 10 films, he says acting was never on his mind when he grew up. He is, in fact, a doctor who graduated from Bangalore Medical College. “I had no exposure to arts at all. What started off as a hobby in the second year of medical school, became an obsession.” Soon, Ravindra would find himself replacing his stethoscope with scripts. He credits the theatre group, Rafiki, for instilling this passion in him. “I started working with them on street plays in 2005.” Since then, he was drawn more towards theatre and has been part of many theatre groups in Bengaluru. By 2011, he was a full-time theatre actor. When he shifted base to Chennai, working with the group Perch, he got an opportunity in the form of Odu Raja Odu, in which he played Nasser’s brother. He was also seen in movies like Kadaram Kondan and Dharala Prabhu. Work kept Ravindra busy, for, he was hopping from one film set to another. “Taking that decision was tough; the idea was to ease myself into theatre. My family was shocked and wondered how I could give up Medicine to be an actor.” It has not been an easy journey. He has worked on oil rigs and ships to keep himself afloat. “I was meant to work just for a few months, but ended up working for a year. Maybe because there is nothing more addictive than a pay packet,” the actor says with a laugh. He, however, has not yet opened his account in Kannada, but “would love to explore this industry too”. He also says that he will be seen in Season Two of the web series Family Man and Idhu Vedhalam Sollum Kadhai in Tamil.     Starting out as a medical professional, Ravindra dabbled in many fields before he became a full-time actor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lights-camera-stethoscope/article32399024.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The city that stayed indoors||Helping a friend out has some perks and Chennai-based photographer L Ramachandran will vouch for that. The lensman, popular for being the first Playboy photographer from India, used the last few months of lockdown to help a friend, Jayakumar, learn photography. In the process, he created a 440-page collectors’ special coffee table book, Chennai to Madras , which will be launched on August 21, capturing the sights of a city that largely stayed indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “He wanted to learn photography, and I took him to the Chennai Central station one evening. When I saw the building and sunset through the camera, it looked beautiful. I have travelled across the world for my fashion shoots, but this frame, in my city, was so pretty,” he recalls. And, thus kickstarted a project — one that saw him get Government permissions to travel in the city, and capture familiar and unfamiliar sights. The photos are black and white, and Ramachandran believes that a glance through the pages, even after a 100 years, will narrate the tale of how the city looked, during these troubled times. “These pictures might be impossible to take now with people starting to crowd the streets. During the peak lockdown months, however, all these places were silent, sans people. I just had to document this,” he explains. During this time, Ramachandran travelled the length and breadth of the city, taking multiple shots of landmarks. “I would have spent Rs. 70,000 on diesel alone,” he smiles, taking us through the pictures of the book that contain shots of landmarks such as the Government Museum, Ripon Building and Amir Mahal besides covering lesser-known places such as the Dhobikhana and Milk Bottle Tower in Madhavaram. Though the lensman has covered many magnificient buildings in this journey, his favourites include shots of a few old houses. “Usually, there’s so much noise in the frame but when I was clicking them during lockdown, there was no disturbance; no vehicles parked haphazardly. Chennai looked the prettiest in these months.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-city-that-stayed-indoors/article32399026.ece
20 August 2020||August 20 2020 00:00 IST,||The buck stops with the audience||The Netflix show Indian Matchmaking featuring Sima Taparia, the high profile Mumbai matchmaker, has triggered heated debates on the concept of arranged marriage. While Sima’s interactions with participants and their families have generated a handful of meme pages, the often regressive nature of these conversations have been flagged by liberal-minded netizens on social media; some called out the show’s producers for failing to suitably adjust the narrative to make a distinction between what was merely awkward family talk and clearly retrograde beliefs that fly under the garb of tradition. Smriti Mundhra, a Los Angeles-based documentary filmmaker is the show’s creator and executive producer. The Academy Award-nominated filmmaker, who was recently in conversation with office bearers of the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FICCI FLO), Chennai Chapter recently, adds that her biodata too may have passed Sima’s hands at some point of time, and that the idea for the show came about after having observed Sima’s work from close quarters while filming feature documentary A Suitable Girl .

20 August 2020||New Delhi,||Torrential rain batters Capital; more showers expected today||Incessant rain lashed the national capital on Wednesday submerging low-lying areas in waist-deep water and bringing traffic on key roads to a grinding halt. The city received 32 mm of rainfall till evening, leading to waterlogging in Kirari, Burari, Rohini, Mayur Vihar Phase-2, Sarai Kale Khan to DND, Sashi Garden to Kotla, Seemapuri to Dilshad Garden underpass, MB Road at Maidan Garhi, MB Road at Anuvrat Marg, and Apsara Border among other areas. Other parts of Delhi were completely inundated after just a few hours of rain. Pictures and videos of vehicles stuck on waterlogged roads and people wading through waist-deep water were quickly shared on social media. Trees fell at seven different locations and at eight places parts of buildings collapsed due to rain, the north municipal corporation said. Power cuts were reported in some parts of the city. Several vehicles were also damaged after a boundary wall of a school in Saket collapsed due to the rain, civic body officials said. On the road, vehicles moved bumper to bumper during the morning rush hour, as the downpour led to heavy waterlogging on key road stretches. Delhi Traffic Police remained busy clearing traffic at ITO, Purana Qila, Vinod Nagar, Surajmal Marg, Sarai Kale Khan, Dhaula Kuan, Bhairon Road, near Indraprastha Park, Sultanpur and Munirka metro stations, Civil Line police station, Mathura Road, Rani Jhansi road and other places. Till August 25 The India Meteorological Department has forecast cloudy skies and rain in the city till August 25. Light to moderate rainfall is expected on Thursday. “After Wednesday’s rainfall, the monsoon deficiency of Delhi has reduced and reached almost normal. Before today, there was deficiency of around 20%. The actual figures will be out on Thursday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre, IMD. “South Delhi and Gurugram received heavy rain on Wednesday. Ayanagar station [in south Delhi] recorded heavy rainfall, whereas, Safdarjung station [in central Delhi] recorded moderate rainfall,” he added. From 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Safdarjung station recorded 32 mm of rainfall. The station also recorded 8.2 mm of rainfall from 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday to the same time on Wednesday.

20 August 2020||GURUGRAM,||Gurugram ‘submerges’ after heavy rain||Flood-like situation was witnessed in several parts of the Millennium City on Wednesday after incessant rain in the morning. Within a few hours, the city recorded 120 mm of rainfall, the highest amount this monsoon. Six underpasses, including three in DLF area, had to be shut. Water also entered several condominiums, trapping the residents inside. One electrocuted Retired executive engineer Ashok Bakshi, a resident of Sector 28, died of electrocution after water entered his house, causing short circuit. Sector 28 RWA member Amit Mittal claimed that there was around 4-5 foot-deep water in the residential area and engines of around 100 cars were seized. He said that basements in all houses and the construction sites were inundated. Dramatic pictures of flooded underpasses, submerged vehicles, people wading through waist-deep water, policemen pushing vehicles and resident rowing boats on the flooded roads were posted on social media. Gurugram Municipal Commissioner Vinay Pratap told The Hindu that he took full responsibility for “whatever had happened” and accepted that there was “a huge scope for improvement”, but claimed that a lot had been done since the 2016 gridlock and the situation today was nowhere close to it. ‘We responded well’ “Despite the heaviest rainfall of the season, there were no traffic jams. We responded well to the situation. Except a few places, waterlogging was cleared at majority of the points in a few hours time,” said Mr. Singh. Three underpasses on Raghvendra Road, a signal-free stretch through DLF area from Shankar Chowk to AIT Chowk, were inundated and had to be shut for traffic; the longest among them near DLF Phase-I Rapid metro station was filled to the top. DLF officials, not willing to be named, said the pump sets could not handle the massive volumes of water and the underpass was submerged. Five fire tenders were pressed into service to pump out the water.The unidirectional underpasses on MG Road, near Medanta Hospital and under the Cyber City Rapid metro station were also flooded. Around six-km-long stretch on NH-48 was hit due to flooding of service lanes on both sides of the road near Narsinghpur village. It took around six hours to restore normal traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gurugram-submerges-after-heavy-rain/article32399048.ece

On Monday, the police had registered an FIR based on a complaint filed by Ms. Das, stating that she has been receiving threats and offensive messages on social media. The officer said that Ms. Das had given her statement in detail. In her complaint and statement to the police, she had identified several social media accounts for issuing threats and posting offensive messages. The police have written to Facebook and Twitter seeking details like activity, name of the users and other details of the accounts. “After getting the details of social media accounts which the complainant has identified in her statement to police, those will be verified and, if required, they will be asked to join the probe,” said the officer. In her complaint, Ms. Das said the threats were in relation to an article dated August 14 this year that was published in The Wall Street Journal and further in a “mischaracterised and distorted” manner in India by various publications and widely circulated on the social media. She has identified a few Twitter and Facebook accounts in her complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-ask-fb-twitter-for-details-in-ankhi-das-case/article32399007.ece

Venkaiah Naidu about all these police complaints against me and also tell him about the injustice done by the BJP government under Adityanath,” he said. He asked whether, as a member of Rajya Sabha, he doesn’t have the right to talk about the injustice against the people. “It is unfortunate that being a Rajya Sabha member when I raised questions against Yogi Adityanath, he tried to make me a history-sheeter,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-claims-bjp-leaders-supporters-have-joined-party/article32399013.ece

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, however, accused the Opposition of continuing to play dirty politics at a time when Punjab was going through a critical period due to COVID-19 crisis. Capt. Amarinder Singh on Wednesday expressed shock at the reaction of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal and AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema, terming it as a manifestation of the total lack of sensitivity and concern on the part of the two Opposition parties in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/oppn-flays-punjab-govt-over-one-day-session/article32399040.ece
20 August 2020||New Delhi,||Auto top-up feature in new metro cards||In a bid to ensure social distancing when metro services resume, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to launch smart cards that enable automatic recharge at the Automatic Fare Collection gates. The cards, issued by app ‘Autope’, will offer auto top-up functionality whenever the value of the smart cards is below Rs. 100. “Automatic recharge of Rs. 200 will happen at the AFC entry gate itself. Autope will auto-debit the value from the customer’s linked card or bank account,” said officials. DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said, “This new measure will eliminate the need for queuing at metro stations to recharge cards. Currently, even in case of online recharges, the card needs to be presented to the Add Value Machines (AVMs) for the value to get validated. Autope eliminates the AVM layer as well.” Officials said commuters can get the feature enabled in existing metro cards by registering on the Autope app.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/auto-top-up-feature-in-new-metro-cards/article32399005.ece
