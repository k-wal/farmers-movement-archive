01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Core sector output shrinks 15% in June, fertilizers buck trend||The output of eight core sector industries shrank for the fourth straight month in June 2020, although the contraction eased to 15%, showing some recovery from the 22% fall in May, according to data released by the Commerce Ministry on Friday. Economists expect the negative trend to continue for at least two more months. During April-June 2020-21, the sector’s output dipped by 24.6% as compared to a positive growth of 3.4% in the same period previous year. Monsoon boost Of the eight core sectors, the fertilizer industry was the only one which saw actual growth in June, with output rising 4.2% in comparison to June 2019. This, however, is lower than the May 2020 growth of 7.5%, but reflects the positive outlook in the agriculture sector where a normal monsoon is leading to expectations of a bumper kharif crop. The remaining industries showed contraction, with the steel sector continuing to remain the worst performer, with a 33% drop in production in comparison to the previous year. Cement production fell almost 7%, albeit an improvement from the 22% contraction seen in May. The energy sectors also showed negative growth, with coal production falling 15.5% and crude oil and natural gas production dropping 6% and 12% respectively. Refinery squeeze Petroleum refinery production, which carries the greatest weight in the core sector index, saw a contraction of almost 9% while electricity generation dropped 11%. “The daily mobility and power indicators do show sequential improvement in May and June but it is now plateauing out in July, so it is hard to predict when sluggish economic activity will recover,” said India Ratings chief economist D.K. Pant. “The national lockdown may have been lifted, but several States have announced their own lockdowns till the end of August, and even globally, we are seeing a second wave of infections,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/core-sector-output-shrinks-15-in-june-fertilizers-buck-trend/article32245141.ece
01 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Governor clears 3-capital and CRDA repeal Bills||In a major turning point in the history of Andhra Pradesh, Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Friday gave his assent to the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and AP Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Bills - 2020. The clearance of the decentralisation Bill facilitates the development of Amaravati, Kurnool and Visakhapatnam as the legislative, judicial and executive capitals respectively. The repeal of the CRDA paves the way for the formation of the Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority. The government is free now to give the ‘three capitals’ proposal a tangible shape while a batch of petitions that challenged the two Bills is pending adjudication by the HC. As per the Decentralisation Bill, Visakhapatnam will have the Raj Bhavan, the Secretariat and offices of the Heads of Departments at Visakhapatnam, and Amaravati will be the seat of the legislature. Regarding the judicial capital, the Bill says: “The seat of all State judicial institutions established under the State legislations, shall, as far as practicable, be located in Kurnool.” Accordingly, the principal seat of the HC will be located in Kurnool and Benches constituted as per the procedure laid down in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. The Bills were considered as ‘deemed to be passed’ as one month has elapsed after their introduction in the Legislative Council for the second time, as per Clause 2 of Article 197 of the Constitution notwithstanding the fact that they were not cleared by the Upper House. The Bills were subsequently sent on that premise to the Governor, who took his time to scrutinise them in the context of the legal tangle. The Bills were first passed in the Assembly in January, but the TDP had stalled them in the Council by leveraging on its majority in the 58-member House and got them referred to a Select Committee. The Opposition alleged that the Select Committee was not formed but the Bills were passed in the Assembly and sent to the Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-governor-clears-three-capital-crda-repeal-bills/article32245069.ece

The new cases reported on Friday is 885, while the remaining 425 cases were added on from Thursday’s tally. Following technical glitches, the Health Department had not been able to compile the data from Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and Kasaragod districts on Thursday. Health workers Of the 1,310 new cases, 1,207 are locally acquired infections, of which 36 cases have not been traced to any particular source of infection. Twenty health-care workers have also been affected. Three deaths were officially confirmed, two in Ernakulam and one in Kollam, taking the toll to 73.

Thiruvananthapuram leads among districts with 320 cases, of which all except one are locally acquired infections. There seems to be no let up in disease transmission within some of the coastal clusters in the district from where the disease has been spreading into newer coastal villages and the city. The number of persons undergoing treatment in the district has swelled to 3,078, of which a chunk are being managed at COVID first line treatment centres.

01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||KVs unlikely to change medium of instruction||The Centre is unlikely to implement its own National Education Policy (NEP) recommendations regarding the medium of instruction in Kendriya Vidyalayas, which are directly controlled by the Education Ministry, or in schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. Since the KVs and CBSE schools cater to the needs of people in transferable jobs, it would not be practical to use students’ mother tongue or regional languages as the medium of instruction, senior officials said. Since the NEP was released earlier this week, the fiercest debates have raged around the clause calling for the mother tongue or local language to be used as the medium of instruction “wherever possible” at least until Class 5, but preferably till Class 8 and beyond. “This will be followed by both public and private schools,” the NEP said. In an interview with The Hindu on Friday, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank clarified that it would be up to the State governments to decide on how this would be implemented in schools under their jurisdiction. However, when asked about the Kendriya Vidyalayas, which come under Central jurisdiction, he only said, “The beauty of this policy is flexibility... We will try to take everyone along in the process of making a vibrant India.” ‘Fantastic idea’ A senior official in charge of the Kendriya Vidyalayas said this recommendation could not be implemented. “Ideally, that is a fantastic idea, and academically that is very, very correct. Unfortunately, in our country, that doesn’t happen. The child speaks one language at home and then it comes to school and is totally puzzled and confused when it is suddenly exposed to English,” said the official, adding that the policy had not mandated the use of mother tongue because of the variations that exist across the country. ‘Miniature India’ “For example, in KVs, any school, any one class is like a miniature India. In that one class, you will find people from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanniyakumari. Because we are catering to the needs of Central government employees... they are posted anywhere. So which medium of instruction can we use? That is practically difficult for us. But the policy also says ‘wherever possible’. We can teach as many languages as possible, but using them as the medium of instruction in KVs may not be possible for us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kvs-unlikely-to-change-medium-of-instruction/article32245142.ece
01 August 2020||Srinagar,||Sajad Lone released from detention||Peoples Conference (PC) chief Sajad Lone was released ahead of Id-ul-Zuha on Friday after 360 days of detention. However, the detention of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was extended by three months. “Finally, five days short of a year I am a free man. Jail was not a new experience for me. Earlier ones were harsh... But this was psychologically draining. Much to share hopefully soon,” Mr. Lone, a former Minister and son of assassinated leader Abdul Ghani Lone, said. Mr. Lone was one of the signatories of the Gupkar Declaration, a statement signed by most of the regional parties on August 4 last year “to pledge a joint fight to protect J&K’s special status”. Ms. Mufti, one of the architects of the declaration, however, will remain behind bars, with her detention extended under the Public Safety Act (PSA) till November. Both Ms. Mufti and Mr. Lone were arrested on August 4-5 last year as the Centre revoked J&K’s special status. Over 230 mainstream leaders and activists were arrested during the period of political change. Most of the leaders have been released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sajad-lone-released-from-detention/article32245329.ece
01 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,||Post-mortem clip confirms injuries on bodies of Jayaraj, Benicks||A video shared widely on social media on Friday showing deep injuries on the bodies of P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks, which was shot during their post-mortem examination, strengthens the charge that the duo was tortured in police custody in the Sattankulam station. The video shows Judicial Magistrate-I of Kovilpatti M.S. Bharathidasan taking notes during the post-mortem. The clip was first hosted by Tamil magazine Nakkheeran on its website and YouTube channel. In the clip, forensic experts turn the body around to indicate and mark the injuries — including raw, red flesh on Benicks buttocks and crusted blood on the face of his father Jayaraj. The injuries pointed to heavy assault on both. The father and son were in police custody for over eight hours and the police, led by inspector Sridhar, allegedly carried out the assault. Relatives break down Even as the bodies were to be taken up for post-mortem examination, some family members were allowed inside the room to identify the victims. The video shows the relatives breaking down on seeing the gruesome injuries on the bodies. Earlier, the doctors who examined Benicks at the Kovilpatti Government Hospital on June 22 had noted injuries in the gluteal region. It is confirmed in the clip. Human rights activist Henry Tiphagne of People’s Watch sai, “In a land where the much celebrated Right to Information Act has been in vogue for 15 years, the post-mortem report, which was submitted in court in a sealed cover, could not be accessed by the family. The government, which has given compensation and a junior assistant job to the family, could not ensure access to the post-mortem report to the affected family. The family has got every right to go through the post-mortem report as it has the right to know the reason behind the death of two of its members.” He added that the video almost nailed the perpetrators.

01 August 2020||Chandigarh,||Spurious liquor kills 38 in Punjab||At least 38 people have died over the past 48 hours in three districts of Punjab allegedly after consuming spurious liquor. The police have so far arrested eight persons in the case, said Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta on Friday. He said a large quantity of spurious liquor, drums and cans were recovered from the accused. While Balwinder Kaur and Mithu were arrested from Amritsar rural district, two persons identified as Darshan Rani and Rajan were nabbed from Batala district. Four others — Kashmir Singh, Angrez Singh, Amarjit and Baljit — were arrested from Tarn Taran. An FIR has been registered under Sections 304, 307 and 120 of the Indian Penal Code. “As of Friday evening, 10 persons had died of spurious liquor consumption in Amritsar rural, nine in Batala and 19 in Tarn Taran. The death toll could rise further as the spurious liquor network was evidently spread across many areas,” said the officer, adding that the questioning of the accused could lead to further arrests. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry by the Divisional Commissioner, Jalandhar, into the suspicious deaths in Amritsar, Batala and Tarn Taran districts, said an official government statement. The CM has given the Divisional Commissioner the liberty to co-opt any civil-police officer or any expert to facilitate the expeditious conduct of the inquiry. Capt. Amarinder also directed the police to launch a search operation to crack down on any spurious liquor manufacturing units that may be operating in the State, said the statement. Judicial probe The Shiromani Akali Dal, however, demanded a judicial probe by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court into the matter. SAD leader and former Minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the inquiry ordered by the Chief Minister was “too little, too late and would not serve any purpose”. He alleged that the supply of spurious liquor was widespread across districts and required a thorough investigation by an independent agency. “The multiple hooch tragedies had exposed the underbelly of the illegal liquor trade in Punjab... The government should act on complaints with reports suggesting that the police failed to act despite complaints about sale of spurious liquor in Muchhal,” he said. The Congress’s Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa asked the Chief Minister for a time-bound judicial probe. “@capt_amarinder ji if you really want to unearth the truth behind the demise of 21 people due to spurious liquor and bring justice to their families, nothing other than a time bound inquiry by a sitting judge from the Punjab & Haryana High Court will suffice [sic],” tweeted Mr. Bajwa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/spurious-liquor-kills-38-in-punjab/article32245144.ece

01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Congress chief whip moves SC||Congress chief whip in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly Mahesh Joshi on Friday moved the Supreme Court against a State High Court direction to the Speaker to maintain status quo in the disqualification proceedings initiated against ousted Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs under the anti-defection law. Mr. Joshi said the High Court order on July 24 violated a Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in the Kihoto Hollohan case of 1992. The verdict had categorically held that courts should not intervene in disqualification proceedings prior to a final decision from the Speaker. Judicial review of disqualification proceedings was very limited. Mr. Joshi said the High Court, however, had intervened at the stage of notice in the disqualification action and even before any harm befell Mr. Pilot and other legislators. Mr. Pilot and others had jointly moved the High Court against the anti-defection notices issued by the Speaker on July 14. The writ petitions filed by them were “premature and non-maintainable”. “There was absolutely no adverse order of any kind against the respondents [Pilot and other 18 MLAs]”, the petition said. It argued that by challenging the constitutionality of Paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which mandates that “voluntarily giving up membership of party” amounts to defection, Mr. Pilot was attempting to “emasculate” the anti-defection law itself. “The writ petition filed by the respondents seek to raise the question of constitutional validity of Para 2(1)(a) of Tenth Schedule. These prayers were also ex facie non-maintainable as the validity of the Tenth Schedule was extensively considered, deliberated and upheld by the Supreme Court in Kihoto Hollohan... Even otherwise, mere pendency of a challenge to a statutory/constitutional provision in a writ petition cannot and could not have the effect of negating the provision itself”, the petition argued. The chief whip’s appeal comes after Speaker C.P. Joshi’s plea, which said the “status quo” order of the High Court had crossed the ‘Lakshman Rekha’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-chief-whip-moves-sc/article32245101.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Indian bid for airport too high: Dhaka||Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen on Friday said the contract for building an airport terminal at Sylhet was not awarded to an Indian firm because of a high bid and therefore, went to a Chinese firm. “From what I have heard, the Chinese are technically qualified and have the lowest rates. India’s offer was too much and as a result they could not make it,” Dr. Momen was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune .  The Hindu and other news outlets had earlier reported that the construction of a new terminal at MAG Osmani International Airport at Sylhet had gone to BUCG (Beijing Urban Construction Group). Indian construction giant Larsen & Toubro was among the bidders for the project. The proximity of Sylhet to India’s northeast and a possible concentration of Chinese workers in the area has given rise to security concerns. Tender norms “The question arose, why the job was given to China and not India. In this case, work is given considering the technical and financial aspects by following the tender process,” Dr. Momen said. Addressing the media ahead of Id, the senior Minister referred to several issues related to India and China, and said New Delhi had not reached out to Bangladesh seeking support on the border standoff with China. Dr Momen said India had not communicated nor had it delivered a diplomatic note to Dhaka regarding the situation in Ladakh where Indian and Chinese forces have faced-off for the last three months. Galwan and after Referring to the incident in the Galwan Valley on June 15, Dr. Momen said, “few” Indian soldiers had died. But he cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comment and said as per the Indian leader, the Chinese have not occupied “an inch” of Indian territory. “The Indian government did not send us any verbal notes that any of their people have died. As a result, naturally we did not make any statement,” the Foreign Minister said when asked about Dhaka’s studied silence on the issue. Dr. Momen had earlier told The Hindu that his country advocated dialogue and regional peace.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-bid-for-airport-too-high-dhaka/article32245124.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘India’s fatality rate among world’s lowest’||Of the total COVID-19 active case load, 0.28% patients are on ventilators, 1.61% patients required ICU support and 2.32% are on oxygen support, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday following the 19th meeting of the Group of Ministers (GOM) on COVID-19. He added that India has one of the lowest case fatality rates globally, which is also steadily decreasing. Active cases “India has conducted a record 6,42,588 COVID-19 tests in the last 24 hours. The active cases under medical supervision are only 33.27% or approximately one-third of the total positive cases. India’s case fatality rate is also progressively reducing and currently stands at 2.18%, one of the lowest globally,” the Minister said. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director Sujeet K. Singh, presenting the global comparison on daily cases, deaths and growth rate in the top 10 countries with the highest case load, said the overall recovery rate for India was 64.54%. “The highest recovery rate is being recorded by Delhi at 89.08%, followed by Haryana [79.82%]. Karnataka has the lowest recovery rate of 39.36%,” he said. Reduce mortality Dr. Singh added that efforts were being made to reduce mortality in high case-load districts and cities as also cities showing recent upsurge like Pune, Thane, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, among others. “The measures to be taken include revamping the strategy for effective management of containment zones through stricter perimeter control; widespread Rapid Antigen Tests; intensive and rapid door-to-door search; more isolation facilities for suspects/cases; standard case management protocols along with increase in oxygen supported beds and ventilators and assessing true burden through planned sero-surveys,” a release issued by the Health Ministry said. The GoM was also apprised of the ramping up of the domestic production capacities of various sectors for manufacturing PPE, masks, ventilators and drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In terms of healthcare logistics, 268.25 lakh N95 masks, 120.40 lakh PPEs and 1,083.77 lakh HCQ tablets have been distributed to States/Union Territories and Central institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indias-fatality-rate-among-worlds-lowest/article32245104.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Surplus rain likely in two months||The monsoon rainfall in August and September is likely to be more than anticipated with chances of a particularly active September. Rains during June and July have so far been textbook-like with India getting 44.7cm (until July 30) as opposed to the historical normal of 44.3. This has contributed to farmers sowing more than what they did the corresponding period last year. In a forecast update on Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that rainfall in the “second half of the monsoon” is likely to be 104% — another of their models puts it at 106% — of the Long Period Average (LPA), a 50-year average of what is usual for that period. Rain within a 4% window of what is forecast are considered to be ‘normal’ by the IMD. However, rainfall in August is likely to be only 97% of its LPA, the IMD said, sticking to a forecast estimate from June. August, like July, is a key month for the monsoon as it contributes about 30% of the overall monsoon rainfall. (July tops with 33%). September is the month when the monsoon is on the wane, and contributes only about 16%. Were the IMD’s forecast to hold, this would imply that September rains could be significantly more than what’s normal and go up to as much as 20%. Subdued July “July rainfall was below what we had expected [the IMD forecast 103% LPA] and subdued rainfall over Central India is likely to continue until August 5,” said Mrityunjay Mohapatra, Director-General, IMD. “Extended range models show a pickup thereafter and September rains too are likely to be on the higher side,” he added. Another IMD scientist said that by the second half of the season, La Nina-like conditions, or a cooling of the Central Equatorial Pacific, is likely to commence. “In August, though the forecast is for 97%, the inbuilt error of the forecast model is +-9%. And given the conditions emerging, there are chances of more rain than expected. September too is likely to see good rains,” D.S. Pai, head, Climate Research and Services, IMD Pune told The Hindu . Data from 685 districts show that nearly 38% registered normal rains, 33% deficient or no rains and 29% excess rains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/surplus-rain-likely-in-two-months/article32245107.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||No word from U.K. on Mallya case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has not yet received any official communication from the United Kingdom authorities on reasons for the delay in giving final clearance to the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya. Over two months ago, the U.K. High Court of Justice turned down his application seeking permission to move the Supreme Court against the dismissal of his appeal countering the lower court’s approval to his extradition to India. The issue had to be finally decided by the U.K. Home Office. “We are not aware of any decision taken by the U.K. authorities in the matter so far. They have not even informed us about any pending legal issue involved in the process,” said a senior ED official. In June, a British High Commission spokesperson said Mr. Mallya could not be extradited at that stage as the U.K. needed to resolve a “confidential” legal issue. Asylum plea reports Shortly thereafter, there were reports that he had applied for asylum in the U.K. under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which pertains to protection against torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Appeal dismissed On April 20, a division bench of the U.K. High Court dismissed Mr. Mallya’s appeal against the Senior District Judge’s judgment on December 10, 2018, allowing his extradition. It held that a prima facie case was made out against him on accounts of fraud, misrepresentation to the bank in securing credit facilities, conspiracy and money laundering. The CBI and the ED have sought the extradition in connection with the IDBI Bank fraud case. As alleged, between September 1, 2009, and January 24, 2017, Mr. Mallya conspired with the others to commit cheating. They fraudulently got loans sanctioned for the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Mr. Mallya was also allegedly involved in false representation to the bank on the company’s financial condition and the value and/or availability of securities to be relied upon for sanctioning credit facilities. The funds so raised were diverted and laundered. Wilful loan defaults Mr. Mallya and others stand accused of wilful loan defaults to the tune of Rs. 9,000 crore. He had flown out of India on March 2, 2016. After the CBI charge-sheeted him in the IDBI case, the Indian government made an extradition request on February 9, 2017. Subsequently, he was arrested by the U.K, Police and released on conditional on April 18, 2017. Based on the ED’s request in the money laundering case, he was again arrested on October 3, 2017, and then bailed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-word-from-uk-on-mallya-case/article32245122.ece
01 August 2020||Bhopal,||Pregnant women, aged must get lower berths: HC||The Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed the Railways to reconsider the prioritisation of lower berth allotment in trains to favour pregnant women and senior citizens over VVIPs. A Division Bench of Justices Sanjay Yadav and Atul Sreedharan noted that the rationale of officials and VVIPs being given priority in berth reservation was understandable as they had to travel at short notice on duty. “However, as regards the priority of allocation of the lower berth is concerned, the same as it exists on date is unpragmatic,” they observed in an order. Pregnant women were “most vulnerable” on account of their medical condition, observed the Bench in the order dated July 27, and it would cause them inconvenience in occupying the middle or upper berths. “The dictates of reason” and “the fulfilment of a welfare state” demanded that such women be given the highest priority, along with passengers suffering from terminal illness or life-threatening ailments and those who were “physically or mentally challenged” be considered as priority number 1 for the allotment of the lower berth, the order said. ‘VVIPs in better health’ The Bench observed that senior citizens on account of their advanced age and attendant medical issues should be considered at priority number 2. VVIPs, usually serving state functionaries who were “invariably blessed with better health,” should be considered at priority number 3. The court was hearing a public interest litigation registered by it suo motu based on an application by a High Court judge after a train journey. The judge later put forth three suggestions to the Railways to ensure passenger comfort. Aditya Sanghi, made a petitioner in the case by the court in addition to the amicus curiae , said, “Whether it’s a tuberculosis patient or one with paralysis, several times they are allotted such seats [middle and upper berths] on which they can’t travel. This is a landmark order by the court.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pregnant-women-aged-must-get-lower-berths-hc/article32245136.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Rigorous consultations done before framing new National Education Policy’||The State governments will take a decision on the medium of instruction in schools under their jurisdiction, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank says on the new National Education Policy (NEP). He expresses concern over a severe scarcity of skilled language teachers and the policy’s recommendations on governance and financing reforms.  Is the policy decision to make the mother tongue the medium of instruction till Class 5 going to be implemented mandatorily across the country, or is it optional for each State Education Department to adopt? Has the Centre taken the States’ views on board on this issue? Have any States raised concerns on implementing this? The Ministry of Education has conducted a rigorous consultation process to ensure an inclusive, participatory and holistic approach while framing the NEP. Over two lakh suggestions from 2.5 lakh gram panchayats, 6,600 blocks, 6,000 urban local bodies (ULBs), 676 districts were received. Most developed countries have made an earnest effort to ensure that the child studies in the mother tongue so that both parents and children participate in education in the early years of the child. Young children learn and grasp non-trivial concepts more quickly in their home language/mother tongue. Thereby, the New Education Policy states that, “Wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/ local language/ regional language.” The RTE Act 2009 also states that the medium of instruction, as far as practicable, shall be the mother tongue. The decision regarding the medium of instruction in schools coming under their jurisdiction is to be taken by the respective State governments. What is the timeline for implementing this decision? Are there sufficient teachers trained for this in all regional languages? There has been a severe scarcity of skilled language teachers in India. There will be a major effort from both the Central and State governments to invest in large numbers of language teachers in all regional languages around the country, and, in particular, for all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. States from different regions of India may enter into bilateral agreements to hire teachers in large numbers from each other, to satisfy the three-language formula in their respective States, and also to encourage the study of Indian languages across the country. Language teaching too must be improved to be more experiential and to focus on the ability to converse and interact in the language and not just on the literature, vocabulary, and grammar of the language. Languages must be used more extensively for conversation and for teaching-learning. A number of initiatives will be adopted to foster languages in school as well as higher education. Strong departments and programmes in Indian languages, comparative literature, creative writing, arts, music, philosophy, etc. will be launched and developed across the country, and degrees including four-year B.Ed. dual degrees will be developed in these subjects. Will the private and public schools affiliated to the CBSE and the ICSE be asked to mandatorily convert to teaching in the mother tongue only till Class 5? How about Kendriya Vidyalayas that are directly controlled by the Centre? The beauty of this policy is flexibility. The intent of the policy follows the mandate given under the Right to Education Act. We will try to take everyone along in the process of making a vibrant India. The NEP mentions traditional Indian knowledge systems to be included in the curriculum. What are some of the topics and themes you think need to be included, and who are the experts that the Centre will rope in to ensure that this is done? We have just come out with the policy. This will be the mandate of the National Curriculum Framework Committee to decide what topics constitute traditional Indian knowledge systems. “Knowledge of India” will include knowledge from ancient India and its contributions to modern India and its successes and challenges, and a clear sense of India’s future aspirations with regard to education, health, environment, etc. These elements will be incorporated in an accurate and scientific manner throughout the school curriculum wherever relevant. The original NEP draft from Dr. K. Kasturirangan’s panel had proposed a Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog as an apex body to oversee all education in the country to be headed by the Prime Minister. Why was this removed from the final policy? Upon conducting several rounds of consultations, it was decided that there is a dire need to strengthen and empower the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) which will have a much greater mandate and not only be a forum for widespread consultation and examination of issues relating to educational and cultural development. The remodelled and rejuvenated CABE will be responsible for developing, articulating, evaluating, and revising the vision of education in the country on a continuous basis, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the corresponding apex bodies of States. It shall also create and continuously review the institutional frameworks that shall help attain this vision. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill has been at the draft stage for over a year now. When will it be introduced in Parliament? The Ministry of Education is almost ready with the Cabinet note for the same and will take approval of the government soon. Will the proposed increase of public funding for education to 6% of GDP be sufficient to finance all the proposed reforms? If not, how does the Centre propose to raise the needed funds for implementation? The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in the education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. In particular, financial support will be provided to various critical elements and components of education, such as ensuring universal access, learning resources, nutritional support, matters of student safety and well-being, adequate numbers of teachers and staff, teacher development, and support for all key initiatives towards equitable high-quality education for underprivileged and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Why was it important to change the name of the Ministry from Human Resource Development to Education? The name shifts the focus to the core work of the Ministry. The core work is imparting education to the millions of children and youth of the country. Now every personnel working in the Ministry will have this constant vision before him to improve the education system of the country.  The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in the education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rigorous-consultations-done-before-framing-new-national-education-policy/article32245094.ece
01 August 2020||PATNA,||Let CBI take up Sushant case: Bihar Deputy CM||Political parties in Bihar have been unanimous in demanding a CBI probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Bihar’s Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi alleged on Friday that Mumbai police was not cooperating with Bihar in its investigation and so the CBI should take over the case. The actor was found hanging in his flat in Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. “Mumbai police is placing obstructions in the way of fair investigation by the Bihar police... BJP feels that the CBI should take over this case,” tweeted Mr Modi. The Bihar police launched an investigation after the actor’s father Krishna Kumar Singh lodged an FIR against the actor’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and five others at the Rajiv Nagar police station here on July 25. He has accused them of cheating and abetment of suicide. A four-member team of the Patna police is currently in Mumbai. Ms. Chakraborty subsequently filed a plea in the Supreme Court to transfer the case from Patna to Mumbai. The Bihar government has roped in former Attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi to oppose Ms. Chakraborty’s plea. Earlier, Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan and other leaders across party lines had demanded a CBI probe. LJP president Chirag Paswan even spoke to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar assembly Tejashwi Yadav, along with leaders from the Congress and other alliance parties, also insisted on a CBI probe, as have leaders of the ruling JD(U) and BJP in the State. The chorus for a CBI probe has baffled many in the State. “Is it all because Assembly elections are just round the corner and no political party wants to go against a popular sentiment?” wondered political observer Ajay Kumar. “Wasn’t it the same CBI that has been unable to conclude the famous Navruna Chakravarty case even after getting 10 extensions from the Supreme Court?” Twelve-year-old Navruna was kidnapped on the intervening night of September 18-19 in 2012 from her home in Muzaffarpur town, allegedly by those belonging to the land mafia-police-political nexus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/let-cbi-take-up-sushant-case-bihar-deputy-cm/article32245138.ece
01 August 2020||Chandigarh,||Spurious liquor kills 38 in Punjab||At least 38 people have died over the past 48 hours in three districts of Punjab allegedly after consuming spurious liquor. The police have so far arrested eight persons in the case, said Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta on Friday. He said a large quantity of spurious liquor, drums and cans were recovered from the accused. While Balwinder Kaur and Mithu were arrested from Amritsar rural district, two persons identified as Darshan Rani and Rajan were nabbed from Batala district. Four others — Kashmir Singh, Angrez Singh, Amarjit and Baljit — were arrested from Tarn Taran. An FIR has been registered under Sections 304, 307 and 120 of the Indian Penal Code. “As of Friday evening, 10 persons had died of spurious liquor consumption in Amritsar rural, nine in Batala and 19 in Tarn Taran. The death toll could rise further as the spurious liquor network was evidently spread across many areas,” said the officer, adding that the questioning of the accused could lead to further arrests. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry by the Divisional Commissioner, Jalandhar, into the suspicious deaths in Amritsar, Batala and Tarn Taran districts, said an official government statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/spurious-liquor-kills-38-in-punjab/article32245378.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru/Mangaluru,||BJP serves legal notice on Congress||Even as the Congress intensified its campaign on Friday alleging corruption in COVID-19 management in the State, the BJP served Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and Congress State president D.K. Shivakumar legal notice asking them to not only withdraw their allegations but also apologise for making “unsubstantiated charges” or face legal action. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar on Friday held the first in a series of press interactions in Mangaluru on the alleged corruption in COVIID-19 management. He also released a booklet titled Coronadalli Bhrashtachara; BJP Sarkarada Samskara . He reiterated the demand for a judicial probe bya sitting High Court judge. The government, he alleged, had failed to even ensure the decent burial/cremation of deceased persons while “making money” in the purchase ofequipment. Responding to allegations that the Congress was making unsubstantiated charges, he said the party would submit all the necessary documents before a judicial commission if it is set up. Meanwhile, N. Ravikumar, general secretary, BJP-Karnataka, served legal notice through a lawyer to Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar. The notice argues that while the two leaders had made several “slanderous statements” against the BJP and the State government, it was curious to note that they had also made an application before the State government regarding details of COVID-19-related expenses and the procurement of various medical material. He described the allegations as “calculated to lower the image of the party and the government” without any proof.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-serves-legal-notice-on-congress/article32245072.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Road accident victims taken to hospital on pushcart||The paucity of ambulance services led a group of youth in Mahbubnagar to take matters into their own hands, as they pushed accident victims in the dead of the night on a pushcart to the hospital. Twenty three-year-old Mohammed Sufiyan Ali and Mohammed Aijaz, both businessmen and social activists, were out helping a friend dealing with an emergency. Around 1.30 a.m. on July 30, they received a call about a road accident in Mettugadda, near the electricity office. “We saw two youngsters on the road who were seriously injured. We looked around for help but found nothing. We called 108 for nearly 45 minutes, but there was no ambulance available. All the private vehicles we tried to stop were full,” says Sufiyan, who is also the State secretary of the Students Islamic Organisation. With no help in sight, the duo and their associates saw a mirchi pushcart nearby. They put the injured persons on it and began to push it towards the hospital as fast as they could. “The only thing on our minds was to try and save them. Aijaz and I along with the others took the injured to the Government General Hospital in Mahbubnagar. It was after 1.30 a.m. and we pushed the bandi for nearly 1.5 km. We then moved the injured persons onto the stretcher and with the help of the hospital staff, took them inside,” Sufiyan said. The youth then followed up on the treatment of the injured persons the next day, but found out that they were moved to the Osmania General Hospital. Their names were not recorded and their identity was registered as ‘unknown’, the said. “We only wish that that ambulance services are readily available here,” they said. The duo are not strangers to helping people. In the recent past, during the lockdown, Aijaz, says Sufian, was involved in distributing ration to migrant workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/road-accident-victims-taken-to-hospital-on-pushcart/article32245417.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Modi govt. empowered Muslim women’||Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Friday said August 1 should be recorded as “Muslim Women’s Rights Day” in the country as the day marked the anniversary of the law making triple talaq a criminal offence. Mr. Naqvi was addressing a virtual function organised by his Ministry to mark the first anniversary of the passage of the law. It was attended by Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani. “Several bold and big reforms are a reflection of our honest and effective efforts, which have delivered better results,” he said. “August 1 is a day that made Muslim women free from the social evil of triple talaq; It has been recorded in the country’s history as “Muslim Women Rights Day”. August 1 will remain as a golden moment of Indian democracy and parliamentary history,” he observed. The Modi government, he asserted, had ensured gender equality and strengthened constitutional, fundamental and democratic rights of Muslim women by bringing law against the social evil of triple talaq. “Triple talaq or Talaq-a-Biddat was neither Islamic nor legal. Despite the fact, it was given ‘political patronage’ by ‘merchants of votes’,” he stated. “The law against social evil of triple talaq could have been passed in 1986 when the Hon’ble Supreme Court gave the historic judgement in the Shahbano Case. The Congress had absolute majority in Parliament with more than 400 out of 545 Lok Sabha members and more than 159 out of 245 members in the Rajya Sabha. But the then Rajiv Gandhi government used its strength in Parliament to make the SC judgement ineffective and deprive the Muslim women of their constitutional and fundamental rights,” he said. Decline in talaq cases The Modi government made the law against triple talaq to make effective the SC judgement. “One year has passed since the law against triple talaq was passed and there is a decline of about 82% in such cases thereafter. If any such case was reported, the law had taken action,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-govt-empowered-muslim-women/article32245099.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Doctors’ quarantine days must not be marked leave: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday expressed shock when doctors and health workers complained that the days they spent in quarantine after performing COVID-19 duty was being marked as holiday by authorities. “They are being compulsorily quarantined after duty... And you are taking advantage and taking away their leave?” Justice M.R. Shah, one of the judges on the Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said. The court directed the Centre, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, to look into the issue. The court was also informed that five States — Tripura, Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi and Karnataka — had not paid full salaries to doctors and health workers. The court had on June 17 directed States to pay the full salaries within the next 24 hours. The court asked the Centre to ensure, even by using its sweeping powers under the Disaster Management Act, that doctors and health workers get their full salaries within a week. On June 17, the court, acting on a petition filed by Dr. Arushi Jain, had also ordered States to provide appropriate accommodation and implement quarantine guidelines uniformly among medical staffers and doctors, regardless of the nature of their exposure to COVID-19 patients. The court had taken exception to how quarantine was done away with for medical workers except those in high-risk categories. It had said no distinction could be made between health workers in high-risk areas and others as far as quarantine was concerned. Senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan, for petitioner Dr. Arushi Jain, said in most cases medical staffers had their aged parents staying with them. Dr. Jain has questioned the Centre’s new standard operating procedure (SOP) of May 15 for frontline COVID-19 Health Care Workers (HCWs) by which it has ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/doctors-quarantine-days-must-not-be-marked-leave-sc/article32245109.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Pandemic a chance for a new world order||The COVID-19 pandemic has given the world a chance to reflect and take “outrageously bold decisions” to create a new order, Nobel laureate and founder of the Grameen Bank Muhammad Yunus said in a virtual conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday. Instead of being eager to “get back to where they were”, Mr. Yunus said the pandemic has given societies to think anew and create a world order where “there is no global warming, no wealth concentration and no unemployment”. The conversation with the Nobel laureate is part of the dialogue series launched by Mr. Gandhi since the outbreak in India. For bold decisions “COVID-19 has given us a chance to reflect on how big, bold decisions can be taken. It has given us a window of thinking and we have a choice, whether we go to that terrible world which is going to destroy itself anyway or we go some place else and build a new world where there will be no global warming, no wealth concentration, no unemployment. It is possible,” Mr. Yunus said. Reflecting on the plight of the poor and migrant workers, Mr. Yunus, who revolutionised the world of micro-credit financing with the Grameen Bank, asserted that financial systems are designed in ways that do not recognise the poor. “Economics doesn’t recognise these people. They call it the informal sector. If we can finance them they will move up the ladder,” he said. Mr. Gandhi said the pandemic was an opportunity for societies to re-imagine and press the reset button.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-a-chance-for-a-new-world-order/article32245111.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||1947 pact on Gurkha soldiers redundant: Nepal Minister||The 1947 agreement among India, Nepal and the United Kingdom that deals with the military service of Gurkha soldiers has become “redundant,” Foreign Minister of Nepal Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said on Friday. In an online interaction organised by the Nepal Institute of International Relations, the Minister also said India should respond to Nepal’s request for talks on the Kalapani dispute to prevent the issue from impacting people-to-people relations. “Gurkha recruitment was on the one hand the first window that was opened to Nepali youth to go abroad... In the changed context, some of those provisions have become questionable. Tripartite agreement of 1947 has become redundant,” said Mr. Gyawali. He spoke of a possible “bilateral” arrangement with India regarding the Gurkha soldiers. The 1947 agreement divided the Gurkha regiments of the British empire between India and the United Kingdom. However, Gurkha veterans have been alleging that the U.K. has been discriminating against them. Mr. Gyawali did not spell out the specific terms that Nepal wishes to discuss with India on the Gurkha soldiers in the Indian military.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/1947-pact-on-gurkha-soldiers-redundant-nepal-minister/article32245113.ece

Biren on Friday appealed to armed rebels to eschew the path of violence and come to the negotiating table to thrash out all contentious issues. “There is no room for violence in a democracy,” he said. He was speaking at a brief ceremony at the Imphal international airport to pay last respects to Ratan Salam of 4 Assam Rifles, before his body was taken to his home in Kakching district for cremation.

01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||In SC, UGC pushes for exams by Sept.-end||The University Grants Commission (UGC) orally made a submission in the Supreme Court on Friday that students should not break their preparation for final year exams to be conducted “by the end of September 2020”. Though a UGC affidavit filed on July 31 said the exams were scheduled “by the end of September 2020” to give varsities sufficient time to make arrangements amid the pandemic, the same affidavit also goes on to inform the court that information received from 818 universities show that 603 varsities had conducted their final year exams or were in the process of conducting exams during August-September 2020. Keep on studying: SG On Friday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UGC, by means of abundant caution, said “let nobody be under the impression that final exams will be stayed because Supreme Court is hearing the case. Students should continue to prepare for their exams”. The submission was made during a hearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar. The UGC is strongly advocating the conduct of the final year exams by September 30 in compliance with its July 6 guidelines while keeping in mind the health and safety of students. Crucial step in career The hearing is based on a bunch of petitions filed by over 30 students challenging the conduct of exams amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The court ordered the Maharashtra and NCT Delhi governments to submit reports on the ground situation in the fight against COVID-19 from their respective State Disaster Management Committees within a week. It posted the case for August 10 for further orders after examining the reports. In its response, the UGC said the “final year/terminal semester exams is a crucial step in the academic career of a student”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-sc-ugc-pushes-for-exams-by-sept-end/article32245097.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Appeal in SC to lower Mullaperiyar’s level||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by a resident of Idukki district of Kerala to lower the water level of Mullaperiyar dam to 130 feet as there is a danger of earthquakes and floods in the area as monsoon progresses in the State. The Tamil Nadu government, however, countered before a three-judge Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar that the plea has become infructuous and Mr. Joy has a similar petition pending in the court. “Two years have passed and a similar matter is pending since 2018,” advocate G. Umapathy submitted. Advocate Wills Mathews, for Mr. Joy, said six districts in the State were under the threat of floods and earthquakes. Pleas tagged The Bench finally tagged the new plea along with the 2018 one and agreed to hear them on August 24. In early August 2018, on Mr. Joy’s plea, the Supreme Court had agreed with the conclusion of the disaster management sub-committee that the water level in the reservoir should be maintained two or three feet below the permissible limit of 142 feet till August 31 as an immediate precaution against floods or other disasters. The sub-committee had met on an urgent basis in the aftermath of the deluge that ravaged Kerala where the dam is located. It informed the court that the water level in the reservoir was 139.998 feet. Mr. Joy approached the court in 2018 during the heights of the flood situation in Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/appeal-in-sc-to-lower-mullaperiyars-level/article32245083.ece

It is different if there is a complete lockdown. But when other things are being opened, temples, mosques and churches should also be opened, at least on important occasions,” Justice Arun Mishra, heading a three-judge Bench, said orally. The court was hearing a plea by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against a Jharkhand High Court order restricting worshippers to virtual darshan at Baidyanath temple in Deogarh during Shravani mela.   The court requested the Jharkhand government to allow worshippers into the temple on a limited basis and set up a mechanism by which there was no huge congregation and devotees maintained distancing. Justice Mishra wondered how States could prevent people from exercising their fundamental right to faith and prayer at public places of worship when the country had opened up or was opening up after the pandemic-induced lockdown. “These [places of worship] are places of importance. Why not allow darshan on a limited basis? At least that is expected of a Welfare State,” Justice Mishra asked senior advocate Salman Khurshid, who led the Jharkhand government side.

While 53 MLAs left in the first batch for the Thar desert town, 560 km from Jaipur, others left subsequently by chartered flights in the evening. AICC general secretary Avinash Pande and Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, who have been camping in Jaipur as central observers, joined a small group of MLAs. The Gehlot camp has been claiming the support of 102 MLAs, including the Independents, in the 200-member Assembly. The legislators are likely to stay in Jaisalmer until the Assembly session, summoned by Governor Kalraj Mishra after much persuasion by the government, begins on August 14. Mr. Gehlot told reporters at Jaipur’s Sanganer airport that the MLAs supporting him had started getting calls with “threats and inducements” soon after the date for commencement of the Assembly session was announced. Reiterating his charge that the BJP was hatching a conspiracy to topple his government after its similar action in several States, Mr. Gehlot said it was the primary duty of everyone to save democracy. “When the Home Ministry is after us, we have to make all efforts to save the government with people's support. Home Minister Amit Shah is in the forefront of bringing down the elected governments,” he said. Mr. Gehlot said he would stay on in Jaipur along with his ministerial colleagues, ensuring “no compromise on governance” during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-shifts-pro-gehlot-mlas-to-jaisalmer/article32245084.ece

However, the detention of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was extended by three months. “Finally, five days short of a year I am a free man. Jail was not a new experience for me. Earlier ones were harsh... But this was psychologically draining. Much to share hopefully soon,” Mr. Lone, a former Minister and son of assassinated leader Abdul Ghani Lone, said. Mr. Lone was one of the signatories of the Gupkar Declaration, a statement signed by most of the regional parties on August 4 last year “to pledge a joint fight to protect J&K’s special status”. Ms. Mufti, one of the architects of the declaration, however, will not see freedom soon, with her detention extended under the Public Safety Act (PSA) till November. Both Ms. Mufti and Mr. Lone were arrested on August 4-5 last year as the Centre revoked J&K’s special status. Over 230 mainstream leaders and activists were arrested during the period of political change. Most of the leaders have been released.   Responding to the decision extending Ms Mufti’s detention, her daughter Iltija said: “Anything is expected from this regime. The petition challenging her unlawful detention has been pending in SC since February 26.

Investigators escorted K.T. Rameez, one of the suspects in the case, to an apartment in a high-rise complex near the Secretariat. Former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, M. Sivasankar, who was questioned by the agency as part of its probe into the national security ramifications of the case, had an apartment in the complex. The NIA took Rameez to the flat owned by Swapna and also a hotel he booked into during his trips to the capital.  The NIA has sought records relating to Rameez’s alleged bid to import powerful air rifles into the State under the cover of a shooting club. Meanwhile, the NIA’s presence in the capital triggered speculation it would record the statement of some higher-ups in government who had interacted with Swapna and Sarith.

A native of Shikaripur taluk, he was admitted to the government hospital at Shikaripur with respiratory problems on July 18. The hospital staff took his swab samples for COVID-19 test. His grandson Praveen told presspersons that the patient was shifted to Shivamogga on July 22. “However, we have not been able to trace him either at the hospital or at any of the COVID care centres in the district since then,” he said. When the family members enquired with the Shikaripur Taluk Health Officer Chandrappa, he reportedly told them that the patient died two days ago and the final rites had been carried out. “We were shocked to hear that. However, later, senior officers told us that the patient had gone missing,” Mr. Praveen said. The Health and Family Welfare Department has registered a missing person’s case with the police. When The Hindu contacted Shivamogga DC K.B. Shivakumar, he said the patient had gone missing and his whereabouts were being traced. The patient that Dr. Chandrappa had referred to was a different one, he added.

It may repeat the lockdown. “This is a matter of more serious concern,” Mr. Khurshid submitted. He asked the court how the State could be expected to “select” devotees to be allowed into the temple. The senior lawyer said even if the State could indeed “innovate” a mechanism for selecting people to be allowed in. When asked for his opinion, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, referred to temples in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh that had an online system for darshan based on Aadhaar card.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Fiscal deficit touches 83% of full-year target||Economists said given the government’s additional borrowing plans, both to meet stimulus spending and bridge the revenue shortfall as a result of the pandemic, the fiscal deficit may end up as high as 8% of GDP, far exceeding the budget’s goal of 3.5%. The Union government has received Rs. 1.53 lakh crore (in terms of tax, non-tax revenue and loan recoveries) from April to June. This is less than 7% of budget estimates for the full year. The Centre’s total expenditure for the quarter was Rs. 8.15 crore, almost 27% of budget estimates for the year, according to the report published by the Controller General of Accounts on Friday. The Centre has also transferred Rs. 1.34 lakh crore to States as their share of taxes, which is Rs. 14,588 crore lower than the previous year. “The 83% figure is not surprising because it is using a denominator that has already been exceeded,” said D.K. Srivastava, chief economist with Ernst and Young, and a member of the advisory council to the 15th Finance Commission. “The Centre has already announced plans for additional borrowing that amounts to about 5.7% of GDP, and then on top of that, some more stimulus spending may be undertaken in the latter part of the fiscal year. So I expect that the Centre’s fiscal deficit... might cross even 6.5%,” he added. D.K. Pant, chief economist at India Ratings, estimated a fiscal deficit of 7.6%, while Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of CARE Ratings, said it could go as high as 8% of GDP. “When economic activity has been stopped because of the pandemic and lockdown, government revenues are also going to come down,” said Dr. Sabnavis. “We have been noting the positive trade surplus, but when imports are down, customs revenue is also lower. And consumers have also cut down on discretionary spending,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fiscal-deficit-touches-83-of-full-year-target/article32245086.ece

In that one class, you will find people from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Because we are catering to the needs of Central government employees, they are posted anywhere. So which medium of instruction can we use? That is practically difficult for us. But the Policy also says ‘wherever possible’. We can teach as many languages as possible, but using them as the medium of instruction in KVs may not be possible for us.” A senior official at the CBSE reiterated this view. “Education is in the concurrent list. The CBSE is only an examination body. We have schools all over the country and in 25 foreign countries as well. The CBSE school in Tamil Nadu will have to follow the State government guidelines, based on the common Policy,” said the official. “Most of the CBSE schools are catering to the requirement of people in transferable jobs, so it will not be possible to teach in local languages. That is why the NEP says ‘wherever possible’.” The official added that in private unaided schools, parents’ choice with regard to medium of instruction would prevail. The Policy also promotes the learning of Sanskrit. “I think teaching Sanskrit to all our children is a wonderful idea. Sanskrit, after all, is the mother language for all our children,” said the official in charge of KVs. The KVs have been following the three language formula for the last 55 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kvs-unlikely-to-change-medium-of-instruction/article32245085.ece

Two personal security officials (PSOs) accompanied me. I tried again around 12.35 p.m. to see my daughter but the police did not allow me to go out,”Mr. Soz said. Stating that the police “produced and released a video showing that he [Mr Soz] was a free man”, “This version of the police is nothing more than a white lie,” the Congress leader said. “I confirm the fact that I am under house-arrest. The government version that I was a free man is wrong. I do not know why the government has resorted to such underhand means,” he added. However, J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal on Thursday again said Mr. Soz was not under arrest or detention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sajad-lone-released-from-detention-after-360-days/article32245195.ece

Taking note of an affidavit furnished by the Ministry, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “This only shows insensitivity to the vital constitutional obligation despite repeated directions. Repeated plea of merely having such proposals without effective enforcement on the ground can hardly be held to be satisfactory.” Following submissions made by the Ministry, that “meaningful steps” had been taken after the filing of the affidavit, the Bench said, “We cannot accept such a statement. If steps have been actually taken, we fail to understand why the same could not be produced at least during the hearing. We record our dissatisfaction at the attitude of the MoEF&CC on the subject.” The observations came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by Sandip Mittal seeking directions to devise effective monitoring mechanisms for compliance of conditions of environmental clearance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ngt-conveys-discontent-to-environment-ministry/article32245095.ece

He was accompanied by K. Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, Government of India. RML Hospital is one of the testing sites, which have started trials of four different kinds of technologies that have the potential to detect COVID-19 in as less as 30 seconds, noted a release issued by the Israel Embassy. It added that these non-invasive technologies include a voice test that uses artificial intelligence to identify changes in the patient’s voice, a breath analyser test that requires the patient to blow into a tube and detects the virus using terra-hertz waves, isothermal testing that enables identification of the virus in a saliva sample, and a test using polyamino acids that seeks to isolate proteins related to COVID-19. “These trials are being conducted on a large sample of patients in India. If the results validate the effectiveness of the tests, they will be mass manufactured in India and marketed to the world by Israel and India jointly,” said the release. “If even one of these tests is successful, it will be the biggest breakthrough in COVID-19 identification,” Mr. Malka said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trials-for-30-second-covid-19-tests-begin/article32245105.ece

Last month, Mr. Oli alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power.

Mr. Oli stoked another controversy this month by claiming that the “real” Ayodhya lies not in India but in Nepal. The spokesperson of Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) and member of the powerful Central Secretariat Narayankaji Shrestha described Mr. Oli’s statements as “undiplomatic”. “Prime Minister Oli has committed a blunder by making irritating remarks against India, at a time when there is a need for resolving the border issue through dialogue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/olis-remarks-against-india-undiplomatic/article32245129.ece

Mr. Fadnavis had sought a CBI inquiry into the death of the 34-year-old actor claiming ‘facts were not coming forward’ in the case. He had also demanded a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “The opposition can even bring Interpol or followers of Namaste Trump into the inquiry. Devendra Fadnavis should understand that it is the same police with whom he has worked with in the last five years. It is the same police that have given so many sacrifices during the fight with Corona. I would like to condemn those who are raising questions over the efficiency of the police,” said Mr. Thackeray. He said that the Mumbai police is not inefficient. “If anyone has any proof about the case they can bring it to us and we will interrogate and punish the guilty. However, please don’t use this case as an excuse to create frictions between the States of Maharashtra and Bihar. Anyone who is bringing politics in the case is really doing the most deplorable thing,” said Mr Thackeray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uddhav-criticises-fadnavis-for-distrusting-police/article32245527.ece

01 August 2020||JAIPUR,||Cong. shifts pro-Gehlot MLAs to Jaisalmer||Congress MLAs supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the ongoing political turmoil in Rajasthan were on Friday shifted from a hotel outside Jaipur to a luxury resort near Jaisalmer in chartered flights amid fresh allegations of horse-trading by the BJP. While 53 MLAs left in the first batch for the Thar desert town, 560 km from Jaipur, others left subsequently by chartered flights in the evening. AICC general secretary Avinash Pande and Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, who have been camping in Jaipur as central observers, joined a small group of MLAs. The Gehlot camp has been claiming the support of 102 MLAs, including the Independents, in the 200-member Assembly. The legislators are likely to stay in Jaisalmer until the Assembly session, summoned by Governor Kalraj Mishra after much persuasion by the government, begins on August 14. Mr. Gehlot told reporters at Jaipur’s Sanganer airport that the MLAs supporting him had started getting calls with “threats and inducements” soon after the date for commencement of the Assembly session was announced. “We decided to shift them to keep the external pressure away... They were being mentally harassed,” he said. Reiterating his charge that the BJP was hatching a conspiracy to topple his government after its similar action in several States, Mr. Gehlot said it was the primary duty of everyone to save democracy. “When the Home Ministry is after us, we have to make all efforts to save the government with people's support. Home Minister Amit Shah is in the forefront of bringing down the elected governments,” he said. The Chief Minister hoped that the Congress MLAs supporting the now sacked Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who were camping in BJP-ruled Haryana, would return to the party fold when the Assembly session begins.  BJP State president Satish Poonia targeted Mr. Gehlot for ferrying the MLAs to Jaisalmer. “Ahead of Jaisalmer is Pakistan. On the other side is Gujarat. How far will the government run to prevent a split in the [ruling] party? It will be better to give them utensils to drive the locusts away in the desert,” he said. Meanwhile, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Rajasthan police decided to move the High Court to obtain a voice sample of an alleged middleman arrested after audio tapes of his alleged conversations to topple the government were made public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-shifts-pro-gehlot-mlas-to-jaisalmer/article32245192.ece

01 August 2020||Bhopal,||No public events in M.P. for two weeks||Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra said on Friday that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had directed all public representatives to not hold public events until August 14, in view of several legislators and BJP leaders having contracted COVID-19. “If necessary, they can do it virtually. More than five persons can’t visit public representatives together,” Mr. Mishra told reporters here. On Thursday, he appealed to all political parties not to hold protests, public meetings or rallies. “Wearing a facemask or a towel is compulsory, whether it is a Minister, an MLA or an MP, otherwise they will be fined. This rule also applies to all officials,” said Mr. Mishra. Nine legislators in the State — eight from the BJP and one from the Congress — have contracted the disease. Mr. Chouhan, BJP State president and MP V.D. Sharma, BJP State general secretary (organisation) Suhas Bhagat and Minister Arvind Singh Bhadoria, who travelled together to Lucknow to pay their last respects to Governor Lalji Tandon, have tested positive.

The same is being witnessed in Madhya Pradesh. However, even today we have enough ventilators, oxygen cylinders and ICU beds.” In an attempt to dispel rumours regarding the extension of lockdown, he said: “It will be enforced wherever it is felt to be necessary.

01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Velachery to have underground cables||The sight of sagging power cables along the streets of Velachery will soon be history as they are going to be shifted under the ground. The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), which has given the go-ahead for a similar initiative in Adyar and the Information Technology corridor, has started the foundation work for executing the Rs. 300-crore project. Work has been taken up in the Tambaram and Perambur divisions. The project is to be executed using trench-less technology to minimise damage to roads. The technology was used for laying underground high-tension cables on arterial roads. A senior official of Tangedco, confirming the launch of the project, said prefabricated cement pillars for providing individual electricity connections had been fixed along with boxes containing power cables. To be extended The official said Thiruvanmiyur, major parts of Velachery West, Velachery East, and parts of Taramani would be covered under the project, which would be extended till Palavakkam. S. Kumararaja, a resident of Velachery, thanking Tangedco for the project, said although Velachery, Taramani and Thiruvanmiyur were brought under the city limits since 1979, these well-developed residential localities were left out when a similar project was taken up in the past. Citing several cases of electrocution in Velachery due to snapping of overhead cables, he said underground cables would enhance the safety of residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/velachery-to-have-underground-cables/article32245240.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BCGVL rolls out 4.5 lakh doses for universal immunisation||The BCG Vaccine Laboratory (BCGVL), Chennai, rolled out its first batch of 4.5 lakh doses for the universal immunisation programme of the Government of India, 12 years after its manufacturing licence was suspended because of non-compliance with the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). BCGVL plans to supply 170 lakh doses of the vaccine till March 2021. According to a press release, the lab, under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, was established in 1948 with assistance from Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark. The seed strain used at BCGVL was initially obtained from SSI through the World Health Organisation for production of BCG vaccine against childhood tuberculosis and supply for the immunisation programme. Because of non-compliance with the cGMP, its manufacturing licence, along with those of other public sector vaccine manufacturing units, was suspended in January 2008. The suspension was revoked by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in February 2010 on condition that the “laboratory shall ensure that the production is made fully compliant with GMP standards,” the release said. The construction of a new cGMP facility began in July 2012 and the facility was handed over to BCGVL in March 2016. The operating capacity of the facility is 600 lakh doses. Quality analysis The laboratory carried out trial production and vaccines were analysed for quality by the central drug testing laboratory of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The State Licensing Authority, the National Regulating Authority - CDSCO and experts from the Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli, conducted a joint inspection. After the production facility, production process, records and documents were scrutinised, the commercial licence for manufacture and sale was issued by the State Licensing Authority in October 2019. Three consecutive batches of commercial scale were completed, following which the samples were submitted to CDL, Kausali, in May 2020. CDL certified the batch to be of standard quality in July. Shanthi Gunasekaran, Deputy Drugs Controller of CDSCO (south zone), flagged off the first batch of vaccine. T.F. Hassan, director-in-charge, and B. Sekar, consultant, BCGVL, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bcgvl-rolls-out-45-lakh-doses-for-universal-immunisation/article32245242.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Co-morbidities contributed to 82% of COVID-19 deaths||What has been rather apparent right from the early days in a little-known disease is that persons with co-morbidities — hypertension, diabetes, cancer, cardiac ailments, chronic kidney disease, obesity and respiratory ailments — are at risk of contracting COVID-19. That uncontrolled levels sometimes also lead to poor outcomes, even death, has also been documented globally. In Tamil Nadu, a total of 81.8% of the deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among people with co-morbidities. Data from the Health Department on deaths in the State until July 29 reflect the fact that cause-wise, the same bunch of factors are leading to death. While diabetes and hypertension caused 33.36% of the 3,297 deaths (until July 29), diabetes alone caused 24.29% of the deaths, hypertension 12.59% of the deaths, and other co-morbidities accounted for 11.56%. Just over 18% of the deaths were in people who had no co-morbidities. A further age-wise distribution of these deaths indicates that age, 60-plus years, is a definite additive risk factor. 38.8% of the deaths occurred in senior citizens who had both diabetes and hypertension. That risk shrinks with a younger population, and other co-morbidities play a significant role. A further delineation of ‘other co-morbidities’ would help in arriving at a better understanding of the nature of risk of infection, and if positive, deterioration and death. “These figures pretty much reflect the global trend, with regard to COVID-19 and co-morbidities,” says V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre. There have been a few Type 1 diabetes deaths among the younger population, but there were other complicating co-morbidities in those cases, he adds. “Old age itself is a factor for sure. Anyone over 60 years must be careful not to expose themselves to transmission. Also, there is emerging evidence to show that a HbA1c (three month average of blood sugar) level of over 8.5 seems to lead to complications, and death. The lower the HbA1C is, the better the patient seems to be doing.” “Uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension is what is causing the problem. Doctors in the ICU struggle to help patients whose blood sugars or BP is way over the limit. Add obesity to this mix, and it becomes nearly lethal,” says Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. He says the advice to people with co-morbidities is to reduce risk, and keep their metabolic parameters well within control. “We are not out of sync with what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control lists for the co-morbidities. But there are variations, across populations, age, ethnicity and several other factors,” explains V. Ramasubramanian, senior infectious diseases consultant, Apollo Hospitals. He re-emphasises the need to ensure protection for the vulnerable population, and the implicit need to follow COVID etiquette to avoid infections. Dr. Mohan adds: “If, for some reason, not staying at home is not possible, then just make sure you wear a mask when you go out, avoid crowded places and maintain distance from others. This is how it works: If 80% of people wear masks, then 90% of the population is protected. If only 40% wear masks, no one is protected.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/co-morbidities-contributed-to-82-of-covid-19-deaths/article32245266.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Revised names for anglicised places likely in a fortnight’||A Government Order containing a list of revised names for cities and towns in Tamil Nadu with anglicised names is likely to be issued in a fortnight. In mid-June, the State withdrew a G.O. to change the anglicised names of 1,018 cities and towns after widespread criticism. Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Development ‘Ma Foi’ K. Pandiarajan told The Hindu that based on the feedback collected after the earlier G.O. was withdrawn, around 400 names of places that had inconsistencies had been identified to be standardised. Transliteration protocol “The team has finalised the transliteration protocol. We had to send the feedback on the names to all the groups in the districts.” “The protocol will fix the issues raised earlier such as the confusion over ‘Oor’ and ‘Ur’ in some names. Once the districts send the revised list, the new anglicised names should be ready,” he said. The initial list of anglicised names of places closer to their Tamil names came under criticism after the government accepted the names proposed by various teams across districts which were tasked with coming up with the anglicised names. Primary among them was the renaming of ‘Vellore’ to ‘Veeloor’ and ‘Coimbatore’ to ‘Koyampuththoor’, which a senior official in the Tamil Department attributed to using ‘Kuril’ (short vowels) and ‘Nedil’ (long vowels) for transliteration. The government now claims to have fixed the transliteration protocol to prevent any further inconsistencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revised-names-likely-in-a-fortnight-pandiarajan/article32245274.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restaurants, hotels may turn their backs on dine-in, continue with takeaways alone||Over 80% of restaurants and hotels across Chennai have decided not to open their dine-in facilities for a few days, but will continue takeaway services. Industry sources said frequent changes to decisions pertaining to the lockdown were hampering business in a big way, leading to huge losses. The managing director of a popular restaurant chain, which is over three decades old, said, “In June, when the government allowed dine-in with social distancing, we opened select outlets to gauge the response. Our sales went up by 15%. But we were all instructed within a few days to close dine-in and allow only takeaways. The workers who came back to duty were again kept idle, entailing an additional cost.” He added, “Some of the workers managed to go back to their homes, and for those who decided to stay back we had to provide accommodation/food and other facilities.” According to a government notification, restaurants and teashops shall be permitted to function with dine-in facilities, with 50% of the seating capacity, following the standard operating procedure, from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Takeaway services will be permitted in hotels and restaurants from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. K.T. Srinivasa Raja, managing director of Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets India Pvt. Ltd., said, “We will open only select outlets for dine-in immediately. We will see how the trial run works; based on the feedback, we will re-open other branches.” On the business side, Mr. Raja said takeaways were good, and apart from food delivery apps, people started coming out to take parcels back home. “In the first phase (starting Saturday), we will open 10 of our outlets for dine-in across Chennai in places including Ashok Nagar, T. Nagar and Nungambakkam. We will look at the response and start opening other outlets in phases,” said Sathish D. Nagasamy, Managing Director of Dindigul Thalappakatti. M. Ravi, president of the Chennai Hotels Association and chairman of Vasanta Bhavan Hotels India Pvt. Ltd, indicated that many hotels under his association would continue with takeaways and decide on resuming dine-in based on market sentiment. “We don’t want to run a risk. We would rather wait and watch,” he said, adding that only a few of his outlets (in location where sales would be good) would open up for dine-in. Many small hotels with a seating capacity of 15-20 people have decided not to run the risk of resuming dine-in and some are not even going to open their outlets. A small-time hotelier who runs a shop near Panagal Park said, “I pay one lakh in rent for this building. Apart from that, I have to pay salaries to my eleven workers, raw material costs, electricity and water charges.” He added, “In June, we opened our outlet and we hardly had any footfall owing to the lack of transport. In two days, I decided to close the shop instead of running it at a loss. I gave 50% salary to my workers and asked them to go home. Now I can’t even call them back as they need e-passes. I applied for it but got rejected, so my outlets [three] will stay closed,” he said. The managing director of a popular Italian restaurant in the city said his outlets would remain closed for dine-in. “My clientèle is totally different. My consumers will not have food at a place where there is no air-conditioning. So I have decided to continue focusing on takeaways through food delivery apps,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restaurants-hotels-may-turn-their-backs-on-dine-in-continue-with-takeaways-alone/article32245272.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police start libraries in Mamallapuram, Koovathur||In a move to keep teenagers occupied during their free time, the police have started two youth clubs with libraries — one in the Mamallapuram police station limits and the other in the Koovathur police station limits. There are over 500 books and sports goods, mostly donated by sponsors, in both libraries. The Mamallapuram sub-division police have tied up with an NGO to conduct quiz and sports competitions regularly to encourage children to read and participate in sports. “The initiative was taken by B. Shamoondeshwari, DIG, Kancheepuram police range. We have roped in two villagers to be caretakers of the library. We are taking steps to provide them salary,” said E. Sundaravathanan, ASP, Mamallapuram sub-division. Sixty children have enrolled in the Koovathur library and 40 in Mamallapuram. They borrow books from the library. “There were instances where teenagers were caught trying to smuggle rectified spirit and were forced to sell ganja to tourists. We want to provide proper guidance to them at a young age and want them befriend books and play some sport. This will prevent them from picking up bad habits. We will provide them career guidance,” he said.  V. Gnanam, former ward member, Koovathur, said it was a good move. “A library was built in the village a few years ago. But it was not used. The police utilised the library building and added books,” he said. Youth were taking books and returning them on time, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-start-libraries-in-mamallapuram-koovathur/article32245245.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC says only principal can forgive children who falsely accused him of sexual abuse||The Madras High Court on Thursday refused to direct a school principal to give a good conduct certificate to two siblings who had levelled a false charge of sexual abuse against him at the instigation of their parents. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh left it open to the principal to take a call on the issue if the students as well as their parents tender a genuine written apology to him. He only expected the principal to empathise with the students. While disposing of a writ petition filed by the mother of the children studying in Class XI and IX, the judge pointed out that it there appeared to be many problems between the principal and the parents of the two boys since 2016. Their father had even barged into the school in Coimbatore and created a ruckus. The children were also made to lodge a police complaint against the principal under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012. However, after investigation, the police found that it was a false complaint and therefore submitted a closure report before the court concerned. In order to put an end to the problem, the principal issued Transfer Certificates to both of them. It was thereafter, the mother had chosen to file the present writ petition to set aside the Transfer Certificate and let her children continue in the same school. However, later, her counsel said at least the remark ‘not satisfactory’ in the conduct column of the certificate should be deleted. Unwilling to pass such an order, the judge said that in normal circumstances he would have shown leniency towards young students and provide them an opportunity to mend their ways. However, the facts of the present case were completely different. The students had gone to the extent of lodging a false complaint and the news had been published in the media. It had very serious consequences and tarnished the image of the institution. The reputation of the principal too had taken a severe beating. “If such acts are condoned, it will destroy the morale of the school and set a bad precedent. Other students may get an impression that they can get away easily with any illegal act. This court does not want to show any misplaced sympathy,” Justice Venkatesh observed. However, referring to the saying ‘every saint has a past and every sinner a future,’ the judge left it open to the principal to take a call while bearing in mind that if this world had not condoned the sins of Valmiki, who was once a dacoit, it would not have been benefited of the epic Ramayana. “One of the greatest traits advocated by all religions is forgiveness. Forgiving a young child and providing him/her an opportunity to change themselves may even result in creating a great citizen for the future of this country,” the judge concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-says-only-principal-can-forgive-children-who-falsely-accused-him-of-sexual-abuse/article32245299.ece

The recording theatre originally belonged to film producer L.V. Prasad. Mr. Ilaiyaraaja said in 1977 that Mr. Prasad had given the entire block of the recording theatre to him as consideration for performing works for his projects. He also said Mr. Prasad had earmarked a specific area and a room exclusively and permitted him to possess, enjoy and utilise the premises.  Mr. Ilaiyaraaja said he had invested a significant amount of money in several high value equipment, musical instruments, handwritten musical notes and used the studio for more than two decades. Even after the death of Mr. Prasad, his son Ramesh Prasad, recognised the understanding and continued the arrangement without any issues. However later, his son Sai Prasad, after assuming control of Prasad Studios started to disturb his exclusive possession of the studio and attempted to dispossess him of it. A civil suit instituted by Mr Ilaiyaraaja against Mr. Sai Prasad and others is pending in a city Civil Court. The complaint was given by Mr. Ilaiyaraaja’s representative to Additional Commissioner of Police-South, R. Dhinakaran, who told The Hindu , “We have received the complaint. Police personnel from local station will inspect the spot and conduct preliminary enquiry on veracity of complaint. Later we will decide on further course of action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/llaiyaraaja-lodges-complaint-against-prasad-studio-owner/article32245277.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Vocational courses may distract poor students’||A section of activists and teachers have expressed concern over the importance given to vocational education in the National Education Policy 2020, arguing that it will end up sustaining and furthering the existing inequalities in access to education. The policy, which has a section titled ‘Reimagining vocational education’, calls for removing “hard separations” between academic and vocational streams. Stressing the need for changing the perception of vocational education as being inferior to mainstream education, the policy said students can be introduced to vocational subjects from as early as grade six, including opportunities for internship from grade six to grade 12. S.H. Thilagar, a faculty member of Anna University and State coordinator of the All India Save Education Committee, said this would lead to “vocationalisation” of education. “This will result in students from socio-economically backward backgrounds ending up taking predominantly vocational groups,” he said. P.B. Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary, State Platform for Common School System-Tamil Nadu, said introducing vocational education at an early age would become a barrier for many first-generation learners. M. Madhavan, a government school teacher and State president of Agricultural Graduate Teachers’ Association, said that while the intentions were honourable, it might have an adverse effect in practice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vocational-courses-may-distract-poor-students/article32245249.ece
01 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC sets aside conviction of ex-DMK MLA||Observing that legal requirements cannot be given a go-by in a criminal case merely because it had become sensational, the Madras High Court on Friday set aside the conviction and 10 years of rigorous imprisonment imposed by a trial court on former DMK MLA M. Rajkumar for the alleged rape and culpable homicide of a 15-year-old girl. Justice N. Sathish Kumar said: “Courts cannot record a finding merely based on imaginary possibilities in the evidence of the prosecution. Imaginary possibilities cannot take the place of acceptable legal evidence to prove the charges in a criminal case. Mere sympathetic consideration or suspicion can also never be a substitute for legal evidence.” The judge held that the police had neither proved the charge of criminal conspiracy nor rape or even that of culpable homicide against the appellant. He said that the prosecution had also miserably failed to prove the charge of conspiracy and cheating against the co-accused K. Jaishankar, and set aside his conviction too from both the charges. Clear evidence He pointed out that the parents of the victim had given very clear evidence before the trial court that they had brought their daughter voluntarily from their native in Kerala and left the child in the custody of the former MLA at Perambalur in Tamil Nadu on June 22, 2012 to serve as a domestic help and also get educated simultaneously. However, on June 28, 2012 the girl suffered from breathlessness and was treated in three different private hospitals before she died at the Government Medical College Hospital on August 5, 2012. Following this, her relatives created a commotion at the hospital, forcing the Perambalur police to register a case. Simultaneously, at the instance of some political functionaries in Kerala, the police in that State, too, registered a separate case. Though none of the doctors and paramedical staff of the three private hospitals found any evidence of sexual assault on the child despite a gynaecologist, in one of those hospitals, having done even a vaginal swab test, a government doctor, who conducted the post-mortem in Theni, opined that the death could have been due to vaginal injuries. On the contrary, when the body was subjected to re-postmortem by doctors in Kerala, they opined that the victim appeared to have died due to pneumonia. However, after the CB-CID took over the case from the Perambalur police, the FIR booked in Kerala was transferred here. Finally, the police filed a chargesheet against the former MLA. The trial was transferred from a Mahila Court in Perambalur to a Special Court for hearing cases against MPs and MLAs in Chennai in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ex-dmk-mla-s-conviction-set-aside/article32245278.ece

Kandasamy, who won the Sahitya Akademi award for his novelVisaranai Commission— the death of an innocent bus conductor in police custody — died here on Friday. He was 81 and is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons. His documentary film on terracotta art —Kaaval Theivangal— won the first prize at the Angino Film Festival, Nicosia, Cyprus. In the literary world, his name became inseparable from his novel Chayavanam , depicting socio-economic transformation through the destruction of a thick forest area for the construction of a sugar factory. In Tamil Saivite bhakti literature Chayavanam , a village near Poompuhar, is referred to as Chaikkadu.  “I read a report submitted by socialist leader Ashok Metha about the entry of sugarcane as a cash crop into India. My uncle, an enterprising man, had gone to Burma and I imagined what he would do if he returned to my village. Though I wanted to write 1,000 pages using sugarcane as a symbol of transformation in a village, I wrote 15 pages per day for 20 days,” Kandasamy had said in an interview to Prof. R. Rajagoplan, which is part of the book Kandasamyin Padaippulagam . Born in Mayiladuthurai, Kandasamy was exposed to literature of the Communist and Dravidian movements at a very young age. Kandasamy steered clear of “isms” in his writing and reiterated that it was for the critics to discover the “isms” in the works of a writer. His writings were shorn of adornments and he attributed the style to his deep learning of Sangam literature. Mr. Rajagopalan said the cultural history of the people on the fringes of urban and rural settings was emphasised in the writings of Kandasamy. Kandasamy also directed documentaries on famous personalities in literature and art, including those of S. Dhanapal, sculptor-painter, and Tamil writers Jayakanthan and Ashokamitran. He also shot a documentary on Prapanchan. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam condoled the eminent writer’s death. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M.K. Stalin, PMK founder S. Ramadoss, CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan, Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) chief G.K. Vasan, L.

01 August 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Textile exporters waiting for govt. to release incentive funds||With export incentives getting delayed under various schemes, textile and clothing exporters say they are unable to tap opportunities in the international markets, and revival is taking time. According to industry sources here, the Central government offered incentives under two major schemes last year — the Rebate of State Levies (ROSL) Scheme and the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). In mid-2019, the government replaced ROSL and MEIS with the Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) Scheme. It also offered an ad hoc, one-time special incentive of 1% till December. With sluggishness in textile and clothing exports and yarn and fabric exports not covered under the new scheme, exporters sought the continuation of MEIS and ROSCTL. The government allocated Rs. 9,000 crore for ROSCTL. However, reportedly owing to inadequate funds, the portal does not accept applications under the ROSCTL Scheme since April this year, say sources. Recently, the government introduced a new scheme called, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RODTEP). This is supposed to be a comprehensive scheme for exporters. But rates are yet to be fixed. Currently, the industry gets only the duty drawback benefit. It should allocate adequate funds for ROSCTL or launch RODTEP at the earliest, says Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association. The industry has been facing several hardships. Without the export incentives, revival takes time and the exporters are unable to tap into the opportunities, he adds. Ashwin Chandran, Chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association, says the export benefits should be extended to yarn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/textile-exporters-waiting-for-govt-to-release-incentive-funds/article32245259.ece

Sources in the Forest Department said that they began treatment for the tusker on Thursday after it was found lying on the ground at Sundapatti section of Nellithurai reserve forest. Estimated to be around 11 years old, the veterinarians found wounds on its palate caused probably due to a fight with another male elephant. Preliminary investigations revealed that the wounds were inflicted nearly 10 days prior to the elephant's death, which led to its starvation. A team administered 32 bottles of glucose to the elephant. As they returned to the spot to resume the treatment at around 6 a.m. on Friday, the elephant was found to be dead, sources said. This is the 16th elephant to have died in Coimbatore Forest Division in the past seven months.

01 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Ganesha idols wait for non-existent customers||Vinayaka Chathurthi is just three weeks away but there are no takers for Ganesha idols. Doll makers say they have borrowed heavily for making idols for Vinayaka Chathurthi - one of the big festivals which fetches them decent earnings. With the extension of COVID-19 induced lockdown till August 31, they are apprehensive over sale of Ganesha idols. Meena Kumari belongs to 10 artisan families that reside on 120 Feet Road connecting Mattuthavani with Surveyor Colony. These doll makers, who are natives of Rajasthan, have settled down in Madurai. She says they received orders for making nine-feet-high Ganesha idols for chathurthi processions in January but the orders were cancelled in March in the wake of the pandemic. “We borrowed heavily from money lenders to make the idols. But with no takers for them, we do not know how to repay them,” she says. Varadha Ram, another artisan, says they have had no income for the past five months. “During the initial days of lockdown, volunteers gave us rice, oil and other essential goods. But now our family members are on the brink of starvation,” he says. M. Alagarsamy is a doll maker from Vilachery on the southern fringes of Madruai. This village is home to 200 families of artisans. He says their total earnings for the year comes from three main festivals - Vinayaka Chathurthi, Navarathri and Christmas. “The income that we earn between August and November helps us to see through the rest of the year,” he says. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the artisans in Vilachery have not made big Ganesha idols this year. They have made idols measuring up to 1.5 feet in height for customers who buy idols for their homes. “Usually, retailers from nearby districts such as Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Dindigul buy idols from August. We even get orders from Bengaluru and Mumbai. But, due to restrictions in movement and difficulty in procuring e-pass, we have not received orders till date,” he says. M. Ramalingam, another artisan, says they are now anxious whether they would sell the idols at all. “Our only hope is, at least street vendors should be permitted to sell our idols during the extended lockdown period,” he says wistfully.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ganesha-idols-wait-for-non-existent-customers/article32245551.ece

01 August 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Dip in patients receiving cancer treatment at GRH||There has been a drop in the number of inpatients and outpatients availing cancer care at Government Rajaji Hospital. Associate Professor of Medical Oncology J. Jebasingh says around 60% of the patients who regularly visited the hospital for chemotherapy still find a way to come to the hospital. However, there has been an overall drop in the number of outpatients. “Many patients who have completed their cancer therapy but under medication to prevent recurrence have not come to the hospital due to fear of COVID-19,” he says. Most of the cancer patients are referrals from other departments of the hospital. So the drop in number of new patients to the hospital itself has resulted in reduction in number of cases referred to the oncology department. Before COVID-19 lockdown, 50 to 60 patients used to come for chemotherapy every day. Now it has come down to 20 to 30 cases. Dr. Jebasingh says the State government has been providing free pick-up and drop facilities for those needing chemotherapy which is being utilised well by patients. Dean J. Sangumani attributed the drop in number of patients coming to the hospital to the absence of public transport as a vast majority of the patients used city buses. However, all emergency surgeries were attended to immediately. The hospital continues to treat patients from different districts of south Tamil Nadu as it serves as a tertiary care hospital with excellent infrastructure. Once elective surgeries resume, more patients will arrive, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dip-in-patients-receiving-cancer-treatment-at-grh/article32245549.ece
01 August 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Declare Palk Bay stretch as a Dugong Conservation Reserve’||Pointing out to the decline in the population of dugong, a nature lover from Madurai has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday seeking a direction to the Centre and State government to declare a 400sq.kmstretch from Adirampattinam in Thanjavur district and Ammapattinam in Pudukkottai district on the Palk Bay as a Dugong Conservation Reserve. The petitioner, K. Pushpavanam from Madurai, a law student, said according to data available on the website of Wildlife Institute of India, there were only 200 dugongs in Indian waters. Proper conservation was the only way to save them from extinction. They formed an integral part of the marine ecosystem, he said. India was a signatory to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had constituted a ‘Task Force for Conservation of Dugongs.’ However, despite the conservation measures, it was unfortunate that dugongs and the their habitat were under threat. Human activities leading to destruction or modification of habitat, pollution, rampant illegal fishing activities, vessel hits, hunting and unstructured tourism activities were posing a threat to the dugongs. In 2019, the Wildlife Institute of India sent a proposal to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department to declare the 400sq.kmstretch of Palk Bay as a Conservation Reserve for Dugongs. This proposal must be accepted and the stretch from Adirampattinam to Ammapattinam should be declared a Dugong Conservation Reserve, he said. Taking up the public interest litigation petition for hearing, a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam suo motu impleaded the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change as respondent and ordered notice to the Centre and the State. The case was adjourned for further hearing to August 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/declare-palk-bay-stretch-as-a-dugong-conservation-reserve/article32245562.ece
01 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MADITSSIA flays extension of lockdown||The Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA) has raised objections to the extension of the lockdown by another month. Association president B. Muruganandam in a press release issued here on Thursday said that since March-end all industrial activity has been shut. This had ruined not just the industries, but all stakeholders including the workforce. The announcement by the government on the extension of the lockdown, without consulting the stakeholders, had come as a rude shock. At a time, when the Central government had given some guidelines for relaxation of the lockdown, the Tamil Nadu government’s order appeared to be totally contrary, he said. The economy was shattered and the revenue of MSME’s was affected. Without allowing public transport to function, MSMEs which were already in doldrums, cannot keep their units open. “How will workers come from home to the factories? Only those who have access to private vehicles will be able to commute. It will be an uphill task for many daily wage earners to come to work,” he said. The e-pass system should be dropped as it was detrimental to the industry. Common man, who had genuine issues to travel from one point to another had difficulties in getting e-pass, while those with influence and in power, travelled without any difficulty. Thus, the purpose of issuance of e-pass was defeated. Hence, the government should follow the guidelines of the Centre, which had scrapped e-pass for intra-State and inter-State, Mr. Muruganandam pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/maditssia-flays-extension-of-lockdown/article32245546.ece

Rajaguru, president of Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation - an association of amateur archeologists. Mr. Rajaguru said that the sandstone pillar measuring 6.5 feet in height and 1.5 feet in width was found at a grove in Eranthurai. The stone had inscriptions on both the sides. On one side, Tamil inscriptions were found. The other side, which was highly damaged, had some Arabic letters. He said that there were 20 lines in the Tamil inscription and many words were damaged. “But, a word ‘Nayakathu’ was found in the inscription. It indicates that a land has been donated to Erwadi Dargah, which has the grave of Hazrat Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badhusha Oliyullah. The dargah is present around one kilometre from the grove where the stone inscription was found,” he said. The inscription has measurement units of the donated land in a written format. He said that the inscription also had names of two members who owned ‘kotthu thengu’ (coconut groves). ‘Thengu’ refers to coconut and the word is currently in usage in Kerala and Srilanka to indicate coconut. So, ‘kotthu thengu’ means coconut groves. This shows that coconut groves were present in this region for many centuries,” he added. A 600-year-old Baobab tree was found 300 metres from the place where the inscription was found. The local residents consider the tree as a deity, he said. “This tree species is native to countries like Madagascar, Australia and Africa.

Addressing the members of the Jamath in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts through videoconferencing on Thursday, B. Abdul Rahman, State Vice-President of the organisation, claimed that the EIA notification carries certain modifications which would directly impact the agricultural operations in the delta districts though the State government had declared the Delta as a protected agriculture zone. The natural wealth of the region and as well as in the country would get ruined by the corporate companies as the draft notification exempt the public hearing process before issuing environment clearance certificate for the projects intended to be taken up in the areas where natural wealth exist in abundance, he claimed. Stating that drafting a notification paving way for plundering of natural wealth while the other countries were struggling to safeguard their natural wealth was absurd, the TNTJ urged the Union government to withdraw the current notification in order to save the natural wealth. The TNTJ members who participated in the video conference from Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts displayed placards demanding the withdrawal of the draft notification. Meanwhile, the Coordination Committee of All Farmers Associations in Tamil Nadu has called upon the Union government not to dilute the existing EIA notification apprehending that certain modifications proposed in the 2020 draft notification would have a direct impact on the agriculture operations, particularly in the delta region. Expressing similar view, P.S.Masilamani, State Deputy Secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said that the modifications and exemptions included in the draft notification would only result in the destruction of natural wealth on a large scale in the name of industrialisation and infrastructure development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/implementation-of-eia-notification-will-hit-agricultural-operations/article32245583.ece

The first person to test positive at the St. Anthony’s Home for the Aged was a woman who was taken to the Kattur Primary Healthcare Centre after she slipped and fell in the bathroom, said Sister Arul Anthony, in-charge at the home. She was asked to get tested for COVID-19 at the PHC. “After reports showed positive for the woman on Tuesday, samples were lifted from all 108 inmates,” she said. On Wednesday, six people from the home tested positive and on Thursday 16 people tested positive for the viral infection. The 23 senior citizens include women as old as 98, Sr. Anthony said. “The management is taken aback by the number of cases emerging from our home. We do not know how they tested positive as not a single individual has stepped out of our home in the last three months,” she said. The home had no visitors and even the cook was asked to stay on campus so as to not risk infecting the inmates, Sr. Anthony said. “To avoid the spread among homes and orphanages, we have ordered immediate testing across all the homes within city limits,” S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner, said. There are nine such homes registered with the civic body and samples were lifted for all of them on Friday, a senior health official said. “There are a few smaller orphanages with less than 10 inmates too.

01 August 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Acute labour shortage delays UGD phase-III work in Tiruchi||Acute labour shortage has delayed the start of phase-III of underground drainage (UGD) scheme in the city. Larson and Toubro (L&T) Ltd, which had bagged the project sanctioned at an estimate of Rs. 336 crore under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, had committed to begin the construction of the UGD work as early as possible. Considering the forthcoming north east monsoon, which is expected to begin in the third week of October, the Tiruchi Corporation asked the company to make use of July, August and September months so as to make a good beginning. However, more than a month after the company was given work order, it is yet to launch the construction work. It is learnt that the prevailing labour shortage has delayed the start. The mass exodus of migrant workers to their natives after the nation wide lockdown imposed to check the spread of COVID 19 is said to be a main factor in the delay in launching the project. “There are issues in mobilising labourers. Ever since the migrant workers returned to their home towns, we have been encountering the issue of labour shortage. Hopefully, the issue will be solved soon,” a senior official of the Tiruchi Corporation told The Hindu . However, the official added that the company had been making arrangements to bring in workers from Chennai. It was expected that they would come in a few weeks. Upon arrival they would be tested for COVID 19. The company had been mobilising materials and construction equipment to launch the construction work. The project is aimed at providing UGD connections to 32,000 households in the areas left-out in phase II and phase III of the underground sewer projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/acute-labour-shortage-delays-ugd-phase-iii-work-in-tiruchi/article32245593.ece
01 August 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Traffic awareness school set up||The Ariyalur district police have established a Traffic Awareness School at Kairalabad where the old Kairalabad police station was functioning a few years ago. Recurring instances of accidents necessitated the need to create more awareness among public of road rule adherence and safe driving so that it was decided to establish it. The old police station was given a facelift for housing it. Within the traffic awareness school premises a model road, model traffic roundabout, model signal and model speed breaker have been created. Inside the building, flex boards on traffic cautionary signs, information signs and regulatory signs have been kept on display for public viewing. Sign boards on traffic-related dos and don’ts while driving have been installed besides photographs displaying violations often committed by vehicle users, including cell phone driving and triple riding. The school would be manned by a team of four police personnel who would be drawn from the traffic wing to create public awareness. The plan was to bring school and college students to the traffic school periodically and drive home road rule adherence and traffic-related safety messages. As Ariyalur district has a chain of cement factories, the police would bring lorry drivers of these factories to the school and drive home the importance of safe driving by adhering to traffic rules. The Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tiruchi Range Z. Annie Vijaya inaugurated the school on Thursday in the presence of the Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, V. R. Srinivasan, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ariyalur K. Jayakumar and senior police officers participated.

01 August 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||App launched to help people donate to zoos, adopt animals||The COVID-19-induced lockdown has hit zoos in the State very hard, Deputy Conservator of Forests Ashok Patil said in Belagavi on Friday. The nine zoos in the State had seen 65 lakh visitors last year. But this year only five lakh persons visited them till now. Even revenue of the Zoo Authority of Karnataka has suffered greatly. Last year, it earned Rs. 70 crore. “But this year, it has fallen drastically,” he said. Zoos are independent bodies that are to be run locally. The State government does not provide running expenses. All the costs of feeding animals and managing personnel costs have to be met through ticket sales. But with falling revenues, it has become difficult to maintain staff and take care of the animals, providing them feed and fodder, Mr. Patil said. Similarly, the Kittur Rani Channamma Mini Zoo in Belagavi has also suffered during the lockdown. It is being upgraded with a higher count of carnivorous and herbivorous animals. A tiger safari will be set up near the zoo. “Almost 70 % work has been completed and work is pending as we are hit by funds crunch,” he added. “There is no government grants for this work and we need donations from the public,” he said. To come out of this difficult situation, the government has chosen to seek citizens cooperation. The Zoo Authority of Karnataka and the government want to encourage citizen engagement in an aggressive manner. “To engage people in our efforts to save zoos, we have launched a mobile application. The scion of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and Forest Minister Anand Singh have launched this app,” he said. The app will enable people to donate to zoos or adopt animals. Any amount above Rs. 50 can be donated. Every one can download this and donate to the government. “Mr. Anand Singh has instructed us to involve citizens in the management of zoos during this time of crisis,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/app-launched-to-help-people-donate-to-zoos-adopt-animals/article32245381.ece
01 August 2020||BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 hospital for doctors, their families||Worried about their health and that of their family members, after people of the fraternity who got COVID-19 infection were unable to get treatment in hospitals during emergency, a group of doctors of Bagalkot district have set up their own COVID-19 hospital without depending on the government. Some 200 doctors of the district have joined hands to establish the centre where only doctors and their family members would be treated at a subsidised rate. “After holding deliberations with the other doctors of the district, we decided to have an exclusive hospital,” said Sujay Heranjal, one the members and treasurer of the association formed for the purpose. Claiming that it is the first of its kind initiative taken by doctors in the State, he said that the idea was kindled after several doctors of the district got infected and had to face hardship in getting admission to hospitals. ‘Difficult to get beds’ “We have been now witnessing sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in the district, because of which there is a huge burden on the government hospital to provide beds. A couple of doctors of the district who got infected did not find beds in the government hospital. They were later forced to travel to other districts such as Gadag and Hubballi for treatment,” Dr. Heranjal said.  Dr. Heranjal said they collected Rs. 20,000 from each doctor who wished to become member of the group. “We found a private hospital which has 40 beds, of which 35 have been reserved for doctors and their family members,” he said. ‘No special facility’ Dr. Hernajal said that so far, the government has not given any special facility for doctors for treatment if they get infected. “In our own hospitals, since nursing staff are reluctant to serve, we are paying them higher salary and got them insured also to retain them in the hospital for continuing the service,” he added.  The idea was kindled after several doctors of the district got infected and had to face hardship in getting admission to hospital.

The Belagavi Bar Association had invited him to speak at its meeting in the district court in 1939. Dr Ambedkar stayed at her home for nearly a week when he attended a court case in Chikkodi and met some friends in Belagavi. He also spoke at the Bar Association. “Dr. Ambedkar’s words inspired the family to send Siddavva Metri to school. She studied up to seventh standard and dropped out after marriage at the age of 17,” recalls Malleshi Chougule, her nephew and Dalit Sangharsh Samiti leader. Siddavva Metri’s husband, who was two years older than her, died of a disease. The couple had no children.  She was buried at the Sadashiva Nagar facility.

01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||K.R., Kalasipalyam markets to remain closed till August 31||Traders in Sri Krishna Rajendra or KR Market as it’s popularly called and Kalasipalya market are up in arms against the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which announced on Friday that they will remain closed till the end of August. Both markets have been sealed since March 24, barring a 12-day period in June where traders were allowed to operate before they were asked to shut shop again. Shop owners were getting ready to open for business as the BBMP, in an earlier order, had announced that the markets seal would be in effect till July 31. In a tweet, Mayor M. Goutham Kumar said the move was taken in the interest of public health. Traders remain unconvinced and accuse the civic body of duplicity as most parts of the central business district, especially Chickpete, S.P. Road, Avenue Road, have been allowed to open for business. R.V. Gopi, president of the Kalasipalyam Vegetable Wholesale Market, said they had submitted a memorandum to both the mayor and BBMP commissioner, urging them to allow the wholesale market to function at night. “We have been allotted some space in Singena Agrahara but it has only temporary sheds and lacks basic amenities,” he said. Traders of K.R. Market too are upset with the move. G.M. Divakar, president of the KR Market Flower Merchants’ Association, told The Hindu that with the extension of the closure, they have been denied the opportunity to recover some of their losses during the festival season. “We had hoped the BBMP would allow us to open the market for Varamahalakshmi. Now, we can’t operate business till the end of August. As per the Hindu calendar, September is an inauspicious month,” he said. Both Mr. Gopi and Mr. Divakar said the move would greatly affect the livelihood of small traders. “Under Unlock 2.0, restrictions on several economic activities have been lifted. Why are only our markets being targeted?” they said, and argued for allowing the markets to function. “We are ready to follow all the standard operating procedures (SOP) and other guidelines. There is no logic in allowing business in all areas around the markets and keeping the two main markets closed,” said Mr. Gopi.

01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||At least 300 hospitals contest dept.’s claim that they are ‘temporarily closed’||While the health authorities have listed 982 clinics, nursing homes, and hospitals in Bengaluru as “temporarily closed” during the pandemic, at least 300 of them have contested it and said they are functioning as usual. Some of the clinic owners told The Hindu that they were running their establishments after taking necessary precautions and are baffled as to why they figure in the list published by the Bengaluru Urban District Health Officer (DHO). G.A. Srinivas, DHO, Bengaluru Urban, said of the 6,979 registered clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes in Bengaluru, as many as 1,595 establishments were “permanently closed” in the last two to three years. In addition, they have published a list of 982 establishments that are “temporary closed” during the pandemic. Mr. Srinivas, however, acknowledged that they had received representations from about 300 of these establishments stating they were open. “The Bescom and BWSSB authorities were vested with the responsibility of conducting a survey of the establishments that were closed. The authorities may have visited at a time when they were closed. Many of the owners have submitted a representation that they are open and sought removal of their names from the list,” he said. An office-bearer of the  Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association said they had brought to the notice of the department that many of these establishments were classified as closed even though they had been sending daily reports of patients details who had influenza-like illnesses, severe acute respiratory Infection or were suspected to have COVID-19. However, many private clinics and nursing homes in the city are closed down owing to multiple reasons. Some of them are facing shortage of staff. In many instances, doctors running clinics have decided to remain closed during the pandemic as they do not want to risk getting infected. Risk and financial factors “If I open my clinic, I will get patients who have fever, cough, cold, and other COVID-19 symptoms. I cannot afford the necessary infrastructure such as PPEs or face shields, so I have decided to do teleconsultation for my regular patients. If they have COVID-19-like symptoms, I tell them to visit the fever clinic close to their home,” said a general practitioner whose clinic is located in north Bengaluru. Establishments closed include dental, skin and eye clinics, maternity homes as well as standalone private clinics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/at-least-300-hospitals-contest-depts-claim-that-they-are-temporarily-closed/article32245213.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students heave a sigh of relief||The Common Entrance Test (CET) concluded on Friday much to the relief of students hoping to get a college seat for professional courses in engineering, agriculture and other streams. Of the 1,94,419 students who registered for CET this year, around 1,75,428 (90.23%) attempted the physics paper and around 1,75,337 (90.19%) sat for the chemistry paper on Friday. Last year, 92.27% had attempted physics and 90.88% had written the chemistry paper. Sixty-three students who had tested positive for COVID-19 attempted both papers across the State. ‘Model exam’ Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the examination was conducted smoothly with the cooperation of various departments. “By conducting the exam without any untoward incident, we have created a model,” he said, adding that the counselling would be held online. The CET helpline, which was set up to address grievances of students, received 200 calls on Thursday, the first day of exam. “All queries were sorted, and 10 to 15 callers had asked for change in exam centres, which was processed immediately,” he said.  Many students, while happy to have completed CET, are now focusing on NEET and JEE Main entrance tests. A few, however, have decided to give them a miss. Sumanth K. Gowda said that based on his CET rankings, he would decide either to do B.Sc in Agriculture or law. “I am relieved after CET. I am not attempting NEET or JEE,” he said. Another student, who did not want to be named, said she had to resume her preparations for JEE Main. “I will have to prepare hard for JEE. With CET complete, I can concentrate on JEE Main, which is scheduled for the first week of September,” the student said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article32245228.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||A low key Bakrid this year||Gatherings with families and friends and the distribution of meat and food from ‘qurbani’, mass prayers and the Haj pilgrimage are some of the important highlights of Bakrid. However, this year, festivities on Saturday will be low-key on account of pandemic-related restrictions and the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the city. Human rights activist Tanveer Ahmed said that due to the restrictions, Muslims were unable to go on Haj this year. “Many go for Haj at this time as this is the month for it. This important part of the festival is completely missing this time,” he said. Mohammed Idrees Choudhary, who sells dates and dry fruits, said that while business did pick up, it was not as high as in previous years or what they were hoping. “The charm of Bakrid is also about livestock trade which was dull this year due to restrictions and reduced purchasing capacity. Livestock trade hubs like Mekhri Circle, Chamarajpet and Varthur did not witness as much business as usual,” he said. Muslim leaders have also been appealing to people to have less ostentatious celebrations. Moulana Maqsood Imran, the imam of Jamia Masjid at K.R. Market, said they have advised people to help the needy as much as possible. “As per instructions by the Government of Karnataka, there will not be mass public prayers. We have advised children below 10 and those above 60 not to visit mosques,” he said. Most families have decided to pray at home. “Collective prayers and sharing the qurbani among family, friends and the poor will also take a hit. We shall pray and celebrate within our homes,” said Tanzeem Pasha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-low-key-bakrid-this-year/article32245199.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||E-pujas: Start-ups catering to NRIs look to domestic market||Despite restrictions on public gatherings at temples, the pandemic did little to dampen Varamahalakshmi festival celebrations on Friday with many families taking the festivities online. Markets that were open recorded brisk business on Thursday and Friday with a huge demand for flowers and puja items. Significantly, a lot of celebrations and pujas seem to have moved to the digital space. Several start-ups that offer online purohit and puja assistance catering to an NRI customer base earlier are tapping into the domestic market. The coming festival season is a big litmus test, firms say. Nischay Chaturvedi, co-founder and CEO of city-based SmartPuja, said they are offering e-puja services wherein a priest will conduct the puja at their location and simultaneously guide customers to perform it at their homes remotely. Customers are given a checklist of items required for the puja in advance. “We have performed marriages and house-warming ceremonies through Zoom calls in the domestic market during the lockdown. Customers are now more open to this mode of assistance. We had several bookings for Varamahalakshmi and have already started receiving bookings for Gauri-Ganesha, which is big for the sector,” he said. Public celebrations and pujas are also moving online. Krishna Janmashtami at ISKCON, Bengaluru, is a key event in the city’s calendar that usually sees several thousands congregate at the temple. This year, however, ISKCON will livestream the puja and other cultural programmes for two days on August 11 and 12 on all social media handles. Devotees will not be allowed to physically participate at the temple. The largest pandal, Bengaluru Ganesha Utsav, celebrating its 58th year, has decided to take the 11-day music festival online. “We are putting up a studio from where over 700 artistes will perform, and it will be livestreamed digitally,” said Nandish Mariyappa, Managing Trustee, Bengaluru Ganesha Utsav. During the lockdown, they had launched daily music on their social media handles. “We ran it for 45 days and garnered over three million views. Enthused by that response , we have decided to take the celebrations online. We will install a Ganesha idol at an indoor space and livestream the pooja as well,” he added. Other pandals in the city are also mulling the digital streaming route given that the BBMP has banned public installation of idols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/e-pujas-start-ups-catering-to-nris-look-to-domestic-market/article32245204.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kateel revamps team; BSY loyalists moved to new posts||Nearly a year after he was appointed president of the State unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nalin Kumar Kateel on Friday revamped the entire party organisation and announced a new set of office-bearers. Several of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s loyalists have lost prominence in the new set-up. Significantly, his son B.Y. Vijayendra, who was secretary of the party’s youth wing and a prominent aspirant to become a general secretary of the State unit, has been pushed to become a vice-president — a post largely considered ceremonial in the organisation, otherwise led by general secretaries. “The new faces are mostly from the RSS stable and are considered close to B.L. Santhosh, the national general secretary (organisation) of the BJP,” a senior leader said, adding that a new team was imperative under a new party chief and this revamp had long been in the offing and was, in fact, delayed. Mr. Yediyurappa’s close aides Shobha Karandlaje and Arvind Limbavali, who were powerful general secretaries, have also been appointed vice-presidents. MP for Mysuru Pratap Simha has been replaced as president of the youth wing by Sandeep from Bengaluru. Mr. Simha has been rehabilitated as a vice-president. While N. Ravikumar and Mahesh Tenginakayi have been retained as general secretaries, former MLCs Ashwath Narayan from the city and Siddaraju from Mysuru are the new appointees, replacing Ms. Karandlaje and Mr. Limbavali. Eeranna Kadadi and Ashok Gasti, recently nominated to the Rajya Sabha against the recommendations of the State core committee led by Mr. Yediyurappa, have been drafted into the organisation as presidents of the Farmers’ Morcha and the OBC Morcha, respectively. Capt. Ganesh Karnik has been appointed as State party spokesman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kateel-revamps-team-bsy-loyalists-moved-to-new-posts/article32245218.ece

However, there will be no cultural programmes or the annual parade this year, said BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Friday. The government has decided not to have helicopters showering flowers. The flag will be hoisted by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at 9 a.m. at Manekshaw Parade Grounds. Two hundred invitees will be allowed to participate in the programme, including COVID-19 warriors, officials and elected representatives. This was to ensure adequate social distancing. Special kiosks will be set up at the parade grounds and Rapid Antigen Tests will be administered to all guests, along with thermal scanning, checking of blood oxygen levels through pulse-oximeters, etc. All invitees have been asked to wear masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-i-day-parade-this-year/article32245207.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cases filed against four Bengaluru hospitals||After temporarily closing down 19 hospitals for not handing over 50% of beds under the government quota, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has filed cases against four major hospitals in the city. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told reporters here on Friday that cases had been booked under sections of the Disaster Management Act against St. Martha’s Hospital, Rangadore Memorial Hospital, Shifaa Hospital, and Fortis Hospital.  The civic body had recently issued show-cause notices to 291 private hospitals in the city after finding that many had failed to hand over beds. The hospitals were required to provide details of bed availability. “After the show-cause notices were issued, many hospitals have come forward and handed over the beds under the government quota,” he said and added that private hospitals could also have an internal arrangement among themselves for the bed quota. “For instance, if five hospitals put together have a total of 200 beds, they may hand over one hospital with 100 beds under government quota. We will take into account such arrangements as well,” he said. Told to refund Meanwhile, the BBMP on Friday inspected Vikaram Hospital and found that they were charging Rs. 5,500 for CB-NAAT test. As many as 44 patients were charged more than what is prescribed by the ICMR and the government of Karnataka. The BBMP thendirected the hospital to refund the excess amount charged and the hospital management agreed. The hospital, in a statement, said they were willing to incur loss and conduct CB-NAAT test at RT-PCR rates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cases-filed-against-four-bengaluru-hospitals/article32245209.ece
01 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC declines plea against testing centre in residential locality||The High Court of Karnataka has declined to entertain a PIL petition against a private diagnostic centre, situated in a predominantly residential locality in the city, which has commenced collecting swab samples for COVID-19 tests. “The counsel appearing for the petitioners is unable to point out any statutory provision which imposes embargo on setting up a laboratory in the residential locality to collect swab samples for testing COVID-19. In the absence of any such statutory provision, we cannot direct the State government to cancel the permission, if any, granted to the diagnostic centre,” the court observed. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order on the petition filed by S. Gangappa and another, residents of Manasanagar, near Nagarbhavi circle. The petitioners had sought direction for cancellation of permission granted to Mediclu Diagnostics and Speciality Centre, Kendra Upadyayara Sangha Layout, near Nagarbhavi circle. On the allegation of the petitioners that the laboratory is not taking precaution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as people are standing in queue for giving swab sample, the Bench said the petitioners can always approach the health and civic authorities on this grievance for taking appropriate steps. “Merely because there is a queue of people outside the laboratory of the fourth respondent, we fail to understand how it poses a danger to the residents of the locality.

His father, Srinivasa Murthy, toldThe Hindu, “We do not have a TV set at home. It is a conscious decision not to have it at home. How can my son follow the classes on TV and do homework?” Mr. Murthy said the government was insisting that everyone purchase a TV and mobile phone. “I am opposed to this very idea. People who can afford to buy it will do so. But what about those struggling to earn two meals a day?” He maintained that online classes would be helpful for students of higher classes, but not primary or high school students. “I am teaching my children agriculture. I grow pepper, coffee, and areca.

01 August 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Network troubles haunt rural students||Students living in villages amid thick forests and hilly areas are worried about their studies this year as online classes are particular hard to access for them. A majority cannot afford smartphones and data, and even those who can afford the gadget do not get Internet access easily. Sometimes, getting a normal phone is difficult in the hilly areas of Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, and Shivamogga districts. The State government has given clearance to schools to hold online classes for students from 45 minutes to two hours daily, with sufficient breaks between the sessions. Many private schools, located in urban localities, have begun classes. Using mobile-based applications, teachers are conducting classes, and sometimes pre-recorded classes are also shared. Srilakshmi, guest faculty at the Government First Grade College at Kalasa in Mudigere taluk, was asked to conduct online classes for her students. Among the 53 students in her class, barely 15 could manage to log in. “There were days when I taught only one student online. It does not work out in rural areas,” she said. Private telecom service providers rarely have network in rural areas. BSNL provides high-speed broadband connections to gram panchayats and other offices in rural areas. However, for online classes, high-speed data is essential. “Forget in rural areas, there are many issues within urban localities. A speed of about 25 Mbps is necessary for streaming high-definition video. Many in the city and on the outskirts are not getting it,” said a person working with a telecom service provider who didn’t wish to be named. Meeting on connectivity Elected representatives also have taken note of this problem. MLA for Sorab Kumar Bangarappa said many villages in his constituency hardly get access to the Internet. “I recently held a meeting with officers and service providers on this issue. They have agreed to put up towers to strengthen services. However, it is difficult to provide access in forest areas and hilly terrains. I hope we come out of this pandemic situation soon,” he told The Hindu . MP for Shivamogga B.Y. Raghavendra also held a meeting with mobile network operators earlier this week. He asked the operators to improve their services. In Shivamogga district, there are 241 BSNL towers while 37 belong to private operators. “The operators have to install towers in areas not covered so far. The district administration will resolve issues, if any, related to availability of space to put up towers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/network-troubles-haunt-rural-students/article32245217.ece

Rajendra. Addressing presspersons here on Friday, he said that the district administration is working on its technical aspects to make status available through any online platform, including a mobile app. The initiative is to ensure transparency. Replying to questions on some hospitals refusing to admit non-COVID-19 patients citing lack of availability of beds, the Deputy Commissioner, who is a medical doctor, said that some confusions can be addressed if people come to know about the status of availability of beds. Dr. Rajendra said that the district administration will either strengthen the existing helpline to address grievances related to COVID-19 test results and bills related to treatment cost, especially in private hospitals, or will have a dedicated grievance redressing system in place. Asked about variations in COVID-19 test results, such as positive cases turning negative and vice versa in a matter of one or two days, he said that in such cases, factors relating to viral load and sample collection methods also mattered. “There could be some stray cases. It cannot be generalised. If there are any specific instances, they can be looked into,” he said. Dr. Rajendra said that the services of senior and aged doctors will be used to train members of COVID-19 task forces in ward and gram panchayat levels. Such doctors will provide them online training in identifying symptoms among people, health surveillance, monitoring health of patients and under which circumstances patients need to be shifted to hospitals. Training will commence in the first week of August. The Deputy Commissioner said that the district has so far reported 142 COVID-19 deaths. Of these, 29 patients are from outside Dakshina Kannada. Of the deceased, a majority of patients had had co-morbidities. Hence, the district administration will shift its focus to health survey and surveillance for the early identification of infection for taking quick remedial measures and treatment. “Now, we will chase the virus,” he said and added that some teachers, aged up to 40, will be deployed for a related survey. Dr. Rajendra said that attempts will be made to convince senior doctors, who have closed their clinics in rural areas, of the need to re-open them by taking adequate precautions. The daily target of COVID-19 sample tests has been now increased to 2,400 samples using rapid antigen test kits and 800 through RT-PCR method, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospital-bed-availability-to-be-made-available-in-public-domain/article32245389.ece

The varsity, established 10 years ago, has taken this initiative at a time when COVID-19 has forced suspension of all classes and potential new students may be wary of enrolling for tutelage under a teacher till the fear of the pandemic subsides. Acting Vice-Chancellor Nagesh Bettakote said they would roll out a six-month certificate and six-month diploma in Bharatanatyam, Hindustani and Carnatic instrumental for beginners and the details would be on the varsity website, https://www.musicuniversity.ac.in, in due course. Syllabus online He told The Hindu that the syllabus and learning modules would be uploaded online and students could download and learn from the confines of their homes. “There will be contact classes and online interaction with varsity resource persons,” Dr. Bettakote added. Former varsity Registrar Niranjana Vanalli said the move would help the varsity spread its footprint to draw more students for their offline classes and courses.

The court, in July first week, had directed the government to measure the distance to a church on M.G. Road and the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) on Kasturba Road. It was found, in the survey, that the distance between the entrance of the liquor boutique to the church is 144 metres and to the office of the DCP is 126.5 metres. The provisions of the Karnataka Excise Licences (General Conditions) Rules, 1967, prescribe that no liquor shop be allowed within a distance of 100 metres from educational institutions, religious places, hospitals, and government offices. The survey was ordered after A.V. Amaranathan filed a PIL alleging that licence was granted in violation of the Excise Rules, and disputed the government’s contention that the distance is more than 100 metres. A division bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice M.I.

The 23-km-long reach would be completed at a cost of Rs. 54.67 crore, said K.P. Vinod Kumar, executive engineer, PWD (Roads). The construction work had come to halt for the past two months due to the COVID-19 lockdown, but the work progressed rapidly when construction resumed, he said. The 127.80-km Hilly Highway passing through the district would be completed in four stretches. The 12-metre-wide highway would have a 7-metre carriageway and a 1-metre-wide walkway on both sides. In addition, bridges, culverts, and dividers were being constructed at the required places, Mr. Kumar said. The Hilly Highway which would begin from Nandarapadavu in the north of the district, would connect to Cherupuzha, which borders Kannur district. It passes from Nandarappada to Sungathakatte, Pivalige, Chevar, Angadimogar, Idiyadukka, Badiyadukka, Mulleria, Padiyathadukka, Athanadi, Edapparamba, Pandi, Pallanchi, Sankarambadi, Bandadka, Manadukkam, Kolichal, Pathinettam Mile, Chully, Vallikkadavu, and Chittarikkal to reach Cherupuzha. Funding for the project was provided through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. Mr. Kumar said that the 49.63-km-long Chevar-Edapparambu Reach, the longest stretch in the district, had received financial approval. The process for technical approval of the project costing Rs. 83.85 crore was in progress.

The promise remains unkept and residents continue to watch helplessly as their homes and belongings are regularly submerged. “On July 31, 2018, the Chief Minister laid the foundation stone for a housing project at Mundamveli. The colony, which has been around for about 50 years, attracts some attention during the rains, but after that it is forgotten,” said Rajesh G., an autorickshaw driver who lives in the area. Procedural delays The housing project, to be implemented by the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) on about 70 cents in Rameswaram village, Mundamveli, is caught up in procedural delays. A total of 85 families from the area were to be rehabilitated in two four-storey housing blocks. “The detailed project report was prepared and administrative sanction obtained when the company that participated in the process went bankrupt and closed, delaying the process entirely. Another firm that could take up the prefabricated method of construction had to be found. It has now been taken up by the Thrissur District Labour Contract Cooperative Society and technical sanction is expected next week. We hope to begin construction by Aug 15,” said V. Salim, GCDA Chairman. With a prefabricated structure, the project should be complete within seven months, he said. Of the Rs. 15 crore that the project is expected to cost, Rs. 9.54 crore will be contributed from LIFE Mission funds. For the rest, the GCDA would have to find sponsors or CSR funds, Mr. Salim said. “This is the only division in the Kochi Corporation that has not been declared Open Defecation Free,” said Poornima Narayan, councillor representing Gandhinagar. “Pipes carrying sewage open into the Perandoor canal and when the high tide sets in, the water carries all the waste back into the houses. The only way to resolve the issue is rehabilitation,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/housing-project-for-flood-hit-pt-colony-residents-hangs-fire/article32245487.ece
01 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||An all-purpose decontamination device from Maker Village||As the initial wave of COVID-19 hit the world, a start-up at Maker Village in Kalamassery came across a United Nations (UN) communication inviting tech-driven innovations to fight the pandemic. For Devaditek Innovations, which was into developing tech solutions for the Navy and the shipping industry, that turned out to be a triggering point to give a spin to a solution they already had evolved for their core area. Thus was born Lumos, an Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Technology-based decontamination device that can be used to sanitise a variety of objects, including vegetables, N-95 masks, mobile phones, parcels, newspapers, toys and the like. “In collaboration with The Master Plan initiative of the UN, we have already sent a batch of the products to Maldives, Ecuador, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Haiti. We have now received orders from abroad and India. Since then we have manufactured 50 more units at our facility at Maker Village while another 200 are under production,” said Sumith Mohan, CEO of the start-up. It took them about a month to convert the idea into a prototype with the help of fab lab at the Maker Village. They developed four different prototypes before settling for the current design compatible with multiple trays to hold articles to sanitise. Unlike the conventional method of spraying disinfectant, UVGI uses UV light to inactivate pathogens, which does not leave behind chemical residues, eliminating the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. “The device could be effectively used to check the breakout of infections among healthcare professionals deployed in isolation wards in COVID care centres by constantly sanitising their personal belongings using it. “The high-power lamps coupled with ozone functionality ensure 100% disinfection,” said Manoj Menon, COO of the start-up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-all-purpose-decontamination-device-from-maker-village/article32245494.ece

Ubio Biotechnology Systems Private Limited, operating out of Kinfra Park at Kalamassery, has started manufacturing the kit, which is basically a strip with three separate lines C, 1 & 2; C denoting control line and two test lines 1 and 2 denoting Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) respectively. For any test to be considered valid, the C line should always appear, failing which the device should be considered faulty. “This test is most effective when conducted 10 days post-infection, as it takes almost eight to 10 days for antibodies to develop in case of COVID-19. Hence, the accuracy of the test, which is just 20-30% before 10 days jumps to 96% after that. Conversely, the ability of rapid antigen tests to detect positive cases decline after 10-12 days post infection, as the viral load decreases,” said Bishor Ibrahim, CEO of the company. The kit, which costs around Rs. 700 a piece, is already in use in hospitals and laboratories in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-firm-develops-rapid-antibody-kit-for-covid-test/article32245485.ece
01 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Measures stepped up to ease traffic, reduce accidents in city||The city traffic police has stepped up efforts to seal unscientific U-turns and introduced many other measures to streamline traffic flow and to lessen number of accidents, on the basis of a study done at accident-prone spots. “We sealed or modified 31unscientific U-turns and other accident-prone road infrastructure during the past year. Three of them were done on the arterial S.A. Road during the past few days. Removal of these traffic bottlenecks has considerably eased traffic movement,” said Francis Shelby, Asst. Commissioner of Police (ACP) of City Traffic Police-East. Two highly-accident-prone U-turns — in front of Toc H School Road and a smaller one beneath Kochi Metro’s Elamkulam station — were sealed using steel barricades, while one facing the old market in Kadavanthra was temporarily sealed using traffic cones. These turns were totally unnecessary, since U-turns were there less than 100 m from them on either side, he said. The police also installed over two km of steel barricades on Civil Line Road, mainly at Palarivattom and Vazhakkala, to prevent wanton crossings by motorists and pedestrians. “Moreover, rule enforcement was toughened to segregate traffic moving in different lines, in order to usher in adherence to lane discipline, especially during peak hours. All such measures were possible due to coordinated efforts spearheaded by City Police Commissioner Vijay Sakhare and DCP (Traffic, Law and Order) G. Poonkuzhali. The officers also inspected many such sites and issued directions on how to surmount traffic bottlenecks,” Mr. Shelby said. On their part, traffic police personnel readied booklets that detailed issues at different accident-prone spots. Remedial measures followed. The police are also pursuing with PWD, Kochi Corporation, and NHAI issues like narrow bell-mouth at junctions which prevent free-left turns. “We also found that sealing right turn at a few junctions, following which vehicles wanting to cross them took U-turn further ahead considerably helped speed up traffic at the junctions,” police sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/measures-stepped-up-to-ease-traffic-reduce-accidents-in-city/article32245490.ece

A recent meeting of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) had decided to issue a stop-memo for the project, which was illegally set up in the Coastal Regulation Zone area of West Kochi. The GCDA had approached the KCZMA last year seeking regularisation of the project, which was launched with much fanfare during the term of the previous regime led by Congress leader N. Venugopal as its chairman. However, the Authority had declined CRZ clearance for the project that was set up over an area of 4.5 acres. ‘No mandate’ V. Salim, GCDA chairman, said the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau had launched an investigation into the project, which had incurred a loss of around Rs. 5 crore for the authority. “Since the vigilance probe is on, the GCDA will approach the government to speed up the investigation and punish those who have caused financial loss to the agency,” he said. No statutory clearance was obtained from any agencies concerned before launching the project, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/expedite-probe-into-cage-fishing-project-gcda/article32245492.ece

The programme, to be offered in economics, history and political science, is designed to engage nationally and internationally renowned scholars for teaching and mentoring. The number of seats for each of the programme, slated to begin from October this year, is fixed at 30. Other disciplines too According to Sabu Thomas, Vice Chancellor, the programme will be a delicately balanced intersection of various broader social science disciplines including anthropology, public policy, and governance within the framework of multidisciplinary studies. “There is a massive outflow of students to universities outside Kerala for undergraduate studies in social sciences. This is partly because of the lack of institutions of national or regional standing here. The IMPSS would cater to this increasing demand for centres of higher learning in social sciences in the State,” said Mr. Thomas. Lateral entry of students The students who exit the programme at the end of three years will be awarded BA certificate while those completing the full term will be given the integrated degree specifying the major at the undergraduate level and the specialisation at the postgraduate level. It also stipulates lateral entry of students having bachelor degrees in the allied fields for the master’s programme directly, Mr. Thomas said. “This programme will have academic linkages with institutions inside and outside India. The scope of collaboration includes exchange of scholars and students, joint research projects, mutual funding for academic events, and sharing of materials and rare resources,” added Mr. Thomas. Eligibility Admission is open to candidates from all the streams with at least 60% marks at the Plus Two level, the Vice Chancellor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/integrated-pg-in-social-sciences-in-mgu-soon/article32245510.ece

01 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||State to ensure environmental flow of rivers||The Kerala State Department of Water Resources is planning to carry out a scientific study to facilitate environmental flow of water in the 41 rivers in the State. The Chief Engineer of Irrigation and Administration and the Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB) have been tasked with submitting an action plan at the earliest in this regard.  The government order dated July 7, 2020, cites that there are hydrological and holistic methods of ensuring E-flow and that a hydrological data base is required to do so. This necessitates a study. The decision comes in the wake of a memorandum submitted to the Minister for Water Resources by T.V. Rajan from Kozhikode in his capacity as Kerala Nadi Samrakshana Samithi general secretary in November 2019. In the memorandum, he had pointed out that despite an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2017 to ensure environmental flow (E-flow) of rivers across the country, no action was taken by the State government in this regard. Centre’s claim E-flow is a term that defines the quantity, timing, and quality of water that should flow through a river to maintain the ecosystems dependent on it. Several organisations had petitioned the NGT a few years ago to ensure E-flow of all rivers in the country during all seasons. During the hearing, the representatives of the Union government had claimed that all rivers in the country had 15-20% water flow even in summer and hence there was no need to make an effort to ensure it. The NGT had entrusted the State pollution control boards to make sure it was so. However, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, answering a recent RTI petition, passed the baton over to the Irrigation Department, which in turn confessed that no scientific study to this effect had been carried out in the State to far. Depends on rain “The rivers in Kerala, unlike those in north India, heavily depend on the rainfall for its water flow. Due to our peculiar topography, the rainwater flows into the sea very fast. Hence, the flow is very low during summer, especially in those with dams across them,” Mr. Rajan said, citing that the people in the low lands did not get enough water during the summer months as most of the rivers turn dry. As a result, people lose touch with the rivers.  “Opening one or two shutters of the dams during summer will ensure that there is a constant flow of water in the rivers,” Mr. Rajan noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-ensure-environmental-flow-of-rivers/article32245509.ece
01 August 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Buffalo rearing offers greener pastures for Gulf returnees||Every time Najeeb Kurikandi flew back to work in Abu Dhabi after his annual vacation, he left behind a dream that he cherished since childhood. Now the 35-year-old is slowly realising his dream to set up a mixed farming project at his home town at Meppayur, 40 km from Kozhikode city. The COVID-19-induced lockdown has helped him start out with rearing male buffalo calves. “The travel restrictions that came into force from March held me back. So I decided this was the chance to pursue my passion and purchased six buffalo calves three months ago and began rearing them,” Mr. Najeeb, a driver in the UAE for the past 13 years, said. For Gulf returnees who are dealing with job losses, livestock farming is seen as an opportunity to earn a livelihood back home. Others, such as Rafeek and Chandran who face the threat of losing their jobs in the Gulf, have turned to this vocation. Returnees are betting on buffalo farming for many reasons, including climate adaptability and minimal expense involved. “Male buffalo calves are reared exclusively for meat. The calves can be easily fed with green fodder. No big infrastructure is required except a shed. And they are mostly disease-free,” said Aji Manathara, a returnee from Saudi Arabia. Rearing male buffalo calves can boost the income of farmers. A six-month-old buffalo calf weighs around 100 kg and the price is calculated at Rs. 110 per kg. These are sold after the calf grows to 400 kg-500 kg in two years. “A buffalo is sold either to local butchers or slaughterhouses at between Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 50,000,” he said. Help at hand The Wayanad-based Brahmagiri Development Society, a State-aided cooperative, is helping new farmers procure male calves from Andhra Pradesh. K. Abhinand, a livestock inspector with the society, said about 600 people had bought male buffalo calves this year. “And 60% of them are expatriates. We have supplied 2,000 male calves in Kozhikode, Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kannur over the last few months. We also get enquiries from Kottayam and Palakkad,” he said. The calves are supplied after vaccinations and deworming. “To eliminate exploitation by middlemen, we are guaranteeing a buyback of the animals at a reasonable rate for our frozen meat market functioning under the Malabar Meat brand,” Mr. Abhinand said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/buffalo-rearing-offers-greener-pastures-for-gulf-returnees/article32245496.ece

In one such raid on Wednesday, the squad from the Nadapuram Excise preventive unit seized around 550 litres of wash and 15 litres of arrack. According to the squads, searches are now conducted simultaneously in various spots to track the illegal business. Though the preventive units have managed to seize large quantities of wash and arrack in their recent series of raids, those behind the illegal activity are still at large, they said. The support of local informers too will be sought to identify villagers engaged in the business. Excise sources said details of a few suspects had been gathered. Though some tribal hamlets have been under the scanner following suspicious attempts to sell hooch, officials confirmed that there had been no major incident to prove their involvement in the trade. Since the announcement of the national lockdown, the squads have been keen on suppressing hooch dens and illegal sales. More than 21,000 litres of wash have been seized by the squad from various locations. According to Excise officials, the search will be intensified with the support of nine squads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-steps-up-raids-at-hooch-dens/article32245472.ece

Revenue officials in charge of COVID-19 prevention activities are also coordinating village-level disaster management following rough weather alert. Meanwhile, there is no plan to open relief camps considering the risks involved in managing them by maintaining the COVID-19 protocol. Local bodies have been asked to consider other viable options for temporary relocation of needy families. At the same time, vigil has been tightened in Kavilumpara and Koorachundu panchayats where minor incidents of landslips were reported. Officials of the Kavilumpara grama panchayat said efforts were on to assess the loss suffered by farmers in the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flood-hit-families-relocated-to-safer-places/article32245476.ece

Dr. Lajish V.L., head of the department of computer science, University of Calicut, said on Friday that the research method relied on identifying emotionally oriented words in a news article and adding the emotion label beside them, before using detection mechanisms. Artificial Intelligence “We started our work by understanding the holistic approach of this research. We used different types of advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms,” he said. K. Anoop, a researcher, said the commercial and political phenomenon of empathically optimised automated fake news was on near-horizon. “The simplicity of the emotion-enrichment method we propose makes it applicable for usage within a diversity of fake news detection tools,” said Dr. Deepak Padmanabhan, faculty member of the computer science department at Queen’s University. The department of computer science, University of Calicut, has set up a web portal — https://dcs.uoc.ac.in/cida/break-the-fake — for collecting fake news in both English and Malayalam from the public for experimentation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mechanism-to-detect-fake-news-on-health/article32245473.ece

01 August 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||MCI inspection of Konni MCH may be delayed||Whether the Government Medical College Hospital coming up in Konni will offer MBBS course this year will depend on the schedule of its mandatory inspection by the Medical Council of India (MCI). Vice Chancellor of Kerala University of Health Sciences Mohanan Kunnummal told The Hindu that the MCI was yet to give a date for the inspection. Considering the pandemic crisis and mobility issues, the inspection was unlikely in the coming months, he said. Once it receives the MCI approval, the State’s 33rd medical college coming up at Perinjottackal in Konni is likely to be the first such facility to be launched in the post-COVID-19 times. It will be the 543rd medical college in India. The government is preparing to open the outpatient (OP) wing of the medical college hospital in Konni in two weeks against the backdrop of the urgent requirement of healthcare facilities in the district. Initially, 15 doctors and 60 other staff would be deployed at the OP wing, sources said. The hospital will cater to the healthcare needs of around 25 lakh people in Pathanamthitta, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Idukki districts and the residents of Shencottah in Tamil Nadu, according to P.G.R. Pillai who was the special officer of the project. Dr. Pillai, known for his expertise in building up the State’s public health infrastructure has set up nine medical college hospitals in the State. MCI norm As per MCI guidelines, a 300-bed hospital should first start functioning at a medical college hospital before an MBBS course for 50 students can be launched there. HLL Infratech Services Ltd. was the architect and consultant for the medical college complex. Bengaluru-based Nagarjuna Construction Company had undertaken the construction work. Widening of the road linking Perinjottackal with the taluk headquarters of Konni to facilitate four-lane traffic is progressing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mci-inspection-of-konni-mch-may-be-delayed/article32245531.ece

Only 70 cases were reported on Thursday, and the comparatively lower number was attributed to glitches on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. Several unreported cases were carried over to the official statistics of Friday. Of the new cases, 311 persons were infected from other patients, indicating high local transmission. Eight health workers are among the infected. While 114 patients recovered, the number of active cases in the district stood at 3,078. Six nuns, two staff Thirty-five persons in Shanti Bhavan, an old-age home run by the Missionaries of Charity, at Kochuthura here have tested positive. The patients include 27 residents who are senior citizens with co-morbidities, six nuns, and two employees. They tested positive in antigen tests conducted at the facility. All have been shifted to the General Hospital. Six police officers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the district. These include four officers in the Kilimanoor police station. They seem to have contracted the infection from an accused in a chain-snatching case who was arrested on July 17. He tested positive on July 27. All other police personnel in the station, including the Circle Inspector, have gone into quarantine. The CI of the Pallikkal police station has been given additional charge of the Kilimanoor station. Two officers attached to the Special Armed Police camp in Peroorkada, the gunman of Deputy Speaker V. Sasi and a sub-inspector from Kattakada, are the others to be infected. The SI’s wife and a child have also tested positive. Both officers have been residing in the SAP camp. At Sree Chitra institute A doctor and a patient in the cardiology wing of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology too have tested positive. The Thumba cluster appears to grow with 14 new cases being reported in the region. The number of patients have grown to 126, most being workers in the KINFRA International Apparel Park. Cases have also begun to emerge in Kunnukuzhy where a woman tested positive two days ago. Sixteen residents here tested positive when the Corporation subjected 50 people to tests. Minister in quarantine Forest Minister K. Raju has gone into self-quarantine at his official residence here, a day after a person who had taken part in a function he had attended at Kulathupuzha, tested positive. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran’s son has tested positive for the infection. The Minister and his family have been in quarantine since a worker in his official residence tested positive on July 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cases-soar-in-capital-district/article32245533.ece
01 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||NEP implementation will be key: experts||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has some innovative ideas for school education but their implementation will prove to be a challenge to the government, say experts. Educationist R.V.G. Menon says the policy mentions phrases such as inclusiveness, equity, and creative and critical thinking, but the question is how these will be put into effect. The crucial content is raising spending on education to 6% of the GDP, as envisaged decades ago. Only if the Union and State governments are committed to it, can many of the reforms be implemented. Changes in structure Structural changes have been brought in, but there is no rationalisation for why Class 1 and 2 have been clubbed with preschool to make the foundation stage or Classes 9 to 12 clubbed into one block, he says. There are practical issues to vocational education, especially in Kerala where parents are not keen on their wards choosing the vocational sector. Any change will require a social change and campaigning, besides recognition for those in the vocational sector. Such aspects are not mentioned in the policy, says Mr. Menon. Amruth G. Kumar, head, School of Education, Central University of Kerala, says the introduction of the 5+3+3+4 school structure is the biggest change, especially universalisation of early childhood education. Making schooling mandatory from the age of three will result in children losing their childhood. Till now, parents had a choice to send them to preschool or not. Though preschool has been made mandatory, no formal schooling will begin at this age. Mr. Kumar says pre-primary or anganwadi teachers are not equipped to achieve outcomes envisioned by the policy. Developing a trained force will take at least a decade. There will be a question mark over implementing the idea of pre-primary education as a foundational stage during that period. Areas of concern Highlighting areas of concern, Mr. Kumar says the idea of setting up school complexes for use of resources and effective governance, while simple, will prove to be a headache in the context of different school managements and sharing of teachers. Semester system at all stages of schooling and allowing students the choice to select subjects and take examinations will affect interdisciplinarity of courses, and run contrary to the idea of promoting interdisciplinarity at all levels of education. There will be the question of deciding what content will be taught – will the present syllabus be divided into semesters or offer branches of a subject in each. This could result in too many choices for students but little knowledge, he warns. The financial burden of education will be passed on to the common man under the policy. The welfare notion of education will be abandoned, and it will become an individual responsibility. This will have a long-lasting impact. M. Shajerkhan, State unit secretary of the All India Save Education Committee, says besides issues of centralisation and commercialisation, the new policy does not talk of education as a concept. It emphasises developing skills for the global market. Restructuring of courses was aimed only at that. There is little talk of teaching in it; most of the focus is on learning. Without formal pedagogy till middle stage, the foundations of education will suffer. The play-based, activity-based model at that stage will affect the teaching-learning process. Focus on vocational skills in Class 6 without ensuring foundation for academics will not do any good, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nep-implementation-will-be-key-experts/article32245504.ece

The youth, a native of Kanyakumari, reportedly jumped quarantine and boarded the D-3 coach of the train at the Kozhikode railway station. A thermal screening was done on him at the platform. When the train reached Thrissur, the District Medical Officer, Kozhikode, informed Railways and Health authorities in Thrissur that the person had jumped quarantine and had been tested positive.  Stopped at Ernakulam Following this, the train was stopped at Ernakulam North and the person was offloaded and shifted to a room in the station by Railway Protection Force personnel. Later, the health authorities shifted him to the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, (at Kalamassery) in an ambulance. The youth, a contract worker at Kunnamangalam, told the authorities that he was travelling to the capital as his wife was hospitalised for delivery. The swabs were taken for test in Kozhikode after he complained of uneasiness. Twenty other passengers on the D-3 coach were shifted to D-4 coach at Ernakulam North and those on D-4 to the adjacent D-5 coach. The D-3 coach was sealed and the train was allowed to proceed. The health authorities asked the 20 co-passengers to go in quarantine, sources said. The coach was disinfected when it reached Thiruvananthapuram Central at 2 p.m. The train later left for Kannur at 3.15 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youth-offloaded-from-train-after-he-tests-positive/article32245500.ece

Non-KASP patients, however, would have to bear the expenses at rates fixed by the private hospitals from their own pocket, a public notice put out by the department on Friday, seeking to clear the confusion over COVID-19 treatment, indicated. “Under the KASP, the government will bear all expenses of COVID treatment of eligible beneficiaries,” the department said. Patients with influenza-like illnesses (fever, dry cough, diarrhoea, loss of smell, and breathlessness) who wanted treatment in government hospitals should approach the nearest government-run COVID hospital, it said. “If non-KASP patients want to go to private hospitals, they may do so by contacting the respective private hospitals and bear the expenses as per the rates of the hospitals. If non-KASP patients have COVID Kavach/COVID Raksha health-care coverage, they may avail themselves of the health services from the empanelled hospitals of the respective insurance providers,” it said. The district-level health administration, with the assistance of doctors’ associations, carried out capacity building in private sector hospitals. Patients could avail themselves of healthcare services — whether related to COVID-19 or not — in both government and private hospitals. The government had not placed restrictions on the private hospitals regarding provision of COVID-19 treatment. Approved private laboratories were also authorised to perform COVID-19 tests at the rates fixed by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-fund-treatment-of-kasp-patients/article32245505.ece
01 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CPI(M) not to stake claim for RS seat||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPIM)] is unlikely to stake claim for the Rajya Sabha seat that has fallen vacant following the death of socialist veteran M.P. Veerendrakumar. Left Democratic Front (LDF) sources told The Hindu that the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) would decide its nominee and will formally be cleared and announced at the front’s State committee meeting within a fortnight. The election would be held on August 24. Rumours were rife that the CPI(M) would stake claim for the seat, but the sources sought to brush it aside as a conscious attempt to create chinks in the front. Front partners do not have the convention of appropriating a seat allocated to an ally through consensus, the sources said.  When the Pala and Kuttanad Assembly seats fell vacant following the death of Kerala Congress(M) leader K.M. Mani and Nationalist Congress Party leader Thomas Chandy, there were reports that the CPI(M) would wrest the seats. But all such rumours were proved to be baseless. NCP candidate contested from Pala while the party still holds claim for the Kuttanad seat. No deviation The front would not deviate from the convention and an LJD candidate would contest the Rajya Sabha seat too. The LJD leadership is expected to have discussions on its candidate with the CPI(M) leadership soon. Neither the CPI(M) nor the LDF would resort to any step that would rock the boat offering an undue advantage to the UDF and the BJP ahead of the local body and Assembly elections that are to be held in succession. The Rajya Sabha election would not offer any space for the Opposition to gain an advantage over the government and the LDF, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-not-to-stake-claim-for-rs-seat/article32245511.ece

He was presiding over a District Disaster Management Authority meeting at the collectorate on Friday. He said as many as 30 wards in the Corporation area and 248 wards in the grama panchayats are now containment zones, where there are severe restrictions on the opening of shops and vehicular movement. Though these restrictions are required considering the increase in the number of cases, these restrictions are preventing people from the containment zones to earn their living or travel outside for work, he said. Practical issues Mr.Madhu said that the lockdown which has now extended for weeks has made daily life difficult for many. In this scenario, relaxations considering these practical issues, while still maintaining all vigilance, should be provided. He said the restrictions in containment zones where new cases are not being reported should be removed. District Collector Navjot Khosa will take a decision on this after detailed discussions. The meeting decided to increase the number of COVID first-line treatment centres in the district, as well as the number of tests being conducted daily. Testing facilities are now available at most of the major hospitals in the district. New test centres will be opened at the Government Taluk Hospital at Vithura, and the Community Health Centres at Palode and Kilimanoor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/more-relaxations-in-curbs-sought/article32245535.ece

01 August 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||GGH feels the strain as cases pile up||The Government General Hospital, the largest and one of the oldest teaching hospitals in the State, and also the State COVID Hospital, is reeling under the heavy load of patients, and evidently has been in the news for all wrong reasons for over two months. The shocking images of bodies abandoned by their families lying at the mortuary, the mysterious case of a man who was admitted and went missing, and finally, his body being traced at mortuary and an episode where a nurse had allegedly deferred the administration of vaccine to an infant, have put the GGH in a poor light. Of the 1,267 beds, 568 beds are dedicated to COVID patients in the old block. The block appeared to be fairly handling cases till the end of lockdown, but the spike in the number of cases during the unlock phase has put it under enormous strain. The GGH and NRI Hospital and Katuri Hospital, also State COVID Hospitals, are handling the majority of the patients. The hospitals together have about 2,000 beds. Guntur district has reported over 13,000 cases so far. GGH Superintendent K. Sudhakar told The Hindu that there is a severe shortage of doctors. “It’s about 30 % and doctors can be on put duty only for a week at a stretch. The Class IV employees are under tremendous pressure and a GO making SSC the minimum qualification for applicants is further hampering our efforts,’’ he added.  Multiple issues The problem begins with the testing of samples being done on the first floor of the super-speciality block. With a single registration counter and a swab collection point, testing is delayed by hours. The staff are under enormous pressure. A single triage centre is hardly sufficient to handle the enormous load and the lack of testing facilities meant that most people had to come to the GGH. There are 10 beds allotted for the triage centre and since most of the patients report with respiratory problem, they are immediately placed under oxygen support. “We need more doctors and paramedical staff in these emergency times. There are lot of medical graduates who have emerged from the portals of medical colleges in Russia and China and the government can enlist their services for some time,’’ said a senior medical professional.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ggh-feels-the-strain-as-cases-pile-up/article32245629.ece

Ravi, a daily wage earner, and his wife have taken the decision due to poverty. The police, who swung into action following information, counselled both and ensured return of the infant to the biological parents. Roopa gave birth to a girl child 13 days ago and the couple already have two girls. Unable to bring up the third female baby, Ravi and Roopa decided to give up the infant for adoption and contacted their relative, who is also a labourer, according to Krishna district Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu. A couple -- S. Venkateswarlu and Govindamma -- who married 16 years ago but did not have any children, approached Ravi, and they took the baby for adoption. They were labourers and natives of Vizianagaram district. However, the biological parents, who could not bear the separation of the baby worried about the welfare of the infant and approached the adopted parents. Roopa urged Govindamma to give back her daughter, said Nuzvid Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) B. Srinivasulu. Both counselled On knowing about the illegal adoption, Hanuman Junction CI D.V. Ramana and Veeravalli SI Namburi Chantibabu summoned both biological and adopted parents and counselled them on Thursday. “During inquiry, Ravi and Roopa said they took the decision as they already had two daughters and are suffering from poverty. They did not enter into any agreement on papers on the adoption,” said Mr. Chantibabu. Mr. Ravindranath Babu said the police enquired about both families and verified their Aadhar and ration cards. The Veeravalli police alerted the Women Development and Child Welfare (WD&CW) officials on the illegal adoption, he said. “We found that no money transaction took place in the process," the SP said. The DSP clarified that no case was registered and counselling had been given to both families on the consequences and punishment for illegal adoption. “We also explained them about the procedure for adopting children through the State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA) and WD&CW Department,” Mr. Srinivasulu said. The CI said the baby was in good health condition and was handed over to the biological parents in the presence of WD&CW officials and anganwadi workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/couple-gives-up-girl-child-for-adoption-repents/article32245632.ece
01 August 2020||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chatrasthapanotsavam celebrated amid fervour||Fervour marked the ‘Chatrasthapanotsavam’ ceremony at the famous hill temple of Lord Venkateswara on Friday. As part of the festival priests performed the ‘thirumanjanam’ rituals to the foot imprints believed to be of Lord Venkateswara atop the Narayanagiri hills with the sacred water fetched from the ‘golden well’ on the temple premises. Mythology has it that the Lord first descended atop the Narayanagiri hills, considered to be the highest peak that form the ‘town of seven hills’. Earlier in the day, the sacred water, flowers, naivedyam and a huge umbrella were taken out in a grand procession from the main temple to the Narayanagiri hills, about four kilometres from the town. The giant umbrella was fastened to the tower housing the foot imprints of the Lord, known as ‘Srivari Padalu’, marking the culmination of the festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chatrasthapanotsavam-celebrated-amid-fervour/article32245606.ece
01 August 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID hospital coming up in Madanapalle||COVID-19 related hassles in the Madanapalle region, considered to be the largest revenue division in the State, will end soon with the government deciding to convert the government area hospital into a COVID hospital. Chittoor district Covid taskforce, which met here on Friday in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy and Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, took a decision to this effect. Apart from the Ministers, legislators Bhumana Karunakar Reddy (Tirupati), Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy (Chandragiri), Collector Bharat Narayan Gupta, MCT Commissioner P.S. Gireesha, Joint Collector S. Veerabrahmam and others participated in the video conference with the officials in the district. Mr. Ramachandra Reddy told the media later that the decision would help those who tested positive in Piler, Punganur, Madanapalle and Thamballapalle constituencies to get treatment. “If required the sanatorium at Madanapalle will also be used for Covid purpose,” he added. The medical college hospitals in Tirupati (both SVRR and SVIMS), Chittoor and Kuppam, have already doubled up as COVID hospitals in the district. In fact, the decision to set up a hospital in Madanapalle is expected to bring down the pressure on SVIMS, which is currently the most sought-after facility. Call to MLAs The Minister asked the legislators of such constituencies where the hospitals are located to reach out to the patients to instill confidence in them. “I request the MLAs to make a video call to ten patients a day and get feedback on treatment and facilities. Similarly, they can also appreciate the services of doctors and nurses for their kind gesture,” he added. Mr. Narayanaswamy urged the public to stay strong and hopeful in fighting the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-hospital-coming-up-in-madanapalle/article32245154.ece
01 August 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||First segmental bridge erected atop pier||The elevated corridor project in Tirupati, Garuda Varadhi, aimed at providing a hassle-free channel to Tirumala-bound devotees as well as easing traffic congestion for the local residents, is all set to be completed within nine months, said MCT Commissioner P.S. Girisha. A precast segmental bridge was erected atop the pier at Prakasam centenary park junction on Friday. Special puja was also performed at the bridge, which was formally lifted and placed atop the pillar with the help of a remote by TTD trust board Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, in the presence of Mr. Girisha and local legislator Bhumana Karunakar Reddy. Mr. Girisha said the distance of three km from Nandi Circle to APSRTC junction would take only four minutes on the flyover as against 30 minutes, and would help reduce waiting time at traffic signals. “The bottom traffic will be cleared in a month and we hope to get the corridor fully ready in nine months,” he added. Mr. Subba Reddy said that the present government made adequate changes to the project by taking into consideration local needs. The 6-km-long elevated corridor requires 2,025 such segments, out of which 230 have already been readied at the casting yard. Funds constraint The funding pattern for the project was originally designed at 66:33, with TTD having to meet two-thirds of its cost, as it is actually meant to benefit visitors to Tirumala. The change of guard at the government and legal wrangles initially made the TTD walk out of the project, leaving the MCT and Tirupati Smart City Corporation disillusioned and overburdened. Mr. Girisha expressed confidence that the TTD would bear the cost at least by the next financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/first-segmental-bridge-erected-atop-pier/article32245159.ece

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) introduced the online tickets for devotees for the vratham owing to the restrictions imposed after the sharp spike in coronavirus caes in the temple towns of Tirumala and Tirupati. According to temple officials, the move to allow online participation of devotees in the rituals evoked a good response. More than 3,500 tickets were sold for participation in the rituals in virtual mode on Friday, when compared to 1,500 tickets that usually get sold every year when devotees could take part in the rituals at the temple in person. “Even as the rituals were performed in ‘ekantam’ (in private) this year, the rise in the number of participants is significant,” said TTD Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal. The priests performed ‘Sri Varalakshmi Vratham’ as per the tradition by worshipping the presiding deity with fragrant flowers and sacred nine threads (Navagrandhi). Agama advisor K. Srinivasacharyulu explained the significance of the vratham’ as explained in ‘Bhavishyottara Purana’.

01 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ramesh Kumar reinstated as State Election Commissioner||The State government has, finally, put a lid on the controversy surrounding the removal of N. Ramesh Kumar from the post of State Election Commissioner (SEC). Late on Thursday night, the government, pursuant to the gazette notification issued by Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, released a G.O. (MS No. 645) reinstating Mr. Ramesh Kumar as the SEC. HC ruling It was, however, stated in the notification that Mr. Ramesh Kumar’s restoration to the top post is subject to the outcome of a Special Leave Petition (SLP) the government had filed in the Supreme Court against the High Court order dated May 29. Mr. Ramesh Kumar’s restoration as SEC is in compliance with the High Court judgement delivered on May 29, wherein it struck down the A.P. Panchayat Raj (Second Amendment) Ordinance (No. 5 of 2020), which resulted in the sudden termination of his services, and the GOs through which Madras High Court retired judge V. Kanagaraj was appointed in his place as the new SEC, as illegal. The government maintained that the ordinance that curtailed the tenure of SEC from five to three years was part of the election reforms and not meant to expel Mr. Ramesh Kumar. Soon after his unceremonious exit in the second week of April, Mr. Ramesh Kumar approached the High Court seeking his restoration and got a favourable verdict, which was challenged by the government in the Supreme Court. Contempt petition The apex court upheld the High Court judgement, but to no avail as the State government did not restore Mr. Ramesh Kumar as the SEC. During the recent hearing on a contempt petition moved by Mr. Ramesh Kumar, the High Court directed him to represent his case to the Governor, who instructed the government to re-appoint him as SEC. Meanwhile, instead of implementing the High Court judgement, the government filed an SLP in the Supreme Court praying for a stay on the contempt proceedings initiated by Mr. Ramesh Kumar but got no relief there either. The government has since been left with no option except to reinstate Mr. Ramesh Kumar as SEC, which it did just over three and half months after promulgation of the impugned ordinance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ramesh-kumar-reinstated-as-state-election-commissioner/article32245080.ece
01 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. will do everything to save this academic year: Minister||Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Friday said the government was making all-out efforts to ensure that students don’t lose a precious academic year due to the existing pandemic situation. Speaking after flagging off 13 ‘Vidya Varadhi’ vehicles designed as mobile classrooms, Mr. Suresh said the move was part of efforts to reach out to students who did not have access to computers, mobile phones or radio and TV. Each vehicle will be equipped with a digital screen, a small library and a teacher. Pointing to the fact that despite its best efforts, the government was unable to start the fresh academic year due to the rapid spread of the virus, the Minister said online classes were planned for students using technology, but there were around 1.18 lakh students who did not have access to these modes of technology. Vidya Varadhi would cater to this particular section, especially in the remote rural and tribal habitations in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. The vehicle would drive into villages and park in an open space where students would gather and learn their lessons imparted through the audio-video mode, maintaining social distancing, he explained. Classes through Vidya Varadhi would continue till schools reopen, he added. The Minister said the lockdown had completely disturbed the academic schedule for the year. The government tried its best to conduct 10th class exams but could not succeed because of the rapid spread of the virus. Left with no choice, it decided to impart online classes using technology.  Innovative modes He said the ‘Vidyamrutham’ programme under which classes were being imparted through Doordarshan channel had gained popularity among students who now regularly attended classes. Mr. Suresh said the department would keep trying new and innovative modes to make things easy for students till the situation returns to normal. Principal Secretary, School Education, B. Rajasekhar, Commissioner, School Education Vadrevu Chinaveerabhadrudu, Special Officer for English Medium Schools K. Vetri Selvi, and Director of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) B.

01 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||A historic blunder, says Naidu||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to seek re-election as a final referendum on the proposed trifurcation of the State capital. Mr. Naidu termed Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan’s assent to the decentralisation and the CRDA Repeal Bills a “historic blunder. ” It was a ‘black Friday’ in the history of Andhra Pradesh, he added. “Who will do justice to the people of the State?’’ he asked, adding the decision was in violation of the reorganisation Act. Addressing a press conference on Friday, Mr. Naidu said similar thing has happened with regard to State Election Commissioner Ramesh Kumar, whose unconstitutional removal was eventually struck down by the court. This was not the time for politics and all the institutions involved should think of protecting the State’s overall interests. ‘State’s future at stake’ Mr. Jagan spoke loudly in favour of Amaravati as only the Capital for A.P. on the floor of the Assembly when he was in the Opposition, but after coming to power, he took a U-turn and started taking decisions aimed at destroying Amaravati. Such hateful activities never happened in the history of any State and even Mr. Jagan’s father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy continued all the developmental projects launched by the TDP regime in Hyderabad, he said. If the YSRCP is allowed to have its way, the State would touch rock bottom in terms of development. The Chief Minister had taken a decision to crush the dream and long-term aspirations of not just 29,000 farmers of Amaravati but the 5 crore people of the State. Moreover, the breach of trust by the YSRCP would severely harm future generations. Mr. Naidu announced that the TDP would participate in the State-wide agitation called by the Amaravati Joint Action Committee. Welcoming the support from all sections to the cause, he urged the people to realise that the time has come to intensify the agitation against the “vicious and atrocious” Capital shifting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-historic-blunder-says-naidu/article32245621.ece

Mr. Naidu held the government responsible for the deaths. “The government has failed to rein in the liquor mafia, which is under the control of the ruling YSRCP. The Assembly Speaker himself has said that the State has become a haven for illicit liquor. The government should provide relief to victims’ families,” Mr. Naidu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blames-govt-for-kurichedu-deaths/article32245155.ece
01 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||North Andhra region stands to gain, says Minister||Leaders of the ruling YSRCP on Friday welcomed the Governor’s assent to the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020. Speaking to The Hindu , Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said it was a historic decision. “The North Andhra region in general, and Visakhapatnam (now Executive capital) in particular, will develop. Amaravati too will develop, as it will continue to be the Legislative capital. Rayalaseema will also prosper, as the Judicial capital will be based in Kurnool.” The Minister, however, said a decision on when to start functioning from Visakhapatnam would be taken soon.  Dream come true: MLA Welcoming the development, TDP MLA Vasupalli Ganesh said, “It is a dream come true for those who are born and brought up in Visakhapatnam. It will benefit the city and the region as well. But, at the same time, the idea of Amaravati should not be killed.” “Amaravati was conceived by former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu as a model city. It should also be developed, as many farmers had sacrificed their lands for the purpose,” Mr. Ganesh said. Asked if the court’s intervention could stall the process, he said, “It (the Bill) has already become a legislation with the assent of the Governor. Now the court can only see to it that the farmers of Amaravati get their due.” ‘Reach out to farmers’ “The BJP has already made it clear that it is the decision of the State government and that the Centre has no role in it,” said former BJP MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju. “Personally, I welcome it, as the city and the region should see some good growth. But, at the same time, justice should be done to the farmers of Amaravati who had sacrificed their lands,” he said. However, the Left parties opposed the decision of the Governor. “To develop a region, one need not shift the capital of the State. Vizag is a blessed city with lot of potential. Had the TDP government, or the YSRCP government now, paid attention to the city, the region would have grown exponentially by now,” said CPI State Secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/north-andhra-region-stands-to-gain-says-minister/article32245625.ece

01 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||When green shoots sprout from tricolour||A city startup is making waves on social media with its wide range of eco-friendly items such as rakhis, friendship bands, idols of Lord Ganesha and the national flag. GreenWaves Environmental Solutions (GWES), which aspires to eliminate single-use plastic from households, is unveiling its ‘Clean and Green’ concept on August 1 through which it will sell ‘seed rakhis’, Ganesh idols and tricolours — all made of seeds taken from 19 varieties of native plants. The seed flag concept has gone viral in Twitter with actors such as Naga Chaitanya and Sai Dharam Tej and music composer Devi Sri Prasad tweeting in support. “This Independence Day, let us use a bio-degradable flag to show our patriotism which can later be turned in to a plant by following a simple procedure. Let’s join hands to protect our environment,” tweeted actor Sai Dharam Tej, tagging the Viskhapatnam-based firm’s Twitter handle. “We are floored by the support for our concept. After the post went viral, we have received scores of orders. We have already taken up 10,000 orders of the seed flags till now,” Potluri Anil Chowdary, managing director of GreenWaves Environmental Solutions, told The Hindu . “Single-use plastic is emerging as the biggest polluter of the environment. Our aim is to offer alternatives and reduce the use of plastic,” he said. GWES has a team of five persons who are working overtime to meet the orders, apart from student volunteers who are interning with the firm. Seeds of plants such as cherry tomato, brinjal, chilli, spinach, tulsi, tamarind, neem and coriander, have been used in these bands and Ganesha idol. Each product is made of cotton, cloth and paper and comes neatly wrapped in paper with an instruction manual on how to plant the seeds. For Ganesh Chaturthi, GWES has plans to start a collection drive of dry leaves, flowers and coconuts used in puja, and reuse it to make incense sticks . Six months ago, the firm had launched temple flower waste management. Temple waste recycling “We collected close to 300 kg of flower waste from seven temples in the city and made around 10,000 incense sticks. We plan to restart it through a door-to-door collection drive during Ganesha Chaturthi to bring down festival waste,” Mr. Anil said. The seed rakhis, friendship bands, tri-colour seed flags and Ganesha idols can be ordered via WhatsApp by calling or messaging 9550685178.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-green-shoots-sprout-from-tricolour/article32245604.ece
01 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pandemic fuels demand for spices||Even as the coronavirus continues to take toll, the demand for traditional spices that help boost immunity has substantially gone up. The spices with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties are being used like never before by the people who are doing everything possible to prevent the infection. The sale of ‘sonti’ (dry ginger), ‘lavangalu’ (clove), ‘miriyalu’ (black peeper), ‘dalchina’ (cinnamon) and turmeric among others has seen an increase since the outbreak of the virus, the shopkeepers say. Out of stock The dry ginger has run out of stock at many shops. “Dry ginger powder, which was available at Rs. 25 for 50 gm before the pandemic has now gone up to Rs. 45. There has not been any increase in the prices of the other spices, though the demand for them has gone up,” says Giridhar, a grocery store owner at MVP Rythu Bazaar. Many outlets dealing with wellness products are of the same view. “We have run out of dry ginger stock. Though the overall business has suffered owing to the pandemic. Customers, however, are buying spices in more quantities. The sale of millets has dropped, but honey, which we procure from Sirohi district in Rajasthan, is in high demand,” says Bandaru Naresh of Sumaja Eco-Wellness which has outlets at Seethammadhara and Pandurangapuram. Some NGOs selling spices are taking alternative routes as their outlets remain closed. “The high demand for scvpices has not yielded much as we cannot open our stall owing to lockdown. However, I have been supplying items to our acquaintances on demand,” says Devullu Pachari, secretary of Sanjeevani, an NGO. However, he says that the NGO has sold 80 kgs of dry ginger, 250 kgs of black peeper, 50 kgs of mustard seed and 400 kgs of turmeric powder since March. “The parcel service launched by the APSRTC has come to our rescue. Dry ginger which was sold at Rs. 450 a kg earlier is now available at Rs. 650 a kg,” he adds. Apart from the spices, consuming ‘Kashayam’, a concoction of various spices and herbs, is gaining ground. “Kashayam is being increasingly used to boost immunity and prevent respiratory tract infections,” says Sarat Pendekanti of Akshayadhatri Farms at Nandyal in Kurnool district. How to make ‘kashayam’ “Once can powder dry ginger, turmeric, black peeper and cinnamon stick should be powdered and boil the mixture with water. Care should be taken to avoid over boiling as it reduces the effect. The concoction should be consumed in an empty stomach early in the morning,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-fuels-demand-for-spices/article32245613.ece

A meeting was held to demand reservation for the Kapu community, in the name of ‘Kapu Garjana’ in which lakhs of people had participated, at Tuni in January 2016. The protesters marched to the Tuni Railway Station even as the meeting was going on and gained entry into the station. They set fire to the Ratnachal Express, resulting in injuries to some of the passengers and railway staff. The locomotive was fully destroyed and some coaches were partially damaged in the incident. As many as 69 cases were booked against the protesters. The State government had issued a G.O. in March 2020, withdrawing 51 of those cases. Another G.O. was issued on July 27, withdrawing 17 more cases. HRF State general secretary K. Sudha and State secretary Y. Rajesh demanded that the State government immediately cancel the G.O. and hasten investigation into those criminal cases. They noted that though Public Prosecutors (PPs) have the power to seek withdrawal of the prosecution in criminal cases under Section 321 of Cr.PC, they should ensure that the cases fall within the parameters of the law, before taking them up in court. The cases can be withdrawn with the approval of the court. HRF leaders allege that it has now become common in all States to misuse this Section for their political advantage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tuni-violence-hrf-faults-withdrawal-of-prosecution-in-17-cases/article32245148.ece

Regarding the judicial capital, the Bill says: “The seat of all State judicial institutions established under the State legislations, shall, as far as practicable, be located in Kurnool.” Accordingly, the principal seat of the High Court will be located in Kurnool and Benches constituted as per the procedure laid down in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

The Bills were first passed in the Assembly in January 2020, but the TDP had stalled them in the Council by leveraging on its majority in the 58-member House and got them referred to a Select Committee.

01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eagle squad to neutralise drones||The Telangana government on Friday issued an order giving the Home Department permission to raise a squad of eagles for training them to neutralise drones during VIP/VVIP visits and official programmes in the State. The order was issued by the Finance Department following a request by the Home Department on June 26 to be allowed to raise ‘Garuda’ squad at the Integrated Intelligence Training Academy of Police at Moinabad on Hyderabad outskirts. The training academy at Moinabad is presently engaged in training sniffer dogs, personal security officers and VIP security of police and private security licensees. The dogs undergo eight-month training to sniff, track and assault targeted objects. So far, 19 batches of dogs have passed out of the academy and been deployed by police forces not only within Telangana but also other States. The present batch of 49 dogs included 25 from Bihar, a senior official at the academy said. The Finance Department also gave permission to engage the services of two resource persons as trainers on contract basis. When the squad is raised, the police of Telangana will become the second force in the world to use this method of tracking unauthorised drones. Earlier, police of the Netherlands trained eagles to take down drones amid concerns that they were increasingly being used to commit crimes. However, it was said that the Netherlands had decided to retire its team of eagles that were trained after one and a half years because the birds did not always do what was expected of them as they were distracted by other things happening around them during training sessions. It was also found that employing eagles in security issues meant unnecessary cost for the birds’ training and upkeep. The decision to retire the eagles also pleased bird lovers who were concerned that the drones with their fast-spinning propellers could injure eagle if its speedy approach was off the mark. High-tech solutions Instead, the Dutch police decided to explore other options like high-tech solutions that were far more reliable and cheaper to maintain than eagles. They included anti-drone guns and drone shield ‘sky fences’. Such systems could be deployed relatively quickly and act swiftly to remove a rogue drone from the sky. Eagles were said to be a preferred lot to combat drones because of their sharp talons and equally sharp eyesight which enabled them to pinpoint and pluck a drone from the sky in a single and fast manoeuvre. The Dutch police demonstrated the skills of eagles first in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eagle-squad-to-neutralise-drones/article32245427.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Initial phase of lockdown dents State’s revenue by Rs. 5,000 cr.||Telangana’s revenue deficit climbed to over Rs. 5,000 crore in the very first month of this current financial year which climaxed with the initial phase of lockdown in the State. The State’s revenue deficit was Rs. 5,178.96 crore which was minus 115.55% of the budget estimates at the end of April as disclosed in a recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The total revenue receipts in the month from various tax and non-tax revenue sources and grant-in-aid were Rs. 3,377.61 crore while revenue expenditure was Rs. 8,556.57 crore, contributing to the aggregate deficit of Rs. 5,178.96 crore. The receipts of the government took a huge beating in collection of tax revenue which was a mere Rs. 1,700 crore against Rs. 5,226.90 crore in April last year. The amount included devolution by Centre of Rs. 620.38 crore as State’s share of Union taxes. Receipts fall The receipts could have been much worse without the grant-in-aid and contributions released by Centre to the tune of Rs. 1,402 crore. Generally, the aid is released in later part of the year but the Centre made an exception this time due to lockdown which impacted the finances of State governments heavily. Sources said the expenditure of the government, on the other hand, was too high to match the receipts, particularly on revenue account which consisted of unforeseen payments on account of COVID. The expenditure was Rs. 4,602.80 crore against Rs. 1,585.73 crore in April last year. Interest payments also rose by about Rs. 350 crore but the salary bill for the staff was cut short by Rs. 300 crore with prior notice to employees. The pensioners also bore the brunt as they had to take a cut of Rs. 470 crore.  Heavy burden The government, however, increased the expenditure on subsidies by Rs. 500 crore over last year. Overall, the revenue expenditure on social sector caused by payment of Rs. 1,500 per family for loss of wages to poor and rice distribution was Rs. 5,174 crore. Receipts from Goods and Service Tax were Rs. 776.75 crore which was nearly half of last year. The revenues from stamps and registration, land revenue, sales tax and State excise duties also plummeted steeply, the C&AG report noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/initial-phase-of-lockdown-dents-states-revenue-by-rs-5000-cr/article32245435.ece

01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Online sheep booking, sacrifice and distribution get a fillip||With Eid-al-Adha scheduled to be celebrated on Saturday amid COVID-19 pandemic, more people took to booking of livestock, sacrificing and distribution of meat online. Several Muslims who would visit traditional sheep markets in Mehdipatnam, Toli Chowki or Saidabad opted to transact on cyberspace, given the several online slot booking available to them. With prices for slaughtering, skinning, portioning, packing and meat distribution available for anything between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 14,000, or more, booking comes across as a more convenient and safer option. “I used to go to the Mehdipatnam market every year. But this year, I didn’t want to take any chances because of the pandemic and booked a sheep for Bakrid sacrifice three days ago for Rs. 9,000. Given the coronavirus, the vendor who I dealt with offered hygienic zabiha (slaughtering), skinning, packing and distribution. Several of my extended family members have done the same,” said Abdul Samad, a resident of Nanal Nagar near Toli Chowki. Mohammed Waseem, a resident of Noorkhan Bazaar, and a businessman too shared a similar experience. “I have two children and thought it best not to venture out because of the coronavirus. I booked two sheep online for Rs. 18,000,” he said. While several did take to a ‘no-contact’ sacrifice, the traditional sheep markets of Mehdipatnam and the relatively newer but smaller Salarjung Bridge and Vijay Nagar Colony sheep markets saw a slow start. Abdul Hameed, a seasonal sheep trader for the past five years, said, “I brought 60 sheep from Alair. On chand raat (Eid eve) last year, I sold nearly 150 sheep, but now I am struggling to sell 50. Customer movement is slow. We had difficulty unloading the animals because police were being strict,” he said. On Friday evening, after receiving information of sheep traders being allegedly harassed by police, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen legislator Syed Ahmed Pasha Qadri and corporator Sohail Qadri reached the spot and intervened. “We will show all the videos of police high-handedness to the Commissioner of Police tomorrow. It seems that police do not want to let these people do business for even four or five days,” the Yakutpura legislator said. Those in the know claimed that till recently, transporters has problems bringing livestock into the city. “I can understand cows being stopped by police. But why stop transport of sheep,” asked a trader. Touching upon the price of sheep, buyers said that there is a marginal difference as compared to last year. While a pair of sheep each weighing approximately 12 kg was selling for anything between Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 18,000, those in markets on the city outskirts struck a decent bargain. “I went around Mehdipatnam market and the ones in Pahadishareef, Balapur and Jalpally on the outskirts. It seems that the prices are slightly higher in the city. I bought a pair of sheep for Rs. 14,000 from Pahadishareef.A lot of the livestock here came from places like interiors of Shamshabad and Shadnagar,” said KareemAnsari, a city resident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/online-sheep-booking-sacrifice-and-distribution-get-a-fillip/article32245419.ece

Apart from unauthorised structures, the corporation is also pulling down additional floors over and above the permitted limit. Officials from the Town Planning wing said the drive was being conducted in other zones too, such as Secunderabad and Kukatpally, as builders have taken advantage of the lockdown to go ahead with construction without permission.

Penalties in terms of enhanced property tax and water would will be imposed on the buildings which did not have occupancy certificate, the statement warned. Details of building permissions and occupancy certificates were available on GHMC website for the citizens to verify, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/unauthorised-structures-pulled-down-in-serilingampally/article32245430.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR firms up 23 bridges in last three months||South Central Railway (SCR) has made good use of the current situation of reduced train movements to give long-term benefits to passengers by implementing a strategy to tone up maintenance work like long-pending repair of bridges. The unprecedented last three months, April to June, have helped the engineering and maintenance wings to carry out repairs for a record number of 23 bridges that needed replacement, repair or re-building. Bridges chosen for repairs were selected from among key and congested sections. These were given prime importance as they were highly saturated with continuous train movements and could have caused major disruptions, said CPRO Ch. Rakesh on Friday.Secunderabad division: Three bridges over the busy Kazipet - Vijayawada section were reconstructed with masonry stone structures replaced with RCC boxes. Hyderabad division: Two masonry bridges at the Kacheguda - Dhone section were replaced with RCC boxes and a Road-Under-Bridge (RUB) was built closing the level crossing gate between Shadnagar and Thimmapur section. An additional vent was provided by the side of RUB at Nizamabad yard to avoid congestion for road-users.Vijayawada division: Two new waterway bridges have been constructed between Vijayawada-Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada-Gudur sections prone to cyclones’ impact. An old stone masonry bridge between Ongole and Karavadi stations was replaced with RCC boxes. Guntakal division: Eight old stone top culvert bridges, one between Chennai and Mumbai route section, were replaced with RCC segmental boxes. Four steel girder bridges were replaced with PSC slabs for track strengthening and safety. Guntur division: A new waterway bridge was constructed between Nadikudi and Macherla section, to avoid breaches in this floods/ heavy rains prone section.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-firms-up-23-bridges-in-last-three-months/article32245458.ece
01 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Coronavirus dents temple coffers||A decline in the number of people visiting temples in the city has adversely impacted the functioning of the religious places. While the temples managed by Telangana Endowment Department (ED) are functioning normally, the smaller temples which rely on offerings by devotees are having a hard time. Salary solace “Only 10-12 persons are visiting the temple a day though it is open between 6 a.m and 11 a.m and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Our temple is under the control of the ED since 2014 so we get regular salaries,” says Ramacharyulu, the main priest at the centuries-old Kishenbagh temple. A visit to the temple is a surreal experience for devotees as they are not allowed to make offerings of flowers or coconuts. “Devotees can pray but there is restriction on archana (offering) or abhishekams (special puja) or tirtham (offering of holy water). We cannot take chances,” says Shyam Sundar, an ED official at a small temple in Gudimalkapur. The collection of money from offerings used to range between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 75,000 per month, but now that has plummeted from the time the temple reopened to visitors on June 8. A list of Standard Operating Procedures is tacked to the entrance of the temple. “We have started online puja but visiting the temple and feeling the air of spirituality is different. We miss devotees who used to throng this temple. We, however, are not affected financially as our salaries are taken care of by the temple trust,” says Chaitanya, who leads prayers at the Jagannath Temple on Road no 12 Banjara Hills. The temple is administered by the Kalinga Cultural Trust.  Other smaller temples which depend on community trusts and patrons are finding it difficult to manage their financial affairs. “We are getting our salary but we know the financial status of the trust. Only a sprinkling of people are visiting our temple,” says a priest at a Sai Baba temple which used to see droves of devotees on Thursdays waiting with coconuts, flowers and prayers on their lips. On Friday, as married women observed Varalakshmi Vratam celebrated according to the Hindu calendar month of Shravan, the subtle shift in the nature of faith due to COVID-19 pandemic was evident. Instead of women visiting homes and exchanging tambulam in the neighbourhood, most women stayed at home and did puja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/coronavirus-dents-temple-coffers/article32245412.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS hits back at Cong. over Dalit deaths||Minister for Scheduled Castes Development Koppula Eshwar and Chairman of Peddapalli Zilla Parishad alleged that unable to find any issue, the Congress was blowing out of proportion the death of a couple of Dalits due to personal and family disputes, linking them to the TRS only to garner political mileage. Speaking to the media here on Friday, they said that one Rangaiah had died after a clash between two persons in Manthani. They wanted to know why the Congress was politicising the death or killing of a TRS activist. In another incident between two families at Mallaram in Bhupalapalli district, one Rajababu was killed following a clash with his neighbour Srinivas, they said, and asked whether such incidents were not taking places in the states ruled by the Congress. At the same time, the Congress leaders had no courtesy even to visit the family of the party activist Bandela Narayanaswamy, who was killed over a personal dispute, they pointed out. Stating that there was no political involvement in any of these killings, they said instead of fighting for the rights of the downtrodden, the Congress leaders were being misled by CLP leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka and taking up petty issues. They accused Congress of attempting to link the Manthani and Mallaram killings to TRS although it had nothing do with them. Responding to the Congress allegation against the government on the snail’s pace progress of distribution of three acres land to each landless Dalit family, the TRS leaders reasoned that non-availability of land had slowed its progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-hits-back-at-cong-over-dalit-deaths/article32245454.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR-Jagan have ‘secret pact’ on Krishna water, says BJP||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar has accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of having a ‘secret’ understanding with his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on utilisation of Krishna waters and hence, the demand for postponing the meeting called for by the Apex Council to discuss the upcoming projects from August 5 to August 20. “When the Centre has taken the initiative to call for a meeting of both the States to discuss the illegal projects sought to be constructed by the AP government on the Krishna River to draw water from Srisailam reservoir, why does KCR want it to be put off instead of showing alacrity in protecting the Telangana’s water share? It is ridiculous to put the blame on the Union government for the differences between both States,” he told a press video conference on Friday. What is the point of having the meeting after the AP government finalises tenders for capacity enhancement of Pothireddypadu and others on August 11, questioned the Karimnagar Member of Parliament. He has been in New Delhi and had met Union Minister for Jalshakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat requesting him to hold the meeting of the Apex Council and the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to stall the proposed AP projects, which he charged went against the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 and hence, will affect the interests of Telangana. The TS government’s “negligent attitude” towards protecting the legitimate share of the water resources has been causing grave injustice to the State, he charged. “The Chief Minister had feigned ignorance when AP had issued orders to build the illegal projects. He has made it a habit of blaming others and diverting the attention of people from critical issues,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-jagan-have-secret-pact-on-krishna-water-says-bjp/article32245441.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TPCC to move NHRC on Dalit ‘atrocities’||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has demanded that the State government register an atrocities case against those responsible for the suicide of a Dalit, Byagari Narsimhulu, at Velur village in Gajwel constituency. Speaking on the increasing atrocities against Dalit and tribal communities in the State during the last six years, Mr. Reddy said on Friday that justice would be denied to the two communities as long as the rule of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) was there. He asked the dalit, backward classes and other downtrodden communities to unite against the “excesses of the TRS leaders” on them. About Narsimhulu’s suicide, the TPCC chief said that the dalit youth had taken to the extreme step as his 13 guntas of land was taken by the officials forcibly for the construction of Rythu Vedika building, in spite of his repeated requests to spare it. He stated that Narsimhulu’s suicide follows the killing of Rajababu in Mallaram village of Bhupalapally district and the killing of two other dalits in Jagitial and Peddapalli districts a few days earlier. He termed the statement of Minister for Finance Harish Rao that one acre would be given to Narsimhulu’s family as unfortunate. He also blamed police inaction on incidents of atrocities against Dalits for their recurrence. The Congress would meet the Governor and also move the National Human Rights Commission on the Dalits killings in the State. Meanwhile, Congress MP from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkat Reddy has announced Rs. One lakh financial assistance to the family of Narsimhulu. He handed over the amount to Wargal mandal Congress president Narender Reddy and others as the police would not allow him to visit Velpur to hand over the assistance personally. He demanded that the government sanction three acre land, a double-bedroom house and Rs. one crore ex gratia to the victim’s family. In a representation, the TPCC has requested the Director General of Police to protect the Dalits and tribals from atrocities by asking the police force to act upon complaints immediately. They alleged that the revenue authorities have refused include his 13 guntas land in revenue records in spite of repeated requests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tpcc-to-move-nhrc-on-dalit-atrocities/article32245456.ece
01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ISTA sounds alert on entry of suspicious seed into India||The International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) has cautioned the Indian government about smuggling of suspicious and unrecognised (spurious) seed into the country through e-commerce entities following such incidents in the USA during the past one week. Director of Telangana State Seed and Organic Certification Authority (TSSOCA) K. Keshavulu, in his capacity as the vice president of ISTA, has stated that ISTA has received information that people in Washington, New York, Virginia, Florida and a few other States in the United States of America have been receiving seed packets through e-commerce companies without ordering for them. Besides, the suspicious seed packets are unrecognised and have no details of origin. “Following the unwanted/unsolicited delivery of such suspicious seed packets for the past one week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has cautioned people, particularly those engaged in farming, against opening such suspicious seed packets, sowing them in farms or backyards or disposing in the garbage and urged them to give information to the officials,” the ISTA vice president said explaining the US response to the unwanted seed supply in violation of customs and import regulations being termed as “brushing scam and seed terrorism” there.  Border inspection Mr. Keshavulu said the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an agency of USDA, had conducted inspection in the US borders to find out about the suspicious seed illegally transported into the US had come to a conclusion that they had originated from China. The neighbouring Canada too had alerted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CIA), its regulatory agency that safeguards food, plants and animals and works for enhancing the health and well-being of the country’s people, environment and economy, to be cautious against entry of such suspicious seed into the country. Stating that such suspicious seed supply would have threats not only for the food security but also on environment and human health, the ISTA vice president said such seeds carry the threat of pest attacks and poisonous weeds with them harming the entire ecosystem of agriculture. Along with ISTA several international seed agencies have also become alert about the entry of such suspicious seed into the supply-chains and have decided to caution the stakeholders.  Inform Centre On its part, the ISTA would officially take the issue to the notice of the Indian government soon, Mr. Keshavulu said. In his capacity as Director of TSSOCA and Managing Director of Telangana State Seed Development Corporation (TSSDC) Mr. Keshavulu requested farmers and seed companies in the State to inform officials immediately in case they come across such suspicious seed packets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ista-sounds-alert-on-entry-of-suspicious-seed-into-india/article32245438.ece

01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Congress sees a conspiracy in TS move||The Congress party has alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is seeking the postponement of the Apex Council meeting convened by the Ministry of Jal Shakti as part of his collusion with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to mortgage Telangana’s interests in the matter of river waters. Instead of presenting the case of Telangana strongly at the Apex Council on the injustice being done to the region from the day when it was clubbed with Andhra to form Andhra Pradesh and opposing the AP’s attempts to divert huge quantity of water from Srisailam reservoir everyday to protect Telangana’s interests, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was trying to give away the opportunity, convenor of Krishna Jalala Parirakshana (Krishna Waters Protection) Committee of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee T. Rammohan Reddy said here on Friday. The mala fide intentions of the Chief Minister in not protecting the State’s interests in Krishna waters were clearly evident in his seeking the postponement of the Apex Council meet to a date after August 20, Mr. Rammohan Reddy said. The former legislator explained that Mr. Rao was seeking the postponement of the meeting to a date after August 20 as the tenders for the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) being planned by AP would be finalised on August 19. AICC secretary Challa Vamshichand Reddy alleged that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was mortgaging the State’s interests to AP in case of Krishna waters in collusion with the AP Chief Minister and Andhra contractors. He said the State government did not react properly when AP had invited tenders for RLIP that had the potential to turn the South Telangana into a desert as it draws 8 tmc ft of water a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-sees-a-conspiracy-in-ts-move/article32245439.ece

01 August 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||‘Consciousness on strengthening immunity naturally a positive sign’||Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the enhanced levels of awareness about COVID-19 among all sections of people and the availability of comprehensive testing and treatment services will help the State effectively deal with exigency, if any, in the current rainy season. All the requisite health infrastructure and screening as well as treatment facilities are in place to tackle any exigency that may arise out of the pandemic, he said. The increased consciousness among people on strengthening immunity in a natural way is a positive sign at this present juncture, he noted. The Minister was speaking to newsmen after inaugurating the TrueNat testing centre and a dedicated Intensive Care Unit for COVID-19 patients at the district headquarters hospital here on Friday. He also opened a RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing centre and a 72-bed COVID-19 special ward at the town-based Mamata general and super-specialty hospital. He reviewed the COVID-19 preventive measures and medical services for COVID-19 patients at the ZP conference hall later in the day. Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar, Khammam MP Nama Nageswara Rao, Collector R.V. Karnan and others were present. Mr Rajender said full-fledged COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment services have been made available in Khammam town. The fatality rate of COVID-19 is very low compared to any other viral disease and as such there is no need for panic, he said, adding that an overwhelming number of 81% of the COVID-19 positive cases, mostly asymptomatic cases, were turning negative mostly by remaining in home isolation. However, those suffering from pre-existing health issues should be very cautious, he said. He suggested that CCTV cameras be installed at the State-run COVID isolation wards and ICUs to effectively monitor the health of each patient. A command control centre kind of mechanism may be set up to operate the CCTV network round the clock, he opined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/consciousness-on-strengthening-immunity-naturally-a-positive-sign/article32245416.ece
01 August 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Giving the dead a dignified send-off||The COVID-19 pandemic has not only created an atmosphere of fear and panic among citizens, but also proved that blood is not always thicker than water. On July 10, when the family of a COVID victim in Patancheru refused to perform his last rites over fear of virus transmission, a local NGO stepped up to the task of giving him a respectful farewell. D. Madhusudhan, who runs an NGO called M. Devender Raju (MDR) Foundation, performed the last rites with GHMC’s help. For Madhusudhan and his team, this was not for the first such instance. They have been doing it since 2017, for over 140 identified and unidentified bodies. Patancheru, one of the biggest industrials belt in India, is termed ‘Mini India’ where people from various parts of the country reside. Sometimes, the situation is that the relatives of a deceased person are far away and are unable to travel or afford the trip. Mr. Madhusudhan started the initiative after coming across a newspaper clipping in 2017 about the unclaimed body of an orphan. “I am doing this job with the cooperation of M. Pruthvi Raj, B Rakesh and some others. The idea is give dignity to the dead,” Mr. Madhusudhan told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/giving-the-dead-a-dignified-send-off/article32245414.ece
01 August 2020||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Raised bund a new problem for Vemulaghat farmers||It was on January 7 last year that the Vemulaghat protesters withdrew their 963 days of agitation, demanding implementation of the Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013 (LA Act 2013). Led by former minister late Ch. Muthyam Reddy, a team of officials held discussions with the oustees and convinced them with the promise of Rs. 11.5 lakh per acre and completing the payment by end of January 2019, paying compensations for structures by February 2019 and completing construction of Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) colony at Mutrajpally of Gajwel mandal by March 2019. Vemulaghat is one of the villages that would get submerged under the 50-tmcft capacity Mallannasagar coming up in both Toguta and Kondapaka mandals. However, even after a year, the promises have not been fulfilled fully and farmers were facing new problems. The height of the bund that has been coming up adjacent to the village has been raised, and that has become a huge problem for villagers. Navigating the bund to go out of the village and return, especially during the rainy season. Their appeals not to continue works till they were rehabilitated were not heeded to by the officials concerned. “The roads leading to our village are completely cut off. It is very inconvenient to ride a motorcycle and autos are also unable to ferry people. We have to pray for the mercy of our village Goddess Mysamma if something happens to somebody in our village or there is an emergency. To make matters worse, police are threatening us if we agitate for our demands,” K. Chandrasekhar, one of the villagers told The Hindu . He is one among those who had signed the memorandum. “The promise of Rs. 11.5 lakh for each acre was made by Muthyam Reddy, who said he would see to it that we get the total amount. All of us were paid an amount of Rs. 11 lakh. When we are asking for the balance Rs. 50,000, the officials are sarcastically asking us to grill Muthyam Reddy, who had passed way. What can we do?” asked another villager.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/raised-bund-a-new-problem-for-vemulaghat-farmers/article32245445.ece

01 August 2020||New Delhi,||HC questions officer for issuing order to riot cases probe team||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Special Commissioner of Police (Crime and Economic Offences Wing) Praveer Ranjan why he issued an order to all the Investigating Officers and teams that are probing cases related to the north-east Delhi riots to exercise caution while making arrests. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait’s query came while hearing a joint petition filed by two individuals whose family members died in the riots claiming that the July 8 order of the Special CP caused “illegal interference” in the ongoing investigations with the intent of influencing the said investigations. The petition cited the news article in which the senior officer allegedly stated that there was a degree of resentment in the Hindu Community against the arrest of certain Hindu persons, while directing investigating officers that they should be careful in the future when making arrests. Special C.P. Mr Ranjan, who was present in the hearing through videoconferencing, said it was a normal practice adopted by the police to sensitise the officials to exercise due care and precaution. ‘Sensitisation exercise’ Mr. Ranjan said that whenever any complaint or input comes to his notice, such a communication is issued to sensitise the officers so that they exercise due care and precaution during the investigation. He submitted that all cases of the riots have already been registered before the July 8 and hence no prejudice caused to any member of any community. When the Special CP said that the police have issued similar orders in the past, the High Court directed Mr. Ranjan to place five such orders or letters, in a sealed cover, which he or his predecessor has issued on receiving a complaint or representation. During the hearing, advocate Amit Mahajan, representing Delhi Police, argued that the petition was highly mischievous. Reacting to this, the court said the July 8 letter was also mischievous. Tell me what was the need to issue this letter, the court remarked. The court also noted that “it is not in dispute that senior officers are duty-bound to guide their teams time and again” while posting the case for further hearing on August 7. The petition filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha sought quashing of the July 8 order claiming that “it gives a clear indication to all the investigating teams to screen offenders if they belong to the Hindu Community”. The petition stated that on July 15, the office of Commissioner of Police tweeted a clarification to the news article, but does not deny that such an order was indeed passed by the Special C.P. The plea quoted the clarification where the police said, “Tone and tenor of the article is highly misleading and seeks to give an impression of the police being biased”. “News item ignores the spirit of order where it has been specifically stated that any arrest irrespective of any class, community or religious group be done on the basis of evidence and does not give an impression of being arbitrary,” the police had clarified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-questions-officer-for-issuing-order-to-riot-cases-probe-team/article32245337.ece
01 August 2020||New Delhi,||L-G rejects govt.’s proposal to open hotels, weekly markets||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday rejected the Delhi government’s proposal to allow hotels and weekly markets to open as part of Unlock 3, resulting in another confrontation between the two entities in as many days. The move came in the wake of Mr. Baijal’s decision to direct the Delhi government to notify a panel of lawyers suggested by the Delhi Police to represent the Delhi government in cases related to the anti-CAA protests and north-east Delhi riots in the High Court and Supreme Court. According to sources, the Delhi government had sought the L-G’s approval to allow rehri patri businesses to operate for longer hours, the opening of hotels as well as the operation of weekly bazars in the Capital on a trial basis through the Revenue Department. “The matter was discussed with Hon’ble Chief Minister and it was agreed that while there has been improvement, pandemic situation in the Capital continues to be fragile and the threat is still far from over. Therefore, a cautious and conservative approach is required,” Raj Niwas sources said. “While the proposal to allow Rehari Patriwallahs to operate for longer hours w.e.f. from 01.08.2020 was approved, the proposals of opening hotels, hospitality services and weekly bazaars are deferred for the time being and would be reviewed later by the SDMA,” they also said. Terms incorrect The Delhi government termed this “incorrect” and offered to send the file related to these proposals to the L-G yet again. “Without getting into the details, if Hon’ble L-G is agreeable, we can send the proposal again for reconsideration. Revival of Delhi’s economy, while at the same time containing COVID, is the topmost priority of Delhi government. Hon’ble CM has always been a strong votary of opening economy,” Delhi government sources said. The Delhi government had, on Thursday, decided to end night curfew, allow hotels and hospitality services and street hawkers in addition to weekly bazars on a trial basis with social distancing norms in place to open up the city’s economy under Unlock 3 guidelines issued by the Central government. These decisions were in continuation of others taken by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure that Delhi’s economy, which was impacted severely by the lockdown, gets back on track, the government had said in a statement. As part of the decisions taken under Unlock 3 guidelines, the Delhi government had decided to end the night curfew that was earlier in operation from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.. Since hotels in Delhi were no longer linked to hospitals, the Delhi government had said, it had also decided to allow “normal functioning” of such facilities and hospitality services, “permitted under Centre’s unlock guidelines.” The AAP on Friday criticised the BJP-led Central government’s decision to not allow hotels and weekly markets to reopen in Delhi. “It appears that the Central government under the BJP derives sadistic pleasure by inflicting pain and misery of the people of Delhi and by undermining the democratically elected government of Delhi. On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, I want to tell the BJP-led Central government that they should immediately stop interfering in the works of the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government. The BJP government should not interfere in the jurisdiction of the elected government of Delhi,” said AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/l-g-rejects-govts-proposal-to-open-hotels-weekly-markets/article32245346.ece

On June 9, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had issued an “irresponsible statement” to the effect that there were apprehensions of the case tally reaching 5.5 lakh till July 31, which had created an atmosphere of “fear and dread” in the city. “When people were suffering and wandering for treatment, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal used to sit in his AC room and did press conferences and talked big on Twitter . Today he is not tired of patting his back that his Delhi model has become successful and COVID-19 cases in Delhi are now on the verge of ending,” Mr. Gupta alleged. Taking credit for someone else’s work and blaming someone else for failing are the only two models utilised by Mr. Kejriwal, Mr. Gupta alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centres-steps-helped-reduce-virus-cases-bjp/article32245345.ece
01 August 2020||New Delhi,||St. Stephen’s staffers want withdrawal of rent notice||Staffers of St. Stephen’s college hit out against the college administration on Friday for its move demanding students to either vacate the hostel or pay a fine of Rs. 100 per day. In a notice on its website posted on July 25, the college has asked students to vacate the hostel by August 7 or pay a “modest room rent” of Rs. 100 per day. In a resolution passed by the Staff Association of St. Stephen’s College, it expressed shock and dismay at the “inconsiderate notice.” The step defied logic and was grossly unethical, especially in the pandemic situation, the association said. “It is not proper for the principal to treat the hostel facility in an educational institution as analogous to the facility of a cloak room in a railway station or an airport” the resolution read. The association also claimed that the fee was double of what was charged in normal situation, and that no such fee was ever charged from students in the past for keeping their luggage in the college during vacations. It also termed the urgency of the move, reportedly to get rooms ready for the next batch, “beyond comprehension” as the hostel facility was unlikely to be used in the near future, given the university was yet to reopen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/st-stephens-staffers-want-withdrawal-of-rent-notice/article32245349.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) O.P. Mishra said the accused — Arvind Dhingra — is a resident of South Extension and was arrested on Thursday. A complaint about him was submitted by Administrator General & Official Trustee of Government of India, Sanjay Dewan. False will The accused created a false will of Krishna Khanna dated January 23, 2014 and forged it to grab her properties — worth more than Rs. 20 crores and a fixed deposit of Rs. 50lakh. Khanna from East of Kailash was admitted to Max Hospital with heart problems and died on January 24. She owned properties situated at prime locations in Delhi and left no legal heir behind her. “The accused conspired to grab the properties as it would have gone to the State,” the officer said. During investigation, it was revealed that a court case was under way and an application to release the original will was filed before the court.

01 August 2020||New Delhi,||HC asks Tihar jail authorities to consider TV for inmates||The High Court on Friday asked the prison authorities to consider putting up a television outside a high-security ward in Tihar for the inmates, saying it was a request which would not affect their budget. An HC Bench said, “They are not asking for heaven and sky. They are not asking for anything costly which would affect the prison budget. It is not such a big demand at all”. The court told Delhi government additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan to take instructions on the issue and inform it on the next date of hearing on August 7. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), in its plea, has claimed that the inmates of high-risk wards are kept in isolation and in prevailing situation of the pandemic, they have no contact with anyone from the outside world, leaving them upset. It has contended that in the present scenario, recreational facilities like television are necessary for such inmates to survive. “How many times can an isolated person read books,” the DSGMC counsel said, adding that a TV can be put in the common area outside the ward and the remote need not be given to the inmates. The present application for recreational facilities for the high-risk prisoners, including terrorists, has been filed in a pending petition filed by DSGMC in 2018, highlighting the plight of such inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-asks-tihar-jail-authorities-to-consider-tv-for-inmates/article32245335.ece

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||HC rejects Ishrat Jahan’s plea against extension of probe in Delhi riots case||The Delhi High Court on Friday rejected the plea of former Congress municipal councillor Ishrat Jahan, arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots case, challenging a trial court’s order extending the time for completing probe by 60 more days. While dismissing the plea, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said there was “no illegality or perversity” in the trial court’s order. He said: “The trial court shall not get influenced by the observations made by this court while passing the order.” Ms. Jahan, who is also an advocate, said the FIRs registered do not ascribe any “overt act” or the specific role of violence to her, but the investigating agency has gone on to add sections under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against her. ‘Abuse of legal process’ In her petition filed through advocate Lalit Valecha, she said the application of the public prosecutor seeking extension of time to complete the investigation was “an abuse of the legal process as the same fails to make out any legal or factual basis that justifies the extension of time”. “This exercise is only to subvert and defeat the right of the petitioner to seek regular and statutory bail under the Cr.P.C.,” Mr. Valecha argued. The Delhi Police’s counsel opposed the plea contending that section 43D of the UAPA is a specific provision which prescribes for extended timelines for completion of investigation. “The proviso of Section 43-D of the Act stipulates that if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the period of 90 days, the court may if it is satisfied with the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said period of 90 days, extend the period upto 180 days,” Delhi Police’s counsel argued. Ms. Jahan was arrested on March 21 in a case registered by the Crime Branch in relation to the riots in north-east Delhi. She was remanded to police custody till April 5. Thereafter, she has been remanded to judicial custody. Subsequently, the case was transferred to Special Cell. During the course of investigation, the sections under UAPA were also invoked by the Special Cell in the case on April 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-rejects-ishrat-jahans-plea-against-extension-of-probe-in-delhi-riots-case/article32245351.ece

01 August 2020||Mumbai,||Pension for those jailed during Emergency scrapped||The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Friday scrapped the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led State government’s scheme of awarding pension to those arrested during the Emergency in 1975. A government resolution (GR) issued by the General Administration Department (GAD) said that the spread of COVID-19 has had serious impact on the State’s economy. Considering the deficit it will face due to lowered revenue collection, the State government has decided to stop pension to those imprisoned during Emergency. The scheme was launched in July 2018 under which over 3,000 beneficiaries were to get Rs. 10,000 per month under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) pension scheme. A Cabinet sub-committee under the then Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil had prepared a report and no proof or document was required except an affidavit saying the person had been jailed during Emergency to avail the pension. Several officials had subsequently raised questions on the authenticity of the beneficiaries and whether to continue spending around Rs. 40 crore every year on this. Soon after the MVA government assumed office in 2019, Congress minister Nitin Raut had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to scrap the pension scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pension-for-those-jailed-during-emergency-scrapped/article32245370.ece
01 August 2020||Mumbai,||Specify benefits for kin of frontline workers: HC||The Bombay High Court on Friday directed the Maharashtra government to specify what benefits it would extend to the kin of frontline workers who succumb to COVID-19. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Sarang Kotwal was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar seeking to waive off the post-graduate examination for MD and MS degrees. It also sought that members of medical fraternity succumbing to COVID-19 in line of duty be declared as martyrs and they be granted a worthy compensation package. Advocate Aparna Vhatkar appearing for Mr. Tirodkar told the court that the State must recognise the sacrifice made by frontline workers and declare them martyrs. To this the court replied, “The executive can take this decision. Why should judiciary do it? State or the Union can apply its mind.” The court then asked additional solicitor general Anil Singh if there is any provision for granting such titles. Mr. Singh said the Centre did not have any legal powers to grant such a title to civilians. Honours like Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan were all awards and not mere titles, the court said. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, informed the court that Maharashtra government had already issued a government resolution on April 11 saying the families of doctors and policemen, who die of COVID-19, would be given Rs. 50 lakh. He then said the State had also extended the benefit of the Centre’s Pradhanmantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, an insurance scheme, to several frontline workers. The judges then said that the benefits of the GR are not clear and directed the State to file a detailed affidavit by August 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/specify-benefits-for-kin-of-frontline-workers-hc/article32245372.ece

Mumbai suburbs, Pune, Solapur, Amaravati and Palghar districts have been chosen for the implementation of the scheme on an experimental basis, under which 40 children from various orphanages under the department will be selected. Those wanting to be foster parents can register online at the department’s commissionerate, which is based in Pune. Ms. Thakur said, “The department works towards ensuring a safe and secure house for the children living in orphanages. This new scheme can be an alternative to adoptions, and ensure that a child can develop mentally, physically and socially. The scheme may face difficulties and problems initially but I am confident that we will sort out all the problems.” She added that the scheme would ensure a safe family environment and a secure house for the children. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, orphaned children are taken care of in orphanages under the Women and Child Welfare department. Considering the child’s rights and possibility of overall development, they can either be adopted or come under the foster care scheme. Adoption is a permanent feature while under the same Act, sponsored guardianship can be offered as foster care. Foster care involves identifying sponsor for further development of a child and allowing him or her to live in a family environment approved by the committee. Women and Child Welfare commissioner Dr. Hrishikesh Yashod said they would focus on public awareness and outreach campaigns. “Increased awareness will lead to many families coming forward and be a part of the scheme,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-to-roll-out-foster-care-scheme/article32245369.ece

The accused claimed that they had connection with senior politicians and lured businessmen on the pretext of arranging hefty loans from politicians, who they said, “had black money”, on very low interest rates, said a senior police officer. During investigation, the accused confessed to having had cheated more than 30 people to the tune of Rs. 10 crore.

The victims had never met any politicians or officer-bearers, they said.

01 August 2020||Pune,||Maharashtra’s dairy farmers to intensify agitation from today||Hitting out at the Centre for its decision to import milk products from the United States in return for exporting generic medicines there, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) has called upon dairy farmers across Maharashtra to intensify the agitation from August 1, demanding higher milk prices and subsidies. On July 21, farmer outfits across the State including the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS), AIKS, and Sadabhau Khot’s Rayat Shetkari Sanghatana had staged a symbolic, day-long ‘milk agitation’. While Dairy Development Minister Sunil Kedar had assured that the Maharashtra government would soon come up with a scheme to redress their grievances, AIKS has alleged that no concrete proposals have been forthcoming from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “The MVA government seems to be apathetic towards the plight of dairy farmers. Hence, we have been left with no other alternative but to intensify the struggle from Saturday. Eleven other outfits along with AIKS will be agitating tomorrow. Preparations have already concluded in 23 districts of the State,” Ajit Nawale ofAIKS told The Hindu . The left-leaning outfit is expecting a robust response particularly in the districts of Nashik, Ahmednagar, and Thane. AIKS, as well as other outfits, have demanded that the State government give farmers a direct subsidy of Rs. 10 per litre of cow’s milk and that the Centre scrap its June 26 notification clearing imports of 10 lakh tonnes of milk powder at the expense of the unused stocks of the same lying in States all over the country. “The milk price [per litre of cow milk] before the lockdown was Rs. 35. That has come down to Rs. 17 per litre. The State must give a direct subsidy of Rs. 10 per litre to all milk producers so that their per litre price comes up to Rs. 30,” he said. Mr. Nawale further demanded that the Centre immediately rescind its decision to import milk and milk products from the U.S., given that several thousand tonnes of milk powder were lying unused in stocks in Maharashtra and elsewhere. “The Narendra Modi government’s move under U.S. pressure will destroy the livelihoods of dairy farmers all over India. It should not only roll back this decision but also grant an export subsidy of Rs. 50 per kg for the large stocks of milk powder that are lying in the godowns,” Mr. Nawale said. He said while the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government had earlier announced a scheme by which they had purchased 10 lakh litres of milk each day to give succour to dairy farmers, the initiative had benefited only a few big milk cooperatives. “The State’s initiative was limited to only 24% of the milk cooperatives while not helping the smaller milk farmers in any way,” Mr. Nawale said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtras-dairy-farmers-to-intensify-agitation-from-today/article32245529.ece
01 August 2020||JAFFNA,||TNA faces biggest test in post-war decade as Sri Lanka gears up for election||As Sri Lanka gears up for the August 5 parliamentary election, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) — the main grouping representing minority Tamils living in north and east — is facing its biggest test yet in its constituency, since the war ended a decade ago. Though the Tamils have repeatedly given a huge mandate to the TNA, whether in the 2013 Northern Provincial Council election or the parliamentary polls of 2015, the Alliance — which secured 16 seats in the 225-member Parliament in 2015 — is contesting this election amid what seems a growing disenchantment among voters. “No matter who gets elected nothing changes in our lives. We vote because it’s our duty, not in eager anticipation that our situation will get better,” said Yesudas Jenova, seated outside her small home just outside Pallai town in Kilinochchi district. Jaffna and Kilinochchi together form one of the two northern electoral districts, while Vanni — including Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya — is the other. Ms. Jenova’s sentiment, echoed by many across the Northern Province, stems from many reasons. Eleven years after coming out of a war that resulted in huge losses to life and property, the Tamil community is still demanding justice and greater political powers that much of the Sinhala polity does not want devolved to them. The TNA bears the additional baggage of the failed promises of the previous Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government that it backed, especially on delivering a constitutional settlement. Meanwhile, the Tamils’ economic distress has only grown, with governments in Colombo and their own TNA-led Northern Provincial Council failing to revive a war-ravaged economy by creating jobs and livelihoods. Registering their disappointment over the TNA’s governance record in the north, they gave a sizeable vote to candidates from the competing Eelam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) in the 2018 local authority polls. Perhaps recognising this criticism and uncertainty of the Rajapaksa administration delivering a convincing political solution, the TNA for the first time prominently included development and livelihoods in its manifesto. However, for northern voters, who unambiguously rejected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in last year’s presidential polls, making up their mind isn’t as simple this time. Fragmented polity To start with, the general election comes during a pandemic that has forced all parties into a muted campaign. Further, the choices before voters are from a fragmented Tamil polity whose members speak varying degrees of Tamil nationalist politics. The divisions are on all sides. On the one hand is the TNA, which is witnessing heightened tensions within, seen in the vitriol targeting some contestants, and facing an increasingly sceptical electorate. On the other are critics of the TNA, including former Northern Province Chief Minister and retired Supreme Court judge C.V. Wigneswaran, who broke away from the Alliance, and the ACTC, led by lawyer-politician Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam — both known to have some support in urban Jaffna — who are contesting separately, as different camps. Vying for the same parliamentary seats in the north-east are politicians aligned to the Rajapaksas’ ruling party, such as EPDP leader Douglas Devananda, a Cabinet Minister in the Rajapaksa administration with a traditional support base in Jaffna and the islands off the peninsula, and Angajan Ramanathan of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Past and present While navigating this political landscape, voters are thinking about both their long-standing demand for political rights, justice and accountability, as well as their pressing everyday concerns over land, housing, joblessness and indebtedness. And to them, neither is less important. A range of voter concerns came to the fore at a pocket meeting where a union of hairdressers in Jaffna met prominent TNA contestant and former Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran, near Valvettithurai, the birthplace of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. In the nearly 30 minute-long meeting, union members quizzed the former MP mostly about the TNA’s bargaining power in the south, India’s “waning influence”, prospects for federalism, and Mr. Sumanthiran’s position on the armed struggle that his critics had widely criticised following a recent interview. “We would like the TNA to remain united as one force and represent us,” said A. Udayasankar, president of the federation of hairdressers’ unions, voicing a view more trusting of TNA’s capacity for national politics. Seated with a group from Thondaimanaru town, a young man asked the TNA contestant why the Alliance, which holds considerable power in the local body, could not lay roads in the area despite repeated appeals. “When our own Tamil leadership is unable to address our basic needs, how can we expect the Sinhala political leadership to deliver on larger issues?” asked S. Brindan, a student of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tna-faces-biggest-test-in-post-war-decade-as-sri-lanka-gears-up-for-election/article32245063.ece
01 August 2020||Washington,||U.S. demands action over killing of citizen in Pakistan||The United States on Thursday demanded action over the killing of a U.S. citizen inside a Pakistani court as he faced blasphemy charges, saying it had warned Islamabad about his safety. The State Department said it was “shocked, saddened and outraged” by the killing of Tahir Ahmad Nasim, a member of the minority Ahmadiyya community who it said was a U.S. citizen who had been lured to Pakistan from his home in Illinois. Nasim was arrested in 2018 on allegations of blasphemy. He was being escorted by police on Wednesday to start his trial in the northern city of Peshawar when a man opened fire with a pistol, killing him on the spot, according to officials. “The U.S. government has been providing consular assistance to Mr. Nasim and his family since his detention in 2018 and has called the attention of senior Pakistani officials to his case to prevent the type of shameful tragedy that eventually occurred,” State Department spokesman Cale Brown said. “We urge Pakistan to immediately reform its often abused blasphemy laws and its court system, which allow such abuses to occur, and to ensure that the suspect is prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” he said. Persecuted sect The Ahmadiyya have long faced violence in Pakistan, which forbids community members from self-identifying as Muslims. The sect, which is rooted in the subcontinent and shuns violence, is considered heretical by many orthodox Muslims for challenging the Islamic belief that Mohammed was God’s final messenger. Up to 80 people are known to be imprisoned in Pakistan on blasphemy charges, half of whom face life in prison or the death penalty, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The State Department has put Pakistan on a blacklist over religious freedom, pointing to the blasphemy cases. In Peshawar, senior police officer Mansur Amaan said authorities were investigating how the attacker managed to get his hands on a firearm inside a courtroom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-demands-action-over-killing-of-citizen-in-pakistan/article32245064.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Is Trump empowered to delay the election?||U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday triggered a new controversy by suggesting that the November elections be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history... Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” he tweeted. Though rumours were doing the rounds for some time, this was the first time Mr. Trump suggested that the elections should be postponed. Does he have the powers to do so? He doesn’t. According to the U.S. Constitution, it is Congress, not the President, that decides the timing of the elections. A federal law approved on January 25, 1845 has unambiguously set the election timing. “That the electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed in each State on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November of the year in which they are to be appointed,” states the law, referring to the selection of the Electoral College. This falls on November 3 this year. It can be changed only by passing a new law, which needs the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and will be subject to legal challenges. The House is now controlled by the Democratic Party and the Senate by the Republicans. Senior leaders of both parties have dismissed Mr. Trump’s suggestion to postpone the election. What if it’s delayed? While the possibility of postponing the elections is very, very low, even if lawmakers agree to change the date, in the event of a bigger crisis, Mr. Trump can’t continue in the White House beyond his stipulated term. President Trump’s first term is set to expire at noon on January 20, 2021. The 20th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the President and the Vice-President from March 4 to January 20. These dates cannot be changed. Ordinarily, if the presidency is vacant, the Vice-President assumes charge. But here, the terms of both President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence will expire on January 20. The House Speaker is the next in the line of succession. But the two-year term of the current House expires on January 3, 2021. So, Speaker Nancy Pelosi cannot assume the presidency. The next in the line is the ‘president pro tempore’ of the Senate, largely a ceremonial position. According to Article 1, Section Three of the Constitution, the Vice-President is the president of the Senate, and the Senate should choose a president pro tem to act in the absence of the Vice-President. Currently, senior Republican Chuck Grassley is the president pro tem. But if elections are not held in November (in which 23 Republican Senate seats and 12 Democrat seats are up for grabs), the current equation of the Senate would change. The Democrats would have a majority and they could elect a new president pro tem. Voting by mail If elections are held in November, a record number of Americans are expected to vote by mail due to the COVID-19 crisis. Most States have said that registered voters must request for a ballot in the mail or cast their votes in person. Independent researchers have debunked the voter fraud theories. States can adopt different measures such as barcodes to track the ballots (the voter can also track his or her ballot) and conduct post-election audits. Studies have also pointed out that in States like Washington, which vote almost entirely by mail, no major frauds were reported in the past. President Trump has not offered any evidence to his claims either.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-trump-empowered-to-delay-the-election/article32245067.ece
01 August 2020||Kabul,||Three-day Afghan Id truce begins||Afghans offered prayers marking the Muslim festival of Id al-Adha on Friday as a three-day ceasefire between Taliban and government forces began, with many hoping the truce will lead to peace talks. A car bomb that killed at least 17 people in the country’s east just hours before the ceasefire started underlined the scale of the challenge that lies ahead, although the Taliban denied any involvement. The halt in fighting is slated to last for the duration of Id and is only the third official truce in nearly 19 years of war. As the ceasefire commenced, hundreds of worshippers went to mosques across the capital where they were patted down by armed guards before going inside. Beginning peace talks President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban have both signalled that peace talks could begin straight after Id, and there are widespread calls for the warring parties to extend the ceasefire. Under a deal signed by the Taliban and the U.S. in February, “intra-Afghan” talks were slated to start in March, but were delayed amid political infighting in Kabul and as a contentious prisoner exchange dragged on. That swap will see Kabul free 5,000 Taliban fighters, while the insurgents claimed late on Thursday they had fulfilled their pledge of freeing 1,000 government forces. In a speech, Mr. Ghani said another 500 prisoners will be released in a bid to “accelerate the peace talks.” However, the 500 inmates are not on the original list of 5,000. Authorities have released 4,600 of those prisoners but are hesitating over the final 400, deeming them too dangerous.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/three-day-afghan-id-truce-begins/article32245059.ece

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||In Assam, a trail of broken barriers||Rabindra Hajong had sensed trouble the evening before when he saw muddy water threatening to overtop the road to Lakhipur town, about 165 km west of Guwahati. Lakhipur is the headquarters of Lakhipur Revenue Circle in western Assam’s Goalpara district, sandwiched between Meghalaya and the Brahmaputra river. In about nine hours since Hajong raised the alarm, a 50 ft-wide body of water erased a culvert and portions of the road at Sigri near Lakhipur and rushed toward Dhamor Reserve about 2 km away. It took moments for about 95% of some 800 houses to be submerged early morning. Floods in Assam come in waves dictated by the rivers. What hit Dhamor Reserve village on May 25 was a mini tsunami from the hills of Meghalaya. “Most of us did not sleep that night. We had packed our important documents and other valuables and tried to keep them above the water level before we could move to safety or be rescued,” says Hajong, the Dhamor Gram Panchayat president. But they could not save their most precious asset — the harvest-ready paddy they had toiled over for almost six months. “We are used to floods, but the water level in the past used to rise gradually. That gave us enough time to reap the paddy and store it for the year ahead. We did not suffer as much in 1998 when Assam experienced bad floods,” says Sujit Hajong, a farmer whose crop on four bighas of land was destroyed. The Hajong community was settled in Dhamor Reserve as refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan in 1964-66. Each family has an average of three bighas of land for farming. “Goalpara saw flash floods in 2014 and earlier, but in the eastern part bordering the North Garo Hills district of Meghalaya in areas along three tributaries of the Brahmaputra. The devastation this time came to the western part following a cloudburst in Meghalaya’s West Garo Hills. Some 50-odd villages of Lakhipur Circle bore the brunt. We hardly had time to react but rescue personnel did a fast job of taking the marooned to safety, some of them to a relief camp,” says Varnali Deka, Goalpara’s Deputy Commissioner. The villagers did not have to stay away from their submerged houses for long; the water subsided in four days. They returned home only to be caught in an inundating ‘wave’ on July 6. The cause of their misery this time was a breach in the 37 km-long Kharmuja-Nichinpur dyke that was expected to protect Dhamor Reserve and scores of other villages from the fury of the Brahmaputra. The fluctuating water level has since made 262 of Dhamor Reserve’s 2,861 people stay on at the Baungaon Lower Primary School, a relief camp by the roadside. The others made their own arrangement or took shelter at the houses of relatives on highlands. Refugees again At Ghoshpara-Sahapara village about 5 km southwest of Baungaon, betel leaf trader Madhab Saha had raised his semi-concrete house by one metre after a “not-so-damaging” flood 13 years ago. The “safe height” did not insure his house and those of 71 neighbours from the dyke breach at Chilarvita, an average of 8 km northwest of both Ghoshpara-Sahapara and Dhamor Reserve. Kharmuja-Nichinpur is one of two Brahmaputra dykes or B-dykes that Assam’s Water Resources Department (WRD) manages in Goalpara district. The other one is 2 km long for the protection of Goalpara town. The department also handles four embankments on three tributaries in the district. According to WRD officials, newly constructed barriers to keep rivers in check are embankments while the older ones needing repairs and periodic maintenance are dykes. “We expected to stay in this relief camp for a week at most, not for almost a month,” says Madhab’s wife Uma Saha at Lakhipur’s Nidanpur Sabita Adarsha Prathamik Vidyalaya, where anganwadi workers keep her two children engaged in pre-school activities. The plight of relief workers and service providers is no different from the inmates of the camps. The Baungaon school’s anganwadi worker Durgabati Das wades 2 km from her house, now shin-deep in water, every day “for the relief camp children who need to be in good spirits”. The Lakhipur house of Samin-uz-Zaman, an accountant with the Integrated Child Development Scheme, is in knee-deep water. Lakhipur’s anganwadi supervisor Sukurana Begum is luckier; the flood spared her elevated house but not her surroundings. All of them had raised their houses after the 1998 flood level they thought would be difficult to surpass. The devastation in Lakhipur Circle happened that year because of a breach in the same dyke at Haguripara, about 6 km east of Chilarvita where the Brahmaputra tore off a section of the dyke on July 6. Sahabuddin Mondal, former Gram Panchayat president of Haguripara, recalls how the 1998 breach changed the area comprising five villages forever. “These were revenue villages famous for growing quality paddy, oilseeds, pulses and vegetables. Merchants used to drive to Haguripara from far for bulk-buying. The 1998 flood turned the villages into smaller, disconnected chars (river sandbars). Some 80% of the once-prosperous farmers turned daily-wagers in far-flung areas while some families relocated elsewhere in Goalpara and other districts,” he says. From 150 bighas of farmland two decades ago, Mondal and his six brothers now own about 10 bighas. He has to use a boat to travel to the ‘mainland’ almost throughout the year. But they are “still better off” than other Bhatias – Bengal-origin Muslims – who relocated to districts such as Darrang and Bongaigaon only to end up being suspected as ‘Bangladeshis’ and served ‘D-voter’ (doubtful voter) notices. Election Commission officials mark people they suspect to be foreigners as D-voters who are then referred to Foreigners’ Tribunals for ascertaining their citizenship. The five villages under Haguripara Gram Panchayat have about 7,000 people now. Mondal says some 30% of the nearly 6,000 who relocated are  yet to be cleared of the D-voter tag for inclusion in the updated National Register of Citizens. The rest of those who relocated and all those who stayed back made it to the register. The Haguripara script of 1998 is now playing out for Chilarvita and the adjoining villages under the Tarangapur Gram Panchayat. “A channel of the Brahmaputra was 25 metres from the dyke. The rising river first eroded a 150-metre stretch and suddenly about 2 km of it was gone, washing away more than 350 houses in the nearest village,” says Tarangapur Gram Panchayat secretary Abu Bakker Siddique. “These villages began turning into chars a few years ago. The process has perhaps been completed this year to force more people to live on the mathauri (dyke) for the rest of their lives,” he adds. Flood-prone farmers are not the only ones to have undergone a change of fate in Lakhipur area, says Goalpara’s veterinary officer Nurul Islam. “Most members of Nagendra Narayan Choudhury, the British-era zamindar of Lakhipur, have relocated outside,” he says. Some amount of flood, he insists, has traditionally been necessary for recharging the soil of Lakhipur circle. “But things are getting too unpredictable, erratic and damaging,” he says. Blame it on the embankments Lakhipur is not the only part of Assam to have suffered from brittle embankments. Data provided by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) say 220 embankments were damaged or breached this time. Officials admit this has been a major factor in 56.71 lakh people being affected and in the death of 108 people across 30 of Assam’s 33 districts between May 22 and July 30. “The intensity, damage and death in the last two decades have been proportional to the breaching of embankments, and it is getting worse every year,” says Partha Jyoti Das, who heads the water, climate and hazard programme of Guwahati-based NGO Aaranyak. “This also indicates how the entire flood management is heavily dependent on ad hoc embankments.” For instance, 64 people died and 39.81 lakh were affected in 2016 when 26 embankments were damaged. In 2018, 25 embankments were damaged, 45 were killed and 13.22 lakh affected. Das says planners and engineers laid the “foundation of disaster” with the dyke-oriented National Policy for Flood four years after the great earthquake of 1950 that affected the courses of some major rivers. No time, energy or resources were spent on studying the hydrological, geo-morphological and climatic conditions of the rivers as the embankments came up all over. The embankments outlived their utility and began collapsing from the 1990s, rapidly by the turn of the millennium. There was patchwork maintenance of the old dykes, and agencies other than the WRD began building embankments haphazardly without any scientific input. “The British colonialists began building elitist embankments in eastern Assam to protect their tea gardens, oil wells and urban settlements more than a century ago. Post-Independence, Assam continued with this idea that kept hitting the marginalised hard. In course of time, it became an embankment economy embellished with a dam economy in the upstream of rivers and a dredging economy for increasing the depth of the rivers without studying their silting nature,” says Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, researcher at Delhi’s Institute of Chinese Studies, who has been working on the sociological impact of river and flood management in Assam. The Brahmaputra Board, formed in 1980 to “integrate management of flood and basins of interstate and international rivers in the northeast”, came up with the idea of building big storage dams to contain the rivers upstream. High-volume discharge of water from hydropower dams in Arunachal Pradesh and Bhutan during the monsoon season has added to Assam’s flood problems. The “engineering ego” that dissuades planners from seeking scientific inputs and makes them ignore traditional knowledge of living with floods has not only complicated disaster management but also the adaptability of locals to changing conditions, Rahman says. “The Mising community, for instance, has lived in the flood-prone areas of eastern Assam for ages, the water level never reaching the floor of their elevated houses on wooden stilts. They could predict floods until the embankments affected their survival skills. Many don’t have a clue about the fast-changing moods of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, leading to the desertification of large swathes of hitherto fertile flood plains,” he says. Hydrologists point out that while the emphasis has been on building dyke after dyke, often to save one from the other, no thought has been given to how to properly drain water from the floodplains. “One has to understand that floods also happen because excess water cannot recede from the floodplains in time due to obstructions such as roads, embankments, unplanned human habitations, excessive sand and gravel mining and encroachment or blocking of wetlands, streams and channels,” says Das. Ironically, some of Assam’s leading centres for ecological studies are built on reclaimed wetlands. They include the Gauhati University, Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Consequently, wetlands that once acted as “sponges” for absorbing excess water have been under pressure. They include Deepor Beel, a Ramsar Site on the western edge of Guwahati whose area has shrunk from 4,000 hectares to 500 hectares in two decades. According to Rahman, one of the reasons for the obsession with inherently-flawed embankments is their profitability. “Floods actually mean a lot of money to a lot of people and many feed off the contractor lobby,” he alleges. It is high time, says Das, for discourses on long-term strategies that are not based on putting up barriers in a bid to tame rivers and make them flow in a straight line instead of letting them meander at will. After the flood devastation across eastern India in 2004, the Centre had set up a Task Force that made several recommendations such as community-based management of dykes. These were soon forgotten. “No amount of planning can succeed unless we discuss river basins, encompassing in the case of the Brahmaputra the catchments in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Tibet and other north-eastern States. For that, we have to first ensure inter-district cooperation in Assam, go on to coordinated measures involving the neighbouring States, and then think of international collaboration. We must also be ready to spend time on research and development and wait 10-15 years for alternative plans to be in place,” he says. But when a temporary solution like an embankment becomes accepted as a permanent one, the government should invest in stronger and durable protection systems, he adds. Lessons from the past Through a Right to Information application, the Society for Socio-Economic Development had found that the cumulative length of embankments was 4,459 km till 2007 and 93.5% of them had been constructed before 1980. The official length now is 4,474.42 km comprising 423 embankments, 295 of which have outlived their lifespan. But WRD officials say they are invariably blamed for embankments built by departments such as Soil Conservation and Agriculture as well as Panchayat and Rural Development that dole out projects under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). In Goalpara, for instance, about 15 km each of embankments along the banks of both the Krishnai and Dudhnoi rivers were done under MGNREGS. “Of the 220-odd embankments that were damaged this time, 48 had breached including 17 of ours. Some of these were plugged.. The problematic embankments are usually the ones done locally without adhering to certain specifications and not maintained,” says a senior WRD officer in Guwahati. “The specifications include using cohesive, good-quality soil that can withstand water pressure, proportionate riverside and countryside slopes from the crest of an embankment that is up to 7.5 metres wide for major rivers and 4.5 metres for tributaries,” says Asad Hussain, WRD’s assistant executive engineer in Goalpara. But things are moving in the right direction, the government claims. There are discussions about inter-departmental synergy in handling conventional methods of flood mitigation. Officials say they have been focussing on research and development in addition to execution of flood management work and collection of hydro-meteorological data. The conversion of a River Research Station of 1958 vintage to the Assam Water Research and Management Institute is an example, as are activities such as geo-technical exploration and investigation, hydrological modelling, physical identification of soil samples and grain size analysis. ASDMA’s chief executive officer M.S. Manivannan says Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has sought restoration of all embankments with technical support from the WRD. “The government has proposed to the Centre the strengthening of the entire length of embankments for use as roads,” he says. The government has also sanctioned the formation of a committee to study how floods happen, how to go about managing them, and how to mitigate an issue that “cannot be stopped” given Assam’s geographical position – largely low-lying and surrounded by the hills of Meghalaya, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram from where the rivers flow down. “Fresh ideas have gone into flood mitigation. Child-friendly spaces in relief camps, in coordination with UNICEF, were made compulsory at every relief camp this time along with guidelines for maintaining COVID-19 protocols. Such spaces are helping lessen the stress that displaced children undergo,” Manivannan says. “We are planning for the years ahead too. We have decided to set up material banks strategically at flood-prone places to store emergency items. The materials include life jackets, 150 of which have been ordered, for use by flood-affected people. We have put up a Bailey bridge on the road near Lakhipur where the flashflood from Meghalaya washed away a culvert on May 25,” he says. The Bailey bridge, provided from the State Disaster Response Fund, was put in place by the Public Works Department (Roads) in 10 days. For the locals, the Bailey bridge was a throwback to the British era when the spot sported a steel bridge that was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1980.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Diluting the EIA process spells a path of no return||On July 12, Fridays for Future India (FFF), a collective of young environmental campaigners, received a notice from the Delhi police that accused it of committing offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Its alleged crime: “sending too many emails” to the Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar, with subjects tagged “EIA 2020”. Over the last few weeks, the FFF has organised a sustained protest against a proposed new notification, which aims to replace the existing model of conducting environmental impact assessments (EIA) in India. The notice the group received claimed that the campaign’s details published on its website contained “objectionable contents” and constituted “unlawful activities or terrorists act[s]” which were “dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of India”. Even though the notice was eventually withdrawn, after the police cited a “clerical” error, that the country’s anti-terror law can be invoked with such facile ease is a shuddering thought. But equally this must also make us wonder what it is about the FFF’s campaign that drew such ire out of the government. Is the new draft EIA policy so critical to the state’s programme that even the slightest acts of dissent are to be quashed with maximum force? The wreckages of COVID-19, one would have thought, would have given the government a chance to reassess what its goals towards climate justice ought to be. After all, the pandemic has had a searing effect on how we lead our lives. It has altered our relationships not only with each other but also with the environment. During this time, the decades of pitiful investment in public health and education have clearly been brought to the fore, as has the fragility of our basic infrastructure. But the responses to the crisis seem to mirror the failures of the past: the more that goes wrong, the more we want to do the same things again, as though all that we desire is a return to a pre-pandemic status quo. What we do not seem to understand is that the supposed normality that we are craving does not mean that there are no fresh disasters ahead. And those disasters, as every sign demonstrates, are likely to be all the more catastrophic unless we contend with the deplorable neglect that we have shown towards the environment. It is time we recognised, as Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker , that “normal is the enemy”. Culture of disregard Yet, the proposed new EIA policy symbolises a rush to restore society to where it was before COVID-19 halted its motor of progress. The draft notification takes an already inadequate system and seeks to infuse into it a culture of disregard. It is almost as though, to the state, the global climate emergency is operating in a parallel universe of its own. Around the world, legislative interventions mandating EIAs began to burgeon in the late 1960s. The basic credo of these measures was to ensure that the state had at its possession a disinterested analysis of any development project and the potential impact that it might have on the environment. It took India, though, until 1994 before it notified its first set of assessment norms, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. This policy mandated that projects beyond a certain size from certain sectors — such as mining, thermal power plants, ports, airports and atomic energy — secure an environmental clearance as a precondition to their commencement. But the notification, subject as it was to regular amendments, proved a failure. Abandoning rigour In 2006, a new EIA programme was conceived, ironically on the back of corporate pressure. There was a belief that the 1994 system hindered speedy growth. The new draft attempted to decentralise the process. It increased the number of projects that required an environmental clearance, but also created appraisal committees at the level of both the Centre and States, the recommendations of which were made a qualification for a sanctioning. What is more, the programme also mandated that pollution control boards hold a public hearing to glean the concerns of those living around the site of a project. But, in practice, the 2006 notification also proved regressive. The course remained mired in opacity. The final EIA report, for example, was not made available to the public; the procedure for securing clearances for certain kinds of projects was accelerated; and there was little scope available for independent judicial review. When clearances were challenged, the courts treated the views of the assessment authorities as sacrosanct. In the process, EIAs, far from serving as a bulwark for environmental justice, came to be regarded as a mere inconvenience, as a bureaucratic exercise that promoters of a project had to simply navigate through. Now, as we find ourselves amidst not just a pandemic but also a global climate emergency, it is hard not to despair at the nature of changes that we need to make, to not merely our laws and regulations, but also to how we lead our lives. Yet, the government is on a warpath to further weaken an already fragile system. As many campaigners have highlighted, the new draft is riddled with problems. It enables a sweeping clearance apparatus to a number of critical projects that previously required an EIA of special rigour; where some industries require expert appraisal under the existing 2006 notification, they will, under the new notification, be subject to less demanding processes. These include aerial ropeways, metallurgical industries, and a raft of irrigation projects, among others. Damaging fundamental tenets What is more, the new proposal does nothing to strengthen the expert appraisal committees on which so much responsibility is reposed, leaving the body rudderless. It also does away with the need for public consultation for a slew of different sectors, negating perhaps a redeeming feature of the 2006 notification. But, most egregiously, the proposal opens up a window for securing post-facto clearances. That is, companies which have commenced a project without a valid certificate will be allowed to regularise their operations by paying a fine. If there is a singular logic to the EIA process, it is that an environmental clearance is a prerequisite to the launching of a project. But here the government wants to reverse that fundamental tenet. There is no doubt that a mere strengthening of the existing EIA norms will not by itself be sufficient. We need a renewed vision for the country; one that sees the protection of the environment as not merely a value unto itself but as something even more foundational to our democracy. To that end, we must begin to imagine a future where, as the American law professor, Jedediah S. Purdy, argues, our ecological and egalitarian projects can fuse together. For this to happen, though, we have to see ourselves as not distinct from the environment that we live in, but as an intrinsic part of it. Under such a model, our economic solutions will have to necessarily subsume a commitment to our natural surroundings. To achieve this broader vision we will need deeper thinking, greater political initiative, and a leap of faith. But, in the meantime, to allow the government to weaken the EIA process has the potential to make things irredeemable. And here, Wendell Berry’s words are worth recalling: “Whether we and our politicians know it or not, nature is party to all our deals and decisions,” and it “has more votes, a longer memory, and a sterner sense of justice than we do.” Suhrith Parthasarathy is an advocate practising at the Madras High Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/diluting-the-eia-process-spells-a-path-of-no-return/article32245052.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The COVID-19 crisis as a metropolitan battle||COVID-19 has brought in unprecedented challenges to India’s metropolitan cities, yet again highlighting their limited capabilities to self-govern. India’s top metropolitan cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad — now account for nearly half of the country’s cases of COVID-19. No governance architecture This fallout has an obvious public health angle. India’s public health expenditure in 2018 was a mere 1.28% of GDP. According to the World Bank, India’s out-of-pocket health expenditure was 62.4% in 2017, while the world average was 18.2%. Additionally, manpower in the health sector is low with India’s doctor-population ratio being 1:1,457 which is lower than the World Health Organisation norm of 1:1,000. Complimenting an inequitable public health system is a larger governance issue. Governance has a bearing not just on the response to COVID-19 but also in preparedness for other natural and man-made disasters and contingencies. Specific systemic factors underlying city governance include spatial planning, municipal capacities, empowered mayors and councils and inter-agency coordination, and ward-level citizen participation. Twenty-seven years have passed since the enactment of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, but these reform agendas continue to be on slow burn.  Lack of robust integrated spatial planning: The Constitution mandates formation of Metropolitan Planning Committees (MPCs) in all metropolitan areas with a million-plus population. MPCs are envisioned to ensure integrated planning for the entire metropolitan area, and are responsible for the preparation of draft development plans, synthesising priorities set by local authorities, State and Central governments. In reality, MPCs are either not constituted or are defunct. Janaagraha’s Annual Survey of India’s City-Systems (ASICS) 2017 report found that only nine out of 18 cities assessed had constituted MPCs even if on paper. The absence of comprehensive integrated planning is starkly visible in the COVID-19 crisis. Poor housing, sanitation, and a lack of access to meaningful social security are a reality for the urban poor. Only medium- to long-term spatial planning that focuses on equal access to opportunities and services can avoid a repeat of such disasters.  Weak municipal capacities: India’s metropolitan cities have weak capacities in finance and staffing. Bengaluru’s average percentage of own revenue to total expenditure is 47.9%, Chennai 30.5%, Mumbai 36.1% and Kolkata at 48.4%. According to ASICS 2017, Mumbai has the highest number of officers per lakh population at 938. However, this is abysmally low compared to global cities such as Johannesburg with 2,922 officers and New York with 5,446 officers per lakh population. COVID-19 resurfaces the poor capacity of municipalities in delivering infrastructure and services, and managing disasters; highlighting the urgency to bolster the capability of municipalities to self-govern.  Need for authority Weak mayor and council and fragmentation of governance: The leaders steering India’s metropolitan cities are toothless. No big metropolitan cities with 10 million-plus population has a directly-elected Mayor. Mumbai’s Mayor has a tenure of 2.5 years, Delhi and Bengaluru, a mere one year. Furthermore, Mayors do not have full decision-making authority over critical functions of planning, housing, water, environment, fire and emergency services in most cases. Our metropolitan cities are far from being local self-governments. Parastatal agencies for planning, water and public transport report directly to State governments. The State government also largely controls public works and police. It is imperative that citizens are able to hold one political authority accountable in the city, and that political authority cannot be the Chief Minister or the State government.  Transparency, accountability and citizen participation: Transparent cities with institutional platforms encouraging citizen participation have significant bearing on urban democracy. No metropolitan has functional ward committees and area sabhas. An absence of citizen participation is worsened by poor transparency in finance and operations. As per ASICS 2017, India’s big metropolitan cities on average score 3.04/10 in transparency, accountability and participation. Decentralised citizen participation platforms are critical in identifying beneficiaries to provide aid, co-opting communities for contact tracing, adoption of safety precautions, enforcing quarantine, recruiting volunteers, and collaborating with civil society organisations to battle the pandemic.  Look at smaller cities too A World Bank report notes that despite the emergence of smaller towns, the underlying character of India’s urbanisation is “metropolitan”, with new towns emerging around existing large cities. According to a McKinsey report, in 2012, 54 metropolitan cities and their hinterlands accounted for 40% of India’s GDP, and by 2025, 69 metropolitan cities, combined with their hinterlands, will generate over half of India’s incremental GDP between 2012 and 2025. Despite this, India is yet to begin an active discourse on cohesive metropolitan governance frameworks.  COVID-19 is primarily a metropolitan battle; and, owing to their size and complexities, come with a higher scale of challenges and opportunities. Studies by the Centre for Policy Research point that India’s spatial feature exhibits the growth of small towns beyond the economics of large agglomerations. This indicates that while India’s urban vision should focus on its metropolitan cities to reap the benefit of scale, it shouldn’t ignore smaller cities. Globally, metropolitan cities are steered by a directly-elected leader, with robust mechanisms to reduce fragmentation in governance. Evolved examples include the Tokyo metropolitan government, and recent experimental models such as combined authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia. India needs home-grown solutions suited to its context and political realities, while imbibing lessons on institutional design from global examples. The challenges posed by COVID-19 offer a glimpse into various other future threats of climate change, natural disasters, etc. which will further strain Indian cities. It is time the Central and State governments lead efforts towards a metropolitan governance paradigm. The first steps should include empowered Mayors with five-year tenure, decentralised ward level governance, and inter-agency coordination anchored by the city government. India should use the current pandemic as an opportunity to introspect and reform the way its metropolises are governed. V.R.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||War and talks||The Taliban’s decision to cease fire for three days during Id-ul-Adha has come as a relief for Afghans who have seen unabated violence despite a peace agreement between the insurgents and the U.S. This is the third official respite since the war started in 2001. In June 2018 and May this year, the Taliban had briefly ended hostilities to mark the end of the holy month of Ramzan. On both occasions, it refused to extend the ceasefire, returning to war as soon as the celebrations were over. This time, however, hopes are high that the truce could be extended as Kabul and the insurgents are preparing to launch the intra-Afghan talks that were promised in the U.S.-Taliban deal. According to the pact, talks were to begin in March. But both sides failed to reach an agreement on prisoner exchange, which the U.S. had agreed with the Taliban. The insurgents complained that the government was not complying with the terms of the agreement, while officials of the Ashraf Ghani administration said the Taliban’s demands were unacceptable. Finally, President Ghani decided to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which was followed by the Taliban’s ceasefire announcement. Both sides have now agreed to kick-start talks after Id and they could do it in a peaceful environment if the ceasefire is extended. While the cessation of hostilities is welcome, there are underlying issues that continue to plague the peace process. When the U.S. entered into talks with the insurgent group, it did not insist on a ceasefire. So the Taliban continues to engage in war and talks simultaneously. Worse, the Americans, badly looking for a way out of the conflict, kept the Afghan government out of the peace process. After the U.S.-Taliban agreement was signed in February, according to which the U.S. agreed to pull out its troops in return for security assurances from the Taliban, the onus was on a weakened Afghan government to start talks even as the Taliban continued attacks. According to the government, 3,560 government troops and 775 civilians have been killed in conflict since the deal was signed. Also, infighting made matters worse for the government. Last year’s presidential election saw a record low turnout. The results, announced months later, were contested by the main Opposition candidate, Abdullah Abdullah, who formed a parallel administration. He backed off, but only after being appointed the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation that will lead talks with the Taliban. These factors allowed a resurgent Taliban to maintain the upper hand — in war and in talks. This will be the government’s key challenge when its representatives and that of the Taliban, which sees itself as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan and has not recognised the country’s Constitution, would be holding talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/war-and-talks/article32245048.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Towards a new normal||The Centre has announced further relaxations in the lockdown that began on March 25 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic although the numbers are unrelenting. The third phase will now take effect from August 5. At nearly 17 lakh, India stood third among countries with the highest number of cases; a third of these cases are currently active. With over 36,000 deaths, India’s case fatality rate of 2.16% is relatively low. The possibility of wider prevalence indicated in serology surveys in Delhi and Mumbai suggests that the death rate could be even lower than current estimations. The disease spread has been uneven within the country. The responses of States and cities have also remained inconsistent. Along with the number of cases, overworked health-care professionals experiencing fatigue and the public showing impatience with restrictions are also on the rise. This is not a pleasant mix of circumstances, and utmost vigil must continue. By now, it is also evident that complete lockdowns that disrupt economic activities cannot be sustained over long periods of time. Gyms and yoga centres, but not educational institutions, metro rail, and large gatherings, will be allowed in the next phase. Movement of people and goods across borders will be easier as per the Centre’s guidelines. Random restrictions on movement such as those in Tamil Nadu, where an e-pass is required for intra- and inter-State travel, must now be done away with. As a vaccine or a cure is not yet visible, it is time the focus on adaptation got sharper. Though many questions about COVID-19 remain, certain measures are evidently helpful in managing the pandemic better and bringing fatalities down. The coming phase of unlocking must prepare the country for complete opening. For that, first of all, testing should be unlocked and made available on demand as close to home as possible. For those infected to not step out of home is a far superior measure in preventing spread, compared to inadequate mask usage. With most cases turning out to be asymptomatic, wider and cheaper availability of testing must be a thrust area for the government now. Easy, early diagnosis of infections, even when asymptomatic, will go a long way in containment. The concerns regarding increased dependence on rapid antigen tests in some places must be addressed. Second, real time epidemiological data should be unlocked. Just as weather data is freely available, and allows for cropping practice readjustments, disaggregated real time data enables micro-planning and localised behavioural response. The proclivity shown by some States and cities to conceal data has been self-defeating. Even official death counts do not match with the numbers available with other sources. There must be efforts to harvest accurate data, and with ease of availability. Normalcy, albeit a new one, could be reached faster with the right efforts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/towards-a-new-normal/article32245047.ece
01 August 2020||Southampton,||World champion stays winning||David Willey and Sam Billings guided World champion England to a six-wicket win over Ireland in the first One-Day International here on Thursday. Left-arm paceman Willey, appearing in his first ODI since being left out of England's World Cup-winning squad for Jofra Archer, took a career-best five for 30 as Ireland was dismissed for a modest 172 in a match that marked the return of white-ball cricket from the coronavirus lockdown. Setback But an unfamiliar-looking England slumped to 78 for four at the Ageas Bowl. Sam Billings, a late injury replacement for Joe Denly, made 67 not out, including 11 fours, at better than a run-a-ball. He shared an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 96 with World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan. Meanwhile, Denly has been ruled out of the series after suffering back spasms in training, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday. Liam Livingstone has replaced him for the remaining two ODIs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/world-champion-stays-winning/article32245166.ece

The panel will also pick names for the Dhyan Chand award, Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar (RKPP) and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad trophy. Record number With the ministry allowing self-application and extending the deadline during lockdown, a record number of entries have been received, with the SAI undertaking the arduous vetting process. As many as 42 people have applied for the Khel Ratna, 215 for Arjuna, 81 for Dhyan Chand, 137 for Dronacharya and around 30 institutions for the RKPP. Meanwhile, due to the pandemic, uncertainty remains over holding of the awards function at Rashtrapati Bhawan on August 29, the National Sports Day. While it is possible to convene a video conference of the selection committee members, hosting a function in these troubled times seems difficult, given the advisories pertaining to travel, quarantine and other restrictions in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sehwag-sardar-in-awards-panel/article32245172.ece

01 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||TTFI may do away with National-ranking meets||The Table Tennis Federation of India is contemplating deferring all National-ranking tournaments and focus only on three National championships separately for seniors, juniors and youth and sub-juniors and cadets for 2020-21 to ensure that the annual calendar doesn’t go blank, according to TTFI senior vice-president S.M. Sultan. Very difficult The Vijayawada-based Sultan informed The Hindu that it is next to impossible, as per the COVID-19 guidelines, to restrict the number of participants including officials to below 200 in national ranking events which otherwise normally feature about 1500 including players, support staff and technical staff during the five-day competitions. “Since it is not feasible now to have these National-ranking tournaments in all five zones of the country, TTFI President Dushyant Chautala took the initiative to plan these separate Nationals. And, there will be no inter-State events in the Senior Nationals,” he said. “These events may be held in January-February next year. Yes, the whole idea is to see that the year 2020-21 calendar doesn’t end without any National champion in both men and women sections.” “For these Nationals to be held in three different centres, we will also be restricting the number of entries and will not entertain any additional entries because of the current crisis” he said. “The State Associations are also being suggested to follow a similar pattern at State-level to field the State teams for the Nationals. “These are challenging times and we need to work as a team to rise to the occasion and come up with practical solutions to the crisis,” Sultan felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ttfi-may-do-away-with-national-ranking-meets/article32245403.ece
01 August 2020||KOLKATA,||‘Indians equipped for greater glory’||Elite women’s head coach Mohammed Ali Qamar wants boxers to take inspiration from Indians’ past performances to excel in future. Qamar, who was the first boxer from the country to win a Commonwealth Games gold (light flyweight) in Manchester, said yesteryear’s top performers always set a benchmark. Legacy “After I won the gold medal in 2002 (on August 1), Akhil Kumar did it in 2006 and others won it in following editions. Our boxers (Vijender Singh and Mary Kom) have won bronze at the Olympics. Now, we should try to change the colour,” Qamar told The Hindu . According to Qamar, Indians are better equipped now to achieve greater glory. “In 2002, we had only one doctor and the coaches. The biggest source of motivation for me was that the Government had raised the cash award from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh. “Getting a rousing reception like (the then India cricket captain) Sourav Ganguly on reaching Kolkata was unexpected, though. “There is no comparison between the facilities we had and what boxers today get. Now, there is a full team of support staff. “The boxers get supplements, sponsors and all sorts of backing. They have been winning medals everywhere. “It’s not a question of whether we can win medals, it’s whether we can win gold... We must raise our performance at the Olympics,” said Qamar. Nation before self While inspiring the boxers to go for Olympic medals, Qamar, who is overseeing the National camp at NIS Patiala, does not mind being away from his family on Eid al-Adha or skipping the twin celebrations on his son’s birthday. “My son’s birthday is on August 16. Every year, we celebrate my Commonwealth Games win and his birthday together. This time it is going to be different,” said Qamar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indians-equipped-for-greater-glory/article32245304.ece
01 August 2020||Mumbai,||‘Disappointing that IPL is not in India’||It has been five months since Steve Smith featured in an international match as the coronavirus-induced lockdown in the world of sport forced the cricketers into a long break. The IPL — starting on September 19 in the UAE — will mark the return of Smith along with other international stars. He is excited to lead the Rajasthan Royals again. Key message Smith understands that the conditions will be challenging, and adaptability will be the key. “The conditions in Dubai can be similar to what you get in India, or they could be different. It’s about adapting on the run. That’s going to be the key message for me and the coaching staff along the way as well,” said Smith, while interacting with a select group of media during the special screening of Inside Story: A Season with Rajasthan Royals — a documentary on the team. Six years ago, the first leg of the IPL was held in the UAE. Smith believes that this experience will help a few players. “Guys are going to be just jumping out of their skin to get in there and play some quality cricket. “It’s disappointing that the IPL is not in India, we would have absolutely loved to play there. But to get the tournament up and give everyone a chance to play, it’s amazing what has been going behind the scenes,” Smith said. Challenging times The past few months have been challenging for the cricketing fraternity but the situation is slowly getting better with players resuming training. “A lot of people have not played any cricket at all or had very little under their belts, so from that point of view, it’s an even contest. Everyone is going in with the same sort of preparation, which is nice. “It has, however, been incredibly difficult times and the boys are trying to get their cricket pitches anywhere possible,” said Smith. Before the IPL, the Australians will travel to England for a limited-overs series.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/disappointing-that-ipl-is-not-in-india/article32245168.ece

The other semifinal saw Anish Giri and Ian Nepomniachtchi sign peace after a marathon lasting 131 moves.   The results: Semifinals: Set One: Game One: Peter Svidler (Rus) lost to Magnus Carlsen (Nor); Anish Giri (Ned) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/carlsen-shows-his-class/article32245164.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Indian hockey players called for training||The extended break for Indian hockey players will finally end over the weekend. The men’s and women’s probables have been asked to report to the SAI Centre in Bengaluru by Monday (August 3). The 58-odd members of the core group — 33 men and 24 women — had started dispersing on June 18 in batches after being stuck for more than 100 days at the Sports Authority of India centre. They were initially supposed to return on July 19 but with increasing cases of COVID-19 and lockdown in the city, the break had been extended. “We had been told to be prepared for reporting any time after July 23 but there was no confirmation. Now we have got the official letter from SAI and we have to report by August 3 but actual camp will only start later because of safety protocols,” players said. With the federations de-recognised, arrangements and notifications are being done directly by SAI with the players making their own respective arrangements for travel. Actual training, however, will only begin later with the players and returning staff required to be in mandatory 14-day quarantine. Among the staff members, women’s chief coach Sjoerd Marijne and analytical coach Janneke Schopman are also expected to return on Sunday with Marijne tweeting late on Thursday night that he was waiting for a copy of his negative COVID test report before embarking for India. The men’s coaches had stayed back at SAI along with four players — three women and goalkeeper Suraj Karkera.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-hockey-players-called-for-training/article32245174.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The Festival of Sacrifice||Eid-ul-Zuha, the Festival of Sacrifice (Bakrid), is one of the two major festivals of Muslims. It falls in the month of Zilhaj, the last month of Islamic calendar. Eid-ul-Zuha commemorates Prophet Ibrahim’s (peace be upon him) willingness to sacrifice his son Hazrath Ismail on Allah’s command. Muslims believe that Allah wanted to test Prophet Ibrahim and directed him to sacrifice his son. It is during this period Muslims around the world undertake the annual Haj pilgrimage to the holy cities of Makkah and Madina. The first ten days of Zilhaj are considered the best days of the Islamic year. The ninth day of this month is the Day of ‘Arafah’, which is considered as the best day and the most powerful day in the entire year. It is on this day the Haj pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of Arafah, praying and supplication to their Allah. Arafah is the day on which Allah perfected Islam as a way of life and completed his favours upon Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). It is also a day of good deeds and striving in worship; a day of forgiveness, mercy and great bounty; a day when Allah saves people from the hell-fire. The Day of Arafah is also significant as a few verses of Holy Quran were revealed on this day. As per the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Muslims not performing Haj observe fast from dawn to dusk on the Arafah Day to get Allah’s forgiveness for their sins. The Prophet on fasting on the Day of Arafah said: “It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year.” This year’s Haj pilgrimage commenced on July 29.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Wenger’s , even in the new normal||I felt like a part of Picasso’s Blue Period — except that I was green — when a friend told me how he’d been spending his time. One day, he informed me with some glee, he’d visited Wenger’s in Connaught Place, and had eaten all kinds of goodies from there. I was instantly green with envy and quickly checked to see if they would deliver in East Delhi. In the next moment I was my golden sunny self when I learnt that they did indeed. This has to be said out aloud from rooftops: Wenger’s is the best. I have had delicious patties and pastries from elsewhere, but few can outdo the magic that this old bakery wields. I also have nostalgic links with Wenger’s. In the early ‘60s, when I was a wee lad, my mother would occasionally take me there. Sometimes we sat in its restaurant that was right above and where they served Chinese and Continental fare (it later became the American Express office). Those days there were three places that we used to go to: Wenger’s, Tea House and Nanking (I remember its cutlets and even the face of a server). The last two downed their shutters long years ago. Thankfully, Wenger’s carries on. So, the moment I found that I could get some of my favourite snacks delivered from there, I placed an order online (Wengers.in/store). Two of our all-time favourites had to be there, of course. So I asked for chicken patties (Rs. 80) and mutton shammi kebabs (Rs. 80). Then we thought we’d have a chicken quiche, a ham and pineapple pizza, and a mushroom and cheese pizza. I also asked for a loaf of sundried tomato bread (Rs. 70). With a stiff upper lip, I didn’t look at the dessert section. One must keep a stern eye on one’s health. All told, the bill, including shipping and processing fees, came to Rs. 1,006, and served as three happy meals. The food arrived on the designated day, at the designated time. The pizzas, kebabs and quiche were our dinner; the bread (with a chicken paste from Licious) was our breakfast the next day, and we had the patties with tea. Wenger’s pizzas are special: They are not thick or flour-laden, like some of the mass produced ones. A little smaller than the MNC fare, they are also a lot cheaper. The ham-and-pineapple pizza costs Rs. 150, and the mushroom one is at Rs. 130. The crust is thin yet substantial, and the toppings are superb. I couldn’t get to taste the ham in the ham and pineapple pizza (if they were there, they were camouflaged well), but the pineapple had melted into the cheese, and the sweet and salty flavours together did a glorious act. The mushroom pizza was oozing with toppings, and two pizzas and a kebab each were enough for the three of us. The kebabs were the way I remembered them: thick and juicy. The quiche was a pleasant surprise. I had thought it would be large enough for three, but it was just right for one. It was outstanding though, with juicy bits of chicken embedded in the creamy bed and a crunchy crust. The bread was fresh and pitted with sundried tomatoes and olives. And the patties were buttery and flaky, as they are meant to be. The shredded chicken stuffing had all the right flavours, too. I am going back to the site. This time, there will be a quiche for each one of us. And, maybe, if the stiff upper lip uncurls a bit, even an éclair or two.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Indian Matchmaking holds up a mirror||Let us begin by admitting that Indian Matchmaking is a brilliant show. Like all the best series — Downton Abbey , Game of Thrones , How t o Get Away w ith Murder — it is absolutely binge-worthy. But unlike them, it relies on something much more powerful than a good, solid story. It is imminently, pervasively real. There isn’t a single Indian alive, within the country or elsewhere, whose life isn’t touched by an arranged match somewhere in their family tree. The showmakers recognised this, and then linked the series with the other most powerful thing that has become essential to our social and online existence today: anger. As ‘woke’ millennials ranted about how the show ‘glorified’ an outdated, patriarchal tradition that has no place in ‘today’s world’ (whatever that means), more and more people across India and the globe tuned in to Sima Taparia-from-Mumbai’s iconic, cringe-inducing pronouncements on girls who needed to ‘adjust’ and be ‘flexible’. Everyone wanted to slap Pradhyuman for being a flake, Akshay for not being one, and both for rejecting scores of girls. We all wanted Aparna to lighten up, Nadia to sober down, and both to get suitable guys who understood them. It was glorious.  Playing the inclusive card  Apart from these obviously astute aspects of the making of this show, it accomplished something else no other series has done so seamlessly: it was ‘inclusive’. So much so that it actually didn’t feel forced. Let me count the ways: we have a less-than-perfect cynical lawyer in her early 30s; a nomadic, multi-ethnic 20-something into Bollywood dancing; an intelligent, funny, dark-skinned, balding school counsellor; a narcissistic and hugely privileged amateur cook and for-show-playboy; and a browbeaten mama’s boy who is also burdened with the birth of his elder brother’s baby. The best screenwriters in the world have not been able to show this range, variety and mix of Indians in one storyline. Ever. Even GoT had to pick its characters from seven imaginary kingdoms. But the main surprise from a show titled Indian Matchmaking came in the application of the process of matchmaking itself. Instead of being shown as the norm for ready-to-marry Indians, the idea of the arranged marriage was treated in individual contexts. This came home to me during Vyasar’s monologue, where he spoke about having dated previously and has now decided to opt for this route to find a life partner. The same thing applied to Ankita. And throughout the show, it was the various aspects of matchmaking and how it operates today, now, here, that we saw unfolding episode after episode. It succeeded because it gave us the freedom to judge and react to — and in many cases, to relate to — the situations the characters found themselves in.  Words that matter  The best part? We weren’t given any, absolutely not a single atom of morality. There was no lesson to be learned at the end. It was the perfect documentary of a custom that has prevailed and adapted itself over the centuries to suit the needs of those who use it for the variety of benefits it brings them. And while long usage does not make matchmaking right or acceptable, it can be argued that the show does not speak in its favour either, let alone glorify it. If anything, the overarching theme of Indian Matchmaking seems to be arch sarcasm. Riding on the crest of Sima Taparia’s démodé judgments, complex and fascinating characters are summed up succinctly into a few words — hatthi (strong-willed), jiddi (stubborn) and swabhimani (proud) — supplied by her tech-friendly face-reader. The fact that she considers her work a god-given mandate draws a nice parallel with megalomaniacal political figures who think they know best for the people. Indeed, more than one participant turns to Sima j i because “if not her, then who?” It is a phrase we have heard often in the past months even as evidence of utter failure continues to pile up, much like Sima j i ’s useless stack of CVs and failed dates. So let’s see the show for what it is: a mirror. And not rely on a commercial enterprise to bear and discharge the responsibility of taking a moral stance. Mithai is, one realises, traditional. But let’s take this one with a pinch of peri-peri.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Fashion for your peloton||I loathe golf almost as much as I loathe... no, wait, there’s nothing I loathe more. Not even the sport of curling. That said, what I do admire about it is how spiffy you can look no matter whether you are a pro or a noob who keeps swinging with all their might but only ends up unearthing divots of grass. This, by the way, never happened. Another sport which allows us to dress up is cycling. Sure there is the unsightly issue of your belly and other areas of fat protruding through the fitted gear, but MAMILs (middle-aged men in lycra) are as common as people walking about with hair transplants and nose jobs in Istanbul, so not to worry. This is good because the ongoing pandemic has had an odd outcome — people the world over now have a sudden penchant to pedal their way everywhere. Cities in the West are having to allocate new dedicated lanes for cyclists and, as one journal put it, “Cycles are selling out faster than toilet paper!” Well, it is a buyers’ market and having been a cycling enthusiast since before the Corona effect, I am a tad more well-informed than most about how to turn up for your first ride looking like you just won the previous stage at the Tour de France. Cycles The most basic of requirements, budgets range from a paltry Rs. 5,000 to well, the Eastern European black market price of two working kidneys. Find your sweet spot and settle in. Italy is the spiritual hub of everything on two wheels so, just like with your dinner order, when in doubt, go Italian. Pinarello and Colnago (Rs. 3 lakh+) are my top brands, but there is also Bianchi (Rs. 50,000+) and Cipollini. Others such as Cervelo (Rs. 2 lakh+) sound Italian but are actually Canadian. So is Argon (Canadian, that is) and way too speedy to be inert (like the gas). The US has some top brands, Trek being the worldwide leader for quality premium bikes. Their latest, Madone (Rs. 3.5 lakh), is an American product with Italian appeal, much like Frank Sinatra. Giant is reliable but ‘mass’— you can get a great bike cheap. Me, I ride a Specialized, which sits somewhere in the one arm and half a leg price zone. Computers You will need this because if you don’t record and post about a ride, did it even happen? The range is vast, but you’d do well to stick with the leaders: Garmin or Wahoo. How much data you want depends on how nerdy you are and how deep the pockets go. A basic Garmin 130 (Rs. 20,000) will resolve most biker needs, but an 830 or a 1030 (Rs. 60,000) will show you coloured maps. Wahoo comes in two versions: Bolt (Rs. 24,000) and Roam (Rs. 37,000), and here too the bells and whistles go up with the price. Of course, there are others, from Sigma and Lezyne to Cateye, which are significantly cheaper. I settled for the 130 because it does it all. Clothes Assos makes some of the best cycling gear out there, so just suck it up and pay. Rapha is another luxury performance brand as is X-Bionic (but ill-suited for Indian climes). If not these, you can go for Castelli, Roka, Agu and a relatively unknown brand, Pas Normal Studios. Padded cycling shorts are crucial (for where you connect with the bike) so make sure they are top-grade. I use the Mille GT by Assos (Rs. 8,000) and no complaints thus far.  Helmets and g loves  For the former, it can be safe, light and aerodynamic or heavy and cheap — you decide. I use Catlike Mixino (Rs. 18,000), a fairly off-beat (and now defunct) Spanish brand and the Giro Aeon. But Kask, Met, Bell, Smith, POC (another off-beat pick), Specialized... the choices abound. Try and get an MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) if you can, else Trek’s new Bontrager WaveCel helmets (Rs. 12,000) with their hair net weave inners appear to be a technically-advanced design in terms of safety. Gloves with gel work best. I use half-finger Giro and Specialized gloves for summers and fleece-lined ones for winters (Rs. 1,000+). Pedals You can get stock or clip ones, which your regular sports shoes lock into. Or else, you can be super-dedicated to the pro look and invest in clipless pedals — the cleat underneath your cycling shoes lock into it. That way you aren’t just pushing the bike forward and uphill, you can pull it too. I used Shimano clipless, from which I upgraded to Look Keo Carbon — much lighter and left my wallet feeling similarly so (Rs. 7,000). If you want to step into a whole new range of pedal pricing, go for the kind that come equipped with a power meter (Rs. 50,000+). It is a metric and it is nerdy — measures wattage being churned out by the rider — so if you aren’t too caught up about it, don’t bother.  Shoes Sidi is the way to go: Italian and stylish, even if a little loud and fiendishly expensive. Shimano, Fizik, Specialized and Bontrager would be my other equally-laudable options. Expect to spend upwards of Rs. 7,000 on a good pair. The higher you go the lighter they get, as also snugger which means your foot gets to transfer all your force to the wheel, and convey all the pain of wearing such stiff shoes directly to you!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/fashion-for-your-peloton/article32245022.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The this thing of the that thing||Pandemics, lockdowns, downturns, poverty, starvation, mental illness, locusts, the threat of war, tranquiliser darts – nothing can deter the Indian writer from the job at hand: book promotion. Given below is an excerpt of the social media exchange between a writer friend and her writer friends.  Writer: Super-excited to share the cover design of my new book, The This Thing Of The That Thing, that is coming out shortly. So totally excitedly super-duper excited.  Writer Friend 1: OMG. I just peed a little in excitement looking at the cover. The orangutan in a Fabindia kurta playing a cello is so lyrical. A violin would have made it... ho-hum. And the subtle touch of the man in silhouette mercilessly clubbing a soft toy in the background, like WOW! This is literary fiction. So dying to get my hands on your The This Thing Of The That Thing .  Writer Friend 2: Oh My Double Super God! I am writhing excitedly spurred by your excitement, WF1. Did you notice the title font? It is so achingly beautiful. I’m getting two copies of the book. I’ll read the recto pages from the copy in my right hand. And vice verso ... SWIDT! LOL!  Writer: ROFLMAO!! You are like PG Wodehouse crossed into Yogi Babu. God, I so love that you love my book so.  Writer Friend 3: Hey, WF 1 and WF 2, I am dying to witness with my own eyes both your excitements based on Writer’s original excitement. Let’s do a super-excited FB Live reading of our joint and individual excitements. I’ll read the copyright page.  Writer: Awwww. You’re making me cry. I’m super-excited already by the imminent release of my book which led to WF 1’s incontinent excitement. Then WF 2 says this . And, you, WF 3, you had to outdo that with the FB Live idea. How much love can a best-selling writer take in one day.  WF 1: Hey, I haven’t even begun. I am so super-excited by the book, I’m going to have the opening para tattooed on the back of my neck.  Writer Friend 2: Cool. But make sure the typo in para 1 is corrected (I just read the preview on Amazon). In line three, it says ‘exited’ instead of ‘excited’.  Writer: OMG, really? Thanks, WF 2. You have a keen eye. You caught this one just like I caught the ‘yatch’ one in the title of your debut book, Purple Yatch On The Poignant Backwaters . LOL!  WF 2: Thanks for reminding me, Writer. Too sweet, you are. I changed it in the reprint (sold 19,238 copies, but who’s counting).  WF 3: Yes, you did. But the spelling of ‘poignant’ became ‘poingant’. Poing! Like a cartoon sound effect. LOL. But hey, who cares, right? You got the Siromani Wet Grinders Debut Fiction Award.  Writer: Erm, let’s not get diverted, sweeties, let’s do the FB Live, no? So ultra-super excited.  WF 1: Hey, can I talk a little bit about my last book then? As you may remember my The Unbearable Heaviness Of Being... Kumbhakarna was nominated for Udipi Shri Shanti Vilas’ Best Second Book By A First-Time Writer Award.  Writer: Er, okay, but how is it relevant? Yours was a futuristic mythological cookbook. Mine is a performance-poetic semi-fictional self-improvement literary memoir. Let’s keep it about me, no, for a bit?  WF 1: TTYL. The corporation guy is at the door to take our temperatures.  WF 2: BFN. Hubby calls.  WF 3: Me, too. Kiss kiss. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-this-thing-of-the-that-thing/article32245028.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Honey, I shot the kids||This lockdown I’ve been occasionally dipping into old photos, something I loved doing as a kid. We used to have about three or four family albums, and you can see how they move down the years from carefully posed black-and-white photos of naked babies, annual vacations and headshots to the more casual and coloured era of weddings, Christmas parties and New Year dances, till they vanish altogether as the idea of the album dies out. Gone are the beautiful thick black pages, photos attached with adhesive corners, each page protected by tracing paper, replaced by the ugly plastic sleeves of the studio album provided free each time you gave in a roll for developing. That’s gone too. Photographs are innumerable and so valueless nobody prints them anymore. They float in ether now, soulless and lost. The lockdown has filled the airwaves with these empty photos. Pictures of pets and food and selves shared as substitutes for the shared lives now missing. The camera in my very first smartphone filled me with a false sense of my artistry, but now I rather hate the blighted thing. Especially when other people wield it. Hell, Sartre would have said today, is other people’s phones. And there’s nothing quite as hellish as people constantly whipping out a phone and pointing it at themselves or at you at the least provocation. A random lunch, a dinner with the spouses of your spouse’s colleagues, a meeting with a distant cousin thrice removed whom you plan to arrange never to meet again. I have no idea why these non-events are commemorated by the phone camera. Who cares? Why must a perfectly ordinary dinner party end with everyone grinning inanely into a phone? It’s like we are all goldfish in a bowl, swimming on show, pouting and kissing glass walls vacuously, endlessly. Speaking of which, how wonderful that one might not be required to attend weddings anymore in a post-pandemic world! No more ghastly giving-present photo ritual. No more standing in queue like you’re boarding an Indigo flight, only you’re in high heels and best sari. No more being marched across that bizarre desi ‘Wedding Stage’ to pose like cattle as the camera records you handing over the present. There’s an inherent inelegance to the whole procedure that makes me shudder. I am getting far better at handling all this though. Some months ago, we hosted a couple, with whom we are politely acquainted, for dinner. As soon as the eating was done, the lady stirred to life and fishing about in her bag, she trilled: “We really should all take a photo now.” I trilled right back: “No, we really shouldn’t.” It worked like magic. I am proud of my growing photo repellent skills. At one time, the idea of a photograph was precious. A day was set aside, a roll bought, camera loaded, hair brushed. Picking up the prints from the studio was an event of high excitement. You were heart-broken that your favourite shot was over-exposed or delighted you had squeezed out two extra shots from the roll. Just 30 or so photographs at one time. A finite number. A limited hoard. To be carefully filed in those albums, brought out on Sundays and high days as a treat. We held those prints of loved ones with as much care as we did their living counterparts. My father at 25, slim and handsome, holding a cigarette with that stylishness only a black-and-white photograph can impart. My mother dressed up as a qawwali singer for the fancy dress bash at the club. There’s a deep sense of entering other worlds when one holds physical prints in the hand and pores over them. Like that childhood fantasy of being inside the scenes you saw through a bioscope or through the lens of that Viewfinder toy we all had. When my mother was grieving, we siblings would show her umpteen photographs of dad on our phones. But finally, the only thing that made sense was to make prints of them, so that she could hold them in her hands and flip through them endlessly or tuck them away under her pillow at night. Have you tried tucking a blasted phone under your pillow at night? The only thing you could possibly evoke is radiation. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/honey-i-shot-the-kids/article32245013.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Chasing deliveries||The pandemic has decimated the restaurant business across formats all over the world, but also facilitated creative ideas as entrepreneurs find ways to cope. One way in which top chefs and restaurants are trying to tide over tough times is by focussing on the delivery format. Internationally, much innovation is happening here — a spurt in complex, ready-to-drink cocktails, high teas delivered in tiered trays by the likes of Four Seasons, and even collectible crockery. As brands try to outdo each other, the emphasis is on not just high-quality ingredients, but presentations and mechanisms such as butler services to up the home dining ‘experience’. In India, we are seeing similar growth in upscale deliveries — a big change from the pre-Covid days. Anonymous cloud kitchens with questionable hygiene and indifferent cooking catered to a large base of consumers with average order values of just Rs. 200-Rs. 300. Today, these dark kitchens are out. The emphasis is on brand, as well as high average order value, even if this means fewer deliveries by upscale restaurants or chefs. For customers, the play on quality is welcome. However, the question is whether restaurants and chefs will be able to earn enough revenue to sustain. Most establishments are treating deliveries as stop-gap arrangements, but does it make sense for them to enter this vertical for the long term? Finally, do deliveries have the potential to be lucrative investments for PE funds? These were some questions I posed to a lively panel of chefs: Prateek Sadhu of Masque, Regi Mathew of Kappa Chakka Kandhari (KCK), Vikramjit Roy of Hello Panda, Saransh Goila of Goila Butter Chicken, and Sharad Sachdeva, director operations for L Catterton Asia, the food and luxury retail focussed PE fund. Both Sadhu and Mathew were unanimous that their food in the delivery format is very different from their restaurant cooking (the food and experience can’t be replicated) and that this is a temporary arrangement. “Even with deliveries, 65% of our revenue has been wiped off, so we are just trying to do anything to survive,” said Sadhu. Explaining why he is serving popular dishes like biryani and parotta (that were never on KCK’s menu), Mathew says, “People want comfort. This may eventually become a separate vertical.” Roy differed, pointing out that he was trying to disrupt the category with a long delivery menu, with both popular and specialised dishes. Hello Panda has been successful in NCR in its one month of operations. “Our monthly revenue is about Rs. 9 lakh and the average order value is high,” he said. While the category is attracting a more evolved clientèle, scalability and affordability will remain crucial in the long run, highlighted Goila. “Multiple kitchens to cater to hyper-local markets and affordable pricing will be key.” As brands compete with each other and walk the quality-price tightrope, banking on tech is important. Apps that show consumers how their food is made, for instance, will give chefs an edge. Even popular deliveries typically make one-third the money of a comparable restaurant size, but with scale, they could be the next sunrise sector. All the chefs were unanimous in their vote of low confidence to delivery aggregators and felt their own fleet of personnel was vital in an upmarket space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/chasing-deliveries/article32245010.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Hope in a gin bottle||-In the last four months, Twinkle Khanna’s go-to home embellishment has been money plant saplings in empty alcohol bottles. “I have a lot of gin bottles because I have been drinking a lot of it during the lockdown. They are my new vases,” says the 46-year-old writer, columnist and interior designer. The human eye, she says, is naturally oriented to see life in the colour green, more so now, when we are confined in our homes due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Closely linked to our emotions, colour can be instrumental in uplifting our mood, says Khanna, who is partial to all shades of blue. “I’m always wearing [the colour] and have blue around me.” She talks about updating living spaces with colour, and this includes the bathroom, which doesn’t have to be a “boring and sterile white”. The ambassador for American bath design brand, Kohler, says, “It is only now that we are realising how important a bathroom is. It is almost like a sacred space because it is the only place you are alone, especially if you have kids.” DIY memories That said, Khanna has ensured that her children have been a part of home improvement activities during the lockdown. “As a child, I had learnt to crochet and embroider, and I’ve been doing embroidery hoops with my children. Hopefully we will make something that will have value, if not materialistically, then as a memory of doing this activity together at a time like this,” she says. Quick DIY tips like using old shawls as upholstery have worked well for Khanna, who believes recycling household items is the best way to usher in some change at the moment. As an interior designer, she has held sustainability and durability in high regard. “Construction itself is non-sustainable,” she observes. “But within that framework, we have to maximise output by incorporating elements like rainwater harvesting and solar energy, for instance.” When she started her brand, The White Window, they had no access to western designs, compelling her to look at homegrown artisans. “We have the best carvers and artisans in India. We are [now increasingly] looking inwards, not just in designs but also in culture,” she says. As residences are doubling up as office spaces during lockdown, Khanna resorts to making an armrest of pillows on her bed and using them as a table to break the monotony of a desk routine. She calls it a pillow fortress. It is a hack she recommends, especially if your job is to write. “It is quite ergonomically viable,” she observes. “For me, headphones are also vital because I get distracted by noise. I put them on while writing and play white noise or sounds of a washing machine or the air conditioner or the rain, so I drown out screaming children and the chaos behind me.” Currently working on her fourth book, the author of Mrs Funnybones and Pyjamas Are Forgiving , found it easier to focus on her writing at the start of the pandemic. “Back then we were a lot more hopeful,” she recalls. Writing has become progressively challenging. “It is like those sugarcane stalls on roadsides.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Shobhaa De: Inside out||“I was like a woman possessed, sweating blood and [writing] at a demonic speed,” says Shobhaa De. At a time when people are baking sourdough bread and whipping up Dalgona coffee, this doesn’t sound like the best way to spend a lockdown. But as a writer, she “simply could not let this dramatic, disruptive pandemic moment pass without responding to it in my own fashion.” De is referring to Lockdown Liaisons , her latest collection of short stories that first came out as weekly e-books through June and July, and have now been compiled into a paperback. “Some stories were written in a day, some in two. Putting down 2,000 to 2,500 words a day became my ‘new normal’,” she shares, adding, “I was responding to so many stimuli. I was devouring news reports, watching the pandemic take over our world and our lives. The early stories in the series reflect my own confusion and pain as I watched lives crumble and change around me. So, in that sense, every story is ‘real’.”  Stories for all  Fear, frustration, uncertainty and tragedy run through the 24 stories. Sex (in De’s inimitable style) plays a large part too — a woman contemplating seducing her brother-in-law, another fending off her husband’s unwanted attention, and a man stuck with a mistress he barely knows. “Most of the characters, like most of us, are still coming to terms with the tumultuous emotional and financial changes brought on by a lethal virus that has paralysed the world. Everyone is obsessed with just one thing, survival! I have tried to capture these mixed feelings through the different characters,” she says. The first-person narratives, structured as internal monologues, are mostly set among the urban, well-to-do segment. But the occasional one delves into the lives of people from other stratum of society, such as a migrant worker leaving for his village or a Benarasi weaver and his silent loom. “The book shows a great range and [Shobhaa’s] connection with people at all levels,” actor Lillete Dubey said during a performative reading of the final e-book. “Obviously, she was not sitting inside a migrant’s house, but she was sitting inside his head. Each character speaks distinctly; they even construct their sentences differently.” Dubey is now eyeing a few stories for the stage.  Rediscovering priorities  While switching between characters — “occupying their skins, their minds, their hearts, their lives” — was challenging for De, the short story format wasn’t. “I have written a volume of short stories in the past for Hay House, titled Small Betrayals. I love the format and strongly believe this neglected genre is poised to stage a major comeback in publishing. It has to do with ADS [Attention Deficit Syndrome]. Readers are searching for something that provides food for thought in small, delicious bites!” Up next, we can expect a new novel, Srilaaji - Diary of a Marwari Matriarch (published by Simon & Schuster). It is slated for a Diwali launch. In the meantime, she is keen on spending more time with her family. “I have been reaching out to long-lost friends and investing more time in relationships that matter,” says De, who has been watching Aarya and Indian Matchmaking on Netflix of late. “I have rediscovered my priorities: family and writing.” Lockdown Liaisons , published by Simon & Schuster, is p riced at Rs. 350.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Fashion for your peloton||I loathe golf almost as much as I loathe... no, wait, there’s nothing I loathe more. Not even the sport of curling. That said, what I do admire about it is how spiffy you can look no matter whether you are a pro or a noob who keeps swinging with all their might but only ends up unearthing divots of grass. This, by the way, never happened. Another sport which allows us to dress up is cycling. Sure there is the unsightly issue of your belly and other areas of fat protruding through the fitted gear, but MAMILs (middle-aged men in lycra) are as common as people walking about with hair transplants and nose jobs in Istanbul, so not to worry. This is good because the ongoing pandemic has had an odd outcome — people the world over now have a sudden penchant to pedal their way everywhere. Cities in the West are having to allocate new dedicated lanes for cyclists and, as one journal put it, “Cycles are selling out faster than toilet paper!” Well, it is a buyers’ market and having been a cycling enthusiast since before the Corona effect, I am a tad more well-informed than most about how to turn up for your first ride looking like you just won the previous stage at the Tour de France. Cycles The most basic of requirements, budgets range from a paltry Rs. 5,000 to well, the Eastern European black market price of two working kidneys. Find your sweet spot and settle in. Italy is the spiritual hub of everything on two wheels so, just like with your dinner order, when in doubt, go Italian. Pinarello and Colnago (Rs. 3 lakh+) are my top brands, but there is also Bianchi (Rs. 50,000+) and Cipollini. Others such as Cervelo (Rs. 2 lakh+) sound Italian but are actually Canadian. So is Argon (Canadian, that is) and way too speedy to be inert (like the gas). The US has some top brands, Trek being the worldwide leader for quality premium bikes. Their latest, Madone (Rs. 3.5 lakh), is an American product with Italian appeal, much like Frank Sinatra. Giant is reliable but ‘mass’— you can get a great bike cheap. Me, I ride a Specialized, which sits somewhere in the one arm and half a leg price zone. Computers You will need this because if you don’t record and post about a ride, did it even happen? The range is vast, but you’d do well to stick with the leaders: Garmin or Wahoo. How much data you want depends on how nerdy you are and how deep the pockets go. A basic Garmin 130 (Rs. 20,000) will resolve most biker needs, but an 830 or a 1030 (Rs. 60,000) will show you coloured maps. Wahoo comes in two versions: Bolt (Rs. 24,000) and Roam (Rs. 37,000), and here too the bells and whistles go up with the price. Of course, there are others, from Sigma and Lezyne to Cateye, which are significantly cheaper. I settled for the 130 because it does it all. Clothes Assos makes some of the best cycling gear out there, so just suck it up and pay. Rapha is another luxury performance brand as is X-Bionic (but ill-suited for Indian climes). If not these, you can go for Castelli, Roka, Agu and a relatively unknown brand, Pas Normal Studios. Padded cycling shorts are crucial (for where you connect with the bike) so make sure they are top-grade. I use the Mille GT by Assos (Rs. 8,000) and no complaints thus far.  Helmets and g loves  For the former, it can be safe, light and aerodynamic or heavy and cheap — you decide. I use Catlike Mixino (Rs. 18,000), a fairly off-beat (and now defunct) Spanish brand and the Giro Aeon. But Kask, Met, Bell, Smith, POC (another off-beat pick), Specialized... the choices abound. Try and get an MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) if you can, else Trek’s new Bontrager WaveCel helmets (Rs. 12,000) with their hair net weave inners appear to be a technically-advanced design in terms of safety. Gloves with gel work best. I use half-finger Giro and Specialized gloves for summers and fleece-lined ones for winters (Rs. 1,000+). Pedals You can get stock or clip ones, which your regular sports shoes lock into. Or else, you can be super-dedicated to the pro look and invest in clipless pedals — the cleat underneath your cycling shoes lock into it. That way you aren’t just pushing the bike forward and uphill, you can pull it too. I used Shimano clipless, from which I upgraded to Look Keo Carbon — much lighter and left my wallet feeling similarly so (Rs. 7,000). If you want to step into a whole new range of pedal pricing, go for the kind that come equipped with a power meter (Rs. 50,000+). It is a metric and it is nerdy — measures wattage being churned out by the rider — so if you aren’t too caught up about it, don’t bother.  Shoes Sidi is the way to go: Italian and stylish, even if a little loud and fiendishly expensive. Shimano, Fizik, Specialized and Bontrager would be my other equally-laudable options. Expect to spend upwards of Rs. 7,000 on a good pair. The higher you go the lighter they get, as also snugger which means your foot gets to transfer all your force to the wheel, and convey all the pain of wearing such stiff shoes directly to you!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/fashion-for-your-peloton/article32245318.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||The this thing of the that thing||Pandemics, lockdowns, downturns, poverty, starvation, mental illness, locusts, the threat of war, tranquiliser darts – nothing can deter the Indian writer from the job at hand: book promotion. Given below is an excerpt of the social media exchange between a writer friend and her writer friends.  Writer: Super-excited to share the cover design of my new book, The This Thing Of The That Thing, that is coming out shortly. So totally excitedly super-duper excited.  Writer Friend 1: OMG. I just peed a little in excitement looking at the cover. The orangutan in a Fabindia kurta playing a cello is so lyrical. A violin would have made it... ho-hum. And the subtle touch of the man in silhouette mercilessly clubbing a soft toy in the background, like WOW! This is literary fiction. So dying to get my hands on your The This Thing Of The That Thing .  Writer Friend 2: Oh My Double Super God! I am writhing excitedly spurred by your excitement, WF1. Did you notice the title font? It is so achingly beautiful. I’m getting two copies of the book. I’ll read the recto pages from the copy in my right hand. And vice verso ... SWIDT! LOL!  Writer: ROFLMAO!! You are like PG Wodehouse crossed into Yogi Babu. God, I so love that you love my book so.  Writer Friend 3: Hey, WF 1 and WF 2, I am dying to witness with my own eyes both your excitements based on Writer’s original excitement. Let’s do a super-excited FB Live reading of our joint and individual excitements. I’ll read the copyright page.  Writer: Awwww. You’re making me cry. I’m super-excited already by the imminent release of my book which led to WF 1’s incontinent excitement. Then WF 2 says this . And, you, WF 3, you had to outdo that with the FB Live idea. How much love can a best-selling writer take in one day.  WF 1: Hey, I haven’t even begun. I am so super-excited by the book, I’m going to have the opening para tattooed on the back of my neck.  Writer Friend 2: Cool. But make sure the typo in para 1 is corrected (I just read the preview on Amazon). In line three, it says ‘exited’ instead of ‘excited’.  Writer: OMG, really? Thanks, WF 2. You have a keen eye. You caught this one just like I caught the ‘yatch’ one in the title of your debut book, Purple Yatch On The Poignant Backwaters . LOL!  WF 2: Thanks for reminding me, Writer. Too sweet, you are. I changed it in the reprint (sold 19,238 copies, but who’s counting).  WF 3: Yes, you did. But the spelling of ‘poignant’ became ‘poingant’. Poing! Like a cartoon sound effect. LOL. But hey, who cares, right? You got the Siromani Wet Grinders Debut Fiction Award.  Writer: Erm, let’s not get diverted, sweeties, let’s do the FB Live, no? So ultra-super excited.  WF 1: Hey, can I talk a little bit about my last book then? As you may remember my The Unbearable Heaviness Of Being... Kumbhakarna was nominated for Udipi Shri Shanti Vilas’ Best Second Book By A First-Time Writer Award.  Writer: Er, okay, but how is it relevant? Yours was a futuristic mythological cookbook. Mine is a performance-poetic semi-fictional self-improvement literary memoir. Let’s keep it about me, no, for a bit?  WF 1: TTYL. The corporation guy is at the door to take our temperatures.  WF 2: BFN. Hubby calls.  WF 3: Me, too. Kiss kiss. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-this-thing-of-the-that-thing/article32245306.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Shakuntala Devi’ movie review: Loud, mawkish and joyful||Shakuntala Devi had a famously high-octane personality — full of laughter, quirk, impudence and wit. She turned a conventionally drab skill of nimble calculations into a stage performance and added oodles of drama and oomph to it. Anu Menon’s biopic on the late mathematical genius takes the essence of her public persona to construct an upbeat, bright and loud tone for the film, while also revealing the not-so-positive and lesser-known aspects of her private life, using the same audio-visual aesthetic. This contradiction is a captivating approach, but there’s a thin line between paying homage to the vibrancy of a personality and being an over-the-top cliché. Shakuntala Devi keeps oscillating between the two. Visual gimmick To make numbers look scintillating, the film uses a visual element of flying digits on the screen. Some appear as if they are sketched on a blackboard, while others are either levitating on-screen or revolving in a circle. The purpose of this cartoon-like visual aid is to make numbers look attractive, much in sync with Devi’s lifelong efforts. But unlike Devi’s innate charm and sass, the visual gimmick in the film symbolises a desperate attempt to appear upbeat and positive. Menon opts for an easy way out instead of doing the hard work of eliciting the same emotions through characterisation. The actors perform comically in sync with the film’s exaggerated tone, especially all the Caucasian actors in London during the flashbacks to the ’50s, when Devi landed in England to make a living. Vidya Balan maintains the same high energy but it’s apt considering she plays Devi, who was known for her vibrancy. Balan, who has previously essayed real-life personalities like Silk Smitha, has the ability to smoothly transition between age and appearances, but even she can’t salvage a rather mawkish finale to the film. The upside of all the over-the-top treatment is that the film has no dearth of joy. There’s a lot of fun to be had, especially when Balan is bringing out Devi’s temerity and an innate sense of defiance. Her stance against patriarchy is enjoyed rather than beatified, and that only adds to the admiration one feels towards the mathematical genius, who was also a prolific writer, astrologer and politician. An audience watches a biopic not so much to witness a reenactment of what we already know about a public figure, but what happens when the curtains drop. Shakuntala Devi explores the mathematician’s relationship with her daughter, parents and husband, and illustrates how the three are closely linked to each other. While her childhood both haunts and feeds into her success, she inadvertently repeats history with her daughter, Anupama Banerji (Sanya Malhotra). The mother-daughter relationship is the focal point of the film, demonstrating how success and wealth may not guarantee a happy childhood, and how childhood memories are often adjusted, embellished and altered when we grow up. The film makes this rather pertinent point, and is reflective of the unfettered access given by Anupama to the filmmaker. Devi’s relationship with her husband, Paritosh Banerji (Jisshu Sengupta), on the other hand, is rushed and his sexuality is only used fleetingly in parts as instances that agitate Anupama. While exploring the mother-daughter relationship, the film goes back and forth between the ’90s and previous decades, but towards the end, the structure gets tiresome. There is no space for finer details in this film — everything is either too on-the-nose or exaggerated.  Fairly critical There’s so much to Devi’s life and the film doesn’t try to cramp in everything but follows a thematic thread of ‘you can’t have it all’. The film is also fairly critical of Devi as a mother and wife, which — contrary to its glossy and bright texture — is quite refreshing to see in a biopic, which can be an easy trap for glorification. It’s certainly a film that makes you want to know more about Devi, after seeing her in all her larger-than-life splendour, but the desire, ultimately, is more to do with what the film leaves out, rather than what it opts to include. Shakuntala Devi is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shakuntala-devi-movie-review-loud-mawkish-and-joyful/article32245516.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Hope in a gin bottle||In the last four months, Twinkle Khanna’s go-to home embellishment has been money plant saplings in empty alcohol bottles. “I have a lot of gin bottles because I have been drinking a lot of it during the lockdown. They are my new vases,” says the 46-year-old writer, columnist and interior designer. The human eye, she says, is naturally oriented to see life in the colour green, more so now, when we are confined in our homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic that’s hit the world. Closely linked to our emotions, colour can be instrumental in uplifting our mood, says Khanna, who is partial to all shades of blue. “I’m always wearing [the colour] and have blue around me.” She talks about updating living spaces with colour, and this includes the bathroom, which doesn’t have to be a “boring and sterile white”. The ambassador for American bath design brand, Kohler, says, “It is only now that we are realising how important a bathroom is. It is almost like a sacred space because it is the only place you are alone, especially if you have kids.” DIY memories That said, Khanna has ensured that her children have been a part of home improvement activities during the lockdown. “As a child, I had learnt to crochet and embroider, and I’ve been doing embroidery hoops with my children. Hopefully we will make something that will have value, if not materialistically, then as a memory of doing this activity together at a time like this,” she says. Quick DIY tips like using old shawls as upholstery have worked well for Khanna, who believes recycling household items is the best way to usher in some change at the moment. As an interior designer, she has held sustainability and durability in high regard. “Construction itself is non-sustainable,” she observes. “But within that framework, we have to maximise output by incorporating elements like rainwater harvesting and solar energy, for instance.” When she started her brand, The White Window, they had no access to western designs, compelling her to look at homegrown artisans. “We have the best carvers and artisans in India. We are [now increasingly] looking inwards, not just in designs but also in culture,” she says. As residences are doubling up as office spaces during lockdown, Khanna resorts to making an armrest of pillows on her bed and using them as a table to break the monotony of a desk routine. She calls it a pillow fortress. It is a hack she recommends, especially if your job is to write. “It is quite ergonomically viable,” she observes. “For me, headphones are also vital because I get distracted by noise. I put them on while writing and play white noise or sounds of a washing machine or the air conditioner or the rain, so I drown out screaming children and the chaos behind me.” Currently working on her fourth book, the author of Mrs Funnybones and Pyjamas Are Forgiving , found it easier to focus on her writing at the start of the pandemic. “Back then we were a lot more hopeful,” she recalls. Writing has become progressively challenging. “It is like those sugarcane stalls on roadsides. There is no sugarcane left any more for the juice to be extracted; the mind is not stimulated enough,” she quips. She is, therefore, occupying herself with a long reading list of books and watching their cinematic adaptations, in the hope that they spark inspiration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hope-in-a-gin-bottle/article32245305.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Death at a wedding||A whodunit set in the confines of a haveli, during a wedding of an old man with a young bride, where the entire family is a suspect, is a ripe setting for a classic locked-room mystery. Raat Akeli Hai parachutes the audience into this scenario and has a captivating start to the narrative, up until a point where the film starts leaving this cloistered setting and steps outside, literally and figuratively. That’s when the mystery starts tapering and enters the realm of contrived storytelling, where you question plausibility as well as how clever the revelation is. Although crime thrillers are supposed to be inherently contrived, Raat Akeli Hai is so focused on confusing and misleading you that it barely drops hints along the way, and the effort to surprise is quite evident in the climax. Narrated through the eyes of inspector Jatil Yadav (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), Raat Akeli Hai functions on two levels: a crime mystery and a romance saga. While the two are closely interlinked and interdependent, the latter isn’t fully actualised and feels like an impediment to the mystery, rather than an asset. The build-up to the big reveal is expected to be misleading, but it’s not terribly satisfying. It would have been doubly sharp had the film tricked its audience into being distracted while the answers are right under their nose. What works in the film’s favour is its characters and actors. At the forefront is Siddiqui, a middle-aged policeman, who applies fairness cream to lighten his skin and wants a ‘homely’ girl to marry. His strangely progressive mother, essayed quite comically by Ila Arun, just wants him to marry and settle down, irrespective of who the girl is. At the crime scene — the haveli — there are a bunch of intriguing characters. Among which is Radha (Radhika Apte), a prostitute sold by her father to marry the dead landlord. She has a mysterious presence, which soon fizzles out. Beyond a point, Apte is unable to add much complexity to the character, which otherwise had tremendous potential to add a layer of suspense and deceit to the film. Underneath the thriller is a layer of commentary on patriarchy, misogyny and abuse. Patriarchy is both a direct evil and a force that drives the film. The women in the movie, as well as Jatil, are bound by patriarchy, and it influences several decisions. Thankfully, the commentary is neither overpowering nor didactic. The hinterland setting works quite well in favour of Raat Akeli Hai . A Muslim butcher who doubles up as a hitman, and a Hindu politician discreetly running a tannery in a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood are fascinating details that help root the mystery in its rustic setting. Even the dialogues, some quite wittily delivered by Siddiqui, make the film enjoyable. Among the actors, Padmavati Rao, Shreedhar Dubey and Aditya Srivastava are the most compelling. Even though inconsequential for a large part, Rao gets her moment of glory, but Dubey makes a mark despite being relegated to the background. Srivastava, fondly remembered for being a loyal investigator in CID, is on the other side of the law in this film, playing a slimy and repulsive politician. In its first one hour, the film does a competent job of ushering you into this murky crime and twisted household but then, somewhere along the way, loses its hold over characterisation in the pursuit of being a shocking thriller. Sure, the end is surprising but the film misses that vital feeling of being a step ahead of you and the detective, even when you think you've got it all figured out.

01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Loud, mawkish and joyful||Shakuntala Devi had a famously high octane personality — full of laughter, quirk, impudence and wit. She turned a conventionally drab skill of nimble calculations into a stage performance and added oodles of drama and oomph to it. Anu Menon’s biopic on the late mathematical genius takes the essence of her public persona to construct an upbeat, bright and loud tone for the film, while also revealing the not-so-positive and lesser-known aspects of her private life, using the same audio-visual aesthetic. This contradiction is a captivating approach, but there’s a thin line between paying homage to the vibrancy of a personality and being an over-the-top cliché. Shakuntala Devi keeps oscillating between the two. To make numbers look scintillating, the film uses a visual element of flying digits on the screen. Some appear as if they are sketched on a blackboard, while others are either levitating on-screen or revolving in a circle. The purpose of this cartoon-like visual aid is to make numbers look attractive, much in sync with Devi’s lifelong efforts. But unlike Devi’s innate charm and sass, the visual gimmick in the film symbolises a desperate attempt to appear upbeat and positive. Menon opts for an easy way out instead of doing the hard work of eliciting the same emotions through characterisation. The actors perform comically in sync with the film’s exaggerated tone, especially all the Caucasian actors in London during the flashbacks to the ’50s, when Devi landed in England to make a living. Vidya Balan maintains the same high energy but it’s apt considering she plays Devi, who was known for her vibrancy. Balan, who has previously essayed real-life personalities like Silk Smitha, has the ability to smoothly transition between age and appearances, but even she can’t salvage a rather mawkish finale to the film. The upside of all the over-the-treatment is that the film has no dearth of joy. There’s a lot of fun to be had, especially when Balan is bringing out Devi’s temerity and an innate sense of defiance. Her stance against patriarchy is enjoyed rather than beatified, and that only adds to the admiration one feels towards the mathematical genius, who was also a prolific writer, astrologer and politician. An audience watches a biopic not so much to witness a reenactment of what we already know about a public figure, but what happens when the curtains drop. Shakuntala Devi explores the mathematician’s relationship with her daughter, parents and husband, and illustrates how the three are closely linked to each other. While her childhood both haunts and feeds into her success, she inadvertently repeats history with her daughter, Anupama Banerji (Sanya Malhotra). The mother-daughter relationship is the focal point of the film, demonstrating how success and wealth may not guarantee a happy childhood, and how childhood memories are often adjusted, embellished and altered when we grow up. The film makes this rather pertinent point, and is reflective of the unfettered access given by Anupama to the filmmaker. Devi’s relationship with her husband, Paritosh Banerji (Jisshu Sengupta), on the other hand, is rushed and his sexuality is only used fleetingly in parts as instances that agitate Anupama. While exploring the mother-daughter relationship, the film goes back and forth between the ’90s and previous decades, but towards the end, the structure gets tiresome. There is no space for finer details in this film — everything is either too on-the-nose or exaggerated. There’s so much to Devi’s life and the film doesn’t try to cramp in everything but follows a thematic thread of ‘you can’t have it all’. The film is also fairly critical of Devi as a mother and wife, which — contrary to its glossy and bright texture — is quite refreshing to see in a biopic, which can be an easy trap for glorification. It’s certainly a film that makes you want to know more about Devi, after seeing her in all her larger-than-life splendour, but the desire, ultimately, is more to do with what the film leaves out, rather than what is opts to include. Shakuntala Devi is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/loud-mawkish-and-joyful/article32245317.ece
01 August 2020||New Delhi,||1,195 cases take Capital’s COVID-19 tally to 1,35,598||As many as 1,195 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Delhi in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 1,35,598, stated a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Friday. Also, 27 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 3,963. Of the total cases, 1,20,930 people have recovered, while there are 10,705 active cases. Though Health Minister Satyendar Jain had earlier this month said that the government would start another serological survey from August 1 to find the percentage of people who have developed antibodies against COVID-19, no order in this regard was issued till Friday evening. Officials of different districts said that there was no confirmation on starting the survey from Saturday. Since the daily new cases touched almost 4,000 – the highest so far – on June 23, the number of new cases has been dropping and it has been less than 1,500 for the past 15 consecutive days. The number of active cases has been decreasing since July 1 and it has decreased from 27,007 on July 1 by 60.3% to reach 10,705 on Friday. Also, of the total 19,091 tests done in the past 24 hours, 70.5% of the tests were rapid antigen tests, which have shown a low positivity in the city compared to RT-PCR tests. The number of people admitted to COVID-19 hospitals has also been decreasing. On July 1, a total of 5,892 beds in COVID-19 hospitals were occupied and the number decreased to 2,932 on Friday. During the same period, the number of COVID-19-positive people in home isolation has also decreased from 16,703 to 5,763. Also, the positivity rate has dropped from 12.2% to 6.2%. The number of containment zones was 692 on Friday. The Delhi government, in an order issued to all hospitals on Friday, directed to strictly comply with “rational use of PPE” available on the website of Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/1195-cases-take-capitals-covid-19-tally-to-135598/article32245360.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||Shobhaa De: inside out||“I was like a woman possessed, sweating blood and [writing] at a demonic speed,” says Shobhaa De. At a time when people are baking sourdough bread and whipping up Dalgona coffee, this doesn’t sound like the best way to spend a lockdown. But as a writer, she “simply could not let this dramatic, disruptive pandemic moment pass without responding to it in my own fashion”. De is referring to Lockdown Liaisons , her latest collection of short stories that first came out as weekly e-books through June and July, and have now been compiled into a paperback. “Some stories were written in a day, some in two. Putting down 2,000 to 2,500 words a day became my ‘new normal’,” she shares, adding, “I was responding to so many stimuli. I was devouring news reports, watching the pandemic take over our world and our lives. The early stories in the series reflect my own confusion and pain as I watched lives crumble and change around me. So, in that sense, every story is ‘real’.”  Stories for all  Fear, frustration, uncertainty and tragedy run through the 24 stories. Sex (in De’s inimitable style) plays a large part too — a woman contemplating seducing her brother-in-law, another fending off her husband’s unwanted attention, and a man stuck with a mistress he barely knows. “Most of the characters, like most of us, are still coming to terms with the tumultuous emotional and financial changes brought on by a lethal virus that has paralysed the world. Everyone is obsessed with just one thing, survival! I have tried to capture these mixed feelings through the different characters,” she says. The first-person narratives, structured as internal monologues, are mostly set among the urban, well-to-do segment. But the occasional one delves into the lives of people from other stratum of society, such as a migrant worker leaving for his village or a Benarasi weaver and his silent loom. “The book shows a great range and [De’s] connection with people at all levels,” actor Lillete Dubey said during a performative reading of the final e-book. “Obviously, she was not sitting inside a migrant’s house, but she was sitting inside his head. Each character speaks distinctly; they even construct their sentences differently.” Dubey is now eyeing a few stories for the stage.  While switching between characters — “occupying their skins, their minds, their hearts, their lives” — was challenging for De, the short story format wasn’t. “I have written a volume of short stories in the past for Hay House, titled Small Betrayals. I love the format and strongly believe this neglected genre is poised to stage a major comeback in publishing. It has to do with ADS [Attention Deficit Syndrome]. Readers are searching for something that provides food for thought in small, delicious bites!” she shares. Up next, we can expect a new novel, Srilaaji - Diary of a Marwari Matriarch (published by Simon & Schuster). It is slated for a Diwali launch. In the meantime, she is keen on spending more time with her family. “I have been reaching out to long-lost friends and investing more time in relationships that matter,” says De, who has been watching Aarya and Indian Matchmaking on Netflix of late. “I have rediscovered my priorities: family and writing,” she says. Lockdown Liaisons , published by Simon & Schuster, is p riced at Rs. 350. Available at leading bookstores and on e-commerce platforms like amazon.in .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shobhaa-de-inside-out/article32245514.ece
01 August 2020||New Delhi,||Court drops UAPA charges against four IS suspects||A court has dropped charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against four alleged Islamic State (IS) suspects, who were arrested by Delhi Police Special Cell in January after a brief exchange of fire. The case was later transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which filed a chargesheet against the suspects on July 6. After the chargesheet was filed, Additional Sessions Judge Praveen Singh found it to be “lacking clarity” and specific questions were asked regarding “availability of evidence”. In an order dated July 22, the court asked NIA if it cited “any evidence with regard to the offences under the UAPA except the disclosure statements and pointing out memos of the accused”. Charges have also been filed under other sections of the IPC and the Arms Act against the suspects. An NIA spokesperson did not respond to queries on the court dropping charges under various sections of the UAPA against the four suspects. The next date of hearing is August 14. The suspects in the case have been identified as Khaja Moideen, Abdul Samad, Syed Ali Nawas and Jaffar Ali. Moideen (52) is wanted by the NIA in two other cases. The two cases that were registered by the Tamil Nadu police on December 28 last year and Bengaluru police on January 10 this year were also transferred to the NIA. In a chargesheet filed on June 23 against 12 IS suspects in the Chennai case, including Moideen, the NIA said, “Investigation revealed that after the release of the key conspirator and ISIS/Daish terrorist named Khaja Mohideen on bail in a case relating to the murder of a Hindu leader from Central Prison, Puzhal in February, 2019, he had conspired with one Liyakath Ali with the intention of furthering the activities of ISIS/ Daish in India.” NIA said Moideen and Ali allegedly procured large number of SIM cards fraudulently activated by accused Pachaiyappan and Rajesh at Chennai between September and December, 2019. “In furtherance of the conspiracy, Khaja Moideen and Mahboob Pasha also procured through the co-conspirators, countrymade firearms and prohibited ammunition besides jungle camping equipment, pursuant to their intention to establish a wilayah [province] of ISIS/Daish near forests in South India with a view to wage violent jihad on behalf of the global terrorist organization,” the NIA said in its June 23 chargesheet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-drops-uapa-charges-against-four-is-suspects/article32245365.ece
01 August 2020||August 01 2020 00:00 IST,||An aimless comedy of errors||A comedy of errors dependent on an abandoned bag full of cash outside a public toilet in Mumbai. That’s probably the most interesting aspect of Lootcase , an utterly pointless and lackadaisical film, which drags on for more than two hours without much happening. The film starts off with a promising setup — an ordinary working-class man, Nandan Kumar (Kunal Khemu), discovers a bag abandoned during a crossfire between two rival goons. Nandan has no idea what to do with the ginormous amount of cash, and does all he can to hide it from his wife, Lata (Rasika Dugal). But for the next couple of hours, the film goes in circles and ceases to be funny. Once the film has established the conflict quite early on, one would expect the narrative to move on and introduce new scenarios that can lend to good comedy. But for almost an hour, the film showcases Nandan’s struggles — some of which are fleetingly amusing — but largely frustrating. Scenes are often repeated and one wishes Dugal had more to contribute than be a simpleton of a wife. Instead of being Khemu’s moral conscious, she comes across as a party pooper and he is allowed to walk away with all the goofiness. Beyond the two characters, there are gangsters like Bala Rathore (Vijay Raaz), who is obsessed with National Geographic and speaks in animal analogies. Gajraj Rao plays a local politician, Minister Patil, who gets work done by being too sweet. Ranvir Shorey as Inspector Kolte has a slight antagonistic shade, who carries out encounters at will and is controlled by Patil. All these characters have a few one-liners that land well. But overall, none of their character traits is memorable or innovative enough. Especially with Raaz — we’ve seen him play a shade of a Mumbai gangster aplenty before. Originally shot for the big screen, the film has now found a direct-to-digital release. As per the original vision, Lootcase also has a couple of songs, which may not bode well for an OTT watch, especially considering the film is so loosely edited. With so many other options and the temptation of the remote, Lootcase should have been pruned and drastically shortened for a snappy digital experience. This version feels like lazy transplantation across mediums that is completely out of sync with the times. Lootcase is currently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-aimless-comedy-of-errors/article32245517.ece
01 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Anna Nagar JJ cluster residents shifted from tent to school||Twelve days after 12 houses were swept away at Anna Nagar JJ cluster, after which residents started living in open tents, they have been shifted to a school in Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg on Friday morning. The development comes after The Hindu reported how the residents were living in tents in pitiable conditions for 12 days since the incident on July 19. A resident identified as Kuber Chandra Kotiyal, a security guard by profession, said that on Friday morning, local AAP MLA Praveen Kumar along with officials from the District Magistrate’s office had come to the tents and told the residents that they were shifting them to Andhra Education Society School after which a bus was provided. “The officials also said that they would move us to a permanent place in the next 10 days,” he said. Talking about the living condition, the residents said it was better than the tents. “We are now at least in a clean space and don’t have to worry about rain, heat, insects and electricity,” he said. The residents said that they have been allotted four rooms and four toilets along with mattresses. “People from an NGO also came and distributed essential items. At the moment, we are satisfied but still waiting for a roof over our head,” said Santosh. The MLA said that, “About 50 families have been shifted. They have facilities of water, electricity and toilets. Food is also being provided to them. Government is also in talks with Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board to help provide them the flats that have been constructed by them but it’ll take a month or more,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/anna-nagar-jj-cluster-residents-shifted-from-tent-to-school/article32245357.ece

01 August 2020||GURUGRAM,||Man beaten in public over ‘beef’ suspicion||A young man transporting meat in his vehicle was chased by a gang of motorcyclist for around half-an-hour before being waylaid and beaten up in full public view near Jama Masjid main market off Jail Road here on Friday. The police suspect the man, a Muslim, was beaten up on suspicion of transporting beef. Gurugram Police Spokesperson Subhash Boken said one of the accused, Pradeep, 26, was arrested. “The motive behind the attack is not clear, but it could be prompted by suspicion over transportation of beef. The samples of the meat are taken.” The assailants are booked under charges of rioting, unlawful assembly, causing grievous hurt and wrongful confinement, among others. Tough time for police The assailants even broke the windshield of the police vehicle in a bid to pull out the man, Lukmaan, 28. The police had a tough time controlling the mob to take the injured to a hospital. Riding on motorcycles, the assailants, beat up the man behind Jama Masjid main market before they bundled him up in his own vehicle, drove to Sohna Road and again brutally thrashed him. In one of the videos of the incident, shot in Badshahpur, a man can be seen kicking Lukmaan on the face while he is surrounded by the public. A police man also features in the video trying to prevent the man from attacking the victim. Lukmaan was driving towards Gurugram from Nuh’s Ghasera village around 9 a.m. carrying the meat to be delivered at Tahir Qureshi’s shop at Jama Masjid main market when he realised that he was being chased. The motorcyclists even tried to waylay him near Sector 56 traffic signal, but he sped up the vehicle, according to the First Information Report. Meanwhile, he called Tahir for help. Attacked others too “Soon after I received a call from Lukmaan, I rang the Police Control Room seeking their help immediately. I called up the police four times till Lukmaan, being chased by the men, reached the Masjid Market, but no one turned up. I again called up the PCR for the fifth time while he was being beaten up with iron rods and hammers, but the police reached 15 minutes after they had driven away with him,” said Tahir, the president of the Masjid Market. He said the assailants attacked those who tried to intervene. While he was being thrashed near Jail Mor, a policeman informed at Badshahpur police station and a team reached the spot to rescue him. Tahir said that Lukmaan had no personal enmity with the assailants and he was beaten up on suspicion of carrying beef. He claimed that he had been running the meat shop for almost five decades now and not indulged in any illegal activity.  The motive behind the attack is not clear, but it could be prompted by suspicion over transportation of beef. The samples of the meat are taken   Subhash Boken Gurugram Police Spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-beaten-in-public-over-beef-suspicion/article32245354.ece

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said that keeping in view the facts that Ms. Jaitly “was not arrested in the present case, however, without commenting on the merits of the appeal, I am of the view that the appellant [Ms. Jaitly] deserves suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal”. The court has also issued notice to CBI on Ms. Jaitly’s plea challenging the trial court’s judgment of July 21 and order on sentence of July 30 where Ms. Jaitly has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for four years with fine of Rs. 50,000 for the offence punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 9 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Ms. Jaitly and two others were held guilty of corruption in a 2000-01 case related to a purported defence deal. It was argued by Ms. Jaitly’s counsel that she was neither caught red-handed accepting the money nor she is beneficiary of the money as alleged. Moreover, she was not arrested and faced the trial and continued to appear before the trial court as and when directed, her counsel stated. “In addition, during the present pandemic situation, the appeal is not likely to be heard, anytime soon, therefore, the sentence of the appellant may be suspended during pendency of the appeal,” her plea stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-stays-jail-term-to-jaya-jaitly-in-corruption-case/article32245352.ece
