25 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. renews offer for dialogue||A day after farmer unions rejected its offer for talks, the Union government on Thursday extended a fresh invitation for dialogue and reiterated its commitment to finding a logical solution to all the issues raised by them. In a three-page letter to the unions, Vivek Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Agriculture Ministry, said the government had always been discussing the issues with an open mind and honest intentions to end the agitation, and sought a convenient date and time for further discussions. He sought details of the issues to be discussed. The letter was written in the context of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s reply to the government’s earlier offer on Wednesday. However, the fresh letter said the three laws on agricultural reforms were not related to the minimum support price (MSP) and would not impact it in any manner; therefore, putting forth any new demand on this front was not justified. The government was still ready to discuss all the issues raised by the unions, the letter said. The unions, in their reply on Wednesday, had objected to the written proposal earlier, saying it did not mention amendments to the Essential Commodities Act. The letter clarified that the written proposal was based on the issues identified during the December 3 meeting. It added that the government was ready for talks on any issues, including those not identified during the December 3 meeting. All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee general secretary Avik Shah said the government should start engaging farmers on an agenda that addressed their “real issues”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-renews-offer-for-dialogue/article33414490.ece

Teams of officers are also tracing their primary and secondary contacts who include their families, friends, work colleagues and other acquaintances who may have met them after their return. Officers have obtained a list of passengers from international airports in Mumbai, Benglauru and Goa about travellers who have arrived from England and have a travel history connected to the district. “All the returnees are non-symptomatic. Some of them have COVID-19 negative certificates, but some don’t. But we are getting all of them getting tested,” said District Surveillance Officer B.N. Tukkar. All returnees and family members are being asked to undergo RT-PCR tests. If they are found positive for COVID-19, they will be compulsorily shifted to the district hospital. A ward is being set up there for these returnees. The treatment protocol is the same as that for COVID-19. The first round of tracing has revealed that all returnees came before December 13. This means that some of them have completed two weeks in Belagavi and some have completed one week. But all of them have been asked them to remain home quarantined for two weeks after their tests, even if they are found to be negative. All senior citizens whether they are returnees or their contacts, will be strictly monitored. They are being asked not to venture out of their home at any cost. They will be asked to install Arogya Setu and other relevant mobile applications. Health Department officers will be visiting their houses at least once every day. “A team of para-medical staff and ASHAs continues to identify Britain returnees and trace their contacts,” Dr. Tukkar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/belagavi-district-admn-launches-process-to-identify-uk-returnees/article33414609.ece

25 December 2020||MANGALURU,||Cyber Crime Police arrest man from Chitradurga posing as India Post officer||The Cyber Crime Police of Mangaluru City Police on Tuesday arrested a 23-year-old man from Chitradurga district on the charge of cheating gullible public using social media platforms by creating over 20 fake Facebook accounts. The police gave the name of the accused as Parameshwarappa alias Param, son of Rangappa, resident of Kurubarahalli village, Hosadurga taluk, Chitradurga district. After being produced before the jurisdictional magistrate, he was handed over to police custody to undergo COVID-19 test, Commissioner of Police Vikash Kumar Vikash said in an official release here on Thursday. It all started with a complaint from N. Sri Harsha, Senior Superintendent of Posts, Mangaluru, to the Cyber Crime Police on December 2 that Parameshwarappa had sought an alliance with a girl from Goa, claiming that he was a senior postal officer working in Mangaluru. He had also shared two videos claiming to be a recipient of the Rajyotsava award and the Meghdoot award with her family. When the girl’s family did a cross check with the Mangaluru Postal Department, it was revealed that Parameshwarappa was not a postal employee in Mangaluru. Accordingly, Mr. Harsha filed the complaint seeking action for impersonation against him. Again on December 20, the Cyber Crime Police received complaints from two constables attached to the City Armed Reserve Police, Mangaluru, that Parameshwarappa had cheated them of about Rs. 6 lakh promising Group A and B posts with India Post by projecting himself as a senior postal officer. Both the cases were taken up for investigation by the Cyber Crime Police Inspector B.C. Girish under the guidance of Mr. Vikash and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar. Upon learning that both the cases were interconnected, Mr. Girish along with his personnel secured Parameshwarappa at the Bejai KSRTC Terminal on Tuesday. During initial inquiry, Parameshwarappa revealed that he had created 20 fake FB profiles under different names with an intention to cheat people. He would befriend senior officials with various departments on FB to lend credence to his story and pretend to be a senior Postal Department official. So far, he had cheated 13 people to the tune of Rs. 15 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh, Mr. Vikash said. Police have seized a laptop, five mobile phones, duplicate identity cards of the Postal Department and a debit card.   The police gave the name of the accused as Parameshwarappa alias Param, son of Rangappa, resident of Kurubarahalli village, Hosadurga taluk Police action comes after a complaint from Senior Superintendent of Posts, Mangaluru Division||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cyber-crime-police-arrest-man-from-chitradurga-posing-as-india-post-officer/article33415074.ece
25 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Free provision kits till April||On Thursday, the Cabinet decided to extend the free distribution of provision kits to ration card holders irrespective of their income status till April next. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said an estimated 80 lakh families would benefit from the scheme. The COVID-19 crisis had cratered household economies. However, the government had ensured no one starved. It had found resources to bolster the social security benefit net even as conventional revenue streams dried up. He had earlier announced that the government would provide COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to citizens. The government also said it would generate 50,000 jobs in the coming months and reduce the State's power consumption by replacing conventional street lamps with LED lighting. Persons between the age of 50 and 65 could apply for jobs via employment exchanges. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) had swept back to power in the local body polls on its social welfare schemes strength. The government, it appeared, wanted to maintain the "winning" momentum until the Assembly elections in May next. The government appeared focussed on building infrastructure and improving the health and education sectors. The Chief Minister said the KSDP would supply life-saving medicines for organ transplant patients at one-fifth of the market price. He promised free internet connectivity via the K-FON project to BPL families in February. He also announced a slew of projects, including Kochi water metro and rural roads, to enhance mobility. He said more Kudumbashree budget hotels would offer affordable dining to citizens. The government also placed a premium on modernising schools and colleges. A flop: Opposition Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Vijayan had set out to pull the wool over the public's eyes with the same set of lies. The so-called 100-day programme of the government was a flop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/free-provision-kits-till-april/article33414652.ece
25 December 2020||ANANTAPUR,||Two arrested in bank employee’s murder case in Anantapur||The Anantapur police on Thursday arrested two accused in the murder of SBI Credit Cards outsourced employee Snehalatha and confiscated a motorcycle used during the crime along with four cell phones. There was a huge turnout of general public and Dalit groups at the house of Snehalatha to pay respects to the mortal remains. They poured out anger against the police for their lack of immediate action on the frantic calls to Disha App and Dial 100 by the victim’s mother. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to the parents of the victim in addition to the relief of Rs. 8.25 lakh, five acres of agricultural land, a house, a government job for one in the family and provisions for three months as per G.O. 95, Collector Gandham Chandrudu said. At a press conference , SP B. Satya Yesu Babu said that Gutti Rajesh, 23, and his friend Sake Karthik, 28, were arrested based on the call records and CCTV footages in Dharmavaram and Anantapur. The victim had called the accused first after 25 days on December 22. While she was coming along with Rajesh on his bike to Anantapur, he throttled her to death suspecting her fidelity. “The accused was in a sexual relationship with the girl for the past four years even while she was a minor. Hence a case under POCSO Act will be registered against Rajesh, while Karthik had abetted the crime by advising his friend to get rid of the girl and was interacting with Rajesh before and after the crime,” Mr. Yesu Babu observed. Protest Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Women’s Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma, along with Anantapur MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy, visited the house of the victim and promised all help from the State government. But they were gheraoed by Dalit activists who demanded immediate action against the police personnel responsible for the delay in action, which, according to them, led to the crime taking place. “The mindset of boys needs to be changed as they have been taking women for granted and resorting to all kinds of atrocities,” Ms. Padma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-arrested-in-bank-employees-murder-case/article33414495.ece

25 December 2020||New Delhi,||Plea for SIT probe into alleged custodial death during Delhi riots||The Delhi High Court on Thursday issued notice to Delhi Police on a petition by a 61-year-old widow seeking constitution of a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the alleged custodial death of her son during the north-east Delhi riots. Faizan, 23, was last seen in a viral video being rounded up by policemen with four other Muslim youth and forced to sing the national anthem on February 24 this year. In her petition, Kismatun alleged that “the policemen kicked the five Muslim men with their boots, beat them with their lathis and taunted them saying, ‘ Y eh loh azaadi (Here, take freedom)’. They forced them to sing the national anthem while they were lying down, in a grievously wounded condition”. The plea alleged that Faizan was in the “control and custody of the policemen from the time he was wrongfully confined and assaulted on February 24, till he was released in a precarious health condition on February 25 from Jyoti Nagar police station around 11 p.m.”. He succumbed to his injuries the next day at the Lok Nayak Hospital. ‘Denied critical care’ Advocate Vrinda Grover, representing Ms. Kismatun, said her son was denied access to critical medical care all through his illegal detention from the evening of February 24 till almost midnight on February 25. “The MLC (medico-legal certificate) from GJB (Guru Teg Bahadur) Hospital dated February 24 records that Faizan was in need of specialised care, but the police took him to Jyoti Nagar police station. It was only when Faizan’s condition turned precarious and it appeared that he may not survive that he was released from the police station,” the plea stated. “The mere release from the police station prior to his death would not absolve the policemen of having committed murder in custody, and the petitioner is seeking justice for the same,” advocate Grover said. Faizan’s murder case was registered at the Bhajanpura police station on February 28. The investigation was later transferred to the Crime Branch of Delhi Police. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait has directed the police to submit a status report on the case before the next date of hearing on February 1, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/plea-for-sit-probe-into-alleged-custodial-death-during-delhi-riots/article33414739.ece
25 December 2020||CHITTOOR,||Jumbo menace worries farmers in Chittoor||Tension gripped about a dozen villages in V. Kota mandal after a herd of 17 wild elephants from the forests of Karnataka strayed into Chittoor district in the early hours of Thursday. By evening, the herd was seen roaming close to the fields at Kummaramadugu and Dandikuppam hamlets of the mandal. According to information, the herd made its way to V. Kota after the forest officials undertook a drive to send them back into their habitat. After reaching Madderi in Kolar district, the herd all of a sudden crossed the Palamaner-Hosur national highway and entered Chittoor district. The farmers are a worried lot that the pachyderms are habituated to raiding the crops after dusk. On receiving information from the elephant-trackers, the forest officials of Chittoor West division rushed to the spot and deployed additional forces at vulnerable villages to prevent the entry of the wild animals into \uman habitations. Farmers of Thota Kanuma, Chinna Syama, Mornapalle, and Raghavapalle sought the forest officials to initiate immediate steps to drive the elephants back into the thickets. “ At a time when we are waiting for harvest, the presence of the wild elephants is a nightmare to us,” said a farmer in V. Kota, Srinivas Gowd. Additional forces Forest Range Officer (Palamaner) B. Srinivasulu told The Hindu that he, along with a 20-member team of elephant trackers camp at Thotakanuma to prevent the herd from moving towards Palamaner. “Now, our immediate task is to drive the elephants towards Tamil Nadu, as the possibility of the herd retreating into Karnataka is remote. We are taking all care to protect the standing crops. If needed, we will deploy additional forces of trackers from Kuppam range. As the herd is moving with two baby elephants, it is difficult to achieve the task immediately. We are monitoring their movement,” said the FRO and asked the farmers to abandon night vigil in the fields till the herd was driven back into the thickets. It was only last week that the forest personnel drove away a 13-member herd from Tamil Nadu back into their habitat after a three-day effort when they strayed into Somala mandaland camped atop a hillock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jumbo-menace-worries-ap-farmers/article33414431.ece

25 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Uncertainty over reopening date puts school managements in a fix||Amidst confusion over the date for reopening schools, managements are in a dilemma on whether to begin preparations for it or not. The State government is yet to take a final decision. Although the government initially announced that schools would reopen on January 1, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday said the government would take a final call later next week. Sanitising classrooms School managements will have to follow the standard operating procedure, get the premises and classrooms cleaned thoroughly before reopening. “We depend on third-party agencies to sanitise our classrooms and if the government takes a decision next week, all schools may not be able to complete the sanitisation process as the slots may not be available,” said D. Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools. Schools are also facing shortage of funds as many parents have not paid fees for 2020-21 academic year. Many parents reluctant Private schools affiliated to central boards said a majority of the parents do not want to send their children to school. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS Group of Schools, said that only 20% parents of class 10 and 12 students had given consent for their children to attend classes from January. “The rest of the parents are happy with the online classes and we have completed the entire portions through online classes,” he said. Mr. Khan also said many parents were reluctant as the school buses were not plying. “The buses are run by our vendors, which is outsourced. They said it would not be feasible for them to run the buses for only a few students,” he said. Some schools feel that they will unable to bear the cost of following all the SOPs. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said they have decided not to reopen the school as following all the SOPs would entail a lot of expenditure. “Besides, we do not want to take any risk, if the students contract COVID-19 while attending physical classes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uncertainty-over-reopening-date-puts-schools-in-dilemma/article33414610.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Construction major ‘prints out’ a building||The 700 sq ft building looks like a normal concrete shell structure. There is nothing to indicate that it is not one of the usual concrete buildings of the urban landscape, but it is special. What makes it unique is that the ground-plus-first floor building in Kancheepuram, about 75 km from Chennai, has been fully constructed using only a 3D printer and a special concrete mix. L&T, the engineering and construction conglomerate, built this concrete building using a fully automated 3D printer with an indigenously developed concrete mixture and some manual labour. The special concrete mix used by the printer has been prepared using the same concrete composition used for regular construction materials. The company hopes the project would play a disruptive role in the construction industry. ‘At a nascent stage’ The 3D printing technology is a computer-controlled execution of printing an object layer-by-layer and is being used for manufacturing various prototype models and producing complex shapes of engineering products, but 3D printing with concrete has remained at a nascent stage internationally until now, said the company spokesman. M.V. Satish, senior executive vice-president (Buildings), L&T, said the success of the building project lies in its construction, executed in both vertical and horizontal methods using reinforced bars and welded mesh. The building project was executed at an open project site and completed within 106 printing hours. The vertical and horizontal methodology formulated for the 3D building project meets the provisions of the Indian codes for construction. The cost is also optimal, compared to what is spent on traditional manpower and material-intensive construction, he added. The 700 sq ft building is an advancement over the company’s project last year – a 3D printed 240 sq ft one-bedroom house aimed at promoting building layouts for the economically weaker sections, and exploring 3D printing technology for house construction. It could make housing for all viable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/construction-major-prints-out-a-building/article33414509.ece

25 December 2020||New Delhi,||India files appeal against Vodafone case verdict||India has challenged in a Singapore court the international arbitration tribunal verdict that overturned its demand for Rs. 22,100 crore in back taxes from Vodafone Group Plc, sources said on Thursday. An international arbitration court had on September 25 rejected tax authorities’ demand for Rs. 22,100 crore in back taxes and penalties relating to the British telecom giant’s 2007 acquisition of an Indian operator. India had 90 days to file an appeal, and the same was done in a Singapore court earlier this week. This appeal also sets the stage for the government to challenge the order of a three-member tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that asked India to return $1.4 billion to British oil and gas company Cairn Energy plc. The government had used a 2012 law that gave tax authorities the power to reopen past cases, to seek taxes from Vodafone and Cairn over alleged capital gains made several years ago. Both Vodafone and Cairn had challenged the tax demands under bilateral investment protection treaties and initiated arbitration. Sources said the government believes that taxation is not covered under the investment protection treaties signed with various countries and the law on taxation is a sovereign right of the country. While the treaties are primarily aimed at protection of investments, the tax is levied on ‘returns’ earned by entities. Vodafone Group declined to comment on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-files-appeal-in-vodafone-case/article33414500.ece

Sivasankar have accumulated several huge movable assets in their name through gold smuggling. In its additional complaint filed before the Principal Sessions Judge, Ernakulam, which is trying the money laundering case booked against the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the agency on Thursday said the accused also concealed the ill-gotten money and attempted to project the movable assets gained through it as untainted. Sarith, Swapna, and Sandeep got involved in gold smuggling, earned lucrative profits, and amassed movable assets. Sivasankar knowingly assisted the trio in gold smuggling, it said. The former bureaucrat received illegal gratification for facilitating the award of contract of UAE Red Crescent-sponsored LIFE Mission project in Wadakkanchery to Unitac Builders and Sane Ventures. He parked the money in a bank locker held jointly by Swapna and P. Venugopal, a chartered accountant, the ED submitted. ‘Bribe’ in bank locker The Rs. 1.5 crore seized by the National Investigation Agency from the bank locker was bribe received by Sivasankar from Unitac, according to the ED. Sarith, Swapna, Sandeep, and Sivasankar committed the offence of money laundering and rendered themselves liable for punishment under the Act.

25 December 2020||New Delhi,||DJB office vandalised by BJP workers: AAP||A group of BJP workers, led by party’s Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta, on Thursday allegedly attacked the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) headquarters and assaulted the employees on the premises. In multiple videos released by the Aam Aadmi Party, a mob chanting “ Adesh ji sangharsh karo” and “ Jai Shri Ram ” can be seen forcing its way through the main gate of the DJB headquarters and vandalising property. Mr. Gupta can also be seen in the videos, both inside and outside the main DJB building. Mr. Gupta, however, claimed that the attack was carried out by AAP workers. “In the interest of Delhiites, the BJP was staging a peaceful demonstration outside the Delhi Jal Board headquarters against the tanker scam, but Aam Aadmi Party karyakartas (workers) forcibly barged into the headquarters, vandalised the property and attacked the BJP karyakartas ,” he alleged. A senior police officer said 30 people were detained in connection with the vandalisation and later released. No complaint has been received in the matter, said the officer, adding that they are obtaining CCTV and mobile footage to identify the people involved in the incident. ‘Employees injured’ DJB Vice-Chairman and AAP legislator Raghav Chadha said at a press conference, “Hundreds of BJP leaders and goons entered through the [DJB] gate by force. From the reception to the Vice-Chairman’s office, they vandalised doors, windows, and glass. They broke computers, printers and other things. They assaulted the staff too.” “On the floor, you can see blood drops of DJB officers. Some of our staffers are hospitalised and some are getting treated at a dispensary,” he added. Mr. Chadha alleged that the attack was carried out with the “help” of the Delhi police. He said the BJP workers asked them to “stop supporting the protesting farmers and threatened to attack other AAP leaders too”. The BJP Delhi chief also tweeted photos of him and other party workers protesting outside the DJB office. Mr. Gupta alleged that “AAP goons” attacked BJP workers and severely injured them. “The [Arvind] Kejriwal government has conspired to defame the BJP. One BJP karyakarta  got injured in the backbone and was admitted to a trauma centre. Four other karyakartas  have suffered serious injuries,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/djb-office-vandalised-by-bjp-workers-aap/article33414738.ece

25 December 2020||Bengaluru,||No night curfew in Karnataka||Less than 24 hours after issuing an order imposing night curfew, the Karnataka government on Thursday did a U-turn and withdrew the curfew which was to be in place till January 2 morning. This was following criticism not only from the Opposition Congress but also from within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on lack of consultation, according to government sources. In a short statement on Thursday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said that the decision to withdraw the night curfew was taken “following public opinion that it was not required”. The decision was taken after consultations with Cabinet colleagues and senior officials, he said. Appeal to public On the eve of Christmas and New Year celebrations, the Chief Minister appealed to the people to follow COVID-19-related rules and protocols strictly and cooperate with the government to contain the spread of the virus. On Wednesday evening, the State government issued the order clamping night curfew between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. starting from December 24 to January l (5 a.m. on January 2), 2021, for containing the spread of the new mutated strain of the coronavirus. Earlier on the same day, the government had announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m but eventually not only cut it by two hours but also allowed a slew of concessions within this period. BJP legislators, including Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and A.H. Vishwanath, had expressed their reservations on the relevance of the night curfew. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar too had termed the decision “illogical”. “From morning to evening, any number of people can come together. We had elections, the Assembly session and thousands of people coming together in markets,” Mr. Shivakumar said. Conflicting messages The State government’s flip-flop has left the State’s COVID-19 experts disconcerted. In the absence of government restrictions, people should go in for self-imposed curfew and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, they said. Otherwise, the State may witness a spike in cases in the first week of January, they warned. Expressing displeasure over the government’s U-turn on night curfew, a senior member of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee said: “Messages by the government have to be clear and firm. You cannot waver on decisions on restrictions, especially during a pandemic.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-night-curfew-in-karnataka/article33414424.ece
25 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘PM’s charge a travesty of truth’||Opposition parties have said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s allegations against them of “spreading lies” on the farm laws is a “travesty of truth”. They also sought to put some distance between themselves and the ongoing farmers’ protests, claiming that the protesters have come together on their own. The signatories to a joint statement include former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar, chairperson of People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration Farooq Abdullah, DMK leader T.R. Baalu, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D. Raja, CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, All India Forward Bloc leader Debabrata Biswas and Revolutionary Socialist Party leader Manoj Bhattacharya. The Opposition parties said that they have only expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers. “The call for this ongoing historic struggle was given by more than 500 kisan organisations from all over the country under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha [SKM].” The parties said the “unity, grit and determination” shown by lakhs of farmers in the midst of a severe cold wave was a testimony to the fact that farmers across the country had risen in opposition to the farm laws. So far, 32 farmers have lost their lives in this agitation, the parties stated. The parties pointed out that they had protested against these laws in Parliament. And that the MPs who sought a vote during the passage of the agriculture Bills were suspended. “Amongst the many unsubstantiated accusations made, one of them is that those who spoke of agrarian reforms in election manifestos earlier are now opposing the reforms. Yes, we are for reforms, but what sort of reforms? Opposition parties seek reforms to strengthen Indian agriculture; enhance the prosperity of our farmers; and ensure continued food security for our people and the country. The present farm laws undermine these very objectives,” the statement said. The BJP had pulled out the Congress’s manifesto and Mr. Pawar’s old letters to point out that the Opposition parties were working towards similar laws. Mr. Modi had repeatedly assured farmers that the MSP would not be removed and accused the Opposition of spreading “big lies”. While Mr. Modi talked of implementing the Swaminathan Commission report, in reality his government had expressed its inability to implement the MSP rate proposed by the commission, the parties said. “Likewise, there was accusation that Opposition parties are “shooting from the shoulders of the farmers” in order to “regain lost political ground”. Despite all tall claims of improving farmers’ prosperity and implementing a higher MSP, the fact remains that farmers’ distress due to indebtedness is growing, leaving a record number of them with no other recourse than committing suicides,” the statement noted. The Opposition once again demanded the repeal of the three farm laws. The government should hold a discussion on agrarian reforms with farmers and all stakeholders and draft new laws based on these consultations, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pms-charge-a-travesty-of-truth/article33414449.ece
25 December 2020||Kolkata,||‘Visva-Bharati essence of self-reliance’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday emphasised that Visva-Bharati embodied Rabindranath Tagore’s vision for the country. The university was also an essence of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India), he noted. Mr. Modi was participating in Visva-Bharati’s centenary celebrations via videoconferencing. He said the institution had been a venerable source of energy for the country for the past 100 years. “100 years of Visva-Bharati is a matter of pride to every Indian. The journey of Visva-Bharati is unique as it reflects the ideas, philosophy, and efforts of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore for the future of the country. This place is a source of constant energy to the country which has given artists, musicians, economist and scientists to the country.” The university was set up by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in 1921 at Bolpur in West Bengal’s Birbhum district. Message to world Mr. Modi reflected on how the university was a seat of learning and living in the lap of nature. The country was taking the message of Visva-Bharati to the world, he stated. “Through International Solar Alliance, the country is playing an important part in conservation of environment . India is the only big country working in the right direction for achieving the targets of Paris Accord,” he said. The Prime Minister also touched on the historic context in which the university was founded. “When we talk about freedom struggle, the 19th and 20th century comes to our mind. But it is also a fact that the foundation of such movements was kept centuries ago,” he said, referring to the “Bhakti” movement. “The tradition of ‘Bhakti’ played a crucial part in the ideas that laid the foundation of these ideas that helped in the freedom struggle. In the ‘Bhakti’ period, these reformers gave the ideas that were not limited to a region. It gave a collective insight and self-reliance to people,” he said. Along with the “Bhakti”  tradition, there was also a movement where people led “karm andolan”, a movement based on active action where, for centuries, people of the country fought against oppression and for independence. He referred to Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, Rani Lakshmi Bai and Birsa Munda as glowing examples of the tradition. A number of educational institutions, including the Benaras Hindu University, the Aligarh Muslim University and several other varsities, came up across the country. It was the collective of the three movements that led to the Freedom Struggle and a national awakening. Touching on the Gurudev’s ideas of “self-reliance”, he said: “Tagore wanted to see our villages, atmanirbhar (self-reliant), our agriculture atmanirbhar, our art and literature atmanirbhar and also our businesses atmanirbhar”. “Gurudev spoke about self-empowerment (atmashakti) in self-reliance (atmanirbhar). The university is called Visva-Bharati, which brings a synergy between country and the rest of the world. Atmanirbhar Bharat also draws its inspiration from here,” he asserted. Mr. Modi touched upon the new National Education Policy, saying it drew its inspiration from Gurudev’s ideas of holistic learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/visva-bharati-essence-of-self-reliance/article33414469.ece

A few hours before that, M. Poshaiah (45) working in a government office as maskuri (class four employee) complained of chest pain and died of cardiac arrest. Both of them belong to Mamidyala village, one of the submerged villages under Kondapochammasagar. The oustees of Kondapohamma have been rehabilitated at Tunkibollaram Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) colony. Three villages and one tanda – Mamidyala, Bahilampur, Thanedarpally and Thanedarpally tanda – were re-established here. As two persons died, the relatives tried to bury the bodies in two pits dug side by side. However, a farmer of the neighbouring area objected to burying bodies stating that it would be a problem for them. There was a heated argument for some time and finally the oustees buried the bodies in the huge pit they dug for burial. While agreeing that the bodies were buried in the government land though it was not allotted for grave yard, the Mamidyala villagers alleged that despite repeated appeals their request for burial ground was not answered. “We do not know where to perform last rites as grave yard was not yet allotted. We came here about eight months ago. What can we do expect burying in government land,” asked one of the residents of the village, on condition of anonymity. It was stated that more than 10 bodies were buried so far at this government land which was marked for construction of complex. When contacted, officials have not responded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dam-oustees-struggle-to-find-a-place-for-the-dead/article33414433.ece
25 December 2020||New Delhi,||India is now an ‘imaginary democracy’, says Rahul||In one of his sharpest attacks on the Union government over the three farm laws, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said India was now an “imaginary democracy”. He alleged that even Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat would be branded a “terrorist” if he were to stand in opposition to the government. Mr. Gandhi’s remarks on democracy was in response to a question on the police detaining his colleagues, including party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, when they were on their way to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to hand over a memorandum with two-crore signatures seeking the repeal of the farm laws. However, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Mr. Gandhi were allowed to submit to the memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind. “Whoever stands in front of Narendra Modi ji , he says something or the other against him. When farmers stand in front of him, they are branded. Labourers stand in front of him and are branded as terrorists. If one day Mohan Bhagwat stands in front of him, he will be called a terrorist,” he stated. Asked for his comments on police detaining his party colleagues, he said it was the government’s usual way of “detaining or beating up” protesters. “Which country are you talking about? Are you talking about India? There is no democracy in India,” he said. Sharing a video of his press interaction, Mr. Gandhi tweeted, “India is now an imaginary democracy”. The BJP, countering Mr. Gandhi’s offensive on the farm laws, asked if the agriculture produce marketing (APMC) Act was applicable in Kerala. “Rahul Gandhi is Wayanad MP. Is there APMC Act in Kerala? If not, then, why don’t you stand with farmers there? How is it possible that something is good for Kerala and not in Delhi? He must clarify where and with what intention he is supporting farmers,” said BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-is-now-an-imaginary-democracy-says-rahul/article33414447.ece

25 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala again seeks Governor’s nod for Assembly session||The Cabinet has once again decided to seek Governor Arif Muhammad Khan’s assent to convoke an emergency session of the Assembly on December 31 to discuss the fallout of the farmers’ agitation in rice-bowl States in North India. The Governor had turned down a similar request on December 21 because he felt the Assembly lacked the "jurisdiction to offer a solution" to the strike.  Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government hoped Mr. Khan would change his mind. He spelt out the need for the special Assembly session at an hour-long press conference here on Thursday. The government feared the ongoing farmers’ agitation could adversely impact the State's food security. Kerala was predominantly a consumer State. It relied heavily on food imports from neighbouring States. Farmers were on the warpath against the Centre's newly enacted agriculture reforms. Food security Kerala was anxious whether the disruption in the agriculture sector would imperil its food security. The State was not immune from the fall out of the farmers’ agitation nor the controversial agriculture laws passed by the Centre. The emergency warranted the urgent convening of the Assembly to weigh the crisis. The Assembly also need to plot a response to the situation. Mr. Vijayan said the Governor had no discretionary powers in the matter. He was legally bound to give his approval once a majority government decided to convene the Assembly. The Governor could not arbitrate on the topics of deliberation in the Assembly. Mr. Vijayan said the government was optimistic that Mr. Khan would give his assent. The Raj Bhavan has not indicated how it would handle the latest request from the Cabinet. In the past, the Governor maintained that the Assembly had no mandate to evaluate the constitutional validity of the acts of Parliament. He had opposed the move to pass a unanimous resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-again-seeks-governors-nod-for-assembly-session/article33414427.ece
25 December 2020||New Delhi,||Centre may accept Sumi’s ceasefire offer||The Union government is likely to accept NSCN-K (National Socialist Council of Nagaland – Khaplang) leader Niki Sumi’s offer to revive the ceasefire agreement and the anti-terror cases lodged against him would be dealt with appropriately, a senior government official said. Security agencies have worked on Sumi’s return to India with an eye on concluding the Naga peace deal. The development comes ahead of Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Manipur and Assam on December 26 and 27. Sumi is wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly planning the attack on an Army convoy in Manipur’s Chandel district on June 4, 2015. As many as 18 Army personnel were killed in the ambush carried out by NSCN-K cadres who came from Myanmar. He carries a reward of Rs. 10 lakh on his arrest. The attack preceded the NSCN-K’s decision to unilaterally abrogate the ceasefire with the Centre in March 2015. Sumi was expelled from a Myanmar-based camp of the NSCN-K in June last, following which Indian security agencies have been trailing him. He floated a new outfit on December 18. A statement signed by Sumi and issued on Wednesday said, “NSCN/GPRN has been striving all these years to achieve an honourable and acceptable political solution to the Naga issue. NSCN/GPRN is also conscious of the overwhelming sentiments among the Naga people for an early solution to this long standing issue.” The official said, “If Sumi has to join the peace talks, then it is imperative that he agrees to a ceasefire pact with the Centre. This is one of the prerequisites of him coming to the dialogue table. The Naga peace deal has been lingering for decades.” When asked about the terror cases against Sumi, the official said, “the Centre will take a measured view but this is not the first time that cases will be dropped against a wanted person who has agreed for a peaceful solution.” Ban in 2015 The Union Home Ministry had banned the NSCN-K led by S.S Khaplang in 2015 after the Chandel ambush. On September 10, 2015, the NIA said in a statement, “S S Khaplang is head of the NSCN (K) group and Niki Sumi is holding the charge of armed wing of said group. They were closely associated with the decision to attack Assam Rifles personnel at Indira Gandhi Stadium, Kohima, on March 26 and subsequent string of attacks on armed forces, including the attack on 6 Dogra Regiment Convoy in Chandel district of Manipur on June four killing 18 Army personnel." Khaplang, a Hemi Naga from Myanmar who led the Naga insurgency movement for decades, died in 2017. He formed his own outfit in 1988 after he fell out with Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, the other two Naga leaders who went on to form the NSCN-IM, the group that signed a framework agreement with the government in 2015 to find a permanent solution to the Naga issue. Naga outfits envisage a “Greater Nagalim” or a contiguous land for the Nagas spanning over the States of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Myanmar. Sumi, a resident of Nagaland, will likely be a part of the seven other Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) that are in talks with Naga interlocutor R.N Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-may-accept-sumis-ceasefire-offer/article33414471.ece

The Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports, headed by BJP MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, noted that due to the lockdown and the travel restrictions, sportspersons had lost international and even national competition exposure. “The Department and National Sports Federations must ensure that players get an opportunity to play maximum international tournaments before the 2021 Olympic Games. International competitions should be accorded priority as they prepare athletes for pressure situations they may find themselves in during actual Olympics,” the panel stated in a report submitted to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday. The committee directed the government to create bio-bubbles in training facilities where athletes can isolate themselves in a secure environment and train with minimal possibility of being infected. It proposed “giving individualised programmes to athletes capable of reaching finals or medal hopefuls and also providing for sending them abroad as soon as possible in a bubble environment”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-recommends-training-exposure/article33414450.ece

The codification of laws on wages, social security, occupational safety and industrial relations into four codes is expected to be implemented in the next financial year, for which the process of framing rules is under way. Ten out of the 12 Central trade unions declined to attend the meeting called by Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar. While the Code on Wages Rules and the Industrial Relations Code Rules were discussed on Thursday, the discussion on the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code Rules and Social Security Code Rules would be discussed on January 12. In a statement, the joint platform of the 10 unions said the exercise was being undertaken “only to meet the criticism that this government at the Centre is violating tripartite consultations”. Call for dialogue In a letter to Mr. Gangwar on Tuesday, they wrote that the single-day meeting on all four codes with several unions and employers organisations would not be enough for a fruitful discussion. The letter was signed by the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the All India United Trade Union Centre, the Trade Union Coordination Committee, the Self Employed Women’s Association, the All India Central Council of Trade Unions, the Labour Progressive Federation and the United Trade Union Congress. AITUC general secretary Amarjeet Kaur told The Hindu that the joint platform would move the International Labour Organization against the “violation of tripartite consultation process”. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-linked Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, which attended the meeting, demanded that the definition of wages that limits allowances to 50% of total salary should not be frozen; the calculation of minimum wages should be done keeping in mind a family of six units; and a national minimum wage should be set, as opposed to the proposed rates for metro, non-metro and rural areas.

The Sabarimala temple pilgrimage, from December 20 to January 14, is expected to draw thousands from across the country. The State, represented by advocate G. Prakash, said the threat of a new virus strain and the recently concluded local body polls in Kerala posed a real and present danger during the temple season. “Entry to the temple is controlled by a virtual queue system managed by the police. Pilgrims are tested for COVID-19 before allowing them to enter the temple. An increase in the number of pilgrims will put the police and health officials under great strain and difficulty,” the State said.

The government had used a 2012 law that gave tax authorities the power to reopen past cases, to seek taxes from Vodafone and Cairn over alleged capital gains made several years ago. Both Vodafone and Cairn had challenged the tax demands under bilateral investment protection treaties and initiated arbitration. Sources said the government believes that taxation is not covered under investment protection treaties with various countries and the law on taxation is a sovereign right of the country. While the treaties are primarily aimed at protection of investments, the tax is levied on ‘returns’ earned by entities.

25 December 2020||Kolkata,||I was not invited by university, says Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that she had not been invited to mark the start of the centenary celebrations of Visva-Bharati University on Thursday, and also accused the Central university of insulting Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. “When did they invite me…For today’s foundation day, there was no invitation, no phone…I want to thank those who have nurtured the institution for 100 years. Those who at helm of affairs today they are temporary, their days are numbered,” Ms. Banerjee told presspersons at the State Secretariat. She said the university authorities had sought time to meet her during her visit to Bolpur later next week but she could not give them time. Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring to a connection between Gujarat and Rabindranath Tagore at the virtual inauguration of the centenary celebrations, she said that his language itself proved there was “political intention”. She dubbed the event as a “political event” and a “BJP event”. Ms. Banerjee also referred to a development where the Visva Bharati named Nobel laureate Amartya Sen among “unauthorised occupants” of land in Santiniketan and sent a letter to the West Bengal government in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-was-not-invited-by-university-says-mamata/article33414458.ece
25 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||‘Objection to new mosque untenable’||The five-acre land allotted for the construction of a mosque in Dhannipur in Ayodhya was not in any manner a barter or an exchange, but a relief carved out by the Supreme Court using its special powers, the trust set up to build the structure has asserted. The clarification was issued by the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation following questions raised by AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani, who reportedly termed the mosque and other facilities being constructed in Dhannipur “illegal” and impermissible under the Shariah. Mr. Jilani had allegedly told reporters that the proposed mosque violated the Waqf Act, arguing that mosques or land for them cannot be bartered. It also violated the Sharia law, he had said. Zufar Faruqi, chief trustee, Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, said the objection regarding the prohibition on barter or exchange of waqf properties “is false or seemingly made without reading of the judgment of the Supreme Court.” While the U.P. Sunni Central Waqf Board had argued before the Supreme Court that the erstwhile Babri Masjid was a waqf by user, such contention had not been accepted by the court, he said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/objection-to-new-mosque-untenable/article33414460.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Economic revival beating predictions: RBI bulletin||It added that despite headwinds, efforts by all stakeholders could put India on a faster growth trajectory. In another article in the bulletin on the half-yearly review of government finances, officials of the Fiscal Division of RBI’s Department of Economic and Policy Research warned that notwithstanding the severe impact of COVID-19 on government finances, it was imperative for the Centre and States to continue with the countercyclical fiscal measures to sustain the momentum of the recovery. Social sector support “Revenue expenditure measures undertaken to enhance social protections to the underprivileged and to address labour market dislocations might need to continue as the recovery is likely to be uneven across sectors,” they added. “Capital expenditure, which collapsed in the first half of this fiscal, will need to be scaled up as a priority. Public investment in healthcare, social housing, education and environmental protection is the need of the hour to build a more resilient and inclusive economy,” they stressed. The authors noted that views did not necessarily represent those of the central bank. Stating that two important forces — better handling of the pandemic and stimulus impact — were “conspiring to bless this turning of the page on the virus” the authors of the article on ‘State of the Economy’ stressed that India was bending the COVID infection curve. Since mid-September, barring localised surges, infections were falling week after week, and the recovery rate was nudging 95%, they said. The authors said an analysis of 12 months ahead forward earnings reveals improvement in the outlook for many companies. Sectors such as auto and capital goods that were severely impacted in lockdown are expecting a turnaround in forward earnings. Healthcare, information technology and fast moving consumer goods firms were sighting stronger earnings outlook.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/economic-revival-beating-predictions-rbi-bulletin/article33414418.ece

25 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC refuses to entertain plea for seat||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea by a student seeking allotment of seat in one of the State government-run medical colleges in Kerala. A Vacation Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee allowed Najma P.M. to withdraw her appeal. Ms. Najma said she had opted foremost for a seat in any of the government colleges in the State. Despite this, she was denied a seat. Instead, she argued, students ranked below her were given the seats surrendered to the State from the All India Quota. When the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations released the second allotment list after receipt of the surrendered seats, 24 candidates ranked below Ms. Najma were allotted them. She said the denial of a seat to her was illegal. The petition said she was allotted a college in the Andaman in the first round of counselling against 15% seats in the All India quota. In the second counselling, she was allotted a seat in Karwar Institute of Medical Sciences in Karnataka. However, she chose to join the Amala Medical College, Thrissur, based on allotment under the State quota. The Kerala High Court had declined her plea earlier, saying she had completed two rounds of counselling. The State counsel had said the seats were already filled up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-for-seat/article33414702.ece

25 December 2020||Bengaluru,||SC/ST panel cannot decide disputes, says Karnataka HC||The State Commission for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) is not empowered in law to adjudicate and decide disputes between the parties and pronounce its orders either interim or final as it is neither a tribunal nor a court, the High Court of Karnataka has said. “The commission cannot be construed to be a tribunal or a forum discharging the functions of a judicial character or court. Article 338 of the Constitution itself does not entrust the commission with the power to take up the role of a court or an adjudicatory tribunal and determine the rights of parties inter se ,” the High Court has observed. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while setting aside a 2016 direction of the commission asking the government to promote to a government employee in a dispute over seniority and date of promotion between two employees belonging to the Scheduled Caste M.B. Siddalingaswamy, a superintendent working in the Office of the Director, Department of Pre-University Education, had questioned the 2016 order of the commission on a plea filed by another employee, K.R. Muralidhar, also a superintendent in the same office. “...the powers bestowed upon the commission by the Constitution are procedural powers of the civil court for the purpose of investigating and enquiring into matters and are limited only for that purpose. The procedure that is conferred under Article 338 cannot be confused to be conferring a substantive power akin to that of a civil court or a tribunal which are adjudicating bodies of disputes of citizens,” the court held. As per the provisions of the Article 338 and its interpretation by the apex court, it is “unmistakably clear” that the commission does not have the power to adjudicate such disputes,the High Court said while noticing that the commission, without authority in law, had directed the government to grant retrospective promotion, correct seniority with consequential benefits, etc. while entertaining the plea of one of the employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scst-panel-cannot-decide-disputes-says-karnataka-hc/article33414419.ece
25 December 2020||MYSURU,||Watcher killed in Nagarahole||A forest watcher on jungle patrol duty was trampled to death by a wild elephant in Nagarahole National Park on Thursday. Gururaj, 52, was part of a three-member squad walking along the stipulated beat when a tusker charged and attacked the three guards around 3 p.m., taking them by surprise. The incident occurred near Gaddehadi which is about 1 km from the dormitory. While Gururaj sustained severe injuries the other two guards – Chandra and Ashok – escaped with minor injuries. Nagarahole Tiger Reserve Director Mahesh Kumar said despite their injuries both Chandra and Ashok managed to rescue Gururaj from the tusker. “He was fully conscious at that point of time but died while being shifted to hospital,” said Mr. Kumar. “He was fully conscious at that point of time but died while being shifted to hospital,” said Mahesh Kumar. Gururaj is survived by wife, a son and a daughter. The last rites will take place in his native place in Maddur, according to officials. He was under the “notified watcher” category who are neither permanent staff nor daily wagers. But such staff deployed as forest watchers are eligible for benefits of permanent employees apart from hardship allowance, besides being covered by insurance. “We will recommend all relief and compensation due to the family as Gururaj died when he was on duty,” Mr. Mahesh Kumar said. Incidentally, he is the second Forest Department staff to have died following an elephant attack in Nagarahole in recent years. In March 2018, the then Director of Nagarahole and Conservator of Forest S. Manikandan was killed in an elephant attack while he was assessing damage caused to the forest by a fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forest-watcher-trampled-to-death-by-tusker/article33414753.ece

Ms. Banerjee said no land would be acquired for the project and land would be allotted to industrial houses which wanted to set up facilities at the industrial park. Singur was the site of the proposed small car project of Tata Motors in the seventh Left Front rule.

25 December 2020||Mysuru,||Consumer group seeks reduction in pre-call COVID-19 messages||An NGO involved in consumer rights advocacy is preparing the grounds to approach the higher authorities to regulate the COVID-19 messages that one is forced to hear while making a telephone call each time. This is on the grounds that the man-hours lost and the economic loss incurred by hearing the same message each time a call is made during the day, was staggering while it no longer served the purpose of educating the public. It was in the first week of March that the Government of India had directed the telecom service providers to change the default ringtone and precede it with messages on the imperatives of maintaining social distance and ensuring use of hand sanitisers. But, nine months later there has been no signs of the pre-call messages being reduced which has irked a large section of the subscribers and consumer rights groups are now toying with the idea of approaching the relevant authorities to regulate it. Bhamy V. Shenoy, a consumer rights activist and Governing Council member of Consumer Voice, said a calculation by Mysuru-based social activist Roy Joseph indicated that India was losing nearly 2.5 crore man-hours every day. And if one attributed even Rs. 50 per hour, then the loss works out to around Rs. 125 crore per day or Rs. 45,625 crore per year. These figures are broad indicators and based on the assumption that 100 crore subscribers make three calls a day and have to listen to the 30-second audio every time they make a call. This translates to 2.5 crore hours per day and at Rs. 50 per hour it amounts to Rs. 125 crore per day, as per the rough calculation which has not factored in the cost of power to recharge the phones for three crore hours, according to Mr. Shenoy. He said Consumer Voice, which is a national-level voluntary action group of academicians and professionals constantly working to raise awareness on consumer rights and laws, was taking up the issue with the Telephone Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) or with the decision makers at a higher level. The existing technology should be able to stop giving the message after a mobile phone user has heard it 10 or 5 times in a month or it could be restricted to the first two calls a day rather than forcing the subscribers to listen to it every time, according to Mr. Shenoy. Consumer Voice activists aver that there was growing consensus that what started as a good cause has now become a nuisance. In addition to the man-hours wasted, it had ceased to serve as an educative tool, according to Mr. Shenoy. “It worked fine in the initial stages but given the public apathy to social distancing and use of masks, this is no longer working and even if the messages are changed and made relevant, people tend to ignore it as it is seen as a source of annoyance,”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/consumer-group-seeks-reduction-in-pre-call-covid-19-messages/article33414420.ece

His friend Shuhaib was injured in the incident. The police have filed a case against Muslim Youth League (MYL) leader Irshad and two other persons on the basis of an eyewitness account by another friend of Abdul. The incident occurred around 10.30 p.m., when a group waylaid Abdul and Shuhaib, both on their motorbikes, on the Kaluravi-old beach road. They stabbed Abdul on the chest and fled the spot. Abdul’s friends who were following on another motorbike rushed the duo to the hospital, but Adbul’s life could not be saved. One of these friends gave the statement to the police. Irshad is reportedly undergoing treatment for a head injury in a hospital at Mangaluru. Tension had prevailed in Kaluravi over the counting of votes in the recent polls. The police said the murder could be a result of it. League’s denial The DYFI alleged that the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) was behind the murder. The IUML denied the charget.

25 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Postal ballots for voters above 80 years||If the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the 2021 Assembly polls in Kerala will see the introduction of postal ballots for voters aged above 80 and the differently-abled, in addition to electors who test positive for COVID-19 or are in quarantine, Teeka Ram Meena, Chief Electoral Officer (Kerala), has said. “'District Election Officers have been directed to identify voters who are 80-plus or people with disabilities (PwD). Postal ballots will be optional for them. We will send them a form seeking their preference as to whether they would rather visit the polling booths to vote or use postal ballots,” Mr. Meena told The Hindu . However, the postal ballots for these voters will not be hand-delivered by teams led by Special Polling Officers (SPO) as done by the State Election Commission for the just-concluded local body elections. “We will adopt the same methodology that is used for despatching postal ballots to the service voters. We will send the ballots by post and voters can return them by post to the returning officers,” he said. Electors who test positive for COVID-19 or are in quarantine will be allowed to cast their votes directly at the polling stations in the final hour of polling. Additionally, every polling station will have a health nodal officer to make sure that the COVID-19 guidelines are complied with. Auxiliary booths The State may require at least 15,000 auxiliary polling booths for the 2021 Assembly elections if the COVID-19 situation persists and the voter population per booth has to be restricted to 1,000. “Creating auxiliary polling stations will be a major challenge as Election Commission of India (ECI) directives require us to locate the auxiliary stations in the same building as the main station as far as possible,” he said. Mr. Meena urged the public to use the campaign under way to update the voter rolls to include their names or make changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/postal-ballots-for-voters-above-80-years/article33414429.ece

The militants were trapped during a search and cordon operation in the Wanigam Payeen area of Baramulla in the morning. “The hiding militants opened fire on the search party, triggering an encounter,” the police said.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More diversion channels planned for southern suburbs||With its experience in draining floodwaters into waterways, the Water Resources Department (WRD) has proposed more diversion channels and cut-and-cover channels in the southern suburbs that witnessed inundation this northeast monsoon. However, a few residents have raised doubts about the efficiency and maintenance of these channels. The WRD took up 17 long-term flood mitigation projects in the southern suburbs after the 2015 floods. But some low-level areas at Semmencheri, Perumbakkam, Varadharajapuram and Mudichur were inundated last month. To find a permanent solution to flooding in these areas, the WRD has proposed four emergency projects on an outlay of about Rs. 207 crore to be taken up early next year. Officials said a 9 m straight-cut channel is proposed from the southern side of the Pallikaranai marshland to drain water into the Buckingham Canal. This would reduce waterlogging at Semmancheri, Thazhambur and Sholinganallur, and floodwater would travel 8 km less to reach the Buckingham Canal. Another channel would be built to carry floodwater to the Pallikaranai marshland near Ottiyambakkam odai and Madurapakkam odai. A bypass channel would be built from the Somangalam tributary to the Adyar to decrease inundation at Mudichur and Varadharajapuram, besides the widening of the river, officials said. Report on waterbodies Environmental activists say any plan involving the Pallikaranai marshland should be executed only in consultation with the Forest Department, which has prepared a report on 31 waterbodies around it. “This is essential to maintain the flow of water into the marshland and save the flora and fauna and the waterbodies,” said K.V.R.K. Thirunaranan of The Nature Trust. If the government focuses on the cleaning and upkeep of lakes on the southern side of the marshland, the flooding in most areas could be greatly averted, he said. But residents of some localities have expressed doubts over the efficiency and maintenance of channels, especially in the absence of inspection chambers to clean them. The government agencies must take into account the capacity of the Buckingham Canal and the Pallikaranai marshland to drain water, they said. S. Kumararaja, president, Annai Indira Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, Velachery, said the diversion channel along the Taramani Link Road to carry floodwaters to the Buckingham Canal did not mitigate the problem this season. It did not have inspection chambers to check for obstructions. “There was a reverse flow in the channel as the Buckingham Canal had already carried more water. The proposal to connect floodwaters from Okkiyam Maduvu through the East Coast Road and the sea near VGP Golden Beach must be considered. This would reduce the time taken for rainwater to reach the sea instead of joining it near Muttukadu,” he said. P. Viswanathan, convener, coordination committee of the Chitlapakkam Residents’ Welfare Associations, said nearly 75% of inundation was prevented as the cut-and-cover channel to link surplus water from Selaiyur lake to Chitlapakkam lake functioned. “But areas such as Sethunarayanan Street, Thirumagal Nagar and Nasib Avenue were flooded as work on constructing a cut-and-cover channel between lakes in Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam is yet to be completed.” Officials said many interventions to drain floodwaters through cut-and-cover channels helped in addressing inadequacies and missing links between the drain systems. This year, water-logging was reduced or eliminated with the building of channels to link waterbodies at Adanur, Narayanapuram, Chitlapakkam, Tambaram, Keelkattalai and Ullagaram. The new channels have been provided with inspection chambers. The diversion channels will distribute water flow and help in quicker draining into major waterways or the sea. As places like Ram Nagar at Velachery that got flooded this time were at a low level, pumping arrangements might be a major solution. Water from these areas would drain into the Buckingham Canal only when the flow was less, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-diversion-channels-planned-for-southern-suburbs/article33414978.ece

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||RTI invoked to solve mystery of ‘missing’ Tiruvallur village||In a significant order, the Tamil Nadu Information Commission (TNIC) has directed the State authorities to computerise all revenue records since 1864 and make them accessible to the public in digital format through e-Seva centres. The judgment stems from a petition filed by N.P. Venkateswarlu, of Raichur in Karnataka, who alleged that a property owned by his grandfather in Nedumaram village near Tiruttani in Tiruvallur district was illegally transferred in the names of some other persons, and sought copies of the documents that facilitated the patta transfer. Unsatisfied with the replies of the Public Information Officer, Archives and Historical Research Department, and the First Appellate Authority, Government of Tamil Nadu, the petitioner filed an appeal before the TNIC, seeking its intervention in getting the Old Settlement Register (OSR), Resettlement Register (RSR), Survey Land Register (SLR) and A-register documents relating to his query. In a telephonic inquiry held in view of the COVID-19 situation, the PIO stated that the village (Nedumaram) was not found in the revenue records of Tiruvallur district. The official said that since the village had not been included in the jurisdiction of Kancheepuram district as well, the petitioner, when informed about the same, sought the A-register data and details of other revenue transactions made in the survey number mentioned by him. However, the information sought by the petitioner was not available on record. Since the village records were not available in Tiruvallur, it was possible that they could be available in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the PIO said. Mr. Venkateswarlu claimed that he had copies of the documents in the name of his grandfather pertaining to lands located in Nedumaram, which was a village in Tiruttani division in Tiruvallur district. Struggle to access files His prayer was to access the documents that facilitated the patta transfer. After hearing both sides, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj observed that a large number of people who were residents of the erstwhile Madras Presidency were struggling to access property documents, since some parts of the then Presidency were now in Andhra Pradesh. While inquiring into RTI petitions seeking such revenue records, it was noted that such documents were preserved and maintained in the Madras Record Office or the Tamil Nadu Archives. Though the Revenue Department had said in its policy note that all revenue records would be computerised and made accessible to the public in digital format, it appeared that the assurance was yet to be implemented. Mr. Muthuraj directed the Secretary to Government, Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the Commissioner of Land Administration and the Commissioner, Tamil Nadu Archives and Historical Research Department, to computerise all revenue records — OSR of 1864-1898, RSR of 1901-1938, SLR of 1950 and A-register data of 1979 — and make them available to the public through e-Seva centres within two months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rti-invoked-to-solve-missing-village-mystery/article33415135.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||2 Cuddalore travel agents arrested for job racket||The Taramani police have arrested two travel agents from Cuddalore for cheating job aspirants. The agents had taken money online by promising to get the candidates jobs abroad. The police said Valli, 50, of Bharathi Nagar, Taramani, lodged a complaint with the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar, alleging that her son Murugesan was cheated of Rs. 47,000 by a company which promised to get him a job abroad. A few days ago, her family saw an advertisement on a television channel about openings in a power plant in Malaysia. Her son called the number mentioned in the advertisement and the receiver of the call demanded Rs. 47,000 as processing fee for verification of documents. The family paid the amount in two instalments to the bank account mentioned by the advertiser. The agent arranged for a fake medical test at a private hospital at Aminjikarai. Later, the agents switched off their mobile phones and were not reachable. A case was registered at the Taramani police station and the personnel of the cyber crime team, Adyar, analysed the detailed call records and the bank account details and traced the accused in Cuddalore. Police arrested Manimaran, 50, and Siva alias Sivanantham of Thirupathiripuliyur of Cuddalore and seized many passports and a car from their office. They were running a travel agency at Thirupathiripuliyur since 2012 and a manpower agency called Sankaradevi Consultancy. They had sent a few people abroad in the initial days. Later, they contacted the job aspirants over the phone and cheated them after collecting “processing fee”, the police added.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dry weather to prevail in most parts of the State till Dec. 27||Cool and dry weather conditions may prevail in most parts of the State for the next few days. With no significant weather system over the Bay of Bengal, most parts of the State are set to experience dry weather till December 27, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Wednesday, there was light rain in Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi districts, officials said. Temperature dipped The minimum temperature has dipped below normal in many regions. Places like Vellore and Tiruttani had a minimum temperature of 18 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. In Chennai, the weather stations at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded a minimum temperature of 20.5 degrees Celsius. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said, “Dry weather may continue over the State almost till the year-end. Weather models indicate that rain may revive around the first week of January. But we will have to wait for more clarity.” “Cloudless sky conditions and dry land winds from central parts of the country would influence chilly weather during night time. However, the northeast monsoon has still not withdrawn from the State,” he added. Officially, the season is considered to end on December 31. Tamil Nadu has recorded normal rainfall for the season. Since October 1, the State has recorded an average rainfall of 47 cm, which is 7% more than its normal share of 44 cm, Mr. Balachandran said. Deviations in rainfall up to 19% below normal or in excess are considered normal by IMD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dry-weather-to-prevail-in-most-parts-of-the-state-till-dec-27/article33415181.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Court can see why farmers are agitating in the country’||Observing that corporate companies manipulate the “system” to work against poor litigants, the Madras High Court said it was able to see why farmers were agitating across the country, fearing harassment at the hands of corporate giants when contract farming becomes inevitable due to the new farm laws. Dismissing a civil revision petition filed by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Justice G. Jayachandran wrote: “It is high time that corporate companies, more particularly public sector undertakings, change their attitude and conduct while dealing with individual landowners for commercial purpose. They have the duty to dispel the mistrust prevailing among the public by restraining themselves from filing frivolous petitions with an oblique intention of making the counterpart fall in the vicious cycle of litigation… The suffering of the respondents herein is index of the largescale apprehension across the country.” Coming down heavily on BPCL for not vacating a property taken on lease in 1963, the judge said if the reasons cited by the company were accepted, it would be looked as “audacity” of a mighty corporate squatting on the land of meek landowners, bent upon litigating to tire the landowners and submit to their might. “Article 227 [High Court’s power of superintendence over all courts under its jurisdiction] of the Constitution cannot be abused in this manner,” the judge said, expressing distress over the way in which the High Court Registry, too, aided the corporate company to file the present revision petition, despite the latter suffering from defects. Pointing out that the present revision had been preferred against an order passed by a sub-court in an interlocutory application (IA) in 2017, the judge said that a wrong IA number had been mentioned throughout the revision petition. “By printing the name of the counsel as Ravi with a wrong initial, ‘S’, instead of ‘V,’ an ex-parte order was passed on April 19, 2018, in favour of the revision petitioners. When the respondents came to know about the ex-parte order, they immediately filed a petition for restoration of the civil revision petition. Then, with all alacrity, the Registry raised the point of maintainability of the restoration petition. Only after the due intervention of the court, the revision petition was restored on file. These facts are highlighted, with a very heavy heart, to place on record and deprecate how corporate companies are able to manipulate the system, ” the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-can-see-why-farmers-are-agitating-in-the-country/article33414991.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||38,356 returnees being monitored, says official||A total of 38,356 persons, who arrived in the State from countries other than the United Kingdom in the last 15 days, are being monitored in Tamil Nadu, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Thursday. “We readied a list of these 38,356 persons, and have kept them under home quarantine. All of them were RT-PCR negative. Some States are not insisting on RT-PCR negative reports and are doing only thermal scanning. We insisted on RT-PCR test reports and an auto e-pass,” he told reporters after an inspection at the Chennai airport. Mr. Radhakrishnan said a three-tier monitoring system was in place. Health inspectors, village health nurses, sanitary inspectors (in urban areas), the respective police stations and the Collectors were monitoring these persons over the phone and through direct visits. They were instructed to report to the authorities in case of any symptoms. A passenger who tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving from the U.K. through Delhi remains under treatment at the Government Corona Hospital, Guindy. The 25-year-old man was administered drugs, including remdesivir. “The patient’s sample was sent for a genomic analysis to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. They [the institute] will need to study 17 mutations, and the result is likely to be known by Monday. However, we have asked them to expedite it,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. A total of 15 persons who were in contact with this passenger were traced, and samples were lifted from them. “They had arrived on flight AI 553 on December 21. We are contacting the remaining 110 passengers of the flight. So far, we have contacted 70 of them and asked them to get tested on their own,” he said Mr. Radhakrishnan said that last night, a cargo flight from the U.K. had arrived in Chennai with nine persons. “We have lifted samples from all of them and quarantined them in a hotel. The airport manager has said there was no ban on cargo flights till now. We have taken this to the notice of the Centre. The cargo is being disinfected, and a further course of action will be taken based on the test results,” he said. Following an internal review with officials, cargo handlers and those at the entry points were instructed to wear personal protective equipment. ‘A setback’ On the new variant of the novel coronavirus, Mr. Radhakrishnan said, “This is a setback at the global level. Another variant from South Africa has been identified in Britain. Tamil Nadu has not reduced RT-PCR testing and is continuing fever surveillance. People need to wear masks, follow physical distancing and hand hygiene measures.” He added, “This is not a new coronavirus but a variant. Already, there were two to three variants in India. The European Centre for Disease Control has said transmissibility is high of this variant. This could affect youngsters, and we should take precautionary measures.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/38356-returnees-being-monitored-says-official/article33414539.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. sanctions Rs. 80.83 crore for restoration of 29 heritage buildings||Many public heritage buildings that were in dire need of repairs for several years may soon be restored. The Tamil Nadu government has sanctioned funds to conserve 29 heritage buildings across the State in the first phase. A government order was issued on Wednesday, sanctioning Rs. 80.83 crore towards restoration of heritage structures that house government offices and courts. Identifying buildings This will be a major project for the Public Works Department (PWD) that has been restoring heritage buildings in Chennai. The PWD has identified heritage buildings across the State. A separate ‘Building Centre and Conservation Division’ in the PWD, with 16 assistant engineers, has been working towards heritage conservation since 2016. There are sub-divisions in Madurai, Chennai and Tiruchi. The PWD has submitted a project to take up conservation of nearly 72 buildings. Of the total number of 29 structures for which funds have been sanctioned, Kanniyakumari and Pudukottai account for five each. The Travellers Bungalow at Thiruvattar in Kanniyakumari district and the Collector’s residence at Pudukottai will get a facelift. Two buildings each in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Cuddalore, Madurai and Tiruvannamalai districts are being covered, in addition to one each in nine districts, including Sivaganga, Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram and Dharmapuri. The PWD is confident of restoring all buildings simultaneously, citing expertise gained through conserving heritage buildings such as the PWD Complex, Kalas Mahal and the Egmore Government Museum. It has collected details of about 200 structures across the State. K.P. Satyamurthy, Joint Chief Engineer, PWD (Buildings), said, “We have nine conservation architects in the PWD. We plan to float tenders for the work by January-end and start work by February. Heritage conservation is a challenging task. But we plan to complete it in one year with the department’s team and skilled masons.” The Government Printing Press building on Mint Street in Chennai, the Governor’s bungalow in Coimbatore and the Rani Mangammal building in Tiruchi are among the structures to be taken up for renovation, apart from those functioning as taluk offices and the Collector’s offices in Cuddalore, Pudukottai, Madurai and Tiruchi districts. Break-down of funds Of the total amount, around Rs. 14 crore has been set apart for the printing press building; Rs. 10.26 crore for the Governor’s bungalow, also called the Old Forest Office building; and Rs. 9.4 crore for the Rani Mangammal building. Old structures housing district munsif and judicial magistrate courts at various places and those functioning as schools and old people co-operative bank in Kanniyakumari district would be covered. Some of the prominent buildings to be covered include the Kohinoor Sheikh Abdullah bungalow in Kodaikanal of Dindigul district (where former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah was interned between July 1965 and June 1967) at a cost of Rs. 1.35 crore; Senior Prince’s Quarters on the campus of Thanjavur Palace (Rs. 2.45 crore); and the Collector’s Office in Madurai (Rs. 2.48 crore). About Rs. 50 crore is expected to be released every financial year for the conservation of the remaining heritage structures in phases, officials said.  Heritage conservation is a challenging task.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Don’t allow unauthorised gram sabhas’||Days after DMK president M.K. Stalin urged his partymen to organise gram sabhas in over 16,000 villages to adopt resolutions against the AIADMK government as part of his campaign, the State government on Thursday asked District Collectors not to allow unauthorised gram sabhas. According to a release from the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, the government has instructed officials to take legal action against parties ‘misusing’ gram sabhas as the government has not given permission for conducting them. “Collectors are instructed not to allow such gram sabhas as only elected representatives from the respective village panchayats are authorised to decide whether to call for a gram sabha under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. Political parties or individuals organising such meetings in the name of gram sabhas for political gain would confuse the public,” it said. A gram sabha is an administrative set-up enshrined in the Constitution, which has authorised the panchayat president to call meetings. In their absence, the respective Collector can organise them. “So, other than those authorised, meetings organised by a political party or an individual in the name of gram sabha is illegal,” the government warned. Responding to the warning, Mr. Stalin announced that the gram sabha meetings being conducted by the party as part of the ‘We reject AIADMK government’ campaign would henceforth be called ‘Makkal Grama Sabha Kootam’. “There is a difference between the gram sabhas conducted by the panchayats elected by the people and the ones organised by the DMK. The CM has not understood this difference,” he said.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Lessons from COVID-19 will help handle any disease’||More than 11 months since precautionary measures against COVID-19 took off in the State, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine continues to be on guard. Working on the field, its personnel have been at the forefront of COVID-19 prevention and control strategies, even as they continue to prepare for future challenges. COVID-19 may have brought the State’s public health into focus, but it has provided plenty of knowledge that will help in handling any pandemic, says T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. “COVID-19 has definitely led to an improvement to the public health response. Investment in human resources has been one of the advantages. The knowledge gained will be an advantage in handling and responding to any communicable disease, including H1N1. It has helped in our health system approach, and with this experience, we can handle any pandemic. We have strong infrastructure and trained manpower who can multi-task,” he said. “While the preparatory works for the COVID-19 vaccine are under way, the new variant of the novel coronavirus identified in the United Kingdom has come as a challenge. We can handle it with our experience. The public need to follow physical distancing, wear masks, wash hands, and avoid crowds,” Mr. Selvavinayagam said. As the State continues to lift restrictions, institutions should adhere to the Standard Operating Procedure, he said. “We have told institutions to identify and appoint a health inspector to monitor compliance with the SOP. The personnel could be retired personnel who could advise on the dos and don’ts,” he said. As for strategies in the coming months, he said there would be no major changes. The findings of the sero surveillance, conducted in 888 clusters in the State would be published shortly, and a second survey would follow, he said. Mini clinics Amid the pandemic, one of the latest initiatives rolled out by the State government is mini clinics. He said the government had planned 2,000 clinics, of which 200 would be in Chennai. “Locations of the clinics have been planned based on six criteria that includes inaccessible areas. In the first phase, we are setting up 600 clinics. We will reach 600 to 700 clinics in 15 days,” he said. On the recruitment of manpower, he said the required human resources were sanctioned. “We will be recruiting through the Medical Services Recruitment Board. For now, we are deputing our doctors,” he added.  The public need to follow physical distancing, wear masks, wash hands, and avoid crowds T.S.

Instead, they prefer a holiday on the last Sunday of the month. Various sections of the Koyambedu market were reopened from September in a phased manner with COVID-19 safety norms in effect. When the vegetable market was shifted back from Thirumazhisai to Koyambedu, Sundays were declared as holidays for maintenance. However, merchants now want a holiday on the last Sunday of every month as weekly holidays affected the business of semi-wholesalers. They are planning to make a representation about their demand to the Koyambedu Market Management Committee (MMC) and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. D. Rajasekaran, president of the Federation of All Associations of Koyambedu Wholesale Market, said though most shops had shifted to Koyambedu, some merchants were continuing trade in the Maduravoyal and Poonamallee belt. On days when the market is closed, semi-wholesalers will lose out on business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-vegetable-traders-demand-a-monthly-holiday/article33415180.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Water recharging structures sought||Residents and voluntary organisations in southern suburbs are seeking more water recharging structures instead of a storm-water drain network to mitigate the pollution of waterbodies. Residents and NGOs are making efforts to prevent pollution of the Selaiyur and Sembakkam lakes. In most localities, the storm-water drain network often carry polluted water to the lakes. Residents of Karthik Avenue, Chitlapakkam, had lodged complaints with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on the release of sewage into the Sembakkam lake and the dumping of plastic waste. Eco Society India, an NGO involved in environment conservation, has been sensitising residents of the localities around Selaiyur lake to the importance of source segregation and greywater recycling as part of its efforts at restoring the lake. The organisation has been creating awareness of waste recycling in apartment complexes in areas such as Anandapuram and Aadhi Nagar, Selaiyur. “Our efforts, along with those of the Tambaram municipality, have helped in reducing garbage littering around the lake. We are now discussing methods to handle liquid waste to stop the entry of raw sewage into the lake,” said Darwin Annadurai, founder, Eco Society India. Instead of laying impermeable road surfaces and constructing storm-water drains, there must be more recharge structures along the road. “We must have constructed wetlands near lakes using vegetation, like reed grass, to remove pollutants from the storm-water run-off. This would curb sewage pollution. A comprehensive environment management plan, involving different government agencies, is essential,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-recharging-structures-sought/article33414979.ece
25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Noted Tamil scholar Tho. Paramasivan is no more||Tamil scholar, folklorist and anthropologist Tho. Paramasivan, who made a path-breaking study of Azhagar temple in Madurai, died on Thursday. He was 70. “His study is a trailblazer because for the first time in Tamil Nadu he had explored the relation between various communities and the temple even though K.K. Pillai had made some attempt on the issue,” said folklorist A.K. Perumal. The book’s popularity is explained by the fact that actor Kamal Haasan introduced it to those who are participating in the Big Boss show. Mr. Kamal Haasan also tweeted a condolence message. Mr. Paramasivan worked in Thiagarajar College, Madurai, before being appointed as the Head of the Department of Tamil at Manonmaniam Sundaranar University. Religion and rituals He studied in-depth about the religion and rituals of Tamils, their food habits, their culture and its changes, traditional practices among various communities. In one interview, he had discussed in detail, the inter-caste marriages necessitated by shortage of brides in certain communities and how the women brought with them the cultural practices of their own native communities. Masterpiece Mr. Perumal said his work Panpattu Asaivugal (Cultural Moves) was a masterpiece. It is a collection of essays that capture cultural symbols practices of different communities. “In one article, he explains a symbolic ritual performed by a particular community when the husband of a pregnant woman dies. The ritual is meant to convey that she was already pregnant so that the world should not suspect her,” Mr. Perumal explained. Ariyapadatha Tamilagam (Unkown Tamil Nadu), Theivam Enppathor and Palyamkottai – Oru Moothoor Varalaru (Palayamkottai – History of an ancient village) are his other books. A staunch supporter of Periyar and his ideology, he would say but for Periyar, Tamils could not have secured honour and dignity. Paramasivam was of the firm opinion that women remained the mainstay of religion and spiritualism in Tamil Nadu. “Even a feminist may not come forward to give up the right to light kuthuvilakku at home,” he said.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dayanidhi accuses PMK of instigating violence||Former Union Minister and DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran on Thursday accused the PMK leaders of disrupting communal harmony and instigating violence in Tamil Nadu. “Such a mischievous campaign by the PMK leadership and violence by a few vested interests could not undermine the 20% reservation given to the MBCs and the benefits in education and employment they achieved,” he said in a statement. Responding to the legal notice sent by the PMK, Mr. Maran said the defamation suit was a last desperate attempt for publicity and to try and intimidate him by the PMK since its campaign against him on social media failed. PMK cadre had taken objection to certain statements Mr. Maran had made on their party while meeting reporters in Salem. “For this, they could have issued a simple denial, but instead the party leadership organised small violent mobs and attempted to disrupt communal harmony by instigating violence against our campaign rallies in Omalur, Salem,” he said. Mr. Maran alleged that the mob not only damaged the vehicles of the DMK’s convoy, but also public vehicles. He charged that the PMK leadership also organised a fake news campaign on social media, which too met with abysmal failure. “Pictures of a car accident in Vietnam were circulated on social media, accompanied by claims that the vehicle involved was mine, and that it was perpetrated by PMK cadre as a show of support,” he said. He said it was sad that the AIADMK government led by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami who was encouraging the violent behaviour of the PMK leadership by remaining a mute spectator to this entire incident, which had played out just around his own constituency and home town. “As an alliance partner and as the government in charge of law and order for now, the least they can do is admonish their alliance partner,” he said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dayanidhi-maran-accuses-pmk-of-instigating-violence/article33414557.ece

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two constables, SI recruit held for robbery||Four persons, including two policemen and another waiting for sub-inspector posting, were arrested for waylaying and looting close to 300 sovereigns of gold jewellery from a jeweller in Sriperumbudur on December 10. The police and the jeweller shared the pictures of the stolen jewellery with all pawn brokers and this helped them zero in on the accused. The names of the constables were given as Thamizharasan of Manampathy police station and Kathir of Thirukazhukundram police station. Both belong to the 2017 batch. A search operation has been launched for the other members of the gang. According to the police, Mahendran, a goldsmith, sold jewellery to shops around Sunguvarchatram, Sriperumbudur and Thandalam in Kancheepuram district. On December 10, he and his employees Asif and Raj Kumar were going in an autorickshaw from Tiruvallur to distribute the jewellery. Around 7 p.m., a seven-member gang, riding motorbikes, stopped them near Mambakkam in Sriperumbudur and robbed them of 300 sovereigns of jewellery. Three special teams were formed to crack the case. K. Karthikeyan, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Sriperumbudur, said the police collected the pictures from Mahendran and sent it to pawn brokers across the State. “The jewellery had the logo of the shop name on it. We knew they had to sell the loot somewhere and we requested the receivers to alert us in case someone tried to sell the valuables,” he said. Tip from Kumbakonam The police got an alert from a receiver in Kumbakonam stating that someone had come to sell the jewellery. Upon nabbing the accused, it was found they were agents and they gave information about Ranjith, who had served a sentence in prison. The police nabbed him and found that Santosh, who had earlier worked for Mahendran, had plotted the robbery. “Santosh was a friend of the two constables and he had told them that Mahendran was an easy target. For this, the policemen introduced Ranjith, whom they used escort while he was serving his sentence, to Santosh. All of them then committed the crime,” said a police source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-constables-si-recruit-arrested-in-robbery-case/article33414981.ece

Thirumavalavan on Thursday urged the Centre and the State governments to increase the funds allocated for the post-matric scholarship scheme for students belonging to the Scheduled Castes by at least 10% each year. In a statement, he welcomed the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs’ approval for the changes in the scheme including the funding pattern, which translates into an investment of Rs. 59,048 crore, of which Rs. 35,534 crore would be the Centre’s share for the next five years. Opposes DBT However, Mr. Thirumavalavan pointed out that the number of students would increase each year but the quantum of funds allocated for five years was the same. He also said the Centre’s decision to transfer 60% of its share on direct benefit transfer mode into the students’ bank accounts amounted to ignoring the State governments.

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil scholar Paramasivan is no more||Tamil scholar, folklorist and anthropologist Tho. Paramasivan, who made a path-breaking study of the Azhagar temple in Madurai, died on Thursday. He was 70. “His study is a trailblazer because for the first time in Tamil Nadu he had explored the relation between various communities and the temple, even though K.K. Pillai had made a similar attempt,” said folklorist A.K. Perumal. The book’s popularity is explained by the fact that actor Kamal Haasan introduced it to those who are participating in the Big Boss show. He also posted a condolence message on Twitter. Paramasivan worked at Thiagarajar College before being appointed as the Head of the Department of Tamil at Manonmaniam Sundaranar University. He studied the religion and rituals of Tamils, their food habits, their culture and its changes and the traditional practices among various communities. In an interview, he had discussed the inter-caste marriages necessitated by shortage of brides in certain communities and how the women brought with them the cultural practices of their own communities. Mr. Perumal said his work, Panpattu Asaivugal , was a masterpiece. It is a collection of essays capturing the cultural symbols and practices of different communities. “In one article, he explains a symbolic ritual performed by a particular community when the husband of a pregnant woman dies. The ritual is meant to convey that she was already pregnant so that the world should not suspect her,” Mr. Perumal explained.  Ariyapadatha Tamilagam , Theivam Enppathor and Palyamkottai-Oru Moothoor Varalaru are his other books. A staunch supporter of Periyar and his ideology, he would say that but for Periyar, the Tamils would not have secured honour and dignity. Paramasivam was of the firm opinion that women remained the mainstay of religion and spiritualism in Tamil Nadu. “Even a feminist may not come forward to give up the right to light ‘kuthuvilakku’ at home,” he said. DMK president M.K. Stalin condoled the death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tho-paramasivan-dead/article33414992.ece

According to Deputy Director of Health Services (Coimbatore) G. Ramesh Kumar, the 133 returnees (97 in Corporation limits and 36 in district limits) are monitored by the Health Department along with the city/district police to check whether they have developed any symptoms. As there were no direct flights between Coimbatore and the U.K., the returnees entered Coimbatore district after landing in one of the airports in India, he said. “Even if they had a COVID-19 negative certificate, we are lifting their swab samples,” Dr. Kumar said, adding that nearly all the returnees possessed a COVID-19 negative certificate. As direct international flights from Coimbatore International Airport were available only to Sharjah, those passengers from Sharjah, who had a recent travel history to the U.K., were being tested for COVID-19 and placed under house quarantine, he said. The results of six out of 133 returnees had returned negative for COVID-19 as on Thursday and the remaining results were expected by Friday.

25 December 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Micro units seek industrial estates||The micro units here have appealed to the State government to construct industrial estates, exclusively for the micro units, on the main roads in Coimbatore. This was one of the resolutions passed at the annual meetings of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT) and Coimbatore and Tirupur Districts Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (COTMA) held here on Wednesday. At its meeting, the TACT members resolved to appeal to the public sector undertakings to increase the charges paid to them by 30 % for components supplied. With steep hike in raw material prices, the units need to realise better prices for the products. Similarly, the industries that outsource jobs to micro units should increase the hour rate paid for the job work by 50 % from the current level. Though the micro units got payments for the work done only after 60 or even 180 days, they need to pay the GST in 30 days. Otherwise, the units would need to pay the tax with penalty. Hence, the government should ensure that the units get the payments in 30 days. The COTMA members decided to appeal to the State government to set up a raw material bank here to help the MSMEs procure raw materials at affordable prices. It also sought reduction of GST on job works from 12 % to 5 %. Further, the Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation was extending loans at 14 % interest. For loans upto Rs. 75 lakh, the interest rate should be 8 % and repayment period should be extended. The subsidies given by the State government through the District Industries Centre was only for those who had invested upto Rs. 25 lakh in any industry and upto Rs. 1 crore and manufacture automobile components. The Centre had revised the investment ceiling for micro units. The same norms should be adopted by the DIC too.

Soosaipuram, Doddagajanur, Mettalvadi and Bhimraj Nagar are fringe villages located along the border with Karnataka where many revenue canals and defunct quarries are present. With wild animals, particularly leopards, using the quarries as a hideout and hunt their prey, the forest department placed a cage and trapped a leopard earlier this year. Since the boulders and bushes in the quarries could turn as a habitation for wild animals, the department wanted to remove the bushes. Hence, K.V. Appala Naidu, District Forest Officer, Hasanur Division and Deputy Director, STR, had written letter to the Collector requesting him to direct the Department of Mines and Geology to remove the bushes in the quarries and also erect electric fence around them so that wild animals could not enter it. A team led by S. Sivakumar, Talavadi Forest Ranger, along with other staff placed a cage at Soosaipuram village to trap the leopard and also installed automatic cameras at spots where leopard movement was frequent. Officials asked the farmers and the people not to let their cattle or dogs in the open during night hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/erect-electric-fence-around-defunct-quarries/article33414592.ece

25 December 2020||KARAIKAL/puducherry,TAMIL NADU||Sani Peyarchi to be a low-key event||Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday said the Sani Peyarchi festival would be held as a low-key event at the Thirunallar Sri Saneeswaran shrine of Sri Dharbaranyeswara Swamy Devasthanam in Karaikal, on December 27 and 28, in deference to a directive issued by the Madras High Court on Wednesday, advising strict enforcement of the COVID-19 safety guidelines. The High Court had issued the directive in response to a public petition, seeking the cancellation of events scheduled from December 27 to February 12, in view of the pandemic. Ms. Bedi visited the temple with Collector Arjun Sharma, Deputy Collector Adarsh Moorthy, Secretary of Hindu Religious Institutions Sundaramoorthy and the petitioner, Nathan, and arrived at a consensus on changes that could be made to the arrangements. Proceedings will be telecast live on Saturday and Sunday, Ms. Bedi said. The entry of pilgrims will be staggered to avoid crowding and the number of devotees will be capped at 200, at any given time, as permitted under the national guidelines. Devotees will be permitted entry only in batches, with intermittent breaks for cleaning floors, railings of queue barriers and other spots. It was also decided to adopt the pattern followed by Sabarimala for entry. Mr. Sharma said only those with medical certificates indicating that they had tested negative for COVID-19, 48 hours prior to the visit, would be permitted darshan . Everyone must wear masks, adhere to distancing norms and follow other safety protocol. Those flouting protocol will be fined, he said. Downloading of the Aarogya Setu app and other pre-requisite safety norms, as considered necessary by the district administration are required for entry. Specific SOPs will be framed for shops/markets, hoteliers and others. On its part, the district administration had reasoned in the High Court that Sani Peyarchi festivities  cannot be cancelled now as it would be an infringement on the people’s right to worship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sani-peyarchi-to-be-low-key-event-at-thirunallar/article33414555.ece

25 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Number plate recognition cameras installed in city||Madurai City Police have installed automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras at all the entry points to Madurai and at important junctions inside the city to keep tabs on movement of vehicles. The high-resolution cameras will automatically capture the images of number plates of all the vehicles when they cross the point where they have been installed. Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha commissioned the facility installed at Teppakulam junction on Thursday. He said that by employing the new technology, the police could monitor movement of suspicious vehicles, prevent crimes and also pursue investigation of cases where vehicles were involved. Besides, the police could track and trace vehicles involved in hit-and-run accidents, he added. While the closed circuit television cameras can record videos of movement of vehicles, the ANPR cameras will record photographs of vehicles in which the registration number will be clearly visible. If details of black-listed vehicles are stored in the database, the system will alert the police immediately upon capturing the number plate as and when the suspected vehicle crosses the point. These cameras would also detect vehicles with no number plates and raise an alarm. As many as 25 cameras have been installed at 12 city check posts and a few important places in the city like Albert Victor bridge. Very soon, all the city check posts, important intersections with automatic traffic signals and bridges would be covered to give a technological boost in crime prevention, Mr. Sinha said. The police plan to integrate all these cameras and make the database accessible at the City Police Office for effective usage and monitoring. Deputy Commissioners of Police R. Shiva Prasad (Law and Order); K. Palanikumar (Crime); K. Sugumaran (Traffic); and M. Baskar (Headquarters), and Assistant Commissioners were present.  Non-stop watch Police can monitor movement of suspicious vehicles  Vehicles involved in hit-and-run accidents can be traced  Alarm will sound when black-listed vehicles pass through||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/number-plate-recognition-cameras-installed-in-madurai/article33414573.ece
25 December 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders notice to Karur Collector, SP||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the Karur Collector and the Superintendent of Police after taking a serious view of the fact that despite its order directing the authorities to restrain private persons from going ahead with laying pipeline to extract water from a well in a land close to Amaravathi river, the work had been carried out. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi ordered notice on a public interest litigation petition filed by Village Drinking Water and Health Society of Aravakurichi. The society, represented by its treasurer P. Mani, had sought a direction to the authorities to restrain people from laying pipelines to extract water. The judges took into account the fact that the previous Collector in October had rejected permission for the work. However, the present Collector, who took charge in November, had granted permission for the project. The court ordered a stay on the project and sought to know on what basis the Collector granted permission for laying pipelines. During the course of the hearing, the judges expressed their shock when the counsel for the petitioner informed it that despite its order directing the authorities to restrain the private parties from going ahead with laying of pipelines, the work was carried out to an extent of three km in addition to the six km that were already covered. The court directed the Collector and the SP to appear before it to explain why its order was not followed. However, the officials were unable to appear before the court via video conferencing, even after two hours. The court said it was initiating suo motu contempt proceedings against them. Subsequently, the court was informed by the State that the Collector was in an interior part of Karur in connection with a farmers’ agitation, and therefore could not appear before the judges. Also, the direction to appear before the judges could not be communicated in time due to the network connectivity issues. Taking cognisance of the submission, the court dropped the contempt proceedings, and directed the Collector to see to it that the order was followed and steps were taken to restore the area where the additional work had been carried out. The court posted the case for hearing to January 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-notice-to-karur-collector-sp/article33414568.ece
25 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC stays selection process for SI recruitment||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday stayed the entire selection process pertaining to the recruitment of sub-inspectors. The court observed that it was doing so in order to safeguard the interest of Tamil medium candidates as the reservation under the PSTM category was not implemented properly. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that if the selection process was allowed to proceed, the very purpose of the Persons Studied in Tamil Medium (PSTM) Act would be lost and the rights of the students who studied in Tamil medium would be violated. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed in this regard. The judges observed, “The government has brought a laudable Act (PSTM Act). The said Act has been passed only to see that children from the State of Tamil Nadu are encouraged to study in Tamil medium and an incentive has also been provided by virtue of 20% reservation in employment. Moreover, the government also took into consideration the fact that the students who studied in Tamil medium would have opportunity only in Tamil Nadu, whereas the students who studied in English medium would get opportunity outside of Tamil Nadu or anywhere in the world.” Representing the petitioners, Senior Counsel M. Ajmal Khan submitted that the 20% reservation under the PSTM category was only applied at the final stage of selection and not at every stage, as done by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission. He pointed out that with regard to the selection of 1,064 posts of sub-inspector, which were notified in 2015, 212 posts were meant for students who studied in Tamil medium. However, only 34 candidates got the posts under the PSTM category. Taking cognisance of the submission, the court observed that as the reservation was applied at the final stage, the required number of candidates under the 20% Tamil medium quota was not available for selection. Without taking note of this, the authorities continued to follow the same pattern of selection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stays-selection-process-for-si-recruitment/article33414999.ece
25 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Prostitution racket: minor girl rescued and six arrested||Madurai city police have busted a prostitution racket involving a minor girl with the arrest of six persons, including five women. Acting on a tip-off, a team of Anti-Human Trafficking Unit sleuths tracked the girl after a prolonged shadowing of some of the pimps. “We had to patiently wait and follow different women who were taking the girl in different vehicles across the city for more than five hours,” Inspector of Police Hemamala said. Finally, when the girl was intercepted with a male customer, the police arrested the pimps, including the girl’s aunt, who has been into flesh trade for so several years. The police found that the minor girl was one of the six children of a poor widow. The aunt had taken the girl few years back and slowly pushed her into prostitution for the last three years. “Whenever she could not find a customer for the girl, the aunt used to send her to other pimps. The minor girl could not do anything but fall prey to their evil designs,” the Inspector said. The accused have been arrested under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The girl was produced before the Child Welfare Committee and sent to a home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prostitution-racket-minor-girl-rescued-and-six-arrested/article33415067.ece
25 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court comes to the aid of medical aspirants||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has lauded the steps taken by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in creating a revolving fund to financially help the NEET-qualified government school students who were allotted seats in private medical colleges and dental colleges under the 7.5% horizontal quota. Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed that this will help the State to produce more meritorious doctors to serve the public and concentrate in treating patients than earning. Money factor If a person spends more money for an MBBS seat and thereafter for higher education, he/she will concentrate on earning and not on service, the judge said. Pointing to the plight of one candidate, G. Karthika Jothi who gave up the medical seat prior to the announcement made by the Chief Minister as she could not pay the fees in the private college, the judge said that she may be considered for admission on merits taking into account the surrender of seats in the All India Quota for MBBS/BDS admission. The judge also directed the authorities to consider the plight of Soundarya who had studied in a Government Higher Secondary School up to Class X. Not allowing her to participate in the medical counselling on the ground that she studied Class XI and Class XII in a private school may not be correct, the judge said. Hearing another case filed by a medical course aspirant, G. Gowsalya who missed the counselling as she could not keep a tab on it due to distortion in the network connectivity, the judge said that her plight should be considered as depriving a meritorious student of a medical seat would amount to losing a good doctor in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-comes-to-the-aid-of-medical-aspirants/article33414547.ece

25 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry Chief Minister defends decision to allow celebrations||Defending his decision to allow celebrations, including New Year gatherings and religious festivals, in spite of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said he believed that no one had the right to ban festivals. He said the gatherings could only be regulated. Addressing the National Consumer Day programme organised by the Department of Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs here, Mr. Narayanasamy said he decided to allow Christmas, New Year and the Sani Peyarchi celebrations in strict adherence to guidelines, standard operating procedures and under tight supervision. Mr. Narayanasamy said life could not come to a stop because of the pandemic. In line with the Centre’s norms, Puducherry resumed a range of services, reopened educational institutions and revived industrial activity. Moreover, in Puducherry, traditions like New Year celebrations were intertwined with the French mores, he said. After the Chief Minister recently overturned a ban by the Collector and stated that celebrations would be allowed on New Year, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi had written to him, asking that he reconsider his decision in view of the pandemic. Mr. Narayanasamy rejected the idea, contending that a blanket ban on festivities would affect many livelihoods in the tourism-dependent city. “Power that comes with the office should be used to help, not hurt, people,” he said. Rice distribution Mr. Narayanasamy said when the government was distributing rice through fair price shops for six months, the Lieutenant Governor stopped this and ordered payment of cash. Although the government had been trying to distribute rice, the Lt. Governor advocated direct benefit transfer. During his interactions with the people, he found that women preferred to draw rice as monthly rations instead of cash, he added. The public distribution system insulated the poor from inflation. With the DBT, the quantity of rice that one could purchase became variable because of the price fluctuation. Also, the probability of the beneficiaries spending the cash on something else was high, the Chief Minister said. The Union Home Ministry had endorsed DBT and later the Madras High Court had ruled in favour of the policy. The Chief Minister said he was appealing against the court ruling. Minister slams L-G Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy said Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi’s “obstructionist” ways had made Puducherry the only place which did not have functioning ration shops. It was ironic that public money was used to file a case in the Madras High Court for providing cash in lieu of rice, he said. The denial of the basic right to a consumer was a fit case for women to seek justice in court, the Minister added. A. John Kumar, MLA, also spoke.

The protest was led by its State vice-president, M. Chinnathambi, in which former vice-chairman of Sivakasi Municipality, Arasan Ashokan, and Congress party town secretary, Kumaran, took part. Mr. Chinnathambi said that lack of ROB was leading to piling up of vehicles at the level crossing gate. “Even ambulances are not sparred from waiting for longer period at this level crossing when the gate is closed for movement of trains,” he said. Fireworks workers who get injured in fire accidents are often referred to Government Rajaji Hospital or private hospitals in Madurai. The gates, when closed, posed danger to the life of such grievously injured people, he said. Though the ROB was sanctioned years back, the work remained a non-starter due to intervention of the local Minister, K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, he said. Too many changes The State government has been making changes in the alignment of the ROB so that the work does not get implemented, he charged. NSUI Virudhunagar general secetary, Vignesh and president, Sheik Abdullah, took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-against-delay-in-starting-road-over-bridge-work/article33414576.ece

25 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Boy dies after falling into sewage drain||A five-year-old boy died after falling into an open sewage drain near Anna Nagar in Thennur here on Wednesday. The boy, P. Yashwanth, was playing in front of his house at Annai Sathya Nagar in the evening and was found missing thereafter. Police said the boy had gone towards a guava tree some distance away from the house, where the open drain runs, before disappearing. He had apparently climbed onto a temporary wooden plank placed atop a portion of the sewage drain. The plank broke and he fell into the drain and died, said the police. Yashwanth’s parents launched a frantic search which went on for over five and half hours. “The boy was playing in front of his house in the afternoon and went missing thereafter. The locals joined the search but could not find him anywhere in the vicinity. A relative of the boy noticed something afloat in the drain at around 8 p.m. and alerted us,” said Selvakumar, 52, maternal grandfather of the boy. There have been constant pleas from the locals of the area to the Corporation officials to close the sewage drain but that did not happen, said Mr. Selvakumar who resides in the same area. The depth of the sewage drain was about six to seven feet, he said. Although Corporation officials inspected the drain many times no step was taken to cover the drain, said D. Jayakumar, 35, another resident of Annai Sathya Nagar. The body of the boy was handed over to the family after post-mortem was conducted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital on Thursday. The Thillai Nagar police have registered a case under section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In another incident, a man aged around 50 years died after falling into a roadside pit filled with rain water adjoining the Thirumayam-Karaikudi bypass road near Thirumayam in Pudukottai district on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, locals found the body of the man who was identified as V. Pandi. Police sources said Pandi was an alcoholic and suspect that he could have fallen into the pit in an inebriated condition. Police have registered a case under section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/boy-dies-after-falling-into-sewage-drain/article33414567.ece
25 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Banana growers in Tiruchi and Karur hope for bumper crop||Farmers who have raised nendran , one of the most sought-after varieties of banana, in Tiruchi and Karur districts are upbeat about the prospects of a bumper harvest this season, thanks to availability of water for irrigation. While nendran plantations have been raised on about 6,000 hectares in Tiruchi, it is 410 hectares in Karur. The crop is generally cultivated between April and February. There are farmers who transplant in May and June depending upon the availability of water sources.  Nendran has been raised on large tracts of fertile lands in Kulithalai, Neithalur, Sirugamani, Perugamani, Pettavaithalai, Kuzhumani, Thayanur, Mutharasanallur, Somarasampettai, Thiruvalarcholai, Panayapuram and Kallanai. The growers usually irrigate their fields for the first three to four months by tapping groundwater and then with Cauvery water. This year, the season got off to a good start with the opening of Mettur dam on June 12. Since then there have been hardly any complaints on supply of water. Good rainfall received during the southwest monsoon and moderate showers from the northeast augur well. Thunderstorms with strong winds are generally considered a potential danger to banana plantations. Banana growers nursed genuine fears for their standing crop during Nivar and Beruvi cyclones. However, there was not much damage. The banana crop transplanted in April last will be ready for harvest in six to seven weeks.“The crop is healthy. We have so far not come across shortage of water or natural disturbances. If everything goes well in the next two weeks, we hope for a better harvest and productivity this season,” said K. Selvaraj, a nendran banana grower in Neithalur. Many farmers hope that the yield will be in the range of 12 to 15 a kg in Kallanai, Kilikoodu, Panayapuram and Thiruvalarcholai and around 30 kg per bunch in Sirugamani and Perugamani, which are considered high-yielding areas due to fertility of soil and water resources. “There have been no major complaints of pest attack. The prevailing condition is conducive for a good end to nendran season. We expect a good yield,” said Manimekalai, Deputy Director of Horticulture, Karur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banana-growers-in-tiruchi-and-karur-hope-for-bumper-crop/article33414534.ece
25 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Criss-crossing network of open drains, bane of Anna Nagar in Tiruchi city||The death of a five-year-old boy after falling into a deep open drain at Annai Sathya Nagar at Anna Nagar in the city has triggered outrage among residents who have long been demanding the closure of the massive drains that criss-cross the locality Although it is one of the prime residential localities in the heart of the city, Anna Nagar is characterised by squalor and unhygienic conditions due to reeking open drains that run in the area. A network of open drains, most of them originating from residential areas along the Uyyakondan banks, runs across Anna Nagar and Marakkadai before ultimately draining into the Cauvery river near Chinthamani. The drains are massive, about five feet in width and six feet in depth at some places. For several years, the Corporation has been unable to ensure a proper disposal system for the drains. Often during the monsoon, rainwater mixed with sewerage, flows into many low-lying households. A few years ag0, the civic body built concrete linings along the open drains on certain stretches and three large sumps in an attempt to prevent stagnation but the problem has not been solved entirely. The drains were also not closed. “It has been a perennial problem for us and has ended in a tragedy for a hapless family. We have long been seeking the closure of drains. Apart from posing a grave danger, the drains also reek badly. The drains are also a breeding ground for mosquitoes and the menace is unbearable in some parts of the locality,” fumed Kuppan Chettai, a resident of Kannadasan Street in Anna Nagar. Some locals complain that there have been instances of children slipping and falling into the drains earlier, though they managed to escape or were rescued. Condemning the official apathy, N. Jamaluddin, another resident, said the Corporation should be held accountable for their callous attitude. Had the civic body heeded the locals demand for closing the drain, the tragedy could have been averted, said D. Jayakumar, a resident of Annai Sathya Nagar. Stung by the criticism, Corporation officials on Thursday initiated works to cover the stretch of the open drain, where the boy fell, using concrete slabs. Residents hope that the civic body would come up with a comprehensive plan to cover all open drains in the locality at least now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/criss-crossing-network-of-open-drains-bane-of-anna-nagar-in-tiruchi-city/article33414566.ece

25 December 2020||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||‘No protection to women’||DMK MP M. Kanimozhi said that the AIADMK government has failed to protect farmers, fireworks industry and women. In her “Stalin’s voice towards dawn” campaign here on Thursday, she said the government did not defend the fireworks industry when many States had banned bursting of crackers during Deepavali. She said the decision to ban crackers had badly hit over one crore people who were directly and indirectly employed in fireworks industry. After interacting with women in Tiruchuli Assembly constituency, she said there was no protection to women. The DMK had introduced marriage assistance scheme and gave equal rights to women in ancestral property. Its concept of self-help groups gave self-respect to women. But the SHGs were being threatened by financial institutions even during the lockdown period. Ms. Kanimozhi said that many farmers were complaining that compensation under crop insurance scheme was denied to them on the pretext that not all farmers of the village or region were affected. While the DMK introduced Uzhavar Sandhai to avoid middlemen, the AIADMK was supporting the Centre’s three farm laws which would help corporates to dictate terms to farmers. “The farm laws have snatched the right to choose the crop to grow. Important crops have been removed from the list of essential commodities and it would lead to large-scale hoarding and price rise due to artificial demand that would be created,” she said. Tiruchuli MLA and DMK north Virudhunagar district secretary Thangam Thennarasu was present. Sivakasi The party to be floated by former Union Minister M. K. Alagiri or actor Rajnikanth would not affect the chances of the DMK coming to power, said MP M. Kanimozhi. She told reporters here on Thursday that anyone could float a party in a democratic country. “I need not comment on that,” she said. When asked whether it would be a branch of the DMK, she said that such a question should be addressed to the person who would be floating the party. However, the it would in no way affect prospects of the DMK. “People are very clear about voting for the DMK,” she said. She said that parties would come up with several strategies to prevent the DMK from coming to power but its victory could not be stopped. Earlier, she interacted with fireworks and match units workers here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-protection-to-women/article33414571.ece

Participating in the meeting held online, G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam in Papanasam pointed out that some enterprising agriculturists in neighbouring districts had deployed drones to spray urea/fertilizers and pesticides in their fields. Such technology would be of much use in delta districts, which, of late, was plagued with shortage of labour, he said and urged the government to hire or purchase drones and lend them to farmers on an affordable rate or free of cost to spray pesticides on the standing crop. Availability of such machines would also be of immense help in case of pest attack on standing crop, as farmers had taken up s amba/thaladi cultivation on a larger area this season. Addressing the meeting, chaired by Collector M. Govinda Rao at the District Collectorate, officials of the Agriculture Department said 12,756 tonnes of urea, 8,214 tonnes of potash, 7,297 tonnes of complex urea and 3,133 tonnes of DAP had been stocked at primary agriculture cooperative societies and with private traders in the district and distributed to the farmers. Participating in the meeting from Budalur, another progressive farmer, V. Jeevakumar, called upon the State government to come to the rescue of plantain cultivators in Budalur and Thiruvaiyaru blocks where the price for banana bunches had plummeted to a new low in view of good harvest. The government’s intervention would not only help the farmers get back what they had spent on raising the crop but also stabilise the price of banana bunches at mandis , he added. Govindaraj, another farmer who took part in the meeting from the Assistant Director (Agriculture) office, Thanjavur, urged the government to fix Rs. 4,000 per tonne as the price to be paid by sugar mills and demanded that the incentive amount being added to the outstanding loan be disbursed to farmers in cash. Farmers stage protest  At Kumbakonam, a section of farmers staged a walkout by covering their eyes with black cloth as a mark of protest against the enactment of Farm Laws by the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-drones-to-spray-pesticides/article33414558.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Adhere to exam guidelines: BDU||Taking cognisance of incidence of students writing semester exams at public places in the vicinity of their colleges, Bharathidasan University has reached out to principals to ensure adherence to specified guidelines. The students’ reasoning that they have to submit the answer sheets the same day has prompted the university to remind the heads of non-autonomous affiliated colleges of their responsibilities. Though the conduct of the semester exams in a blend of online and open-book model was preceded by three meetings of principals, the communication gap reflecting in such scenarios has become apparent. According to S. Srinivasa Raghavan, Controller of Examinations (In-Charge), Bharathidasan University, one coordinator has been appointed for every 50 students for the exams. Remuneration is being paid to them to apprise students under their care about the procedure. Moreover, the university has also conveyed to colleges that in unavoidable situations, students can be asked to write the exams in classrooms in compliance with social distancing norms. For internal exams, the university had earlier instructed students to upload scanned copies of their answer scripts in PDF format. However, the university dropped the approach this time due to realisation that it was impossible for students from rural areas to send PDF files in the specified size. This time, the students have been asked to write the exams at their homes and submit their answer sheets in college either in person or through post the same day to ensure safe-keeping of the scripts. But the students are under the impression that the answer sheets must be submitted within a short duration. The communication gap was avoidable, Mr. Srinivasa Raghavan said. As per the plan, the answer scripts will be valued at the colleges by teachers under the supervision of the heads of departments. The semester exams are almost over, and those with arrears will appear for the exams set to begin later this month. The teachers have been apprised of the valuation process and the procedure involved in uploading marks on the university portal, packing the answer sheets as per roll numbers and subject codes. “We listed out more than 1,100 subject codes for about 40 programmes to conduct the semester exams in a customised way,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adhere-to-exam-guidelines-bdu/article33414525.ece

The excess land available on the Golden Rock Railway Workshop premises can be utilised for expansion of ICF, according to TIDITSSIA president R. Ilango. Establishing such a facility in Tiruchi will help in generating thousands of jobs and rejuvenating ailing ancillaries of BHEL Tiruchi. Due to dwindling orders from BHEL, the ancillaries are turning sick. There must be a system of minimum guaranteed order in place for sustenance of production units, he has said. At a recent general body meeting of the association, a resolution was adopted urging the Central government to reduce income tax for tiny and small industries from 30 to 20%. Turnover limit for small units must be fixed at one crore rupees for levy of GST, and job orders must be taken out of the purview of GST, another resolution said. Thanking the State government for sanctioning funds for establishment of a food park in 200 acres in the 1,055-acre earmarked for SIPCOT industrial estate, Mr. Ilango emphasised that sites must be allotted to production units at concessional rates. It was informed during the meeting that a Special Purpose Vehicle, Tiruchi Trade Centre Private Limited, has been formed, and SIDCO was thanked for sanctioning allotment of 10 acres for the trade centre in its capacity as a nodal agent. The speakers underscored the need for specialised skill training to equip the workforce for manufacture of components for defence equipment. They sought priority for TIDITSSIA for imparting training to prospective entrepreneurs identified under UYEGP (Unemployed Youth Employment Guarantee Programme), Prime Ministers Employment Guarantee Programme, and the new Entrepreneur cum Enterprise Development Scheme (NEEDS). Citing increasing traffic congestion, the meeting also called for establishing an integrated bus stand in Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiditssia-for-icf-unit-at-golden-rock/article33415172.ece

Thathaiyengarpet police on Wednesday arrested S. Thangavel on the charge of killing his 29-year-old son T. Gopi. Police sources said Gopi, who was unmarried, met with an accident about 10 years ago and was bedridden. He was being taken care of by his parents and grandmother. A few days ago, a dispute arose between Thangavel and his wife over a domestic issue and she left for her relatives’ house. Gopi was thereafter taken care of by Thangavel and his grandmother. On Wednesday morning, Gopi’s grandmother came to see him and found the youth missing and alerted neighbours. The locals found Gopi’s body lying upside down in the empty septic tank covered with clothes and informed police. During inquiry, Thangavel reportedly confessed to have murdered his son apparently unable to take care of him due to his health condition.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Powerloom federation petitions Collector to fix yarn price||Stating that frequent increase in the price of rayon yarn is affecting power looms in the district, members of Tamil Nadu Federation of Powerlooms Associations have urged the Erode Collector to hold talks with private textile mills that supply the yarn and ensure that yarn prices are fixed once a month. In a petition submitted to Collector C. Kathiravan on Thursday, the federation members said that of the 55,000 power loom units in the district, 30,000 were involved in producing rayon fabric by purchasing rayon yarn from a few companies in Pallipalayam. About 24 lakh metres of fabric worth Rs. 6 crore was produced every day in these units. The units employed nearly 30,000 people. The members said the price of yarn that was Rs. 150 a kg during Deepavali shot up to Rs. 176 per kg last week, whereas the price of the 120 gram finished product (fabric) had increased from Rs. 20 to just Rs. 22. “Since the hike in price of finished products is less compared to that of yarn, we incur huge loss. It has forced us to stop production from December 21 to 27,” according to the federation. Before the spread of COVID-19, the weavers were importing 23 % of the viscose yarn requirements. Now, it is just 5 %. The members urged the Collector to direct officials and hold talks with the companies to ensure that the price of yarn is fixed once in a month. Mr. Kathiravan told the members that he would forward the petition to the Central government. According to Southern India Mills Association chairman Ashwin Chandran, the increase in yarn price is mainly because of demand-supply mismatch. He pointed out that international prices of viscose yarn started going up in September-October and imports that used to be about 15,000 tonnes a month dropped to 6,000 tonnes a month. This led to a shortage in the availability of the yarn here. For the mills to increase production of yarn, India has anti-dumping duty on viscose fibre. Further, finding viscose yarn production not competitive, some of the mills had switched over to other fibres. For the yarn prices to stabilise and domestic supply to increase, the government should remove the duty on viscose fibre imports, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/powerloom-federation-petitions-collector-to-fix-yarn-price/article33414604.ece

Late CM Jayalalithaa too walked through a challenging political path. Now some who did not have any opportunity to continue in their field had entered into politics as the last resort with the dream of becoming the CM of the State.

When the police arrested him, he feigned illness. But he escaped from the district hospital and got himself admitted in the army hospital on Thursday. Hemanth Vithal Rangani, 26, who was on holiday, attacked his mother in-law Jayashree Desai and father in-law Lakshman Desai with a machete. He also pushed around his wife Deepa, 22. He was angry that his in-laws did not send his wife with him when he went to their house at 1.30 a.m., the police said. His in-laws have said that he had tortured their daughter for months, after their marriage last year. She had complained to them about it, but they had asked her to adjust to it. Deepa had gone to her parents home at Kondaskoppa during Deepavali. But the accused came back on leave last week.

25 December 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Christmas prayers held in the evening||Despite the State government withdrawing its decision to impose night curfew, churches and chapels in Belagavi and surrounding areas held Christmas prayers in the evening instead of the usual practice of holding them at midnight. This was as per the announcement of Bishop of the Diocese of Belagavi and Karwar Rev. Derek Fernandes, made on Wednesday. While congregations prayed between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Christmas eve on Thursday, following COVID-19 guidelines, priests offered midnight prayers from nearby churches privately. In his annual Christmas message, the Bishop asked believers to share whatever they had. “Let us share from whatever we have with the poor and the needy during this Christmas, and share this love of God,” he said. St. Fatima Cathedral, St. Paul Church and other places were illuminated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/christmas-prayers-held-in-the-evening/article33414623.ece
25 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic changed the way politics is played||The spread of COVID-19 pandemic this year has left its deep impact on the lives of common people and politicians in Karnataka, like elsewhere in India. It has put unprecedented brakes on the functioning of the political system, causing suspension of political activities, cutting short legislature sessions, pushing political leaders to home isolation, resulting in deaths of some leaders, and even postponement of elections to rural local bodies. Though the year 2020 began with the presentation of the State Budget, the duration of the session was curtailed as the State recorded the country’s first COVID-19 death. Soon after, the declaration of nationwide lockdown on March 24 and subsequent restrictions resulted in a lull in political activity over the next few months. New tools As social distancing became the new normal, politicians shunned holding press conferences and used digital tools even to reach out to their voters. As lockdown banned public gatherings, D.K. Shivakumar was sworn in as KPCC president on July 2 through a mega virtual public meeting, which was unprecedented. Opposition Congress leaders criticised the government over the handling of migrants issue, mismanagement of the pandemic, alleged corruption in procurement of COVID-19 equipment, treatment of patients, lack of testing, and delay in giving test results. Ministers held multiple press meets, sometimes en masse , to reject these charges. Noting the “crisis of governability” during the pandemic, Muzaffar Assadi, professor of political science, University of Mysore, said, “The sudden lockdown and the subsequent fear psychosis made governing a difficult task in many sectors. All sectors received severe jolt and they are yet to recover,” The ruling BJP government, however, happily used all the powers under the Disaster Management Act, besides the lockdown, and promulgated nearly two dozen Ordinances related to farm land, agricultural marketing, and labour and industrial laws and later obtained the legislature’s nod. Farmers, who form a major vote bank, opposed amendments to laws on land reforms and APMCs by observing a Statewide bandh. Rain havoc While people in urban areas reeled under the pandemic, rain havoc wreaked normal life in rural areas in September–October, causing crop loss running into thousands of crores. Once again, the Congress targeted the State government for non-payment of relief. It accused the Centre of “stepmotherly treatment” provided to the State on releasing GST funds and compensation for crop loss. As the State was starved of funds, it borrowed extensively. After more than six months of political sledging over COVID-19 and rain havoc, largely on virtual platforms, political party workers and leaders hit the streets in October for the November 3 byelections in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Legislative Assembly constituencies. The Congress and the JD(S) failed to retain their seats, despite highlighting “failures” of the government. The winter session of the legislature too was cut short, citing elections to gram panchayats. The long-pending issues of Cabinet expansion and alleged attempts to replace Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, which hit headlines on many occasions, are likely to happen in 2021. End of the year also saw signs of the JD(S) and the BJP cozying up, with JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy “going soft” on many issues. Prof. Assadi said, “While the incumbent regime provided political stability, we had a paradoxical situation of stability and crisis in the year 2020.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-changed-the-way-politics-is-played/article33414639.ece
25 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State govt. not inclined to take punitive action against Wistron||Penal action against Wistron Infocomm, where violations of labour laws have been reported after violence broke out at its facility in Narasapura in Kolar, appears unlikely, with a senior Industries Department official stating that “punitive action is no solution.” Speaking to The Hindu , the official said, “There will be a lot of introspection by Wistron and parent company Apple, which has been assured.” Meanwhile, Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar said that he will be visiting the facility on Sunday and a call will be taken post the visit. ‘No solution’ “A punitive action is not a solution. In a global company for a fault that happened at some level, responsibility has to be fixed within the organisation for non-compliance,” the official said. He, however, added that the company was liable to comply with the law of the land. “They have to maintain records and furnish them when called for... Whatever laws are applicable to others is applicable to them too. One has to take note of the mistake and not allow it to be repeated. They [Wistron] are taking remedial measures.” When asked if the government expected companies to move out of the State for insisting on compliance with law, he said there has to be “balance.” He said that the government will also have to think of “allowing economic growth for generation of employment.” Delegation meets Meanwhile, a delegation of Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU) on Thursday met Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar. They sought dropping of all criminal charges against those who indulged in violence at the Wistron facility in Naraspura and allow them to rejoin work when the facility restarts, since the company has admitted to lapses. They also urged the State government to ensure that violations of the laws are corrected before the factory resumes operations. They sought a joint White Paper by Labour and Factories Department on their findings of the violations in the facility. They pointed out serious violations of the law committed by the company, including increasing the workday to 12 hours without overtime payment, housekeeping staff being forced to work for 72 hours per week without overtime, employing women in night shifts, delayed payment of wages, unexplained and illegal deduction of wages from workers, and deploying contract workers in jobs which are perennial nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-not-inclined-to-take-punitive-action-against-wistron/article33414644.ece
25 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 cough analysis screening tool launched||With early intervention being the key to better treatment outcomes, a team of researchers has developed an artificial intelligence-powered cough analysis rapid screening tool for COVID-19. Called ‘Covigilent’, this AI model will help in early detection and large-scale screening of patients using cough as a primary input. Jointly developed by researchers from HCG Cancer Care hospital and Wipro, ‘Covigilent’ is being offered free of cost. People can access the smart phone-based web app on https://covidassist .wipro.com “The app helps in distinguishing the COVID-19 cough from other types of cough caused by seasonal bronchitis and pneumonia. It captures cough signals using a simple ‘do it yourself’ recording analysed by experts to pick up subtle changes that are specific to COVID-19 patients without any intervention from healthcare professionals. It captures audio and self-reported data such as gender, age, and other health indicators, and will be uploaded to a secure cloud server for analysis using artificial intelligence technology,” said U.S. Vishal Rao, Associate Dean, Department of Academics at HCG. Identify audio signatures Dr. Rao, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said the the signals are analysed by an algorithm to identify audio signatures specific to people infected with the virus. A smart phone used by the patient serves as the recording device and the risk categorisation is handed out to the user in a matter of a few seconds, he said. This initiative has been supported by the Karnataka government, Bhakti Vedanta Hospital in Mumbai, and Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. With the anticipation of the second wave of infections, this application can help with a more directed and focused approach. It will help categorise the high-risk contacts, who can then be effectively isolated. The objective is to help doctors speed up decision making in times of emergencies. This will also help in reducing the financial burden and countering the challenge posed by healthcare manpower constraints, he said. Reduce burden “The current screening is focused on the identification of symptomatic cases and those from high-risk zones. But given that community transmission is largely unavoidable, Covigilent is a tailored fit, being cost effective, rapidly deployable, and easily reproducible. It can screen much larger numbers with greater accuracy, thereby reducing the burden on confirmatory testing,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-cough-analysis-screening-tool-launched/article33414769.ece
25 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Experts worried over govt.’s flip-flop on night curfew||The State government’s flip-flop on the night curfew decision, wherein the timings were first revised and later the curfew itself was rolled back, has left the State’s COVID-19 experts disconcerted. In the absence of government restrictions, people should go in for self-imposed curfew and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, they said. Otherwise, the State may witness a spike in cases in the first week of January, they warned. Conflicting messages Expressing displeasure over the government’s u-turn on night curfew, a senior member of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee said: “Messages by the government have to be clear and firm. You cannot waver on decisions on restrictions, especially during a pandemic.” “While announcing the night curfew, the Chief Minister had said the decision is based on the TAC’s recommendation. Wonder why it has been withdrawn when the TAC has not recommended its withdrawal. The government should have defended its decision and not yielded to pressure from various quarters,” said the member. “We had recommended night curfew as people usually attend parties and assemble in large gatherings to celebrate the New Year. They should realise that it is not advisable this year due to COVID-19,” another expert from the team said. Avoid closed spaces V. Ravi, former professor and head of the Department of Neurovirology at NIMHANS, who is also part of TAC, said irrespective of government orders people should avoid crowding and participating in events held in closed spaces during this time. He said wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing, and sanitisation are the only strategies now to ensure that the State does not witness another spike. “If people do not behave responsibly now, we may see a surge in cases soon after the incubation period of five to six days,” he said. ‘Game not yet over’ C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said although the number of cases are declining, the game is not yet over. “Going by the pattern of spread in European countries and America, cases are likely to surge in a gap of 40 to 60 days after the decline starts. Based on this, we are expecting a surge in January-February and it is very important that people should not become complacent now,” he said. Also, in the light of a new strain of the virus circulating in the U.K., all European returnees should volunteer for tests and quarantine themselves. At the same time, all their contacts should also watch out for symptoms and take precautions, the doctor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/experts-worried-over-govts-flip-flop-on-night-curfew/article33414627.ece
25 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to upgrade PHC network||To ensure quality healthcare round the clock across the State, the Health and Family Welfare Department is working on upgrading its network of 2,359 primary healthcare centres (PHCs). The existing six-bed PHCs, each one of which is catering to nearly 30,000 population, will be upgraded to 12- to 20-bed facilities. While the existing ones will be upgraded, more health centres will be established, said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. After making a presentation on establishing model PHCs to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, the Minister told reporters that the number of doctors would be increased from one to a minimum of three to four, including a lady doctor and an Ayush doctor. According to the presentation, every PHC will have a radiology section with X-Ray and ultrasound scanning facilities besides separate rooms for minor OTs, casualty room, two tables in labour operation room, and a primary-level lab. Yoga and wellness centres will be part of the PHC to enhance mental and physical well-being of the public. Besides, the State government is also considering providing accommodation to doctors and nurses. “The lack of good housing facilities is one of the main reasons why doctors are hesitant to serve in rural areas and PHCs,” Dr. Sudhakar said. Moreover, every PHC will be provided with one ambulance and e-hospital facility to connect with superspecialty hospitals. “Even a small X-ray report will also be reviewed by a specialist doctor from a superspecialty hospital. Community health centres will also be upgraded. Taluk and district hospitals will be modernised. District hospitals with 200 beds will be upgraded to 500-700 beds,” he said. A model PHC would cost between Rs. 6 crore and Rs. 8 crore, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-upgrade-phc-network/article33414641.ece

Quality education Referring to the improvement in the quality of education in the country, the Union Minister said that earlier, students were sent to foreign countries for medical education and now, foreign students were coming to India for medical education, which was indicative of the high quality education being offered in the country. “Because of their efficiency and commitment, Indian doctors and nurses are sought after across the globe,” he said. Mr. Joshi said that the Medical Council of India had been restructured and designated as Medical Commission of India. “Now, there will not be much delay in giving permissions and other requisite clearances,” he said. Minister for Large and Medium Industries and district in-charge Jagadish Shettar said that there were already two medical colleges in the twin cities and the establishment of the new college would further increase the healthcare facilities and benefit the people in the region. He said that the twin cities were slowly getting transformed into a health hub. KIMS upgrade Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that Mr. Pralhad Joshi was making efforts to upgrade the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) and to bring All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to Hubballi. He hoped that it would materialise soon. As people of the surrounding eight districts were dependent on Hubballi for their healthcare needs, the KLE Medical Colllege would certainly help boost the health infrastructure in the region, he said. The Minister urged KLE Society to establish a school in the native place of Aratal Rudragouda, one of the founders of the society, and promised to get the land required for the purpose at Aratal village in his constituency. The former Minister Basavraj Horatti said that the elected representatives of North Karnataka should learn lessons from their counterparts in southern Karnataka on issues concerning development. “We need to unite and make concerted efforts for development of the region,” he added. In two years Making the introductory remarks, Chairman of KLE Society Prabhakar Kore said that the first phase of the construction of the new medical college and hospital would be completed in two years. The college and hospital campus would be developed at an estimated cost of Rs. 600 crore in an area of 33 acres of which Moorusavir Mutt had donated 24.30 acres. While the college and a 1,000-bed hospital would come up in the first phase, a 500-bed super specialty hospital would come up in the second phase, he said. Minister C.C. Patil and a host of elected representatives took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-is-to-set-up-one-medical-college-for-every-three-dists/article33414620.ece
25 December 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Seer says land donated as per his guru’s wish||A day after seer of Balehosur Mutt Sri Dingaleshwar Swami objected to handing over of Moorusavir Mutt land for building a medical college, seer of the mutt Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami almost broke down while speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the new medical college being built on the mutt land in Hubballi on Thursday. The swami, while delivering a discourse after the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Jagadguru Gangadhar Mahaswamiji Moorusavir Mutt Medical College and KLE Hospital near Gabbur Cross in Hubballi, defended the mutt’s decision to donate the land for the college and said that it was done in accordance with the wish of the late Gangadhar Rajayogindra Swami. “We have not deceived society and will not do so at any cost. However, baseless allegations are being made. The land has been donated as per the wish of our guru (earlier seer) and everything has been done as per law. There is no question of handing over the land illegally,” he said. In his long discourse, the swami did not directly refer to Dingaleshwar Swami but expressed his displeasure over the development. “I have been working honestly and I am true to my conscience. I have not handed over any property of the mutt illegally and it cannot be done also. However, some people have made allegations against me,” he said. The swami then went on to explain in detail what had transpired when the late Gangadhar Rajayogindra Swami had expressed his wish to donate land to KLE Society for setting up a medical college. “Our guruji had called Chairman of KLE Society Prabhakar Kore and Director Shankranna Munavalli to the mutt and expressed this desire. Subsequently, he had got a letter drafted making a pledge to donate land and I too had signed it. After that, as per the pledge, the mutt’s land was donated,” he explained. Clarifying that it was not the first time that the mutt had donated land for educational institutions, Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami said that all the financial transactions were being looked after by six trust committees, including income and expenditure. “I can only borrow money from the trust, which I need to pay back and every year, audit takes place,” he explained. The swami also recalled the developments which had forced to him to relinquish the mutt, but said that he came back as his departure from the mutt led to disputes over the issue of a successor. “In fact, several people, including former minister Basavaraj Horatti, had openly expressed their displeasure over my return. Although Mr. Horatti’s words are harsh, he is kind hearted. And, he stood by our side during a time of crisis,” the swami said. As he continued to speak about the allegations, he got emotional and Mr. Basavaraj Horatti and Mr. Shankranna Munavalli intervened and pacified him after which he ended his words. Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, Ministers Jagadish Shettar, C.C. Patil, Chairman of KLE Society Prabhakar Kore and a host of elected representatives were witness to the development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seer-says-land-donated-as-per-his-gurus-wish/article33414622.ece

He asked banks to compulsorily scrutinise education loan applications being submitted through Vidlakshmi portal and take necessary action. They need to create awareness among the youth about loan for cage poultry farming being offered by the Animal Husbandry Department. Banks should also immediately sanction loans under Prime Minister’s self-employment scheme for street vendors. Assistant General Manager of Canara Bank (district's Lead Bank) M.Y.

For the first time ever, it is getting into a collaboration with a reputed international zoo for sharing of expertise in animal welfare and captive animal management besides supporting conservation strategies. It is all set to partner with Toronto Zoo, the largest in Canada, and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) is mediating the international partnership. An MoU in this regard is expected to be signed soon. Thanks to its impressive track record in animal management and captive breeding, Mysuru zoo has been identified for the partnership, expected to be for a period of five years. Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni told The Hindu that zoo keepers from Mysuru can visit Toronto Zoo and develop skills in animal keeping and other practices. Conservation education, exchange of staff, and sharing of veterinary practices are among the goals of the partnership. “Initially, the collaboration was limited for three years. Now there are plans to extend the partnership to five years.” Toronto Zoo is known for conservation breeding and for captive breeding of rhinoceros and strong in using technology in zoo management. “We could learn from them and it can learn from us. I’m sure it will help both,” Mr. Kulkarni felt. Earlier, the zoo management had struck an animal exchange deal with the Singapore Zoo. The latter had agreed to spare a pair of orangutans. Once displayed, the Mysuru zoo will become the country’s lone zoo to house them. An orangutan housed at Nandankanan zoo in Odisha died last year. The Mysuru zoo also got a male and two female cheetahs from the Ann Van Dyk Cheetah Centre in South Africa in August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/canada-link-soon-for-mysuru-zoo/article33414767.ece

Chamundeshwari temple draws a large crowd on the first of every year and hence, the district administration issued a directive to keep the temple and Chamundi Hills out of bounds to the public so as to prevent mass gathering.

The district administration has also introduced curbs and banned people from visiting the Chikkadevamma temple in Sarguru taluk from December 28 to January 1 though the regular religious rites will not be affected. The authorities have also cancelled the famed Chunchunkatte cattle fair that takes places in Chunchankatte in K.R. Nagar taluk. It was slated to be held from January 1 to 31. The Brahmothsava at Sri Rama temple at Chunchankatte is slated to be held on January 15 but the temple will remain out of bounds for the public on that day to prevent mass gathering, according to the authorities. However, this will not affect the religious rites which are conducted by the temple priests. The temple staff have to comply with the COVID-19 guidelines. Consequent to the State government’s decision to curb New Year celebrations in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities in Mysuru have also introduced measures to ensure that there is no mass gathering and public celebration. The New Year related programmes on the palace premises, which was introduced a few years ago as a tourist attraction, has been dispensed with as also the illumination and fire works. In view of Vaikunta Ekadashi on Friday, the authorities expect the temples to draw bigger crowd.

District Vector-Borne Diseases Control Officer Chidambara, who oversaw the testing, said 26 returnees turned up. The counter functioned from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It will also function on Friday. The COVID-19 War Room had informed 119 returnees out of 137 to undergo the RT-PCR test compulsorily. Eighteen others had tested negative. “Whoever has not given their swabs would be asked to do so by Friday. We shall ensure all are tested as mandated by the government in the wake of new strain of SARS-CoV2 found in the United Kingdom,” he said. The samples were sent separately to the lab of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) which has been carrying out the PCR tests since beginning. Though the Town Hall health team handles samples of all persons, the samples of the U.K. returnees had been separated and sent to the lab for tests. The results would be also listed separately. The results are expected late in the night on Thursday. If anyone is found to have tested positive, the samples would be sent to the National Institute of Virology lab at NIMHANs in Bengaluru for genetic sequencing. Such patients would be either remain in home quarantine or hospitalised based on the nature of the infection. The genetic sequencing was expected to help in ascertaining the nature of infection – whether it’s a new strain of virus or not. The results from NIMHANS may take 24 hours from the time of receiving the swabs. Those who had returned to India travelling through U.K. also turned up at the Town Hall to give their swabs. “Such persons came on their own. Their names were not in the list of passengers who returned from U.K. They volunteered for the test though some of them returned nearly 15-20 days ago. If at all they test positive, it might not be the new strain,” Dr. Chidambara added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-uk-returnees-turn-up-for-covid-19-test-in-mysuru/article33414765.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Towards ‘new normal’ of thinner traffic, cleaner air||Before we look at the changes that the pandemic has brought about, it is important to look back on the transportation system in Indian cities, including Bengaluru, pre-COVID-19. In all the metropolises and most of the tier-II cities, we were facing extreme growth in vehicular traffic -- both in number of vehicles and kilometres travelled -- and congestion. Traffic accidents and fatalities, especially among vulnerable road users like pedestrians and two-wheeler riders were also high and growing. We were also recording other growing externalities connected to mobility in terms of higher levels of exhaust emissions including carbon, noise pollution, and increased fuel consumption. The sum effect of all these was degrading Quality of Life (QoL). During the lockdown period, however, many Indian cities experienced tangible glimpses of improvements in QoL when traffic was negligible and pollution levels fell much below the permissible limits. Now that the cities are inching towards normalcy, the larger question is whether we make these QoL improvements as the new normal, which can happen only when lessons are learnt from this pandemic and specific interventions are introduced. Core principles While public transport systems need to maintain social distancing temporarily, can we translate it into comfortable seating and standing? Likewise, can we translate the need for contactless travel in mass transit systems to seamless and contactless travel experience in multi-modal forms of transport? It is important to focus on sustainability and QoL through focused transport planning and policy as a permanent new normal. I have listed some core principles that need to be followed to achieve this.  Reduce the need to travel: This can include interventions like work from home on some days, staggered and flexible work hours, and more online shopping and home delivery opportunities.  Reduce distances: Here, interventions like mix land use policy and planning, translating “vocal for local” concepts in terms of living closer to where you work or study can be introduced.  Infrastructure for sustainable modes: This will include interventions like priority lanes for bus and cycle lanes, wider and good surface quality footpaths, and a more robust metro and suburban rail network.  Right-of-way allocation: The priority should be in the order of non-motorised transport (NMT), public transport (PT), and in the last personal mobility modes.  Monitoring pollution levels: It is important that all types of high polluting and high space occupying vehicles per unit of person carried are discouraged. This will include interventions like congestion charging, odd-even rule, parking policies and pedestrianising busy streets. Cleaner vehicle technology and fuel for all vehicle categories should be promoted. Of course, no more flyovers/ underpasses/ elevated corridors in the city as they do not satisfy any of the above-mentioned principles. It will be a pity if we don’t learn our lessons even from such a pandemic. And finally, a good transport policy must ensure equal access across gender, income groups, differently-abled people; improve disaster resiliency of transport system etc. Mission 2022 In the light of the above points, it was interesting to note the release of ‘Bengaluru Mission 2022’ document with an ambitious target to make Bengaluru world class in the next two years. The very first action plan listed under this objective is the taking up of 190 km of 12 high-density corridors. While we need to see more details, it almost seems like re-packaging of infamous and ill-conceived elevated corridor and steel flyover projects, making it clear that we haven’t still learned the right lessons from the ongoing pandemic. Ironically, other than this item, no specific targets were set for public transport, walking, and cycling. On the brighter side, the ongoing ‘Church Street First’ pilot for five months, where vehicular traffic is banned on weekends is a good example of promoting sustainable mobility and quality of life. Such initiatives should be scaled up. The scaling up of bicycle and bus lanes are also noteworthy and need to be taken up. Other cities in Karnataka can do even better than Bengaluru by retaining their current higher mode share of walking and cycling and improving public transport. From a long-term planning perspective, carrying out an “Integrated Land Use & Transport Plan Study” jointly by BDA and DULT is an ideal way forward. This will go a long way in ensuring a long-term vision and action plan for a sustainable and liveable Bengaluru.

While some schools had sacked teachers as they were unable to pay salaries, teachers in other schools had quit their jobs after they faced salary cuts or were not paid on time during the pandemic. Many of these teachers had taken up other jobs ranging from farming, selling fruits and vegetables to starting their own small businesses out of their homes. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools, said that while they were able to manage online classes despite shortage of teachers by combining different sections, the same will not be possible during physical classes. Many school managements had in fact started paying teachers by the hour for online classes as they could not afford to pay them full salaries. “Now, when physical classes resume next month, we will need our teachers back. But most of the teachers do not want to come back as they are earning better in their new jobs,” said the principal of a city-based school in north Bengaluru on condition of anonymity. School managements had not paid salaries as they had said that a majority of parents had not paid the fees and they did not have a stable source of revenue and all their corpus amount was empty. New recruitments Jayaranganath, coordinator, Educate English Medium School, Karwar, said that while the schools needed more teachers than before as they had to conduct classes in shift system, they were in a dilemma of whether they should recruit new teachers. “Many of our old teachers have quit and we are not even sure if we should recruit teachers as we are worried we may have to close schools again if there is a second wave of COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-stare-at-teacher-shortage-when-they-reopen/article33414647.ece

Some sections are now accusing the BJP government of ‘insulting’ honest officials. The BBMP council, on March 7, 2020, had unanimously approved a proposal to rename Varthur Kodi Circle as Madhukar Shetty Circle. It was forwarded to the State government for approval in September. The State government communicated to the BBMP Commissioner about the proposal being rejected earlier this month. Former councillor of Hagadur ward S. Udaykumar, who had proposed the renaming, said residents remember the effort made by Shetty in clearing traffic issues in that part of the city, especially ITPL area, when he was posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police (East – Traffic). Abdul Wajid, former Opposition Leader, said Shetty, during his posting in Lokayukta, had brought to light several scams, including illegal mining and KIADB scam. He was responsible for bringing to book several corrupt BJP politicians, he said. “For the BJP, dissent is unacceptable. The party was in power in the BBMP council when the proposal was approved. The BJP government has now rejected this proposal, while approving all other renaming proposals,” he alleged. The BBMP has always courted controversy over renaming of roads, circles and flyovers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposal-to-rename-varthur-kodi-circle-rejected/article33414964.ece

25 December 2020||CHENNAI,KERALA||Ponnani port incurs NGT ire||The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal has criticised the Port Conservator of Ponnani for not obtaining environmental clearance for dredging the port and directed the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) to take appropriate legal action. The bench also directed the Port Conservator and the State of Kerala to appoint a permanent committee of experts for conducting environmental impact study as required under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, 1991, 2011 and 2019 before undertaking the work to dredge the port. The work will have to be carried out under the supervision of the expert body after getting the CRZ clearance and after complying with the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, the bench said. The Ponnani fishing harbour is situated in the Bharathapuzha river before it reaches the estuary of Arabian Sea. The Director of Ports, the Port Conservator and the Secretary, Fisheries and Port Department, divided the port into 20 zones for allotting it to various cooperative societies for sand-mining under the guise of manual dredging as part of channel clearing and even beyond the fishing harbour, the applicant submitted. Further, on account of this activity, the Bharathapuzha river has been polluted and the depth of the river has increased resulting in intrusion of saline water into the water sources available in that area. This had affected the potable nature of the drinking water in the wells, the applicant said. Panel findings However, a joint committee constituted by the NGT, concluded that the dredging was carried out only for maintenance and that there was no sand-mining. But the major port area falls within the Coastal Regulation Zone. The committee also said that when the port was established, CRZ notification, 1991 or EIA notification, 1994 had not been enacted and there was no law for obtaining EC at that time and as such there was no need. But thereafter, CRZ notification 1991, EIA notification, 1994, 2006 and CRZ notification 2019 had come into force. Even as per the documents produced by the port when Environment Clearance was granted during 2014, there was a condition that they would have to obtain CRZ Clearance and that Environment Impact Assessment would have to be done in future while carrying out dredging, the bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ponnani-port-rapped-for-violating-crz-notification-while-dredging/article33414664.ece

The Christmas/ New Year season, aided by a drop in mercury level, is attracting tourists. An official at the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in Munnar says there is a spurt in tourist inflow from December 20. Normally, Munnar witnesses a high turnout from December 20 to January 5. Most hotels and resorts have been fully booked from December 25 to 27. The number of daytime tourists is also on the rise. These are positive trends indicative of normalisation of tourism activities at the hill station, he says. “The number of vehicles parked on roadsides from Kanthallur to Munnar points to the revival of tourism,” says Tijo a local resident. Resort managers say tourists from outside the State have also started coming to Munnar. As many as 1,491 people visited the Eravikulam National Park (ENP), the main tourism destination and the natural habitat of Nilgiri Tahr on Thursday. Job J. Neriyamparambil, ENP range officer, says more tourists are expected in the coming days.

25 December 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Farmers to launch stir against Thondar dam project||A group of farmers under the aegis of the Action Council Against Thondar Dam, a coordination committee of eight farmer groups in Thondarnadu, Edavaka, and Vellamunda grama panchayats, is gearing up to launch a series of agitations with the support of the Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti (WPSS) against the construction of a dam across the Thondar rivulet, a tributary of the Kabini river at Moolithodu in the district. The project envisages collecting 0.3 tmcft of water after constructing an earthen dam across the Moolithodu rivulet to irrigate 1,411 hectares in the three grama panchayats. However, S. Sharafudheen, coordinator of the organisation, said that more than 150 families, including 50 tribal families, would be evicted for the first phase construction of the reservoir. “According to a feasibility study, the reservoir will be constructed at a height of 13.5 metre, and we suspect that as much as 1,500 acres will be used for the reservoir. The project will adversely affect close to 650 families, including 150 tribal families, in seven wards under the three civic bodies,” Mr. Sharafudheen said. “We have been living peacefully in the area for the past many generations, and we are yet to face issues related to drinking water, man-animal conflict, flood, and drought,” M.K. Kelu, vice chairman said. Mr. Raman possesses 5 acres, and farming is the sole source of income for the 70-year-old tribesperson. “If the project is executed, it will wipe out our paddy cultivating land,” he said. “We will not allow officials to enter our land for survey for the project, as the public is against the project,” says V. Abdulla, chairman of the organisation. The villagers detained officials who had reached the area for the survey nearly a month ago. N. Badusha , president, WPSS, said that the Banasura Sagar dam, the largest earthen dam in the country, on the Kabani river basin was built to support the Kakkayam hydroelectric power project and provide water for irrigation. But the irrigation project was still in limbo even after Rs. 53 crore was spent on it. Though successive governments had spent Rs. 400 crore for the Karapuzha irrigation project since 1980, it was yet to meet its target, Mr. Badusha said. The Thondar project will also meet the same fate, he said. Mr. Sharafudheen warned that the coordination committee would form a human wall in the affected area on January 15 as a part of the protest. If the government moved ahead with the project, agitations will be intensified, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-to-launch-stir-against-thondar-dam-project/article33414661.ece
25 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||PCB to invite EoIs for drone mapping of legacy waste||The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has decided to invite expressions of interest (EoIs) from firms interested in taking up the total station survey of heaps of legacy (old) waste lying at the Brahmapuram dumping yard of the Kochi Corporation. The PCB head office in Thiruvananthapuram has directed its Ernakulam regional office to take necessary steps for conducting the survey as part of implementing the directives of the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on swift removal of legacy waste. The board had earlier sought the advice of the Environment Department for entrusting the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS) with the proposed drone mapping of the solid waste dumping site at Brahmapuram. It had sought the department’s response to handing over the survey to UL Technology Solutions, a subsidiary of ULCCS. However, the board has now decided to invite EoIs. The Opposition parties had alleged that the government had failed to go by the due process while awarding projects to ULCCS. The Enforcement Directorate had conducted an inquiry at the ULCCS head office at Vadakara in Kozhikode as part of its probe into the money laundering angle in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case. These developments appeared to have prompted the Environment Department to invite EoIs, according to senior officials. The total station survey using drones is done to ascertain the exact volume of waste lying at the site. Board officials said the aerial survey using unmanned vehicles would provide high-resolution accurate data. Aerial mapping remains the best option to evolve scientific data on old waste at Brahmapuram. Drone mapping of the landfill / dumping site must be done prior to bioremediation and biomining. The Central Pollution Control Board has issued guidelines for contour survey as part of its directives on ensuring proper treatment and disposal of municipal solid waste. Drone mapping of heap volumes at different stages is most cost-effective and fast, according to the central board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-to-invite-eois-for-drone-mapping-of-legacy-waste/article33415062.ece

The 54-year-old debutant councillor believes that though he did not contest under the banner of the movement, it did help him and so as its volunteers who believe in it. “Some people would want to equate it with the Twenty20 experiment in Kizhakkambalam. But unlike them, we do not have a corporate backer, and our idea is more about enlisting and mobilising resources, both human and financial, for local development, said Mr. Kumar, who left the CPI four years ago. The movement, he said, was still in a nascent state, where consultations were being held to evolve a consensual model of development. Having been an active presence in civic and social issues even before contesting elections, Mr. Kumar is now determined to make the development of Ward 19, from where he has been elected, a template for the larger plan of taking the movement forward. Just days after being sworn in as councillor, he has already taken up two projects for immediate perusal from the 19-point charter he had drawn up for his manifesto. “The anganwadi in the ward works out of a dilapidated rented building. Steps have already been taken to secure clearances for constructing a new building on four cents of paddy field. Talks have also been held with the engineer to remove obstacles in using NABARD funds for facilitating flow in a local canal passing through the ward,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-new-model-fuels-an-independents-win/article33415058.ece

In the first phase of the project, units with 20 goats, including 19 females and one buck, will come up in nearly thirty centres in the district. The department plans to produce an additional 100 tonnes of chevon within three years and the project will be implemented at 27 panchayats in the district along with Kollam Corporation and two municipalities, including Paravur and Punalur. At present, Kollam has a total of 2.16 lakh goats and the district’s daily requirement of chevon is seven tonnes. Kollam is currently dependent on other districts, especially those from the northern parts of Kerala, to meet the demand.  The money needed for starting a unit under the project is Rs. 2.8 lakh and the farmers will get a subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh. The department had received around 2,000 applications for the project that will take off in the first week of January, 2021. Malabari goats that can give birth to two to three kids per kidding will be reared in the units. The breed is mainly reared for meat since it is quite prolific compared to others and the goats are also easy to manage. The gestation period is 165 days and the farms will be able to supply the meat within one year.  Next phase in 2022 According to officials, while setting up the farms, steps will be taken to ensure the availability of young ones to be distributed to the beneficiaries in the next phase of the project that will start in January 2022. The farms will be offering meat to Meat Products of India Ltd (MPI) while the milk from the units will go to Oushadhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/goatery-project-for-kollam/article33414708.ece

25 December 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||High Court reverses MG University decision||In an anti-climax to the controversy over the special moderation for BTech students by the Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), the Kerala High Court has revoked the university’s decision to take back the degree certificates of those who passed the course under the scheme. Considering the writ petitions filed by the students affected by the decision, Justice Devan Ramachandran has set aside the university’s order issued on October 26, 2019, with a further direction not to act on it in any manner. The order, according to the court, was issued without proper thought and based merely ‘on public objections’. Statutes and regulations In its judgement, the court also noted that the petitioners had been given the benefit of moderation through an order issued in May 2019 and were declared passed, leading to the issue of their mark lists and degree certificates. “This certainly gave them a vested right to be so declared and if any action were to be taken to cancel the said certificates, it could have been done only as per the provisions of the applicable Statues and regulations and not in the manner as has been done now. It is indubitable that going by the first Statutes of the university, a degree already conferred on a student can be withdrawn only in certain specified circumstances and that the issuance of an order akin to the one impugned in the case, does not fall within the said categorization,” it read.  Decision in 2019 April A decision to give special moderation of five marks to BTech students, who had failed in any one of the 56 subjects altogether in the course, was taken in a meeting of the MGU Syndicate meeting held on April 30, 2019. The move, however, drew sharp criticism following allegations regarding the Higher Education Minister’s intervention behind the move. Following this, the university withdrew the decision so as “to avoid people casting suspicion over the university and the academic community”. Accordingly, a list of 16 students who had passed the course with special moderation was published and an order was issued to cancel their degree certificates. Commenting on the order, MGU officials said any further action on the order would follow a detailed discussion of the matter in the next meeting of the university Syndicate. “A majority of the students who passed the course under the scheme have either landed jobs or gone abroad using these certificates. Based on the memos issued by the varsity, a handful of them have already surrendered their degree certificates,” a university official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-reverses-mg-university-decision/article33414711.ece

The hospital, one of the two government-designated facilities for COVID-19 treatment in the district, is opening up for non-COVID treatment, and there is a drastic rise in the number of such patients. However, other government and private hospitals designated for the purpose are reluctant to admit infected persons with existing health problems, who do not have severe COVID-19 symptoms. First-line treatment centres (FLTCs) are getting closed down as well. “Though there is a rise in the number of non-COVID patients, there has not been a drastic drop in the number of infected persons. So, to manage the patient numbers if we refer asymptomatic persons or those with mild infections, who may have other health issues, to these private hospitals, they are insisting on a negative test result. Government hospitals in the periphery too are not so keen on sharing the burden of COVID-19 patients with us,” some doctors at the hospital told The Hindu . As a result, a few wards are bursting at the seams, and patients are forced to be accommodated in the corridors. The MCH gets patients not only from Kozhikode, but from districts such as Kannur, Malappuram, Kasaragod, and Wayanad. To address the rush in the general medicine department, the authorities recently decided to temporarily open the building being constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana for admitting non-COVID patients from December 28. According to sources, they will be admitted in four wards on the second floor. The paramedical staff required are being redeployed from the FLTCs under the medical college hospital. Sources, however, pointed out that the facilities at the PMSSY block are yet to be fully functional and how far this step would be effective remains to be seen. A majority of wards in general medicine and a few wards in surgery, ENT, orthopaedics, dermatology, and gynaecology are still being used only for COVID treatment. With the academic sessions expected to begin in the coming months, the teachers at the medical college are concerned how the situation in the hospital will impact the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mch-caught-between-care-for-covid-patients-and-others/article33414658.ece
25 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||A mandate to mend bridges, bolster party||The decision of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) to field its leader P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, for the coming Assembly elections, coming as it hastily after the controversial Facebook post of Chief Miinister Pinarayi Vijayan, appears to have been done with twin objectives, including expanding the base of the party in the State. This apart, the IUML leadership feels, Mr. Kunhakulitty along with Kozhikode South legislator M.K. Muneer, who will be more based in Thiruvananthapuram, will hold talks with Church and Hindu organisations leaders soon, to allay the fears that the Muslim community is having undue advantage in the socio-political sphere in Kerala. Good rapport with all One factor that even his detractors admit is that Mr. Kunhalikutty enjoys good rapport with all community leaders, and does not mind fraternising with rival politicians. So also, the party did not want to wait till the run-up to the Assembly polls to announce his candidature that would give political mileage to the ruling front. The decision comes close on the heels of the miserable performance of the Congress-led UDF in the recent local body polls. The party perceived that the tacit support the CPI(M) received from the SDPI helped the Left Democratic Front (LDF) romp home. Now with the Facebook post, the leaders feel the communal polarisation between the Muslim community on one side and the Hindu-Christian communities on the other side would put the UDF in more trouble. They also believe that the assessment of the local body poll results in the light of the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) joining the LDF has been emotive rather than analytic. This, especially after the Congress losing a chunk of its traditional votes of Christian and Nair communities. Hawkish elements Besides, Mr. Kunhalikutty, the party leadership feels, will circumvent the agenda of hawkish elements that had begun to have a sway over the League cadre. Dr. Muneer, through his affable manners and moderate approach, has been unable to take on politically the party opponents. Mr. Kunhalikutty had quit the Assembly to contest successfully from Malappuram Lok Sabha constituency in 2017 in the bypolls after the seat fell vacant upon the death of senior leader E. Ahamed. In the Lok Sabha elections last year, he won from the same constituency. For the party cadre, Mr. Kunhalikutty is an invincible leader, and for them it does not matter whether he is in the national or State capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-mandate-to-mend-bridges-bolster-party/article33414714.ece

The two factions had approached Mizoram Governor and former BJP State president S. Sreedharan Pillai, seeking the Prime Minister’s intervention in the issue. If the separate talks yield positive results, the Prime Minister will decide on a joint meeting with the leaders, it is learnt. Last week Mr. Pillai met the Prime Minister and requested him to intervene to settle the fight between Malankara Orthodox Church and Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, despite the dispute reaching the Supreme Court and the apex court giving a verdict in favour of the Orthodox Church. Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, had also approached the Mizoram Governor for a solution to the stand-off, a source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pm-to-meet-church-factions/article33414715.ece
25 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||NIT-C sans full-time director||The National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT-C) has been functioning without a full time director for the past five months as the Centre is yet to take a decision in this regard. It is learnt that a selection committee appointed by the Ministry of Education had carried out an online interview of the names of shortlisted persons in September. Now, the Ministry has to recommend a name for the post to be ratified by the President. Term ends The post has been lying vacant after the five-year tenure of incumbent director Sivaji Chakravorti ended in mid-August. Incidentally, Dr. Chakravorti was appointed after the post lay vacant for more than a year. Intake of students “This issue comes when classes for the new B.Tech batch also commenced at the NIT-C this month. The intake of 1,200 students for B.Tech course each year, possibly was also the highest among the NITs in the country. Likewise, the post of of director at NIT-Delhi, for which a notification has been called along with NIT-C, has also not been filled. The Ministry has also entertained applications from employed persons in government departments, autonomous organisations, public sector undertakings, and universities for the post on a contract basis. The upper age limit for appointment is 65 years. Earlier, the ranking of the NIT-C in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the Ministry had climbed down in 2018. This has been attributed to the acute shortage of staff with 50% of the teaching faculty then placed on ad hoc basis. It was during the tenure of Dr. Chakravorti that the NIT-C made strides on various fronts, including academic and research. It improved its rank in the NIRF this year. Its all-India rank now is 23 in engineering and is placed third in the architecture category. The institute has been the number one engineering college in the State for the past several years. Also, the NIT-C has been able to get record placements in the country and abroad in the past three years as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nit-c-run-without-full-time-director/article33414655.ece

This follows the death of a 11-year-old boy from Mayanad due to the infection. Nine others were reported to have the infection and over 30 had symptoms. Though there were reports that the presence of the bacteria had been detected in water samples collected from the wells in the area, they could not be confirmed. Health Department officials were quick to dismiss any link between the Mayanad incident and the one reported in Feroke. According to sources, the toddler hailing from division 22 of the Feroke municipality was initially admitted to a private hospital at Chungam a couple of days ago with stomach pain. He was referred to another hospital in Kozhikode when his condition did not improve. The infection was confirmed on Wednesday.

The Higher Education Department on Wednesday issued guidelines for the reopening of colleges and universities in Kerala. Classes will be held with 50% strength allowing students, semester-wise, on a rotational basis. While colleges and universities will function from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all days except Sundays, college Principals have been tasked with evolving schedules comprising sessions held in two batches, if necessary, to uphold the COVID-19 protocol. KTU schedule Classes will begin for fifth and sixth semester degree students, postgraduate degree students (all semesters), and research scholars in arts and science, law, music, fine arts, and physical education, polytechnic colleges, and universities concerned. APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) have been directed to prepare similar schedules. Students from other semesters will be called for classes on the basis of evaluations conducted at the college and university levels after 10 days of the reopening. Fully residential campuses such as IIM-Kozhikode, IIT-Palakkad, IISER and IIST can also function by adhering to precautions laid down by the University Grants Commission. No FLTCs on campuses Physical distancing, and the use of masks and sanitisers must be made compulsory on campuses. Principals, faculty, and all non-teaching staff have been directed to attend colleges from December 28 and ensure that classrooms, laboratories, and hostels are cleaned and sanitised.

25 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Active case pool climbs steadily||The active case pool of COVID-19 patients in the State, which had been brought down to 57,000 after it hit the peak at 97,000 plus cases, is now swelling slowly and steadily since the past few days. The State’s active case pool rose to 63,155 on Thursday, with 5,177 new cases of COVID-19 being reported, when 56,073 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The test positivity rate stood at 9.23%. A warning Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has asked the people to maintain utmost vigil and not to violate any of the COVID-19 protocols as the rising trend in cases is being reported from many districts. Epidemiological analysis shows that disease transmission has gone up slightly in districts where local body elections were held in the initial two phases. In comparison, the increase in new cases was less in Malappuram and beyond where elections were held in the last phase. Even so, new cases have not shown as big a surge in Kerala in the post-poll period as it happened in rest of the country, possibly because of the manner in which the public has been cooperating with the government in following all COVID protocols, Mr. Vijayan said. However, there should be no relaxation in universal masking or the maintenance of physical distancing during Christmas and New Year celebrations, he added. The cumulative case burden of the State has risen to 7,26,687 cases. With 4,801 more patients leaving hospitals on Thursday, the cumulative recoveries reported in the State till date has gone up to 6,60,445. 22 deaths The State’s official COVID toll now stands at 2,914, with 22 new deaths being added to the official COVID death list on Thursday. Ernakulam and Kozhikode reported four deaths each, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur three each, Kottayam two while Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Idukki, Malappuram, and Wayanad reported one death each. Official reports put the number of critically ill COVID patients in the State occupying ICUs in various hospitals at 851, with 217 persons requiring ventilator support. Of the 5,177 new cases, 108 cases have been found to have a history of travel outside the State while 5,069 are locally acquired infections, with the source of infection remaining unknown in 475 cases. Of this, 52 are health care workers. Among districts, Thrissur reported 591 cases, Kollam 555, Ernakulam 544, Kozhikode 518, Kottayam 498, Malappuram 482, Pathanamthitta 405, Thiruvananthapuram 334, Palakkad 313, Alappuzha 272, Kannur 263, Wayanad 165, Idukki 153, and Kasaragod 84 cases.  5,177 new cases of COVID-19 reported on Thursday at a test positivity rate of 9.23%||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/active-case-pool-climbs-steadily/article33414728.ece

25 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Lending a tinge of ‘green’ to the Christmas star||The market is flooded with an umpteen varieties of stars. But far away, in the islet of Perumbalam in Alappuzha, a few families make their own stars to usher in the spirit of Christmas, that too in line with nature. Fashioned out of bamboo, the products are being made by artisans of the Responsible Tourism (RT) Mission unit of Perumbalam. The Christmas stars are handmade, say the artisans. Each star could take around 30 minutes to make and needs an artist’s undivided attention. The untreated bamboo is first sliced into small sticks depending on the size of the Christmas star. Five such sticks are then affixed onto each other and tied to form the frame. Two such frames are then joined to make the final frame. Colour papers are then stuck onto this and voilà, you have yourself a Christmas star. Fond memories As Haridasan M., who has arrived from Perumbalam, gives a few final touches to one such star in his work shed in the capital city, he fondly recalls the spirit of Christmas when he was a child. He would join his father in making these bamboo stars. Every Christmas, this tradition of star-making remained unchanged. Now, his son Abhijith T.H. who has finished college, has joined him in the venture. “It has always been like this. We created our own stars. We got power connection quite recently. Earlier, we would light a candle inside the star. There is a certain nostalgia associated with this. It is a painstaking and arduous process but I grew up seeing this. Our neighbourhood too makes their own stars,” recalls Mr. Haridasan. “Not to mention the fact that these stars are eco-friendly,” chips in Abhijith. Cloth stars This tradition of star-making is followed in the islet of Perumbalam by many families and even during other festive occasions and sports matches. “We use cloth while making huge stars. And it gives a grand display,” says Mr. Haridasan. The RT Mission has joined hands with Culture Shoppe to provide a platform for the artisans to sell these stars, priced at Rs. 300, through the mission’s outlets. This no-profit-no-loss project is a green initiative of Culture Shoppe to curb the use of plastic Christmas lamps from China that flood the Kerala markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lending-a-tinge-of-green-to-the-christmas-star/article33414718.ece

Rajesh Kumar of Kattakada and Sreenivasan of Palakkad, both undergoing life imprisonment, were reported to have gone missing from the prison around 7 p.m. They had earlier been allowed to leave the cells for farming activities on the premises. Soon, the prison officials and the police launched a massive manhunt in the region. Sentence commuted Rajesh, an autorickshaw driver, had been arrested for raping and murdering a 15-year-old girl at Vettikode, near Vembayam, on March 6, 2012. The case, which had created massive outrage, saw the accused being sentenced to death penalty by the trial court within a year. However, the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by the Kerala High Court that had ruled out any parole for the convict for 25 years. Sreenivasan had been arrested for murdering a pregnant woman in Malampuzha in 2004. While he had earlier absconded after obtaining parole, he returned to the prison. In the meantime, he used to work in a textile mill in Coimbatore. The police have not ruled out the possibility of the duo attempting to leave the State. According to Nedumangad Dy.SP Umesh Kumar, a special team led by Maranalloor Station House Officer Bejoy has been constituted to locate the convicts. Local resident held The Neyyar Dam police took into custody one person, identified as Ravi, who resides near the prison, in connection with the case. He was caught on suspicion of handing over Rs. 28,000 and clothes allegedly given by Rajesh’s mother to him. The Kerala Prisons have also instituted an internal probe to ascertain the possibility of any lapse on the part of prison officials. Sources claimed that Rajesh had been shifted to the Open Prison from the Poojappura Central Prison recently as part of a temporary arrangement due to the COVID-19 spread.  They were allowed to leave the cells for farming activities on the premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-convicts-escape-from-open-prison/article33415156.ece

The previous council led by the United Democratic Front (UDF) had opposed the proposed plant, saying that it could place a massive financial liability on the civic body.

Leasehold rights With the LDF assuming power, officials hope to speed up the initial processes ahead of awarding the contract to the company, which is to be shortlisted based on the technical and financial proposals. As per the government’s decision, the firm to be chosen for the execution of the project will have powers to mortgage the leasehold rights over 20 acres for raising funds for the project. The KSIDC will sub-lease the land to the firm for 27 years, with permission to mortgage the leasehold rights for raising funds only for the project. DBFOT mode The plant will be set up based on the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer mode for the Ernakulam cluster of local bodies.

Women’s Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma and Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy when they visited, along with Superintendent of Police B. Sathya Yesu Babu, the house of murdered SBI employee Snehalatha, whose body was kept outside on the street, on Thursday. The protesters demanded immediate suspension of I Town circle inspector Prathap Reddy for his alleged comments on Snehalatha and revealing her phone messages and calls and other details. The protesters did not allow them to board their vehicles, which led to a tense situation. They kept on raising slogans demanding action against the police for alleged inaction, claiming that “otherwise, the girl would have been alive now”. “We are aghast at the claim of the police that they had acted with alacrity and solved the murder mystery, when in fact they did not act on time and allowed the crime to happen. Snehalatha’s life could have been saved,” said Dalit leaders.  ‘Disha police failed me’ “The much-publicised Disha App and police personnel failed us,” alleged Snehalatha’s mother M. Lakshmi Devi, talking to TDP President N. Chandrababu Naidu over the phone in front of mediapersons here. “I approached the police on Monday night, but they did not take any complaint and wanted me to come to the police station the next morning and lodge a complaint. I dialed the Disha App and the person who received the call, asked me from which State are you calling and go and lodge a complaint in your police station,” said Ms. Lakshmi Devi. “This boy Gutti Rajesh (the accused, a masonry worker) had been harassing my daughter for the past one year, I had told the police about it. When I approached the I Town police in the night they said it was a love affair and she would come back. If it was a love affair, why would that boy kill my daughter?” she questioned. “He used to drink and come to our house when my husband, working as a driver, was away,” she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dalit-organisations-gherao-womens-panel-chief-anantapur-urban-mla/article33415123.ece

25 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||High Court refuses to stay distribution of house sites||A division bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court comprising Justices Rakesh Kumar and J. Uma Devi on Thursday turned down a plea seeking a stay on the process of land acquisition and distribution of house sites under the ‘Pedalandariki Illu’ scheme, which is scheduled for launch on Friday. The bench observed that it was not proper to impose a stay as the land transactions involved the government and individuals, and that the petitioners should have approached the court only if they were personally aggrieved. The court also made it clear that the land acquisition would be, however, subject to its final order and adjourned the case to January 22. One of the grounds on which the petition was filed was that the allotment of house sites would cause migration on a large scale and also affect the proposed delimitation of Assembly constituencies. Interim stay Meanwhile, a separate bench of the High Court headed by Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari granted an interim stay on the resuming of about 228 acres at Gundlamadugu village in Thondur mandal of Kadapa district for constructing houses under ‘Pedalandariki Illu’ scheme. The petitioner argued that the land is in the possession of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) and it was intended for industrial development. The matter has been ordered to be listed after four weeks. Advocate-General S. Sriram argued that when the land was acquired for a specified purpose, the validity of its resumption merely for assignment has to be examined in the context of the real public purpose involved in it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-court-refuses-to-stay-distribution-of-house-sites/article33415118.ece
25 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu demands CBI probe||The Telugu Desam Party President and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday described the burning alive of Snehalatha in Anantapur district as a ghastly incident that was more horrific than Nirbhaya and Disha incidents in the country. The government should order aCBI probe into the incident, he said. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Naidu held the State government responsible for the incident. A CBI probe alone would bring the facts to light and help nab the culprits responsible for the girl’s murder. “Why Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not go to Anantapur to initiate immediate action and to console the victimised family even though the CM was currently touring the neighbouring Kadapa district?” he asked. Had Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy responded and taken stern action against the culprits in the first two or three incidents, the law and order situation would not have slipped into this sorry state now, he said. Mr. Naidu said that cases should be booked against the police who did not take immediate action when Snehalatha’s parents complained about the harassment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-demands-cbi-probe/article33415126.ece
25 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Yanamala sees financial mismanagement in State||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Polit Bureau member and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has expressed the view that the situation in the State warrants financial emergency as per the Article 360 of the Indian Constitution. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that the Capital expenditure was Rs. 10,000 crore less when compared to last year. It means, the government expenditure on social infrastructure was nil. The infrastructure development in the medical and education sectors was nothing. Same was the case with Roads and Buildings (R&B), drains, and drinking water schemes. The per capita income slipped to minus 16% during this financial year. The revenue deficit skyrocketed. It was estimated that the share of debts to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) was 27% but likely to touch 37% due to the government's mismanagement, said the TDP leader. ‘Per capita debt rising’ The per capita debt was increasing day by day. The total outstanding liabilities touched Rs. 4.68 lakh crore. There was no control over interest payments, he said. It was pertinent to mention here that Union Minister Suresh Prabhu has asked the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to take stringent measures to check the financial mismanagement before things go out of control. It was pointed out that the Jagan government crossed all possible limits of borrowing capacity, he said adding, the government should come out of deep slumber and take necessary steps to control the State finances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yanamala-sees-financial-mismanagement-in-state/article33415115.ece

25 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fee cut in pvt. professional colleges rattles managements||The government has approved the suggestions made by the AP Higher Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APHERMC) on fixation of fee for B. Tech, B. Arch, Marine Engineering and B. Pharmacy courses in private unaided professional institutes in the State for the block period 2020-21 to 2022-23. A notification issued to this effect has left the stakeholders disconcerted. “It is shocking to say the least. The commission (APHERMC) has apparently not done proper home work,” said Nedurumalli Ram Kumar, president of AP Private Engineering Colleges Managements' Association (APPECMA). Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Ram Kumar referred to the drastic cut in the fee “without taking into consideration the high inflation rate” and said the commission should have taken into account a comprehensive picture of the scenario before arriving at a decision. In 2019, he pointed out, the commission said it did not have sufficient time to make an in-depth study of all key aspects and had assured the government that it would address these shortfalls next year. "It has repeated the same thing this year too. The fee varies for different aspects. For instance, a student with multiple backlogs has to pay the examination fee. How do you calculate this on a uniform scale?” he said. Speaking about the commission's claim that the fee structure is based on the standard of education offered by the colleges, he said “a few colleges may not be doing well but many are competing with universities.” Meet on Dec. 28 Rattled by the development, the association has called for a meeting on Monday (December 28) to chalk out its future course of action. “We need to sit with the commission and sort out certain key issues,” he said. The government has clearly notified that the stipulated fee is an all-inclusive annual fee covering tuition fee, affiliation fee, cost of identity card, medical fee, inter college or inter university sports, games and cultural meet fee, computer-internet fee, college magazine and student activities, student health care scheme, student welfare fund, study tour, alumni fund, examination fee including stationery, maintenance and amenities fee, common services fee and other recurring expenditure. Warning against any deviation from the given d irections, it said the commission will initiate serious penal action against the institute concerned. In the 240 private engineering colleges in the State, the minimum fee is fixed at Rs. 35,000 and increased for some based on the stature of the college. For B. Arch courses offered by four colleges in the State, the minimum fee is Rs. 40,000 and maximum Rs. 70,000, for B. Tech Marine Engineering course, it is Rs. 1,25,000 and for B. Pharmacy courses, it starts from Rs. 35,000 and goes up depending on the standard of the institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fee-cut-in-pvt-professional-colleges-rattles-managements/article33414615.ece

25 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||A dent in Hyderabad’s heritage in 2020||2020: The year of gloom and doom left a trail of destruction on the centuries old built and natural heritage of Hyderabad. If the dip in tourist and visitor numbers robbed the palaces, museums and tourist sites of the usual buzz and the ticket money and hobbled the tourism industry, the October rain did the rest. An indifferent upkeep with the city lacking even the most basic of Heritage Conservation Committee made matters worse. Bright spots One of the bright spots was the visible transformation of the Moazzam Jahi Market after Rs. 15 crore was spent on the old market built in 1935 as part of a City Improvement Board effort. But the joy of hearing the chimes of the clock and seeing the domed structure covered in rice lights was short-lived as it began to leak during the torrential downpour that followed the re-inauguration. Another bright spot was the discovery that the dome of Abdullah Qutb Shah was a ribbed structure. Restored in the course of the year, the ribbed dome now, can be seen shining like a jewel from atop the Golconda Fort. Extensive damage Some of the most extensive damage due to record-breaking rain happened to 500-year-old Golconda Fort, where one of its bastions, the Majnu Burj, collapsed leaving the magnificent 17th century cannon hanging precariously in the air. The destruction didn’t end with that. After the October 14 rain, many stretches of the upper reaches of the Golconda Fort collapsed. The Kingsway, which has seen hundreds of monsoons, gave way turning into a pile of large stones. The innermost wall of the fort which was never breached has turned into a pile of stones as the rainwater washed away earth under the walls. Even secular structures built during the last phase of the Nizam Osman Ali Khan’s reign suffered damage due to a complete absence of upkeep. The Osmania Arts College building began leaking at multiple places on the first floor leading to damage to furniture and classrooms. It didn’t help matters that the classrooms were locked due to the lockdown. The Osmania General Hospital too suffered damage, but of a different nature. As drainage water flooded the building, images showing flooded wards became viral. But only later, it was discovered that the water was not from leaking ceiling or walls but due to the changed landscape and blocked drainage near the hospital. Abandoned portions But the damage was done. Sections of the hospital are still abandoned and are not in use. In Old City, the Bela Kaman was brought down by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials after residents raised an alarm about the structural stability of the arch. But one of the most galling blows to Hyderabad’s heritage was the razing of the G-Block in the Secretariat Complex. Called Sarvahita, it was an old palace repurposed as a secretariat complex by the Nizams. It formed the kernel where the Secretariat came up over a period of time. With the destruction, the bureaucratic link between the Nizam’s rule and Independent India’s has been snapped. It was on December 25, 1905, that a 40-year-old Nizam Mahubub Ali Pasha laid the stone for the Town Hall, which is now the Telangana Assembly building. The building still remains the legislature for the State which the administration wanted to shift to another location. For a city that takes pride in its heritage, 2020 was an absolute disaster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-dent-in-citys-heritage-in-2020/article33415034.ece

Transporting warriors At a time when lockdown was clamped across the State, and stringent restrictions of public movement were in place, the TSRTC was busy not only transporting frontline warriors, such as hospital staff, to their places of work, but also helping migrant workers reach railways stations so that they could board Shramik special trains. According to data obtained by means of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the TSRTC pressed into service several buses and clocked 3,278 trips for migrant workers. Further, it made as many as 7,173 trips on 37 routes so that hospital staff could reach their places of work. An additional 6,062 trips were made on 30 routes to transport sanitation staff. Another 2,503 trips were made to move Secretariat staff. A silver lining Launched on June 19, the TSRTC’s Parcel, Courier and Cargo (PCC) on the first day generated a revenue of only around Rs. 15,000. Six months later, it has generated a revenue of approximately Rs. 20 crore and has delivered over 14 lakh parcels. The per day revenue generation, on an average, is upwards of Rs. 14 lakh. Lockdown revenue loss After six months of being off the roads on account of the lockdown, TSRTC buses resumed services in the city on September 25, albeit with only 25% of its fleet strength. According to TSRTC staff, the lockdown caused a loss of revenue running into several crores per day. However, with reduced expenditure on fuel, the losses to some extent were ameliorated. Despite the resumption of services in the city, the occupancy continues to remain low. But while the TSRTC resumed its city operations and inter-district operations, a stalemate between the corporations of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh continued to affect its revenues. For example, there were no services between the two States during Dasara, considered to be the peak festival season. It was only in the first week of November that both the State transport undertakings signed a deal to resume inter-State services. Decreasing fleet size While Hyderabad and Bengaluru have approximately the same population, as compared to the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), the TSRTC has a fleet much smaller in size. While the BMTC reportedly has 6,460 buses, the TSRTC’s Greater Hyderabad Zone (GHZ), per RTI data, has only 2,982. Not only this, the fleet size had decreased over the years. While in FY 2014-15 the GHZ had 3,811 buses, in FY 2019-2020 this number declined to 2,982. Ageing fleet Bus enthusiasts and transport researchers have time and again pointed out that the current fleet strength is inadequate. They have also pointed out that the TSRTC’s fleet is ageing as the average age of buses is around 9.56 lakh km., and several buses – approximately 150 – have crossed the 15 lakh km threshold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tsrtc-on-the-front-line-but-in-dire-need-of-help/article33415047.ece
25 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court issues notices to OU and KU||Telangana High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre, University Grants Commission, Osmania University and Kakatiya university over a PIL petition seeking action against university officials responsible for granting research fellowships to ineligible students. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy directed them to file counter affidavits on the matter. The CBI, which was made one of the respondents, was also given notice. A student K. Srinivas, who filed the plea, requested the HC to order for an investigation by the CBI into the allegations that students who did not register with the universities for the programmes of M.Phil and Ph.D. were given fellowships. He sought action against the officials of OU and KU responsible for awarding fellowships to students who did not comply with the mandatory registration procedure. He requested the court to instruct the officials of the two universities to scrutinise the fellowships awarded to such unregistered students. Mr. Srinivas, who wanted to pursue Ph.D programme in History, contended that UGC guidelines categorically state that only those candidates (belonging to OBC/Minority/SC/ST) who had already registered for M.Phil/Ph.D are eligible for fellowship. The universities were required to issue notification inviting applications for awarding fellowships. Fellowship amount These fellowships are awarded in Science, Humanities, Social Science, Engineering and Technology. Amounts of Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 28,000 are awarded monthly for Junior Research Fellow and Senior Research Fellow respectively. Mr. Srinivas said that he had secured information under the RTI Act from the Dean of Faculty of Sciences of Osmania University about the fellowships. It was found that many of the students who got fellowships did not have admissions in M.Phil or Ph.D when they were awarded fellowships. On June 1, 2016, some students represented to the Union Ministry of Human Resources to conduct an inquiry into awarding fellowships to ineligible candidates in OU. Another representation was made to OU Vice-Chancellor on the matter. However, no action was taken, the petitioner maintained. On this January 7, one of the Ph.D aspirants sent a petition to the UGC explaining the irregularities in awarding fellowships in OU and KU and how genuine students were being deprived of an opportunity to conduct research works, the petitioner said. The PIL plea was posted after four weeks for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-notices-to-ou-and-ku/article33415041.ece

25 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Hold poll for GHMC Mayor post, BJP tells SEC., govt||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Bandi Sanjay Kumar demanded the government and the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold election for the post of the GHMC Mayor without any further delay as results have been declared more than a fortnight ago. “The TRS government and the SEC held the GHMC polls in a tearing hurry not wanting to give a chance to the Opposition, especially the BJP to prepare for the electioneering. After several machinations, we emerged victorious even though Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself raised the bogey of law and order problems. People supported us and did not believe him,” he said at the party office on Thursday. Addressing a gathering on the occasion of many TRS leaders from Khammam and other districts joining the party, Mr. Sanjay Kumar pointed out that the entire GHMC poll exercise was completed in the shortest possible time despite several colonies still under flood water and people still recovering from heavy rains. “Why are you not holding the poll for the Mayor post? When are you going to do it? Are you ready?,” he questioned the ruling party and warned against attempts to lure newly elected corporators. “Our corporators are being offered large sums of money to jump sides. We too can play the same game and there will be serious repercussions,” he warned. Police blamed The BJP president also accused the police of continuing to play a partisan role in aiding the ruling party in several activities. The government has been undermining the All India Service officers by putting retired officers in key positions to help the TRS leaders in various dubious transactions. The police are also getting involved in trying to prevent people from leaving the ruling party and join the BJP, he alleged. Mr. Sanjay Kumar also demanded the government and the Kothagudem district administration to ensure justice to the five minor tribal girls subjected to harassment by their teacher in Chintavalli village of Laxmidevpalli mandal. Powerful people belonging to the ruling party have been trying to undermine the incident and this is totally condemnable. The party will stand by the families and help them get justice, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hold-poll-for-mayor-post-bjp-tells-sec-govt/article33415039.ece
25 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Acid attack: three people taken into custody||Within 24 hours after the acid attack on a 22-year-old widow, a man and his two friends were taken into custody by Jagtial police on Thursday. The prime suspect, who reportedly confessed to the crime, was alleged paramour of the victim, police said. “He is being questioned on their relationship,” an officer told The Hindu . He said that the prime accused, Gajendar, along with two of his friends hatched a conspiracy to attack her after he suspected that she was ‘cheating’ on him. Call records “Recently, Gajendar found that the victim was also talking to other people in the village, as a result of which he got enraged and resorted to the act,” the investigators said, adding that the suspect is a resident of Dabba village in the district, which also is the in-law’s place of the victim. Two of his friends are Ammaakkalapet village. Police have also analysed the call detail records of the victim and the prime suspect. Initially, the investigators questioned the husband of her younger sister after she raised suspicion on him, as they had some disagreements over family issues. “However, his role was ruled out,” they said. On Wednesday at around 7.30 p.m., an unidentified person wearing a helmet threw acid on the woman at Thimmapur Thanda of Ibrahimpatnam mandal. Earlier, family members of the victim thanked Jagtial Superintendent of Police Sindhu Sarma who went the extra mile in saving her life. Letter to hospital After the victim, a mother of two, was shifted to Nizamabad from Government Hospital, Metpally, for better treatment, Ms. Sarma wrote a letter directing the hospital management to provide quality medicare free of cost.“Victim requires immediate medical assistance. Under Section 357-C of Criminal Code of Procedure, a victim of acid attack shall be provided treatment free of cost by all the hospitals, including private and government,” the SP stated in the letter, a copy of which is in possession with The Hindu . Punishment The letter further stated that if anyone acts in contravention of the provision, he/she shall be liable to be punished under Section 166B of the Indian Penal Code for imprisonment of up to one year. “I request you to provide treatment free of cost to this acid attack victim in compliance with provisions of law immediately,” Ms. Sarma told the hospital management. Police said that the victim suffered 7% burns to her right ear, cheek and collar bone, and her condition is said to be stable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/acid-attack-three-people-taken-into-custody/article33415040.ece

25 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New COVID strains may not alter vaccine efficacy||CSIR-CCMB director Rakesh Mishra informed Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday that the new COVID-19 strains are less likely to change the efficacy of vaccines and there is no evidence of worse outcomes for patients, although the strains are more infective. The director met Mr. Naidu and briefed him about the new strains of SARS-Cov-2 found in UK and South Africa recently, and said that the same disease management strategies currently in vogue are expected to work for the variants too. The VP sought to know about the likely impact of the new strains here and the work being carried out on various aspects of coronavirus at CCMB. Dr. Mishra explained that investigations were underway to find out whether the new strains are present in India. Making a presentation on the work being done at CCMB on SARS-CoV2, he said that the new strain was 71% more infectious than the other strains. A parallel strain identified in South Africa suggests that it affects younger people more, though more thorough research is required, he explained. Genomes sequenced by CCMB and other researchers in the country has revealed that the initial spread of the virus in the country was mainly due to novel India specific clade, named I/A3i clade. The I/A3i clade had likely entered from other Southeast Asian countries. The analysis further revealed that, with time, the weaker A3i clade was eventually replaced by A2a clade, also the globally prevalent strain, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-strains-may-not-alter-vaccine-efficacy/article33414613.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||2020: The year of digital streaming||2020 was a strange year and the pandemic spared no industry. In mid-January, watching the Sankranthi crowd-pullers Sarileru Neekevvaru and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo , one wouldn’t have fathomed that the larger-than-life experience of watching films in theatres would soon change. Among the theatrical releases from January to mid-March, these two films gained big. The former, directed by Anil Ravipudi, was an unabashedly loud mass entertainer in which Mahesh Babu seemed to be having fun and Vijayashanti returned to cinema after a hiatus. The essence of Trivikram Srinivas’ Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo can be summed up as ‘it’s all in your genes’. The escapist family entertainer had a galaxy of stars led by Allu Arjun, Pooja Hegde and Murali Sharma, and hummable tunes (one of Thaman’s best albums in recent times). Debut director Sailesh Kolanu’s HIT (Homicide Intervention Team), produced by Prashanti Tipirneni and Nani, was a taut thriller about an officer investigating the case of a missing girl. The crime stoked memories of a gruesome incident that took place on the outskirts of Hyderabad and the film addressed it with sensitivity. HIT is poised to be a franchise. A smaller film that made for a compelling watch was director Karuna Kumar’s Palasa 1978 , discussing caste politics. Once the theatres were closed and lockdown was imposed in March, viewers lapped up web series, shorts, documentaries and films across languages and genres on digital streaming platforms. New films awaiting release courted the digital platforms. Smaller screens at home were no match for the theatrical experience, but home-viewing turned out to be a great leveller – everyone could get a taste of the first day, first show experience. Among the first direct OTT Telugu releases to make an impression was director Ravikanth Perepu’s romance-comedy-drama Krishna and his Leela . The urban romance-comedy-drama had three notable women performers in Shraddha Srinath, Shalini Vadnikatti and Seerat Kapoor. But the one who made viewers take a new look at him was actor-writer Siddhu Jonnalagadda. Siddhu later wrote and starred in director Aditya Madala’s Maa Vintha Gaadha Vinuma . Debut director Srikanth Nagoti’s romantic drama Bhanumathi & Ramakrishna starring Naveen Chandra and Salony Luthra talked about finding love in your 30s, with a no-frills narration. After Care of Kancharapalem , director Venkatesh Maha ushered viewers into another hyper-local setting, the Araku Valley, in Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya . Actor Satyadev was the backbone of this everyday hero story. Debut director Vinod Anantoju reminded viewers of simpler times of Telugu cinema of the 1980s, by focusing on the everyday family tussles in Middle Class Melodies , set in Guntur and Tenali. The Bombay Chutney stoked the appetite and actors Anand Deverakonda, Varsha Bollamma and Goparaju Ramana made an impression. Both Uma Maheshwara ... and Middle Class… benefited by casting local theatre actors in supporting roles. The warm reception to Colour Photo showed that outsiders can shine in this nepotism-driven industry. Director Sandeep Raj, actors Suhas, Chandini Chowdary, Srividya, Divya Sripada, Harsha and many others in the film made their mark from YouTube videos to cinema and teamed up to present a moving story of romance.  Gatham was the surprise of the year. Made with a shoestring budget by US-based Indian-origin folks passionate about films, and directed by Kiran Reddy, this thriller cleverly pulled the rug from under the audience’s feet to unravel a crime mystery. Film units tread cautiously until October to resume film shootings, barring a few exceptions. The only director to have had a bunch of film releases this year was Ram Gopal Varma. With the small screen becoming the go-to means of information and entertainment in 2020, the time was right to experiment. Actor-producer Rana Daggubati launched the SouthBay.Live platform to introduce talk shows, news capsules for the under-25 age group and the quirky series ‘Why are you?’ In December, coinciding with the release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet , theatres in Telangana resumed operations with 50% seating capacity. One of the notable Christmas releases in Telugu is the Sai Dharam Tej starrer Solo Brathuke So Better . One of the biggest losses for Telugu cinema and music was the passing away of legendary singer, actor and multi-talented S P Balasubrahmanyam. The industry also lost veteran actor Jayaprakash Reddy.

25 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Teens to elderly volunteer at protest site||A 14-year-old girl who wants to participate in making history to a 76-year-old man from Fategarh Sahib who has been part of volunteering efforts for decades and a 26-year-old man who is supposed to get married in February next year to a 51-year-old businessman, there is a plethora of people making themselves available at the Singhu border.  The Hindu spoke with the four, who have been volunteering at the border under Khalsa Aid — an international NGO. The volunteers have been working round-the-clock attending to the needs of protesting farmers at Delhi-Haryana border. Sher Singh, the oldest volunteer here, sat on a trolley with others from his village and started for Delhi on November 24 — exactly a month ago. When he reached here, the volunteers of Khalsa gave us blankets and other essentials, he recalled. “ Main bohot khush hua [I was happy],” he said. Mr. Singh then asked the volunteers if he could also perform sewa. “They told me I am old and I should not perform sewa now. I told them I can work 24 hours a day and won’t feel tired,” he said, adding that now also, he does not feel the need to wear socks and sweaters. Willingness to work Mr. Singh said he did not have to go through the formal process with the NGO because his “willingness to work” made others let him. He comes in at 8 a.m. and leaves the spot at 8 p.m. after serving everyone’s needs. “Back at home, my wife and children are looking after our farm. I don’t have a phone. My family calls the people with whom I have come here. I talk to them once in 10 days,” he said, adding: “Morcha fateh karke hi jaenge [Will go only after the march is successful].” A Class 9 student of a private school in Delhi, Jaap Kaur, has been volunteering at the kiosk since a week now. Her father is also a volunteer. “I put up a WhatsApp status that I am a volunteer here. After seeing the status, my friends were left surprised and amazed,” she said. She also said her first stint at “sewa” was serving water two years ago. “ Sab good wishes dete hain, usme bohot proud wali feeling aati hai [Everyone blesses me. It is a very rewarding].” Ms. Jaap not only gives out necessary things to protesters but also helps in segregating materials from all the donations. Gurpreet Singh from Patiala, a documentary filmmaker, has been associated with the organisation since he was 19. He had joined for a paid project but later, he told them that he would work for free. But for the last five years, he has been working full time with Khalsa Aid. Mr. Singh’s wedding is on the cards and his family is worried for his health as he has recovered from COVID-19 just in August. “They just don’t want me to contract the virus again especially before the wedding,” he said. Every night, Mr. Singh takes a stroll to check if all the elderly protesters are fine . “People come here during the weekend, take a look at all sorts of langars and leave the spot. They should stop and asked these old men and women if they are fine. It’s not easy. At this retirement age, when they should be more comforted, they are in fact most uncomfortable,” he said. Tejinder Singh (51) from Jalandhar, a businessman, has been here volunteering for the last 18 days. He believes that he is earning more profits byperforming sewa . “I have experienced this before as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/teens-to-elderly-volunteer-at-protest-site/article33414777.ece
25 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||DDA suggests 12 nodes, other changes to TOD policy||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has suggested a few modifications, including identification of 12 nodes, to the Transit-Oriented Development policy. Senior officials said the DDA has identified Kashmere Gate, Nizamuddin/Sarai Kale Khan, Anand Vihar Multi-modal transit hubs as some of the TOD nodes. They will be taken up in the first phase alongside the New Delhi Railway station, Trilokpuri metro station, Jangpura RRTS station and Mukundpur metro station. A senior DDA official said: “TOD nodes are the select mass transit stations and their influence zones identified by the DDA. The provisions of this regulation shall only be applicable in the influence zones of such identified TOD nodes. A TOD approach in Delhi will help in bringing people and jobs closer to mass transit and lead to walkable, mixed-use developments within influence zones of transit stations.”  Influence Zone Plans The land-owning agency has also proposed the preparation of Influence Zone Plans (IZP), which will cover recommendations for area improvement pertaining to traffic and parking management plan, integration of projects over station development, if applicable and projects for the improvement of open spaces, public spaces, location of vending zones and so on, officials said. “An IZP will be prepared to assess existing traffic patterns and the potential impact of new development. An audit of streets to review walkability, mapping of ongoing and existing infrastructure projects or other public works by various service providing agencies, in the node will also be carried out,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dda-suggests-12-nodes-other-changes-to-tod-policy/article33414772.ece

They said they will also dispatch senior functionaries, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, to the countryside to listen to Mr. Modi’s address on the occasion of the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “We have installed LED screen at 280 municipal wards in the city and target bringing 500 to 1,000 people to each spot for Mr. Modi’s dialogue with farmers via videoconference tomorrow [Friday],” said Leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri. “The programme will feature speeches at each venue on the achievements of the Modi government over the last six years followed by the PM’s address in which he will directly converse with farmers,” Mr. Bidhuri added. Mr. Shah along with Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and MP Ramesh Bidhuri will hear the PM’s address at Gaushala, Kishangarh village near Vasant Kunj, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and MP Pravesh Sahib Singh at Kakrola Mor in the Matiala Assembly, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at Ranjit Nagar, the party said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-instals-led-screens-across-125-villages-in-city/article33414781.ece

Mr. Sambhajiraje wondered how much of the benefits would actually pass on to the Maratha community and questioned whether the State government had already given up hopes of putting up a strong defence for the Maratha quota before the Supreme Court’s hearing on the case on January 25 next year. “While I certainly am not against the benefits of the EWS reservation being passed on to the Maratha community, the question is whether the State government can guarantee that it will not endanger benefits traditionally availed by other castes included in the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) ambit? Furthermore, will the Marathas actually avail of any benefits under this rubric?” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sambhajiraje-slams-govt-move-to-extend-ews-benefits-to-marathas/article33414701.ece
25 December 2020||Brussels,||EU leaders hail post-Brexit deal||Political leaders in Europe on Thursday hailed the belated sealing of a U.K.-EU post-Brexit deal that aims to to lay the groundwork for long-term future cooperation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was more measured. “At the end of a successful negotiations journey I normally feel joy. But today, I only feel quiet satisfaction and, frankly speaking, relief,” she said, citing British playwright Shakespeare: “Parting is such sweet sorrow.” But she also showed her steely side, warning that, protected by the deal from unfair British competition, “The single market will be fair and remain so.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lauded what he termed “a good deal for the whole of Europe,” which offers “a new stability and a new certainty” to relations. Britain formally left the EU in January after a deeply divisive referendum in 2016, the first country to split from the political and economic project that was born as the continent rebuilt in the aftermath of Second World War. London remains bound by the EU’s rules during a transition period that runs until midnight on December 31, when the U.K. will leave the the bloc’s single market and customs union. Irish premier Micheal Martin — whose EU member State would have been hard hit by a no-deal — said the accord was the “least bad version of Brexit possible”. “There is no such thing as a ‘good Brexit’ for Ireland. But we have worked hard to minimise the negative consequences,” he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was “confident” that the deal was a “good outcome” as it now goes over to EU member States to agree. For French President Emmanuel Macron — often portrayed as a bogeyman by the British tabloids — “Europe’s unity and firmness paid off”. Next crucial step The final 2,000-page agreement was held up by wrangling over fishing as both sides haggled over the access EU fisherman will get to Britain’s waters after the end of the year. Following the announcement of the political accord, Ms. Von der Leyen’s Commission will send the text to the EU member States. They are expected to take two or three days to analyse the agreement and decide whether to approve its provisional implementation. The U.K. Parliament will also have to interrupt its end of year holidays to vote on the deal before the December 31 cut-off. Once it is signed off and the text published in the EU’s official journal it will go into effect on January 1 when Britain has left the bloc’s single market. The European Parliament will then have a chance to retrospectively approve the deal, at some point in 2021, EU officials said. And the 11th hour deal heads off the threat that Britain could crash out of the club after 47 years of shared history with no follow-on rules. With Britain outside the EU single market and customs area, cross-Channel traders will still face a battery of new regulations and delays. Economists expect both economies, already weakened by the coronavirus epidemic, to take a hit as supply chains are disrupted and costs mount. Key compromise But the threat of a return to tariffs will have been removed, and relations between the former partners will rest on a surer footing. It is also a success for Ms. Von der Leyen and her chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who led almost 10 months of intense talks with Britain’s David Frost. Under the new deal, EU fishing fleets will have to give up a quarter of their current catch in British waters over the next five and a half years, officials said. After this transitional period, access to its rich fishing grounds would be negotiated on an annual basis. This represents a compromise. Earlier in the negotiations, Britain was pushing for an 80 or 60% cut in the EU’s share, phased in over only three years. Boats from the continent will also be allowed to work in British inshore waters less than 12 nautical miles from shore during the transition. But it will still be a bitter pill to swallow for many fishing communities in northwestern Europe, which have worked what are now U.K. waters for centuries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-leaders-hail-post-brexit-deal/article33414415.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Xi Jinping tightens grip on China||A year that began in China with the country’s leadership facing searching questions about its handling of a new pandemic that struck the city of Wuhan ends with President Xi Jinping firming up his political control. If 2020 started as China’s annus horribilis, the year has, in the eyes of many strategic experts in Beijing, only hastened China’s ascendancy and narrowed the gap with the United States, its great rival. Beijing, having broadly controlled the coronavirus at home, is now leading a global economic recovery, as well as adopting, as India discovered through this summer’s border crisis, an increasingly muscular posture abroad. In contrast, the U.S. has struggled with both its response to the pandemic as well as unprecedented political divisions at home, manifested in a closely fought election that ended with the defeat of President Donald Trump, whose term in office marked a deterioration in relations with China triggered by a trade war. A crisis in Wuhan Few in China would have expected the year to end as it does. China’s initial fumbling of the pneumonia outbreak that began last December, when the leadership in Wuhan delayed action for three weeks, has now become a footnote, with the leadership showcasing China’s recovery as underlining the superiority of its political system. Back in February, the death of the whistle-blower doctor Li Wenliang had led to an outpouring of criticism, which prompted Beijing to fire the Communist Party leaders in charge of Wuhan and Hubei province. Mr. Xi then acknowledged the pandemic had posed “a major test” of China’s governance. In March, a prominent former real estate tycoon with close Party links, Ren Zhiqiang, penned a searing essay directly criticising Mr. Xi’s leadership. Yet by the summer, China’s controlling of the outbreak, thanks to strict lockdowns and a sweeping testing and tracing system, helped the Party weather the storm. Coupled with the failure of the U.S. to tackle the coronavirus effectively— which the Party propaganda has ceaselessly highlighted as a vindication of its leadership — signs are Mr. Xi remains as strong as ever heading into 2021, a sensitive year that will see the Party celebrate its centenary in July. Heading into the anniversary, the trend of political centralisation under Mr. Xi is only expected to continue, as also the shrinking space for dissent. Mr. Ren, the real estate tycoon, was in September sentenced to 18 years in jail ostensibly on corruption charges, although the real offence was his critical essay. The previous month, another prominent critic of Mr. Xi’s from inside the Party, Cai Xia, a professor of the Party School, was expelled from the elite institution that Mr. Xi once headed over her criticisms of his leadership style, which included an observation that a growing number of Party officials were opposed to the political direction under him but were afraid of speaking out. Strong recovery China’s subsequent recovery from the pandemic helped the leadership mute its critics, with the world’s second-largest economy likely to be the only major country to grow in a pandemic-hit year. China in the first quarter contracted by 6.8%, but has since recovered strongly, growing 3.2% in the second quarter and 4.9% in the third. Shuttered factories have reopened, although the global slump remains a headwind. That has prompted Mr. Xi to double down on his push for greater self-reliance, which he has called a “dual circulation” model that strikes a better balance between relying on domestic consumption and external trade. A key Party plenum held in October discussed “a new development pattern” for the 14th five-year plan (2021-2025) and also laid out a “Vision 2035” blueprint that emphasises more sustainable growth. China is still struggling with rising debt, a problem worsened by this year’s economic relief measures, and is also pushing for cleaner growth, with Mr. Xi this year announcing a target to go carbon neutral by 2060, which will require a reduction of coal in the energy mix from 58% to less than 50% by 2025. Assertive Posture If 2020 has reinforced the belief in Beijing of its global ascendancy, it has also been marked by an increasingly muscular approach abroad on all of its frontiers. China’s homegrown aircraft carrier, the Shandong, sailed across the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea after being inducted into the navy this year and will be combat ready by early 2021. Beijing has made clear to the new administration in Washington it will brook no interference in its “internal affairs”, even as it has pursued increasingly hard-line policies in Hong Kong, where a new national security law has tightened its grip, and in Xinjiang, where it has hit out at any criticism over the internment of more than one million Uighurs in “re-education” centres. In early May, China appeared to disregard three decades of a carefully built consensus with India as it mobilised two divisions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), in a move that officials in Delhi saw as aimed at unilaterally redrawing the LAC in Ladakh. A clash in Galwan Valley in June that led to the loss of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers marked the most serious border crisis with India since the 1960s, leading many former Indian officials to describe 2020 as a major inflection point in relations with China. As the year ends, a sub-zero LAC remains tense with neither side agreeing on a plan to disengage, with the expectation in India of continued hostilities as the snow melts in the spring and tensions on the border to dominate the relationship next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-jinping-tightens-grip-on-china/article33414412.ece
25 December 2020||Washington,||Trump pardons more allies: White House||U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new raft of pardons on Wednesday for allies including the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, adding to a long list he has granted in his waning days in office. In addition to the pardon for Charles Kushner, Mr. Trump also pardoned his 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former adviser Roger Stone, the White House said. They were among 26 people pardoned and three who had all or part of their sentences commuted on Wednesday by Mr. Trump. This comes only a day after Mr. Trump pardoned another 15 people and commuted sentences for five. Tuesday’s list included two people linked to the probe into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia and four Blackwater security guards convicted over the 2007 killing of 14 Iraqi civilians. Those pardons drew outrage, and Wednesday’s actions were likely to do the same. Real estate developer Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to charges, including tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004. His pardon had been expected by many, given his family connection. Jared Kushner is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-pardons-more-allies-white-house/article33414417.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Are children being introduced to coding too early in life?||The number of coding and programming bootcamps that are being offered by educational technology (Ed Tech) companies for children as young as four or five years has increased exponentially in recent times. Ed Tech companies argue that careers in the 21st century will be based on technology, for which children should get a head start. There have also been ringing endorsements from celebrities for this trend. Should we at all be concerned about this? What are the repercussions of increasing screen time for young children? Pritika Mehta and Latha Madhusudhan discuss this issue in a conversation moderated by Mandira Moddie . Edited excerpts: With schools being shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a spurt in enrolments in coding classes. What could be the reasons for this? Pritika Mehta:I think there are three reasons. One is FOMO (fear of missing out) — somebody else’s child has learned JavaScript, my child is not yet into it, so I shall get him to do that. The second is the sense of security with jobs. I think a lot of careers in India are driven by how well-paying the job is. We pursue careers not out of passion but by figuring out what can earn us a decent living. The third is that parents wanted to channelise the energy of their children during the pandemic and they found coding to be one way of doing that. Latha Madhusudhan:I would not recommend joining coding classes. I would go back and ask the parents, what is it that a child needs at the age of four? The child needs his security, he needs to develop his physical skills, hone his language and speaking skills, and his metabolic system has to be in place. All of this has to be achieved before he can get into coding and programming. Some say that since technology has crept into pretty much every aspect of our lives, children should be exposed at an early age to coding as that will help them develop analytical thinking, logic and problem-solving skills. But why is it happening at such an early age? PM:Education is not only about learning to code, or learning mathematics, or learning just one subject; it is about the overall development of a child’s brain. My nieces and nephews are very attracted to technology, to mobile phones. They know how to open websites and do many things on the phone. So, if a child enjoys technology, how about you expose him to certain coding courses online which are free? Instead of letting your child play games on the mobile phone for two hours, why don’t you help him spend an hour learning coding which can help him channelise his energy and maybe one hour he can have the time to play games? I don’t think coding is for everybody, but it’s like maths... if you know maths, your life becomes easier. And it is not that everybody goes on to pursue a career in maths. If you know coding, it will help you become a part of this technological revolution that is happening around the world. But I would not recommend that every parent push their child aged four or five into coding. I would just say expose it to them. If they like it, good; if they don’t, then they have a lot of years to learn it. There have been numerous studies on how early exposure to technology can harm the child’s development; that technology comes at the cost of developing cognitive skills that children build through personal connections and interactions, and free play. Could you elaborate on this? LM:In my school, we do not encourage technology in any form. I advise parents that screen time is not at all what children should have right now. We need to understand what the child needs at this age. Until the age of 12, the brain is not wired to master anything outside of oneself. The brain is wired to connect, it is wired to learn from experience and stimulation. A young child between the age of zero and seven years only learns in an environment of imitation, emulation. When children see their parents sitting in front of a screen and working, they pretend to do the same thing. At that point of time, what they need is to first develop their basic skills. Let them develop the biggest computer that is their own body and their brain, let them master their physical skills, and then move on to something outside of their body to master. Then it happens very easily. It’s not like I’m against technology. But only at the age of 12, the brain is wired to better receive technology. PM:I disagree a little that at the age of 12, everybody has developed at the same pace. A parent should judge his or her child’s ability to learn. Whether the child is ready or not, expose the child to technology. If he doesn’t like it, don’t go ahead with it. And if he does like it, then why not? Just like you send your children for swimming classes, maths classes and dance classes, why not send them or just expose them to coding classes online? LM:Yes, children are very individualistic. Each one has his own talent. But what does [literature on] pedagogy and human development or child development say? Universally, if you see, by the age of 24 months, every child is walking. By 18 months, the child speaks. So, when there are developmental milestones to be reached, then individualism comes within that span of development. When children are exposed too early to technology, to screen time, to too much media, what happens to the physical development of the eye, to sensory integration and to their social interactions? There are developmental milestones which every child should meet at the appropriate age. When you put children in front of the screen or introduce them to coding and they develop one kind of skill, what happens to their physical skills? The human eye does not develop completely until the age of seven. Any medical person will tell you that it takes that much time for the heartbeat to settle, since children’s heart rates are faster. When all these things are happening inside their bodies, we need to wait, give them time. There is enough time to do all these things. Do you think that there is room for both to co-exist at an age-appropriate time? That at the right time, the ideas of free play and these structured programmes that can help them develop their cognitive skills can be combined? LM:Yes, there is scope, but the bone of contention here is, what is the right age? We always talk about age-appropriate activities, even in education. As an educator, I am very clear: play experiences bring everything into the picture, whether it is logical thinking, cognition, critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills... you let the child be a child, not a small adult. If you leave him at that level, and allow play to take over, he will work, interact with the outer environment. Then these things will automatically happen. PM:I would like to add one thing. Because of the pandemic, children are receiving their education only on mobiles or laptops, so there is already screen time. And they are watching a lot of television. There is technology at every juncture of your day-to-day life, and it is really hard to keep your child away from it. I see no harm in this. I started coding when I was very young, and I used to go outside and play. So, I think both can exist together. LM:I agree that media and screen time cannot be brushed under the carpet. They are here to stay. But that is my worry. The early years are the single most important period of the human lifespan. That time is the [time for the] creation of healthy, happy, sustainable societies. This is not happening. There is lack of touch. There is lack of sensory integration. There is too much of exposure to media and children have forgotten how to write properly, how to pick up a book and read. They need to stay connected to another human being. They have relationship problems. Their growth hormones and genes are changing. Menarche has come down from 12 years to eight years and now five years. Where is society headed? Some affluent children have access to sports activities and these parents might find that balance. But what happens to these middle class children or lower middle class children? They are addicted to their mobiles. It is very harmful. PM:Excess of anything is harmful, but if done in moderation, I see no harm. And when it comes to writing or reading, honestly, these days I’m also not reading any book because I find reading blogs more interesting. And I hardly write anything; I type. I use Google Docs to make my documents, notes. Technology has made our life easier. And if we are using technology in our day-to-day life, maybe we are evolving in a different manner. There is an argument that technology is developing at such a fast pace that programming languages that are being used today will become redundant. And instead, with developments in artificial intelligence, humans will no longer be needed to code. So, is there a possibility that these skills that are being taught can become redundant? PM:No, coding will not become redundant. Today, I know more than seven to eight programming languages. But initially, I just learned one. For all the other languages, only the syntax changes, the semantics remain the same. If you know the basics of coding, you can pick up any language any time. And when it comes to the premise that humans will no longer be needed, I would say it is not that we will be replaced, but that we are going to work with better technology. When computers came people said, oh, we are going to be replaced. But just look at the time we are in. During the pandemic, almost all companies were able to operate because they had technology by their side. We had Zoom meetings and people could work from their homes because of technology. If we are replaced at one job, we might just need to learn another skill. I think technology has improved our life rather than ruining it. Excess of anything is bad. We just need to find the right balance. The National Education Policy 2020 recommends that coding be introduced in school only from Class 6 onwards. With private players coming into this field, do you think there is a need for some sort of regulation in this area? PM:I don’t see the need to regulate anything. Companies pressing parents to enrol their children in coding classes or bootcamps... that’s a marketing problem and not really a problem related to coding. LM:More than regulation, what is needed is a statutory warning. Parents should be educated on what is the need for the child at that age. PM:School education in India is broken. You might have seen a lot of discussions on why there is such a huge gap between the skills required by corporates versus the skills acquired by children in schools or colleges. We can fill this gap when we help children become creators of the future; this century is driven by technology.  Play experiences bring everything into the picture, whether it is logical thinking, cognition, critical thinking skills, or problem-solving skills... let the child be a child, not a small adult.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The farmers’ protest, truths and half-truths||The farmers’ protest that currently ring-fences Delhi resists resolution as the air is dense with contrary sets of truths and half-truths. This has made activist farmers suspicious of the reactivist state, and the general public too is equally divided. But what are these contrary sets of truths and half-truths? Protesters’ truth Farmers of Punjab and Haryana alone provide as much as 45% of the marketable surplus of wheat and rice by leveraging Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) regulations and the Minimum Support Price (MSP). These provisions were put in place more than 50 years ago to attract farmers to participate in the Green Revolution. That this programme worked best in Punjab and Haryana is because progressive farmers were at the political helm in these States (https://bit.ly/2WIdCUn).  As a result, the MSP became identified with wheat and rice, the two main crops of Punjab and Haryana. Other crops did not get much prominence as APMCs and its attendant MSP did not receive prominent support outside northwest India.  The “ arhtiyas ” (or, the mandi middlemen) are not seen as villains by farmers in Punjab and Haryana but function as lifeline links. Besides helping in the weighing, grading and sorting of grain, most of them are also fertilizer and pesticide agents, money lenders and general knowledge providers. Many arhtiyas today are Jat Sikhs and are substantial farmers too.  APMC mandis charge a transaction fee, or cess, which the State pockets. The proceeds of this money are used primarily to make better roads and storage facilities.  Contract farming has not been a success for two reasons. Small farmers complain that big contractors easily renege on their commitments and either refuse to buy the produce or beat down the price once harvesting is done. Second, if they give their lands to them then they may not get them back for no contractor will invest in land if the contract is just for a year and is renewable annually. The anti-zamindari policy of land to the tiller might now work against the interest of farmers if they are not the actual tillers for an extended period. Government’s truth The Minimum Support Price has never been a law, only a policy. Therefore, to demand it be made a law now is unfair. Farmers try to duck this question, but it is a major sticking point.  Like everything else, agricultural produce should also obey market price fluctuations. There will be good years and bad years and this is how agricultural markets function everywhere, and for every other crop in India as well. As there is no food shortage today, the provisions of the Green Revolution should no longer be binding. Contract farming will help the mass of small farmers by freeing them from their tiny plots and they will now be free to move outside the village and seek jobs elsewhere.  Farmers get huge subsidies from the State to the tune of 2%-2.5% of GDP. This is much higher than subsidies farmers receive in the United States, the European Union (EU), Latin America or Japan. Total subsidy in India is in the range of $45-50 billion, while in the U.S. it is about $20 billion, in the EU around $39 billion and Japan nearly $46 billion (https://bit.ly/3mMNr9I). Half-truths of protesters Protesters are putting out a half-truth when they argue that the MSP should be made a law. The MSP was never law, it was always a policy. So the farmers’ demand is not really to roll back the new agricultural Bill, as they claim, but to bring in a fresh one that makes MSP a law.  The second half-truth protesters refuse to fully acknowledge is that when international prices are higher than domestic prices, they resent not being able to sell outside the country. Onions and sugar are recent examples. Half-truths of the government On the other side there are half-truths too. True, contract farming ought to release farmers from their uneconomical holdings, but this does not acknowledge the actual difficulties farmers face with contract farming. As we have elaborated, a little earlier, farmers face problems both in terms of selling their produce and when they want their lands back from the contractors. It is true that mainly big farmers, not small or marginal ones, go to mandis . This conceals the fact that most small farmers find the transportation cost too expensive as APMC-run mandis are few and far between. If there had been more of them nearby, then these mandis would have been their preferred choice. It is true that the farm subsidy in India can be as high as $50 billion (about Rs. 3.83-lakh crore), but per farmer the subsidy just about touches $48, compared to over $7,000 in the U.S. (https://bit.ly/37Nztjq). When this is contextualised, we find that only 2% of U.S. farmers are below poverty line, but 85% of Indian farmers are small and marginal. We should not forget either that in India, the social cover for health, education and unemployment is poor.  The MSP does not apply only to wheat and rice, but to 22 crops in all (https://bit.ly/37MkvKB). If it is active only for wheat and rice, it is because there is a strong farmers’ lobby in the northwest. Also in the early years of food shortages, it was wheat and rice that received attention. It is true that farmers in Punjab and Haryana have created an ecological crisis of magnum proportions. Aided and abetted by the APMC and the MSP, farmers in the northwest primarily cultivate paddy and wheat and this has robbed the soil of vital nutrients besides depleting groundwater reserves. As rice is a thirsty crop and it does not rain very heavily in Punjab and Haryana, groundwater is increasingly being used, leading to its rapid depletion. If the APMC and the MSP were to go, farmers would diversify and the ecology would be restored, so also the economy. What is concealed is that the proposal for diversification has been discussed from the time Professor S.S. Johl recommended it as early as in his 1986 report, but no government, at any level, paid heed to it. This is obviously an issue that should have been discussed decades back, but aroused no determined interest (https://bit.ly/3plOuir). Political truth about subsidies An uncomfortable truth looms above all this but is conveniently ignored by most. This truth is that everybody benefits from subsidies. The farmers benefit (cheap electricity and fertilizers, for example), central Government employees benefit (the Central Government Health Scheme, for example), Ministers benefit, corporates benefit (for example, the “revenues foregone” by the government to help business; this increased by 16% in the 2018-19 Budget), the armed forces benefit (rations for the services are priced much lower, for example), poor children benefit (government schools), universities benefit (State and central universities), even prisons benefit (in the U.S., as many as 8% of prisoners are in privately-run prisons). When a particular subsidy is withdrawn, the population that was being served by it will protest. If the CGHS is shut down, bureaucrats will rise in opposition; withdraw perks to Members of Parliament, and our lawmakers will object; cease cancelling the “revenues foregone” provision in the Budget and businesses will complain. Subsidies are bad, but only for other people, never for oneself. If there are so many truths, half-truths and an overwhelming politically unacceptable truth, a meeting ground will always be hard to find.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||MGR’s mojo, time tested and enduring||M.G. Ramachandran, or MGR (1917-1987), founder of Tamil Nadu’s ruling party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), and Chief Minister for an almost unbroken period of 10 years (1977-87), is back in the public discourse. List of claimants Kamal Haasan, veteran actor and founder of the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), has joined the list of claimants to his legacy. Rajinikanth, another veteran actor, and who has planned to launch his party in a month, declared in early 2018 that he aspired to revive “MGR rule”. His admirers are expecting him to replicate a “Dindigul-type” of performance in the 2021 Assembly election, just as MGR’s AIADMK, in its maiden attempt within months of formation, scored a spectacular victory in the 1973 by-election to the Dindigul Lok Sabha constituency; it surpassed the Congress (Organisation) led by former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj and pushed the then ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) to the third spot. About two months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party sought to appropriate the MGR legacy when his images were used in the promotion material of the “Vetrivel Yatra,” a roadshow by the party’s State president, L. Murugan. Last week, even DMK president M.K. Stalin rendered a few lines from a 1965 MGR film to lash out at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. MGR’s 33rd death anniversary was observed yesterday, December 24, and there is a generation of people in the State who have not seen him. Yet, MGR’s name continues to cast a spell on voters. There is a school of thought that the former Chief Minister’s following among people in Tamil Nadu has been a myth. In the later part of his rule, there were critics who described his style of functioning — both in the government and in the party — as “highly personalised” and “feudal”. As far as his style of working was concerned, there was always an element of unpredictability. A stress on welfarism If MGR joined hands with the Indian National Congress in the March 1977 Lok Sabha elections, three months later, in the Assembly elections, he could dump the Congress party and go with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), an adversary of the Congress at the all-India level. Likewise, he sought to implement the concept of a creamy layer in July 1979 by prescribing an annual income limit of Rs. 9,000 for the Backward Classes to be eligible for reservation in education and public employment. After his party faced a drubbing in the Lok Sabha election in January 1980, he not only withdrew it but also hiked the quantum of quota for the BCs from 31% to 50%; also, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are entitled to 19% reservation. As proof of his ability to shock his party colleagues and the public alike, MGR axed 10 Ministers at one go in 1986. Despite his regime getting embroiled in several controversies of corruption such as illegal diversion of rectified spirit to Kerala and allegations of kickbacks in the purchase of foreign ships, the dirt did not stick. The AIADMK founder is best remembered for his government’s noon meal scheme for children and his emphasis on welfare economics, which, according to some of his Ministerial colleagues, was a reflection of his “identification with the poor”. The stress on welfarism sustained MGR’s image of being the champion of the poor, the oppressed and the vulnerable sections of society, including women. MGR had assiduously cultivated such an image even from the early days in the film world. His successor, Jayalalithaa, had, for sometime, dabbled with market-led and neo-liberal policies focusing on growth. But electoral debacles made her realise that welfarism was a powerful political tool and should not be overlooked. Nuanced shift Though MGR broke away from the DMK, whose emphasis on iconoclasm, atheism, and ethnic and regional identity was well known, he was clear from the beginning that he should not be seen as one more representative of that set of political values. Without making any radical departure from the State’s known stand on issues such as the two-language formula, he made a nuanced shift from the DMK’s approach. Initially, he presented himself as a nationalist and later, as a believer, as borne out by his government’s centenary celebrations for C. Rajagopalachari (“Rajaji”) and Subramania Bharati, both prominent figures of the freedom movement, as well as his visits to the Mookambika temple, Kollur, in Udupi, Karnataka. The two traits helped him widen the AIADMK’s political base, as he targeted the vote bank of the national parties, the Janata Party and the Congress, which together had secured around 34% of votes in the 1977 Assembly election. Jayalaliathaa, with her felicity with several languages, was never seen as a parochialist, despite her strong stand on issues such as “Hindi imposition.” She had all along portrayed herself as a god-believing Hindu. Former Electricity Minister Panruti S. Ramachandran, who was a key person in all the three cabinets of MGR, strongly disputes the contention that MGR was an autocrat, while emphasising the point that “in the Cabinet meetings, he would seek the views of every one of us before taking any decision”. More than all these, MGR, while in power, was virtually invincible and his political bête noire , M. Karunanidhi, could become Chief Minister only after his death. Charisma was not the only reason behind his success as MGR banked on a combination of factors to keep himself politically relevant. This is why Mr. Haasan and others have realised that MGR’s mojo can fetch them a rich electoral dividend. ramakrishnan.t@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mgrs-mojo-time-tested-and-enduring/article33414401.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Tackling an existential crisis||Responding to rumours in Karnataka about the Janata Dal (Secular) merging with the Bharatiya Janata Party, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy publicly denied this, adding that his real political innings will commence in 2023. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa of the BJP separately endorsed the merger denial statement. Public posturing apart, Mr. Kumaraswamy appears to be taking his party closer to the Yediyurappa government. Some of his recent decisions in this regard are worth scrutinising. Support for the BJP First, his support to the amendment to Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 allowing non-agriculturists to buy agricultural land in the State is notable. Mr. Kumaraswamy defended his decision on the ground that the new Bill will result in increase the coverage of agriculture, attract youth to farming, and encourage new experiments in scientific farming in place of traditional farming. Second, the JD(S) has formally supported the Yediyurappa government’s no-confidence motion against the Chairman of the Legislative Council, leading to ugly scenes in the Council recently. The JD(S)’s game plan appears to be to get the post of the chairmanship of the Council and leave the deputy chairmanship to the BJP. This may not go down well with many senior members of the BJP, even if Mr. Yediyurappa agrees with it. Third, Mr. Kumaraswamy has adopted a soft line on the Centre’s farm laws, stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be given a year’s time to see if the new laws are going to improve the financial status of farmers. Politics driven by self-interest The root cause for the self-interest-driven politics of the JD(S) is its inability to electorally reach a level where it can form the government on its own, ever since its inception. Its tally in the Assembly of 224 seats has been between 58 and 37. The social base of the party is narrow and is dominated by the Vokkaliga community. A look at the seats won by the party in the 2018 Assembly elections establishes this. Of the 42 Vokkaliga MLAs in the Assembly, the JD(S) has 23 members. Its failure to retain seats in the by-elections of 2019 and 2020 has added to the party’s declining stature. It is necessary for the party to broaden its social base by wooing Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. Expanding its reach to the northern and Hyderabad-Karnataka regions is also an imperative if the JD(S) hopes to gain a pan-Karnataka image. An equally important reason for the apparent decline of the JD(S) is its dynastic character. Dynasty has made the party dysfunctional. With no democratically conducted organisational elections, the party lacks a committed cadre. Additionally, Mr. Kumaraswamy’s disdain for ideology and his pursuit of politics as a business, coupled with statements that his father’s obsession with secularism has come in the way of his political ambitions being realised, are negative factors hindering his party’s performance. JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda maintains a strategic silence on many issues, signalling perhaps that he is allowing Mr. Kumaraswamy to chart out plans for the future of the party. Win-win situation At this juncture, an informal alliance between the JD(S) and the BJP appears to suit both parties. The BJP’s main objective is to contain and checkmate the Congress in the 2023 Assembly elections, if necessary, by getting into an electoral understanding with the JD(S). Mr. Kumaraswamy’s longer-term plan may be, if necessary, to become a Nitish Kumar for the BJP in Karnataka: if no party obtains a majority in the next Assembly elections, he could bargain for the Chief Minister’s post by supporting the BJP in forming a coalition government. Depending on the numbers, Mr. Kumaraswamy might even settle for the post of Deputy Chief Minister and bargain for key portfolios. This might be a way for him to pull the JD(S) out of its existential crisis. P. S.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Learning to let go||The Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague on Wednesday ruled in favour of energy firm Cairn Plc over a retrospective tax demand worth Rs. 24,500 crore pursued by India’s taxmen since 2014. It has ruled that the tax levy, pertaining to a corporate reorganisation exercise undertaken in 2006-07, falls foul of the India-U.K. bilateral investment pact. The timing could not have been worse for the government — expiry of a three-month deadline to contest a similar retrospective taxation case lost against Vodafone this September. But unlike the telecom case, where the government would only need to fork out around Rs. 80 crore if it were to concede defeat, this verdict includes a sharp $1.4 billion payable as damages to Cairn. The damages arise from tax authorities’ decision to take by force and subsequently sell the company’s shares, and freeze dividend payments as well as tax refunds, to recover the disputed tax dues even as the arbitration process was under way. This outcome has repercussions, not in the least for an arbitration plea filed over the same tax demand by Cairn’s parent firm, Vedanta, whose verdict is awaited. Second, perhaps, the fiscal implications of such a large payout to Cairn when the exchequer is cash strapped, may have galvanised the government’s mind about challenging the Vodafone verdict after much dithering. Ostensibly, because it cannot take a different stance on two similar cases, the Centre has now filed an appeal in the Vodafone matter in Singapore. A similar appeal too can be expected on Cairn. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has repeatedly asserted that India retains the sovereign right to levy taxes. The arbitrators do not seem to be disputing that. The fact is that this government has asserted from the outset it is not in favour of retrospective legislative changes. PM Narendra Modi had promised to resolve concerns on retrospective taxation, introduced to global consternation in 2012 by then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee after losing a tax battle with Vodafone in the Supreme Court. The Cairn order even refers to statements by BJP leaders like the late Arun Jaitley terming the retrospective amendments as ‘tax terrorism’ while in the Opposition. The guilty clauses could have been scuppered in the first NDA Budget itself, but barbs about it being a ‘suit, boot Sarkar’ then, that compelled the government to retract land acquisition reforms, may have dampened the enthusiasm for ‘investor-friendly’ changes. Losing the arbitrations in the most-watched cases under a troublesome law that has hurt India’s investment credibility, provided a cathartic opportunity to let go, while resting the blame for the mess on the UPA. In doubling down instead, the government has scored a self-goal. Its aspirations to rope in global investments must be matched by ensuring policy stability and creating a robust regulatory framework.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-to-let-go/article33414390.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Provocation trap||The rocket attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Sunday, which American military leaders called the largest attack on the highly fortified Green Zone in a decade, have sent tensions in the region soaring. President Donald Trump and senior leaders of the administration have pointed to Iran, saying that it supplied the rockets. The offensive appears to have been countered by the U.S.’s radar-guided defensive systems. Mr. Trump has warned that he would hold Iran responsible “if one American is killed”. The attack comes at a volatile time for Iran-American relations, which have collapsed after Mr. Trump took the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal unilaterally in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. He had reportedly sought options to launch strikes on Iran immediately after his election defeat but was dissuaded by Cabinet colleagues. With his exit soon from the White House, and Joe Biden, the next President, promising to revive the nuclear deal, there is a window of opportunity to restart the diplomatic process. But attacks like this threaten to push both the countries into an open conflict. When the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in January this year, American officials claimed that the drone strike in the Iraqi capital had reestablished America’s deterrence. But Iran had launched retaliatory missile attacks on U.S. military camps in Iraq, wounding several soldiers. And since then, pro-Iran Shia militias in Iraq have launched missile attacks at the Green Zone that houses the Embassy and repeatedly targeted American supply lines inside Iraq. The U.S. had earlier downsized its Embassy staff, closed the consulate in Basra and decided to reduce troops in Iraq. If U.S.-Iran relations are now at an explosive stage, the primary responsibility lies with Mr. Trump. His actions derailed a functioning international deal and his ‘maximum pressure’ campaign turned an Iran fully compliant with the deal’s terms more dangerous. Besides targeting the American Embassy, Iran, directly or through proxies, had attacked oil facilities and tankers in the Gulf over the past two years. Earlier this month, a tanker off Jeddah was attacked, allegedly by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen. Iran is under pressure to counter the repeated attempts by the U.S. and its allies to scuttle its influence. Late last month, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top scientist, was killed inside Iran, allegedly by Israeli agents. But in a quest for revenge, Iran should not sleep-walk into the trap of provocation. Under any circumstance, attacks on diplomatic missions cannot be accepted. It should rein in the militia groups in Iraq that it supports. It must give the Biden administration a chance to reboot diplomacy, which is in the larger interests of Tehran as well as the wider west Asia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/provocation-trap/article33414391.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||News from this day, that age||Every day, The Hindu publishes a small section called ‘From the Archives’ on the op-ed page. This gives our readers a peek into the issues that were preoccupying minds 50 years ago and 100 years ago. The task of choosing snippets is fun and informative, the eye strain notwithstanding. Scanning the pages feels like a hurried visit to the past, to historic events that took place when I wasn’t even born, yet also strangely gives me a sense of déjà vu . That is because news is always broadly the same, yet news is always a product of the times we live in. A hundred years ago, the newspaper was vastly different. There were very few advertisements; fonts were designed, it seems, only to serve as an eye test a century later; and little effort was made to keep space between lines. News naturally focused on the nationalist movement. But there were always reports on robbery and murder, sometimes with gruesome details. The writing was archaic and sometimes tedious. Reports were stingy with the use of punctuation and sometimes contained details that would be considered politically incorrect today. In choosing snippets from 100 years ago, the most important factor to consider is the legibility of the report. Though well preserved, the pages are yellowed and some words have faded, so it is often hard to decipher portions of an article, even if the snippet is interesting. Then, of course, is relevance. For instance, I found an interesting piece on fake news, referred to as “yellow journalism”, on how the ‘Hare Street Journal’ was “concocting” stories about a conference that never took place. While choosing reports from 100 years ago is to choose news from an altogether different era, snippets from 50 years ago seem like they’re out of today’s newspaper. Much like how Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often asked where he gets his energy from, in 1969, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was asked in Kabul by an Afghan correspondent about the secret of her “astounding freshness” despite the fact that she had to “carry the heavy burdens of a country like India”. Reports on demonetisation five decades ago in Sri Lanka narrated how lines of anxious people waited at banks to get their cash exchanged. A BBC correspondent was asked to leave India for his “anti-national coverage”. An editorial on the importance of student participation in political movements was published half a century before 2019, the year when many in India complained that students were getting “too political” in some universities. It read: “The... attempts to coerce the student population to avoid politics as though it were poison can only have the effect... of driving them to the other extreme, and it is only by allowing them to discuss political questions, conduct debates… and utilise facilities for training them in citizenship that their minds could be directed in healthy channels...” Sometimes I choose snippets only for their headlines or humour. For instance, when a Minister was told in Parliament during a discussion on film censorship that he, as a bachelor, was not competent to offer any suggestions on the subject of kissing in films, the report was published with the brilliant headline: “Minister tight-lipped on kissing”. A remark we often hear from our oldest readers is that the newspaper has changed, that more errors have crept in. But the archives show that The Hindu ’s understated style of reporting, language, its commitment to truth telling as well as the occasional errors have all persisted through the decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/news-from-this-day-that-age/article33414404.ece

After referring to the previous history of the case, and after deducing, from the action of the District Magistrate (Mr. R. Ramachandra Rao) in 1912 and the subsequent period the reproachful proposition “that there was if anything a bias in the district in favour of taking risks where the decrees of Civil Courts were concerned”, he absolves from blame Mr. Nedungadi, the District Magistrate concerned, on this ground and on the ground that he had no information of the intentions of Muhammadans from the police. “It is, however, impossible that he can have intended that the decree should be enforced by bloodshed, and it would have been better if he had instructed the Magistrates and Police that the procession should be stopped if serious rioting would result from persisting in it.” As regards the Magistrates on the spot, Mr. Couchman finds: “(1) The Magistrate should have made some attempt to personally reason with the rioters and warn them that firing was about to be ordered if they persisted in their unlawful actions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-nellore-riots/article33414402.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Scintillating Pallavi by D.K. Pattammal||Madras, Dec. 25: The pandal concerts at the Music Academy festival usually excite a lot of interest. This season the excitement has been conspicuously lesser than in previous years. Much of the music in the 1-30 p.m.-3 p.m. bracket, has been most unimpressive. In fact one of the performers was so substandard that a distressed listener remarked that this artiste should have waited for another ten Vijayadasamis before thinking of singing in public. The Academy’s model of selection of new artistes to perform in the pandal would appear to call for a thorough revision. The concert of the conference President, Srimathi D.K. Pattammal, was one of stature characterised by high vidwat and mature performing ability. A tough, very intelligently thought-out 3 kalai Adi tala pallavi in Harikambhoji was sung with (brother D.K. Jayaraman also assisting) all the tempo variations in scintillating style. Another highlight of the concert was the skilled swara-singing for “Dasukovalena” (Todi), the misra jhampa kriti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/scintillating-pallavi-by-dk-pattammal/article33414403.ece
25 December 2020||Mumbai,||Sensex jumps 1.14% as Brexit deal hopes spur global markets||Equity indices marched higher for the third session on the trot on Thursday, propelled by Reliance Industries and financial stocks, amid a positive trend in global markets on prospects of a Brexit trade deal. A sharp jump in the rupee and persistent foreign fund inflows added to the momentum here, traders said. The 30-share BSE Sensex surged 529.36 points or 1.14% to 46,973.54. The broader NSE Nifty climbed 148.15 points or 1.09% to 13,749.25. Axis Bank topped the Sensex gainers chart, spurting 3.04%, followed by Sun Pharma, ONGC, Reliance Industries, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance and Kotak Bank. Index heavyweights RIL, HDFC and HDFC Bank accounted for more than half of the Sensex’’s gains. However, Infosys, Nestle India, IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy’’s, HCL Tech and Bajaj Finserv were laggards, dropping up to 1.32%. Global equities extended gains as the U.K. and the European Union neared a Brexit deal ahead of the Christmas weekend, cheering participants. “This has been a short but eventful week with wide gyration in stock prices,” said Rusmik Oza, executive VP and head, Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. “Monthly expiry has also contributed to the higher volatility.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Cash flows, not ratings may decide loans in future: Vyas||Moving on from ratings criteria for grant of loans, banks are likely to focus on cash flow-based lending in time to come, according to a a top executive of UCO Bank. “Banks will focus on cash flow-based lending in time to come and this has already been started by SBI,” Ajay Vyas, executive director, UCO Bank said at a virtual panel discussion on ‘Redefining corporate financing in new normal’ organised by PHD Chamber. Various SBI officials have advocated cash flow-based lending models over the traditional asset-based, or ratings-based ones. In cash-flow lending, a financial institution grants a loan that is backed by the recipient’s past and future cash flows. Mr. Vyas further noted the turnaround time (TAT) for grant of loans needs to come down and emphasised that it was important to move on from ratings criteria for grant of loans. AI for lending According to Mr. Vyas, artificial intelligence, algorithms and prediction analysis are the future of lending norms for banks to follow. On banks’ exposure to the realty sector through non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), DMD, Commercial Credit Group-II (North & South), SBI Thekepat Keshav Kumar said, “it is wrong to say that banks were lending to NBFCs and [hence] indirectly to the real estate companies as very few NBFCs have stakes in the real estate sector.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cash-flows-not-ratings-may-decide-loans-in-future-vyas/article33414376.ece

25 December 2020||Madrid,||Real keeps pace with Atletico Madrid||A towering header from Casemiro and an added-time strike from Karim Benzema saw Real Madrid beat a stubborn Granada side 2-0 at home on Wednesday to notch a fifth consecutive LaLiga victory and go level on points with leader Atletico Madrid. The champion lacked sparkle in the first half but came alive in the second period and after a flurry of chances from the home side, Brazilian midfielder Casemiro powered in a cross from Marco Asensio to give it the lead in the 57th minute. Real had been lucky to not fall behind in the first minute when Raphael Varane gave away possession and Roberto Soldado found Antonio Puertas, who sent his shot way over the bar. Granada continued to trouble Zinedine Zidane's side deep into the second half until Benzema raced clear and thumped the ball low into the net to seal the points. Meanwhile, A.S. Roma bounced back from Sunday's mauling at Atalanta to beat Cagliari in a 3-2 thriller and move back up to third in Serie A. Jordan Veretout volleyed Roma in front in the 11th minute, despite not making proper contact with Rick Karsdorp's cross, and Cagliari goalkeeper Alessio Cragno kept the score down with several outstanding saves before halftime. Having survived the onslaught, the Sardinians levelled in the 59th minute when Joao Pedro took advantage after Roma lost possession. The host replied with two goals in six minutes from Edin Dzeko and Gianluca Mancini and Joao Pedro pulled one back from a penalty in stoppage time. Roma, beaten 4-1 at Atalanta on Sunday after a second-half performance which left coach Paulo Fonseca fuming, has 27 points, seven behind leader A.C. Milan. Sassuolo is one point behind in fourth after also winning by the odd goal in five, away to Sampdoria. Atalanta, seventh with 22 points, lost ground after it squandered a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at Bologna.  The results: LaLiga: Getafe 1 (Suarez 7) drew with Celta Vigo 1 (Aspas 17-pen); Real Madrid 2 (Casemiro 57, Benzema 90+3) bt Granada 0; Real Betis 1 (Rodriguez 71) bt Cadiz 0; Alaves 2 (Mendez 41, Deyverson 45+2) bt Eibar 1 (Leon 4).

25 December 2020||Chennai,||Ahamed: scaling new heights||From dropping out of school after Class X to fighting amongst the best riders in the country, K.Y. Ahamed has come a long way since his humble beginnings in 2012. The rider scaled a new high last weekend at the MMRT when he clinched his first title in the premier class (Pro-Stock 301-400cc) driving for TVS Racing. Ahamed swapped his thrill for speed on the streets of Triplicane in the City to the safe confines of the race track after being spotted by another National champion Jagan Kumar. Jagan won the Pro-Stock 165 cc title for the eighth time this year, incidentally beating Ahamed by just one point. “When Jagan saw me racing on the streets, he warned me not to do so and took me to the race-track so that I could do it safely. Once I tried his bike, I decided I wanted to race professionally,” said Ahamed on Thursday. “Initially my family was reluctant with my decision considering the risks involved, but Jagan convinced them explaining how safe the track is with safety measures and protective gears. Now, they are happy that my decision has paid off,” added the 23-year-old who has had to support his mother and sister since his late teens. Inconsistent Ahamed, who won the 125cc novice title in 2013, has been nipping on the heels of his mentor Jagan in terms of speed for the last few years after joining TVS Racing in 2014. However, he has struggled to find consistency, involving himself in needless crashes. It is an aspect where Jagan has had a role to play in guiding the youngster. “He has the speed but does not play the long game in terms of the championship. I have scolded him and, he used to get angry but this year he was able to finally understand that aspect of racing,” said Jagan, who reclaimed his 165cc title after his seven-year streak (2012-18) ended last year. This year was supposed to be a big one for the duo as TVS Racing entered the AP 250 class in the Asian Road Racing Championship, a fully Indian entry. International glory However, the pandemic meant the season was cancelled after the first round. With the National titles sealed, the riders are focussed on a second attempt at international glory with the season set to start in June 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ahamed-scaling-new-heights/article33414519.ece
25 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Two additional IPL teams approved||The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s Annual General Meeting has, in principle, approved the proposal to add two new teams to the Indian Premier League (IPL) fold, asking the IPL Governing Council to work out the modalities. It means that, in all likelihood, the IPL will expand to a 10-team affair in 2022 with a rejigged format. The AGM in Ahmedabad, on Thursday, passed the proposal in unison and left it to the experts to decide. The governing council and the IPL executives will now have to factor in the financial and logistical factors, besides also considering the additional window required for the increased number of games. The additional time will mean that the BCCI is unlikely to compromise on the base price of two new teams. At least four corporate giants are understood to be in the race to own the teams. Decision on Olympics Another key point on the agenda, to decide BCCI’s stand on participation in the 2028 Olympics, was deferred since the members sought clarity on various issues. The key issues were financial impact of tweaking bilateral commitments, affiliation to the Indian Olympic Association and the anti-doping clauses that cricketers will have to adhere to. The members were told that the office-bearers will provide further clarity during the SGM, which could be convened late in January. T20 WC tax issue The AGM is understood to have resolved that even if the central government declines tax exemption for hosting the T20 World Cup in 2021, the BCCI will not forego its right to host the tournament. Should it be required, the BCCI will bear the tax liability of approximately Rs. 300 crore from its share from the International Cricket Council (ICC) subvention instead of getting into a dispute with the governing body. Golden silence As expected, the AGM didn’t touch upon president Sourav Ganguly alleged unethical conduct of endorsing products that are direct competitors of BCCI sponsors. It is understood that a couple of senior members broached the topic with Ganguly before the meeting and have left it to him to act suitably. Since the audited accounts for 2018-19 and 2019-20 were presented to the members less than 24 hours before the meeting, the accounts were not ratified and instead kept pending for the SGM. The members were informed that the BCCI will continue to disburse lump sum advances and reconcile the accounts once the statements are ratified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/two-new-ipl-teams-approved-for-2022/article33414477.ece
25 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Chetan named chairman of selectors||Former India pace troika of Chetan Sharma, Abey Kuruvilla and Debasis Mohanty have been appointed as national selectors. Chetan will replace Sunil Joshi as the chairman of the panel on the basis of having earned more Test caps (23 to 15). The appointment was announced on Thursday night after the Cricket Advisory Committee of Madan Lal, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sulakshana Naik interviewed 11 candidates shortlisted for the three vacant posts in the five-member selection committee. Joshi and Harvinder Singh, who is with India’s squad in Australia, will continue as selectors. Chetan was preferred from the north zone over Vijay Dahiya, Ajay Ratra, Nikhil Chopra and Maninder Singh while Kuruvilla was opted ahead of Ajit Agarkar and Nayan Mongia from the west zone. Mohanty, the Odisha speedster, was elevated from the national junior selection panel for the slot from the east zone, thus pipping his Statemate Shiv Sundar Das and former Bengal swinger Ranadeb Bose. Chetan — infamously remembered for the last-ball six he conceded to Pakistan’s Javed Miandad in Sharjah in 1986 — represented India in 23 Tests and 65 ODIs from 1984 to 1994. He is the first Indian to pick an ODI hat-trick, achieving it versus New Zealand during the 1987 World Cup. Interestingly, Chetan was BCCI president Sourav Ganguly’s teammate in the 1993-94 Ranji Trophy final for Bengal after switching allegiance from Haryana towards the end of his career. Pivotal role Interestingly, the thrilling Ranji Trophy final between Haryana and Mumbai in which Chetan played a pivotal role in helping Haryana win its only Ranji title was Kuruvilla’s First Class debut. Having worked as a junior national selector and a talent scout for Mumbai Indians, Kuruvilla is active on the domestic circuit. Huge honour “It’s obviously a huge honour and a greater responsibility. I thank the BCCI for bestowing faith in me and I'm looking forward to justifying it,” Kuruvilla, whose 10 Test and 25 ODIs came in a 21-month span starting March 1996, told The Hindu . Mohanty worked as a bowling coach in domestic cricket and with the National Cricket Academy. The former swinger, who played two Tests and 45 ODIs from 1997 to 2001, will be looking forward to working in tandem with his contemporaries and seniors.  The selection committee:   Chetan Sharma (chairman, north zone), Sunil Joshi (south), Abey Kuruvilla (west), Harvinder Singh (central), Debasis Mohanty (east).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chetan-sharma-is-chairman-of-selectors/article33414486.ece
25 December 2020||Los Angeles,||Tatum tips Celtics over Bucks in heart-stopper||Jayson Tatum banked in a game-winning three-pointer over Giannis Antetokounmpo with 1.5 seconds left to give Boston Celtics a 122-121 NBA season-opening victory over Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. Antetokounmpo, the two-time defending NBA Most Valuable Player, had a chance to tie it from the free-throw line with four-tenths of a second left, but the Greek superstar missed his second free throw after being fouled at the rim and the Celtics came away with the win on their home floor. Tatum, who said he "played terrible" after making only 12 of 28 shots from the floor, still finished with 30 points with seven rebounds and two assists. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 33 points, five rebounds and four assists.   Houston's home opener against Oklahoma City Thunder was postponed as COVID-19 concerns — including James Harden's violation of anti-virus protocols that cost him a $50,000 fine — left the Rockets with less than the required eight players available to stage the game. Harden was ineligible after the league found he attended a party on Monday in violation of protocols prohibiting players from attending indoor gatherings of more than 15 people. The Rockets also had three players return positive or inconclusive coronavirus tests, and four other players were isolated. One day after LA Lakers launched its title defence with a loss to LA Clippers, Miami Heat fell 113-107 to Orlando Magic. Evan Fournier scored 25 points for Magic.  Westbrook on song Russell Westbrook looked just the same in new surroundings, notching up the first triple-double of the season with 21 points, 11 rebounds and 15 assists for his new team Washington Wizards, which nevertheless fell 113-107 to Philadelphia 76ers. It was Westbrook’s 147th triple-double of his career as he chases Oscar Robertson's NBA record of 181.  The results: Phoenix Suns 106 bt Dallas Mavericks 102; Boston Celtics 122 bt Milwaukee Bucks 121; Toronto Raptors 99 lost to New Orleans Hawks 124; Memphis Grizzlies 119 lost to San Antonio Spurs 131; Minnesota Timberwolves 111 bt Detroit Pistons 101; Cleveland Cavaliers 121 bt Charlotte Hornets 114; Indiana Pacers 121 bt New York Knicks 107; Orlando Magic 113 bt Miami Heat 107; Philadelphia 76ers 113 bt Washington Wizards 107.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tatum-tips-celtics-over-bucks-in-heart-stopper/article33414520.ece
25 December 2020||MUMBAI,||Compensatory package if season is curtailed||The domestic cricket fraternity will heave a sigh of relief after the BCCI’s AGM on Thursday agreed to work out a compensatory package should the domestic season end up being a curtailed one due to the pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in the domestic season, which usually starts late in August, to be postponed and only the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy — the senior men’s T20 tournament — has been announced from January 10. It has left women and age-group cricketers, plus those who are long-form specialists, in limbo since their financial equation would go for a toss. Even for men cricketers, the match fees from T20s are not good enough. Besides, thousands of other support staff — coaches, physiotherapists, trainers, umpires, match referees, scorers, video analysts and groundstaff — are in danger of being severely impacted financially. The AGM in Ahmedabad unanimously decided to work out a “package” in case of a truncated season. “All these are the pillars of Indian cricket, so we will ensure they will be taken care of, either through State associations or directly by the Board,” said a member representative who attended the AGM. But the AGM was also informed by the office-bearers that depending on the success of the men’s T20s, the BCCI will decide on organising the other tournaments. “It could well be a case of multiple domestic tournaments clashing with the IPL this time around but no one will mind it as long as it’s safe,” said another member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/compensatory-package-if-season-is-curtailed/article33414478.ece

All the world's top players have signed on, led by World No. 1s Novak Djokovic and Ashleigh Barty. Begins training There was a question mark over Swiss great Federer, who warned this month he was in a "race against time" to be fit after two rounds of knee surgery. But he has begun training in Dubai and was among those entered to play at Melbourne Park as he targets a seventh title. US superstar Williams, who like Federer turns 40 next year, is also committed as she once again attempts to pull level with Margaret Court as a 24-time Grand Slam champion. Her last triumph at the Majors came in Australia in 2017 when she was pregnant. The opening Grand Slam of the year, which will be played in front of at least 50 percent of normal crowds, has been pushed back three weeks until February 8. All players must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine on arrival, during which they will constantly be tested for COVID-19 but allowed to train for five hours a day in a bio-secure bubble. The men's and women's qualifiers will be held in Doha and Dubai respectively from January 10-13, with players arriving in Melbourne from January 15 on special charter flights. A slimmed-down, 12-team ATP Cup, the relocated Adelaide International, and a ATP 250 tournament will all be played in Melbourne once players are out of isolation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/all-top-players-for-australian-open/article33414488.ece
25 December 2020||Melbourne,||Indians get to grips with tackling Aussie menace||Team India came up with a new training drill on Thursday that saw players pairing off and working out as if participating in a wrestling bout. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was the first to arrive for the training session and was put through a fitness test, running between the wickets with bat in hand. Jadeja, who has 213 wickets and 1,869 runs in 49 Tests, missed the final two Twenty20 Internationals and the first Test due to a concussion and a hamstring injury and will be eager to play the Boxing Day Test at the hallowed Melbourne Cricket Ground. One of the tour's finds, pacer T. Natarajan bent his back at the nets and often managed to beat stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara. Set to play in the second Test against an in-form Australian team, K.L. Rahul had a long hit at the nets, and so did Rishabh Pant. As the players got busy at the nets after warming up, the coaching staff — chief coach Ravi Shastri, bowling coach Bharat Arun and batting coach Vikram Rathour — were seen exchanging notes from the practice session. They also had a long chat with Rahane, who will lead the team in the remaining three Tests in the absence of Virat Kohli, who has flown back to India for the birth of his child. Shastri was also seen in discussion with Rahul after the batsman's session. Prithvi Shaw, who is going through a lean patch, had a long workout with Kuldeep Yadav backing him up. Meanwhile, watched by head coach Justin Langer, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuchagne had an intense session, with former Sri Lanka off-spinner Suraj Randiv bowling to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indians-get-to-grips-with-tackling-aussie-menace/article33414484.ece

25 December 2020||KOCHI,||Kapustin likely to be India’s new jumps coach||Denis Kapustin, the triple jump bronze medallist at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, is the favourite to become Indias new national coach for long jump and triple jump. The Athletics Federation of India has invited applications for the post of National coaches in select events and the 50-year-old Russian, also a former European champion, has applied for the post in jumps category. Cuban too in the fray One learns that a Cuban coach has also applied for the job but Kapustin appears to be the favourite. “We are following the training workouts sent by him (Kapustin),” said a National camper from Patiala. “He is a former Olympic medallist and he is good,” said a senior national coach. Kapustin, who has a personal best of 17.65m, won the Olympic bronze behind Britains world record holder Jonathan Edwards and Cuba’s Yoel Garcia in 2000. He had also been a National coach for jumps in Turkey earlier. The contract of Bedros Bedrosian, the National coach for jumps, ends in December but the Romanian left the country a few months ago. The last date for application for the posts of National coaches is December 31 and the names will be confirmed early next year. The coaches’ contract will run till the 2024 Olympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kapustin-likely-to-be-indias-new-jumps-coach/article33414649.ece
25 December 2020||Tokyo,||Domestic sponsors solidly behind Tokyo organisers||Tokyo Olympic officials said on Thursday they have reached a “basic agreement” with all 68 domestic sponsors to extend their contracts into next year to support the postponed Games. Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organising committee, said at an on-line briefing that the new contributions “will exceed” ¥22 billion (about $210 million), to patch up holes in the growing budget. Japanese domestic sponsors had already contributed a record of $3.3 billion to the local operating budget, and the new money pushes the total past $3.5 billion. This is at least twice — perhaps three times — as large as any previous Olympics and is driven by Dentsu Inc,, the giant Japanese advertising company that is also the marketing agent for the Tokyo Games. Toshiro Muto, CEO, organising committee, said Dentsu had conducted the negotiations. Mori also said the companies were not "pushed." Mori acknowledged that many companies were facing tough financial times. It''s also clear that the Tokyo Olympics have become a priority for Japan''s national government, which would make it difficult for companies not to renew. There were reports earlier this month that each of the 15 so-called ‘Gold Partners’ would contribute about $10 million each. Some of the Gold Partners include Canon, Fujitsu, and Mizuho Financial Group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/domestic-sponsors-solidly-behind-tokyo-organisers/article33414744.ece
25 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SFI felicitates Merchant and Sarang||The Swimming Federation of India announced the plan to have separate national championship for water polo, while felicitating Bharat Merchant and Avinash Sarang who had helped India to the silver in the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1970. The golden jubilee celebration, conducted virtually by the swimming fraternity, helped Bharat and Avinash to walk down the memory lane and recall minute details of the path to the silver medal, and the warmth of reception on return. Bharat, the youngest member of the team then, and eventually the top scorer, narrated the story of losing a thriller final to Japan, after the team was “relieved” to make the final. He also remembered the Sikh community bringing food to the Indian team. “The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi spoke to me for a minute and we went to the reception by the President V.V. Giri. Coming to Mumbai was celebration for three months’, Bharat said. He was selected in the Asian All Star team, to play against the Combined European team. Avinash Sarang, on a tour of the US, remembered the last-minute clearance of the team by the IOA, after the hard work at the preparatory camp. Influence of legends Members of the water polo team that won the Asian Games bronze at home in 1982, Captain Utpal Mitra, goalkeeper Romen Das and forward Sushil Kohli, shared the influence of the legends of the 1970 team. Ajay Apte, who represented the country in the 1986 Asian Games, and active as the Chief Referee in national championships, suggested ways to regain past glory in water polo. Meenakshi Pahuja, champion open water swimmer, spoke about popularising the sport among the girls. Bharat suggested a Premier water polo league with a dozen teams, and assured the best support from the corporate world. He announced a trophy for the best centre forward in the national championship from the next edition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sfi-felicitates-merchant-and-sarang/article33414750.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Srishti and Pralaya||Srishti is a main topic in the puranas and in the Devi Bhagavata Purana it is explained from the angle of Prakriti. Goddess Devi reveals the truth of srishti to Brahma, Vishnu and Siva when out of Her Sankalpa they come to Her abode. All these details are conveyed by Brahma to Narada by way of clarifying many of the latter’s doubts on these esoteric matters, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. She explains in detail the special aspects of the gunas, Satva, Rajas and Tamas. These gunas inhere in each and every aspect of creation in varying proportions. In the Trimurtis too, the three gunas enable them to fulfil their respective roles in creation, sustenance and samhara. Para Prakriti is the Nirguna Brahman, all pervading and in a state of balance when the gunas are not active. This is before creation happens. So, Nirguna Brahman is not the creator or the cause of srishti. Srishti happenings are allied to the Saguna Brahman. It is only with the help of Maya that srishti happens. The Upanishads speak of Sat as eternally existing without a second. Then Maya is summoned to assist Ishwara and together they work to bring about Srishti. From Prakriti, Mahat is born and then Ahamkara. Then the five elements akasa, air, fire, water and earth are created and this is followed by jiva srishti. All beings and objects are then brought to life by the pervasive power of Shakti. Maya is the blend of the three gunas and these are in a disturbed state at the time of srishti. This leads to the evolution of beings and activities in the world. Jiva srishti is to enable the jivas to exhaust their karma. After the specified period of time, srishti is followed by Pralaya, a state of non disturbance. Srishti and Pralaya reflect the waking and sleep states at the cosmic level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srishti-and-pralaya/article33414473.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Being Shakeela||It is wrong to stereotype Richa Chadha as an “arthouse actor”, but it is a term she claims to have picked up from the media’s description of her choice of films. “[When I started in films] I wasn’t only going to do ‘a certain type’ of film because it was not practical. But good scripts don’t come very often into our lives, and we won’t always get to perform with people we love. Something like Masaan won’t happen again, soon. So for me, it is a balance between monetary consideration and the films I like to do. For that purpose [acting] is ‘a job’ that I love,” she explains. Richa connects over phone from Mumbai where she is expecting the release of Shakeela , in which she plays the titular role. Scheduled for a theatrical release on December 25, the film is a biopic of South Indian actor Shakeela, whose claim to fame was via the many ‘B-grade’ Malayalam films she was a part of in the ‘90s. “I found Shakeela to be an interesting figure who was foolish in taking panga (clash) with the big fish in the sea. Her personal life is so full of tragedy. It is also a classic tale of a family exploiting a girl in show business,” she says. The Hindi language film is being dubbed and released in the four South Indian languages as well. Comparisons, says Richa, with The Dirty Picture are inevitable. “The era [in which both the films are set] is similar. The characters are also cult-like in the South. So there will be comparisons but I am grateful it is not with somebody I don’t respect. I like Vidya Balan and everything she does,” the actor adds. She does point out a key difference between Silk Smitha, on whose life The Dirty Picture was based upon, and Shakeela. “In [Shakeela’s] case, she was not tremendously ambitious as Silk. She was just going with the flow and doing whatever her mother told her in order to survive. Silk, on the other hand, was quite a personality. She was part of many dignified projects; she did films with Kamal Haasan and the likes, and so she was very respected. I think Shakeela’s career only started because of Silk’s untimely demise,” Richa explains. During the course of filming and in the pre-production stage, Richa’s interactions with Shakeela refined her perception of the actor’s personality. “Shakeela is a loveable personality. I have had very real conversations with her. The treatment she got from her family, and her mother... you know, these things can scar you forever. But I did not find her bitter. It is as if she understands why they did what they did. She doesn’t think of her life as tragic. She has never cut a sorry figure and has always been proud to stand by the things she did. She knew the consequences of being upright and didn’t shy away from them. It was not a happy ending; she suffered... but that attitude is unique,” she says, adding, “I would like for her to have a good life and to be able to move with her head held high.” Richa, however, is looking forward to the New Year; the actor has a series of projects lined up. “I have a new web thriller series whose announcement will be made soon. There are other web series too that I will be a part of in 2021. Besides, I will be starting work on Fukrey 3 , and then there is a film called Madam Chief Minister that I expect will release next year,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/being-shakeela/article33414667.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||wake-up call, for a||“ Naya zamaana ” means a new generation or a new time; the latter is how the four twenty-something-year-olds that make up the Mumbai-based rap band Aavrutti describe their music as an ensemble. Incidentally, it is also the title of their new track. Supported by Gully Gang India and DIVINE, the 11-track album, with its foot-tapping, beat-heavy, lyrical compositions, also says as much — a wake-up call to the new generation. The easy-going young Mumbaikars — Sledge (22), Sammohit (21), Saifan and Frenzzy (20) — joined hands to form a rap crew three years ago, having been making music independently as early as 2016. The idea of forming a professional crew started when Sledge and Sammohit found each other’s work on YouTube and decided to jam. Frenzzy and Saifan (who were in the same college at the time) joined soon after. Of their first brush with rap — for all of them, it was during their school days — Saifan says, “I was 15 when I listened to rap for the first time. My friend in school introduced me to the genre and I thought, ‘ Kitna sahi hai !’ (How cool is that!). I slowly started writing myself.” Sammohit was in Class VII when he got hooked on rap thanks to Honey Singh’s ‘Dope Shope’. By the time he reached Class X, he had already written his first song. Frenzzy was in Class IX when he took an interest in rap. He now writes in Punjabi. “Because of this, I had failed in Class IX, and my family was not happy,” he laughs. Sledge adds: “I heard hip hop songs for the first time through speakers that were set in my street, and realised that there were other genres in music apart from Bollywood. It was a revelation.” Matching frequencies The quartet hope to pioneer a new wave in the Indian hip hop scene. “We want to be the sound of the new generation of Indian hip hop. We wish to be relatable and talk more about our own lives, streets and people,” says Sammohit. Saifan adds: “Having said that, evolving thoughts and observations will also reflect on our music.” Complementing each other makes work an easy process for the four of them, says Frenzzy. The idea being in sync and matching each other’s frequency is also a reason why they named their band Aavrutti (which means frequency). Two tracks from the album — ‘Stage’, the single that talks about backstage shenanigans, and ‘Error 404’, the track which is an abstract take on the mistakes one does in life — were released last month. The title track ‘Naya Zamaana’ marked the album’s official launch. The video song, which bursts with colour and hip hop moves by the Mumbai-based dance crew, Famous Family, travels through Mumbai’s gullies. The idea was to feature their surroundings, people and, in effect, their identity. The album was in the making for one-and-a-half years, the band members say. “Each of the 11 songs has its unique emotion,” says Sledge, adding that lockdown only aided their creative process and led to a lot of self-introspection. Are there any more projects in the pipeline? “ Yahaan din bhar gaana banta hain (Here, songs are made every day). But we can’t really say if they all will make an album or not. We take it as it comes,” concludes Saifaan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wake-up-call-for-a/article33414673.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The true meaning of Christmas||For the Shillong Chamber Choir, their recent album Come Home Christmas is an attempt to share the real Christmas story with their listeners. “Most of us have a very westernised way of viewing the festival. We associate it with Santa, reindeers and Christmas trees. But actually, it is all about Jesus Christ’s humble birth in a desert in the Middle East. We want to share that spirit through our songs,” says Neil Nongkynrih, the choir’s founder. The eight-track album is a fusion of pop culture and classic Christmas songs. Most songs are sung in English but have stanzas vocalised in ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu. The songs include ‘Jingle Bells’, ‘Silent Night’, ‘Go Tell It On The Mountain’, ‘God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen’ and ‘We the Kings’. “It was a conscious decision to include all the classic tracks as these songs are popular,” explains William Richmond, lead singer of the choir. One of the biggest hurdles for the team was to find people to translate the English lyrics. William says, “The ancient Aramaic believed to be spoken by Jesus Christ is almost extinct now. Luckily, a friend helped us find Melke Tekin, an elderly man from Switzerland, who spoke the language . ” The choir also collaborated with Ilana Yahav from Israel, a renowned sand artist, for the song video of ‘We the Kings’. This song has lyrics in Urdu, Farsi and English. William says getting the pronunciation right was tricky. “We have sung in around 25 languages and that experience made the process easier for us. We practised by slowing down the songs, and it helped us understand each syllable in the lyrics.” The past few months have been busy for the choir with online concerts. “We set up a virtual studio and now perform from there. We have had more time to be productive. We hope to come up with two new albums and an opera in 2021,” says Neil. Come Home Christmas is available in all major music streaming platforms||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-true-meaning-of-christmas/article33414675.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Police diaries||The eight-episode Telugu web series Shootout at Alair , which is streaming on ZEE5, is based on police case files, and explores cops being attacked in the aftermath of the 2007 Hyderabad blasts. The mention of religion in the trailer made a few people on social media suspect if the series has communal overtones. However, director Anand Ranga emphasises that those doubts will cease once people watch the series: “I am a huge admirer of the police but that doesn’t mean I take sides blindly. I have tried to be as objective as possible.” Produced by Vishnu Prasad and Sushmita Konidela — who is actor Chiranjeevi’s daughter — for Gold Box Entertainment, the series explores incidents that led to an encounter at Alair in Nalgonda district. Anand, who is best known for the film Oy! (2009), wrote the story two-and-a-half years ago. The idea of Shootout at Alair , he shares, came from his frequent visits to the court along with a public prosecutor friend from whom he learnt about certain incidents that unfolded during and after the blasts in Hyderabad. “I have always been fascinated with the police department. I met a few police officers to know about their life and cases that impacted them. At my public prosecutor friend’s office, I came across three files that I thought would make for interesting stories. We are presenting one of the stories in season one of Shootout at Alair ,” he says, adding that narrating the story in web series format allowed him the space to explore different aspects of characters in the crime drama. “Nothing is black and white. We look at the grey areas to try and find out what makes people do the things they do.” Starring Srikanth and Prakash Raj as police officers, Shootout at Alair also stars Teja Kakumanu and Nandini Rai. The series’ cast includes at least 30 theatre actors, and Anand says he was blown away by the talent pool of theatre actors in Hyderabad. On Sushmita Konidela’s production début, Anand says he had her support to film the series the way he envisioned it. “We shot the series in a documentary style. It would have been easier to shoot like a regular film with this unit, but I wanted a realistic visual style since the story is based on true incidents,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/police-diaries/article33414680.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Evergreen gifts||Christmas was Ricky’s favourite time of the year. Grandpa would put on Christmas carols and Grandma would tap her feet to the beat as she mixed batter, pounded dough, and fried, baked and moulded to produce treats for the family and all the neighbours. Right from the beginning of December, the aromas and the sounds of Christmas usually made Ricky rush home from school. Dad and Mom would decorate the house in the evenings, after work. But this year was different. Grandma was sick; so weak that she couldn’t even drink a cup of tea on her own. Then, Mom lost her job. Dad worked from home for several months and then went back to the office. But his glum face each evening told them that things were not going well. “Everything is going wrong for us,” Ricky whispered to Grandpa. A hard time “Everything has gone wrong for almost everyone with COVID-19. Let’s just be grateful that all of us are still here together,” said Grandpa. Ricky looked at his little sister, Rina, and made a face. “It’s hard to be grateful for her!” he muttered. Grandpa frowned. “Where’s your Christmas spirit?” Ricky shrugged and hurried to his corner of the veranda where he had placed a dozen or more cups and mugs that had broken over the months. In each, he had planted a stalk of the jade plant; all were flourishing. “I think I need some new ‘pots’ for my plants,” he said aloud. “Break a few more cups, glasses and mugs,” Rina piped up from behind him. “Don’t follow me around!” he snapped. “Why not? This is my veranda too!” Suddenly, they heard a shuffle and a sigh and turned to see Grandma looking at them sadly because they were quarrelling. “We won’t fight at Christmas time. I promise, Grandma,” murmured Ricky. Soon, Christmas was upon them. Mum had made a small cake and they were all thrilled. “You’ve decorated it beautifully,” said Grandma. “With some practice, you can take orders and sell cakes,” said Grandpa. Just then, there was a knock and Rina ran to answer the door. She returned with the Christmas goodies given by Mrs. Paul, next door. Grandma sighed. “We have nothing to give anyone this year.” “We do,” cried Rina and whispered in Ricky’s ear. The children ran out onto the veranda. Mrs. Paul was just leaving. ”We have something for you!’ said Ricky picking up a jade plant. “I can enjoy this throughout the year,” exclaimed Mrs. Paul. She did and so did all the other neighbours to whom Ricky and Rina presented jade plants.  The sounds of Christmas usually made Ricky rush home from school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/evergreen-gifts/article33415217.ece

One child had asked for a deer, as his parents had refused to bring one home after a visit to the zoo. Unread letters After the regular gifts were wrapped, Santa asked his reindeer, Vixen, to bring the sledge so that the parcels could be arranged. When Santa got up to review the gifts, he noticed a bunch of letters and asked, “What are these letters about? I haven’t read them.” “We have read them but are not in a position to provide the requested gifts,” said an elf. “But this is unusual. How can we dash the children’s hopes?” Santa was concerned and he scanned the letters swiftly. “Why are these kids so crazy about mobile phones? What will we do with the footballs, chess boards, skate boards...? It is sad to see so many young kids having to wear spectacles because of this,” said a worried Santa. “Wonder what caused his vision to fail?” an elf joked, pointing to Santa’s thick glasses. “Ha, ha, ha...,” Santa laughed loudly. “But what will we give them?” asked another elf. “Books, of course,” said Santa. “What else will fire their imagination? Pictures and words will introduce them to rivers and mountains, princes and fairies.” “And to Santa, elves, reindeer, and Christmas,” another elf added enthusiastically. “Let us not waste any more time. We have to wrap so many books,” said Santa. Will they like it? That night, Santa was a little excited. He had never before replaced what the kids had asked for. After a long night, when he returned, he assembled the elves and said, “Now let’s wait for responses from those kids to whom we have delivered books instead of the mobile phones they asked for.” Two days after Christmas, Santa was nervous. Suddenly, the door opened and a dozen elves walked in with a tray full of letters. Everyone was quiet, as they opened each one. Santa felt restless, and turned to go into his room. “They have sent you loads of thanks,” shouted the elves in unison. “One kid has expressed gratitude, for he never knew that books could be so exciting, and another has already placed an advance demand for more books next Christmas,” said an elf, while the others cheered. “Ho…Ho…Ho.” Santa had got his Christmas gift.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Amid the winter snow||What is a traditional Christmas? Well, that’s a tough one. Here are some whacky celebrations around the world.  Austria  Here, instead of Santa, they have Krampus, the evil accomplice of St. Nicholas, who searches out badly behaved children. So, you will see masked figures on the streets, scaring kids and adults alike, with ghastly pranks.  Caracas,   Venezuela  The city’s streets are closed to traffic from 8.00 a.m. on Christmas morning so that people can rollerskate their way to mass. Children sleep with one lace from their skates tied to their toe and dangling from the window so that their friends can wake them up with a tug.  Iceland  The giant Yule Cat roams the snowy countryside to reward those who worked hard and devour those who didn’t. According to tradition, farmers use the Yule Cat as an incentive for their workers.  Ukraine  If you have arachnophobia, avoid at this time of the year. Ukranians use decorations that mimic spider webs, shimmering with dew. According to a folktale, spiders in the house of a poor widow, who couldn’t afford decorations, spun beautiful webs all over her tree.  Japan  In 1974, KFC launched a campaign in Japan with the slogan “Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!” meaning Kentucky for Christmas, leading to a new tradition. Since then, even though Christmas is not a national holiday, the Japanese flock to KFC for a special Christmas Eve meal.  Norway  Christmas Eve in this country coincides with the arrival of evil spirits and witches. So, brooms are hidden before bedtime because people don’t want to find their brooms broken into a hundred pieces and laid at the foot of the tree, trashed by a witch who took it out on a joy ride.  Greenland  Christmas dinners are special. More so in Greenland, where the feast comprises mattak (raw whale skin with a little blubber) and Kiviak, made by wrapping an auk (a small Arctic bird) in seal skin and burying it for several months.  Guatemala  Here, the people believe that the devil and other evil spirits lurk in the dark, dirty corners of their house. So, the week before Christmas, houses are cleaned and all the waste is heaped outside with an effigy of the devil on top, and set on fire. This is known as La Quema del Diablo or Burning of the Devil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/amid-the-winter-snow/article33415256.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The spirit of true giving||I was spending the weekend at Uncle Robert’s house where my cousin, Rachel, was ordering her cook, Ratna, and her daughter, Rani, to bake cakes. They made around 10 vaniila cakes that Rachel carefully placed in individual boxes. “I am going to give these to the homeless people who live near the park. Will you help me carry the basket, Tina?” she asked. So I went with her. Rachel called some children playing on the pavement and handed me her mobile phone and asked me to take photos of her giving them the cakes. After the first photo, “my hair doesn’t look good,” said Rachel, and took out a brush to set her hair. She took the box back and I took photos of her giving it again till she was satisfied. However, a cobbler seated under a tree told his son not to accept the box. “He’s so rude. Let’s go home. I am so hungry,” said Rachel. All for social media Once home, Rachel yelled at Ratna akka, as lunch was not ready. She then uploaded the photos on her social media pages and received many likes and messages praising her. Ranjani, a well-known vlogger, called her for an interview. “I am going to be famous,” said Rachel. When Ranjani arrived, Rachel said that she’d woken up early to bake the cakes, when she’d actually not lifted a finger. “I have three more cakes left,” said Rachel. As Ranjani got her camera ready, Rachel gave a cake to an elderly couple living on the pavement near the bus stand. “Please give it to a child,” said the lady and gave Rachel Rs. 500 to be given to a homeless family. To Ranjani’s questions, the lady replied that her name was Kanchana and that her husband and she washed vessels at a nearby restaurant. Rachel stood angrily, as the focus shifted to Kanchana patti. As Ranjani moved away, her slipper strap snapped and Kanchana patti directed her to the cobbler. “It’s that rude cobbler,” said Rachel. “Call me when you are ready.” As the cobbler mended Ranjani’s slipper, she asked him why he wouldn’t accept the cake. “I don’t like people who take photos when they are doing a charitable act,” he replied. When I returned home, Rachel asked, “Why didn’t Ranjani call me?” “Ranjani is not interviewing you,” I told her. The next week, millions of people watched Ranjani’s interview with the pavement dwellers and came forward to help them. On Christmas Day, I called Uncle Robert to wish him. Rachel and Rani had gone to give blankets to homeless people, he said, adding, “Rachel left her mobile phone at home.”  I took photos of her giving it again til she was satisfied with the photos||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-spirit-of-true-giving/article33415261.ece

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Altered, yet beautiful||Ramakrishnan Murthy did not allow any room for the audience to wonder which raga would be taken as the central piece of his concert — that was clear to everyone quite early on. When the opening phrases of raga Sri escaped his lips, the only question was about the composition. The vocalist opened the (well-attended) concert with the first verse of the Aandal pasuram, ‘Marghazhi thingal,’ in Nattai. The pasuram followed a brief but beautiful alapana, which foretold the unfolding of a lovely concert. The line ‘Narayanane Namakke’ was selected for niraval, which was a detailed affair, but just as the audience was looking for a treat of swaras, the singer jumped into the second pasuram, ‘Vayyathu Vazhveerghal’, in Gowlai and chose the words ‘Mayittu Ezhudhom’ to land the swaras. Niraval in Nattai, swaras in Gowlai! The only slight exception one could take was his not singing swaras in the slower gait — which would have seen Gowlai in full blossom. By now, it was a fair assumption that the next raga would be Arabhi. The sequence cued the third pasuram, ‘Ongi Ulagalandha,’ but Ramakrishnan broke the line and took up Swati Tirunal’s ‘Narasimha Mamava.’ He picked the pallavi line for swara singing, but the notes came on the heels of the longish chittaswaras in the same gait, which was perhaps a trifle unwise, because there was little contrast between the chittaswaras and the kalpanaswaras. Sprightly rendition At this point there was no doubt the next raga would be Varali. The alapana, which lasted under a minute, seemed perfunctorily rendered, for the artiste kept entirely to the lower notes. The abrupt pick-up of Dikshitar’s ‘Seshachala Nayakam’ left the alapana like an unfinished painting, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness. After a neat rendition of the song, Ramakrishnan sprang a little surprise by taking up the line ‘mandahasa vadanam’ for niraval, rather than the usual ‘aravinda patra nayanam.’ But then came another twist in the tale when halfway through the niraval the singer shifted to ‘aravinda patra.’ The double niraval was a welcome break from tradition. Swaras followed the niraval, which were sprightly and lovely, each phrase landing alternately on the upper and lower ‘ri’ — quite a joy ride! However, a notable miss was the long karvai on the rishabham. When Varali ended, exactly at half-time, it had to be Sri, to complete the sequence set by Saint Tyagaraja through his five Pancharatnam gems. Perhaps it was by design that the singer rushed through the earlier pieces, so as to allow himself enough time for a detailed exposition of Sri. Since it is not a raga that is commonly heard in concert halls these days, it was a wonderful experience, fully justifying Ramakrishnan’s growing reputation as an outstanding vocalist. The Sri ( Tyagaraja’s ‘Namakusuma’) alone sufficed to call the evening well-spent. After the brief thani, he presented Behag, (‘Aadum Chidambaramo’) and chose for the finale, the third pasuram, ‘Ongi Ulagalandhu,’ which he sang in four ragas (Atana, Jhonpuri, Hamir Kalyani and Sindhu Bhairavi), two lines each. Vittal Rangan on the violin, Vijay Natesan on the mridangam and Sunil Kumar on the kanjira helped in no small measure in the concert’s success.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/altered-yet-beautiful/article33414903.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A song of ideas||Some efforts are being made by a section of musicians to create a new concert format much to the delight as well as disappointment of Carnatic music aficionados. Young vocalist Rithvik Raja seems to have taken up this mission quite seriously and his vocal recital differs and stands out from the rest of his peers. Rithvik’s opening was very leisurely with the slow and sedate Yadukulakambodi swarajathi ‘Kamakshi’ by Syama Sastri. It was soulful, but the slowness turned soporific after a point. While the swara part was played by violinist Shriramkumar, the sahitya was rendered by Rithvik. Mayamalavagowla was detailed in the same fashion. ‘Shri Nathaadi Guruguho’(Muthuswami Dikshitar) was embellished with an extensive unhurried niraval on ‘Brahma roopo’ and swaras. To break this monotony slightly, raga Bahudari entered at the anupallavi ‘Sri Vasudeva’ of Tyagaraja’s ‘Brovabarama.’ The swara exchanges here centered on gandharam, creating a few ripples. Ragamalika tanam Rithvik Raja was not keen to increase the tempo or reduce the ‘super sowkyam’. He drew a few phrases of Kapi and instantly moved over to tanam. It was set to be a ragamalika tanam exchange between Rithvik and violinist Shriramkumar. So the colourful tanam trade went with Mukhari, Kambodi, Purvikalyani and back to Kapi. The pallavi started with ‘Inta Sowkya’ and the kriti moved on. In fact, the whole concert seemed to be a ‘personal musical conversation’ between Rithivik Raja and Shriramkumar. The company of Sumesh Narayanan (mridangam) and Anirudh Athreya (kanjira) was seemingly incidental, their presence felt conspicuously only during the tani avartanam. Rithvik also connected every kriti with a brief extension of the previous raga and then switched over to the next raga. Some style! The tail-enders were ‘Eppo Varuvaro’ in Jhonpuri by Gopalakrishna Bharati and ‘Shanthi Nilava Vendum’ in Tilang by Sethumadhava Rao. Gurucharan’s fine start There was no spate of swarakalpana for almost consecutively an hour in Sikkil C. Gurucharan’s concert. He focused on the lyrical beauty and raga elegance of the compositions he sang. His recital started with the scholarly Nilambari varnam ‘Senthil Nagar Mevum Deva’ composed by violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman with a masterly swara-sahitya blend. “Seshachala Nayakam” in Varali had a preface of raga and a detailed niraval at ‘Aravinda Patra Nayanam.’ Then came Tyagaraja’s unique ‘Ne Nendu’ in Karnataka Behag with its several beguiling sangathis. Swara passages Thus the stage was set for the main raga Saveri. A highly pliable raga which offers vast scope for the vocalists’ creativity, Gurucharan made full use of his ingenuity in painting its dynamic image. The choice of the kriti also matched the raga alapana, ‘Sri Rajagopala’ by Muthuswami Dikshitar. Gurucharan presented a detailed niraval at ‘Neera Sampoorna’ and it was linked to an exhaustive swarakalpana. The swara cycles centered on shadjam later reached a calculated crescendo after several rounds. V. Sanjeev on the violin contributed competently to Gurucharan’s vocals. His responses in Saveri alapana and swaras need special mention. K.V. Prasad on the mridangam and Sunil Kumar on the kanjira opted for subdued percussion support and an equally sober thani. The closing pieces were ‘Rama Namame’ in Desh by Thanjavur Sankara Iyer, ‘Maname Kanamum’ in Abheri by Papanasam Sivan and a thillana in Sindhubhairavi by Oothukadu Venkatakavi. Listening to a concert in the virtual medium as opposed to a concert in an auditorium does have a difference. Nevertheless, as long as music remains the major charm, it will be a gratifying experience. The organisers deserve praise for their planning and arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-song-of-ideas/article33414926.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Fine classicism highlighted||Both halves of the play begin on a meditative mode. First, with a romantic scene involving Bhima and his spouse Panchali. If the opening 30-minute choreography for the Pandava prince is fascinatingly unhurried, the story in the woods repeats the idea, albeit briefly. That is just into the second part, where the monkey-god sits in penance. It is a still posture struck in silence, barring the murmuring percussive rolls that represent the devotee’s breaths. Hanuman finds his quietude broken. Unexpectedly. A self-search into the reasons is essayed through high-vibrancy mudras. The Ram-bhakt realises an invasion is on, and the man approaching his idyllic territory is Bhima. The ensuing encounter is dramatic: the club-wielding Bhima seeks to shove ‘a doddering ape’ out of his way, but fails. Hanuman soon reveals his identity, and the dizzy younger half-brother is pleasantly surprised. They hug, chat and part, with Bhima having now got guidance on where to find the fragrant flowers that had enchanted his wife.     Kalyanasougandhikam is a story known for its unique blend of elements that highlight the classicism of Kathakali. The richness of its Sanskrit-dense literature, the slow and fast dances, twists in plots, and the vitality of background scores was showcased at Kalakshetra Foundation’s 67th Annual Art Festival overlapping with 2020 Margazhi celebrations. The December 22 programme retained the presentational spirit of the work by Kottayam Thampuran of 18th century Malabar. The show chose two popular scenes from the 13-chapter play that canonically spans overnight, bringing out certain central features of the dance-theatre in 140 minutes. The invocatory Kedaragowla alapana and sloka paved the way to what sets the eminence of Kalyanasougandhikam . The Sankarabharanam-raga padam is set to eight-beat Chembada tala, but the cycle is expanded four-fold — like naalu kalai in Carnatic music. The technique ensures a particularly slow tempo, letting the love-nourished verses of ‘Panchalaraja tanaye’ mould a grand architecture. Kalamandalam Balasubramanian met the challenge with grace, unveiling the grammatical eminence of the mainstream Kalluvazhi style of Kathakali. Be it the profile of the hand gestures, the curves the headgear scripts in the air while delineating the abstract chuzhippu movements, or the restraint in the facial expressions — much of it lived up to a viewer’s expectation of a master with five decades of experience. Indeed, clean body language was common to all three dancers of the evening. Young Kalamandalam Adityan kept Panchali’s timidity intact, which suited the tenderness of the breeze-brought sougandhika blossom that she wanted her husband to fetch more of. Middle-aged Peesappilly Rajeevan, as Hanuman, sought to present ‘wind’ as a leitmotif, given that Vayu is the spiritual father of Bhima as well. The end phase of the play had adequate doses of natural acting light up the fraternal camaraderie. Like desserts served as the last course of a ceremonial feast. Nedumbally Rammohan displayed well his schedule-keeping skills as the anchor vocalist, while the supporting Sadanam Jyothishbabu shone especially well in the upper registers. Sadanam Akademi batch-mates and colleagues Ramakrishnan (chenda) and Devadas (maddalam) complemented each other with practised ease. Kalamandalam Satheesan’s make-up skills were evident in the tidy visages of the male characters. Greenroom assistants Sadanam Sreenivasan and Vivek doubled well as floor managers. The camera angles during the live streaming indicated nice preparatory work. An apt mix of medium shots and close-ups made the viewing pleasing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/fine-classicism-highlighted/article33414930.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Humanism at the core||Must he stay or should he leave? Wilhelm Furtwangler, who many consider the greatest conductor ever, agonised over a decision on which he felt much depended. After seizing power in 1933, the Nazis had begun censoring art and artistes, while promoting their toadies. It would have been easy to simply leave Nazi Germany, as many musicians had done. Furtwangler, though, saw the Berlin orchestra, which he led, as torchbearer of the Austro-German canon of Western classical music: Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Bruckner — and Beethoven. Leaving Germany would not only seem like capitulation, it would give the Nazis a free hand to pursue their depraved vision of German music. While his other motives and actions are disputed, that the man suffered for his art is not. This history bears retelling for it takes us to the core of Beethoven’s music: the human spirit struggling towards an ideal. From the anguish of the war years, Furtwangler emerged to enrich our experience of music, especially Beethoven’s, with influential readings of his works. The three phases Beethoven belonged to the Romantic Age, which swept Europe in the late 18th century. The German Idealist philosophers gave the period its intellectual heft. Immanuel Kant’s marveling of ‘the starry heavens above; the moral law within’ profoundly influenced Beethoven Scholars organise Beethoven’s work into three periods: early, middle, and late. His early compositions, up to age 32, are mostly conventional; it was as a virtuoso performer that he supported himself. Things suddenly changed. Beethoven’s hearing began deteriorating alarmingly. This realisation drove him to the brink of suicide. But his resolve to live for and through his art prevailed. In the Beethoven Museum in Bonn, the tragedy and the triumph coexist. The ear trumpets he used — the larger as his hearing weakened — poignantly stand beside manuscript copies of the seminal music he wrote. In the next decade, called the middle or ‘heroic’ period, Beethoven drew from his own defiance of suffering. Daring personal expressions of vitality, zeal, freedom, liberation, peace, and justice suffuse his music. And when the conventional genres he inherited could not hold his musical thoughts, he rebelled, improvised, and changed them forever. Especially illustrative are the opera, Fidelio, and Symphonies Three, Five and Seven. In the opera,the brave protagonist, Leonore, rescues her husband, a political prisoner. The work’s central theme is fidelity to person and ideal, which Furtwangler describes as an appeal to human conscience. As with his other compositions, Beethoven’s only opera is particularly resonant in times when freedom and human dignity are threatened. Symphony Three, the Eroica, was inspired by the republican ideals of Napoleon. (When the despot crowned himself emperor, however, Beethoven furiously scratched out the dedication.) Many, like conductor John Eliot Gardner, believe the French Revolution inspired Symphony Five. Its spirit echoes throughout, which resistance fighters in occupied countries in WWII supposedly identified with. The piece is also the most radical assertion of humankind in contemporary music. In the famous four opening notes, I hear the human person, sovereign and sacrosanct, majestically standing her ground. A different world, and probably the happiest, most devil-may-care of Beethoven’s works is Symphony Seven. It is not a profound examination of life but a celebration of it. In the late period, at the height of his creative powers, Beethoven composed what is recognised as his finest music: Symphony Nine, the Mass (Missa Solemnis), and the last string quartets. The artistic concerns remain the same, the themes recur, and the genres evolve. There’s a pristine quality, besides, which sets these compositions apart. The critic, Bernard Jacobson, says Beethoven’s late style, particularly in the quartets, ‘can seem at the same time unprecedentedly complex and unprecedentedly simple’. Symphonies Three to Eight are all acclaimed. It is Nine, however, that changed the genre forever. It was the first time a symphonic idea was vocalised. The length of the piece too made it exceptional. Symphonies were not the epics they are today: Haydn’s shortest is about 17 minutes; Mozart’s 40th is about 25. Depending on the tempo, the Ninth can go beyond 75 minutes. Its length vastly increased possibilities for the structure and complexity of the art form. Similarly, in the Mass, Beethoven stretches its artistic potential — as opposed to liturgical usability — to such an extent that the genre’s secularisation was inevitable by composers who followed. The late string quartets (Op. 127 to Op. 135) provide a glimpse of Beethoven’s last artistic testaments on a variety of concerns. Contemporary reaction was no different than it is today: hushed awe. ‘After this, what is left for us to write?’, asked Schubert, specifically referring to Op. 131, considered Beethoven’s zenith. It narrates a sad tale, which lightens, but turns disconsolate again. Perhaps it is an examination of the nature of human existence. In its structure, thematic variations, dynamics, harmonisation, and every technical aspect that keeps performers and musicologists enthralled (and most of us groping in the dark), Beethoven’s improvisations here influenced the development of the genre. Engaging meaningfully Great art is a refining and sublimation of the intensely personal. In Beethoven’s music there’s no mistaking his social, moral and spiritual vision. In the Choral symphony, as if to snuff out all future quibbling about where he stood, he spells it out in Schiller’s verse. Yet, after two centuries, his music hasn’t aged because what troubled him still troubles us — concerns of equality, justice, freedom, fraternity and peace. How do we engage with this art meaningfully except by internalising its pain and catharsis? In anniversary concerts and seminars, Beethoven is only fleetingly encountered. To experience him, we must make time to truly enter the ground of our own being. There, in silence, we will recognise his promptings and awaken to his art. Only then will his legacy renew itself for the world.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Played with orchestral precision||Sometimes, it’s hard to choose between a violin duet and a vocal duel of the Akkarai Sisters, but on Monday, it was easy. Their violin concert for MadRasana Virtual Festival 2020 was a veritable two-in-one in which they literally sang through their violins, often living it up in expressions and speeds that the normal human voice may not easily able to match. An attractive feature of the Sisters’ vocal duets is the difference in the timbre and tone of their voices and the dynamics that it creates. They bring the same tonal contrast to their violin duets too. While Subhalakshmi, the older of the two, retains her mid-range on the violin, Sornalatha prefers the bass sound. So when they began the concert with ‘Annaiye’, a Tamil composition by their grandfather Suchindram S.P. Sivasubramaniam in Amritavarshini, what stood out, along with the expressive beginning in medium tempo, were the sounds of their instrument. Soon, they began cavorting in three speeds that ended in a crescendo, co-created with the percussionists Sai Giridhar (mridangam) and S. Krishna (ghatam). Brisk sangathis What followed was a more commonly heard, ‘Shri Saraswathi Namosthuthe’ (Arabhi) by Muthuswami Dikshitar praising the virtues of goddess Saraswati. The attractive element of this rendition was the brisk alternation of sangathis and notes. Arabhi, that’s energetic even otherwise, sounded more animated, yet devotional. In both the songs, Subhalakshmi took the lead. An upbeat mood in a concert sets the stage for a little introspection and soul-searching. And what better raga than a stately Bhairavi? This time, it was Sornalatha’s turn. She was fastidiously truthful to the gamakas and variations that add to the might and beauty of Bhairavi and its quintessentially Carnatic flavour. Her phrases painted the raga in all its majesty. Subhalakshmi joined her in the kriti, ‘Lalithe Sri Praviddhe’ by Tyagaraja. It was a nuanced and detailed rendition in which the dynamics they generated as they alternated phrases and notes were a value addition. Another example of how orchestral work can make regular compositions experientially different and more colourful. The highpoint of the concert was the Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP) in a rarely-heard Rishabhapriya. After a quick Nilambari (‘Brovavamma’ by Syama Sastri) to change gears, the Sisters settled into the RTP. A 13-minute alapana may be a luxury in the shorter format, but Subhalakshmi, who took the lead to portray the raga, brought out its intriguing quality. I have always found Rishabhapriya to be a bit arty and intellectual, probably because of the judicious use of gamakas and the straighter sounding notes, but that was the essence of Subhalakshmi’s painstaking alapana. The pallavi was ‘Parama Siva Neelakanta Vaidyanatha Mampahi,’ composed by the sisters as a prayer to fight the pandemic. The pallavi was followed by a marathon ragamalika in which they presented 20-odd ragas in quick succession alternately on their violins. Towards the end, the ragas changed in a flash — probably in five notes or so — leaving the virtual audience with no time to guess. Still, many could identify ragas such as Nattakurinji, Ranjani, Bahudari, Hemavathi, Poornachandrika, Nalinakanti, Saramathi, Sriranjani, Janaranjani, Valachi, Saranga, Kalavathi, Vasantha, Sri, Revathi, Sumanesa and so on. They ended the concert with a Lalgudi thillana in Sindhu Bhairavi. In fact, it’s not difficult to summarise the experience of the concert because what was on display was depth of musical wisdom and mastery over the instrument. The double-bowing and cut bows that Subhalakshmi throws in reminds me of Western violinists and the understated (mathematical) improvisational prowess of Sornalatha harks back to seasoned musicians. The result was orchestral precision. The contribution of Sai Giridhar and S. Krishna on rhythms was immensely valuable too, as they played to elevate the central piece and maintain a soothing laya. Giridhar added considerable melodic beauty by employing a lot of bass and gumkis. In fact, he was not accompanying them, but was in a conversation in which Krishna also seamlessly joined. To summarise, a sprightly concert with a great mix of songs, languages and composers that showed how even a small ensemble can create an orchestral storm within the classical confines of Carnatic music. MadRasana’s production design created the right aesthetic, while their top class production values made the experience truly immersive.  The Pallavi was ‘Parama Siva Neelakanta Vaidyanatha Mam Pahi,’ composed by the sisters themselves as a prayer to fight the pandemic||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/played-with-orchestral-precision/article33414928.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Knowing the real Dikshitar||Muthuswami Dikshitar – Time we focused on his music. The youngest of the famed Carnatic Trinity is a personality that continues to intrigue, enthral, educate and amaze, so many years after his passing. Born in 1775/1776 and having passed away in 1835, he took his time to come into the limelight. But beginning with the 1960s, there was a rediscovery of sorts of Muthuswami Dikshitar, and he continues to remain in the limelight. Chief among the great minds that studied his works in depth was Dr V Raghavan. His works have much to offer that is of interest — Hindu mythology, local lore, architectural and iconic details, and the way in which he embeds the raga name in many of his songs. To stand at a shrine, and reflect that you are seeing what he sang about is an indescribable thrill. Every aspect of his compositions is sifted and analysed, and scholars and laypersons, especially with the explosion of the internet, post their findings and opinions on a daily basis. Of course, in the process of amateur research many myths have accrued to Dikshitar, which would be nothing but a disservice to him. There is a school of thought that all songs with the Guruguha mudra or signature are Muthuswami Dikshitar’s works. This simple attitude is not entirely correct. Firstly, we do know that his descendants too used the same signature. There is the diametrically opposite view that claims that only the compositions as compiled by Dikshitar’s nephew Subbarama Dikshitar in his Sangita Sampradaya Pradarsini (1904), are authentic. This too may not be a correct view. True, many of the compositions outside of the Pradarsini suffer from prosodical errors or poor alliteration, both of which would have been anathema to Muthuswami Dikshitar given the high standard he adopts in undoubtedly genuine works. But even among these there are some which are exemplary. The truth therefore lies somewhere in between what is in the Pradarsini and outside of it. Unfortunately for us, those who knew the truth, and in this I include a whole host of Carnatic greats right from the composer’s grandnephew Ambi Dikshitar, chose to remain silent and have passed on. Research efforts That even Dr. Raghavan had reached a frustrating dead end in his research is evident from a note in his monograph on Dikshitar where he states that “it was up to the present representatives” to “co-operate with us to bring to light more of the rare compositions of Dikshitar.” In his time the chief sources of such manuscripts were three — the descendants of Ambi Dikshitar, the Guruguha Gana Vidyalaya of Ananthakrishna Iyer and the descendants of the Thanjavur Quartet. Today, all three stoutly deny being in possession of any such material. Perhaps what there was has perished with time. A fallout of this has been the sudden influx of ‘new compositions’ that are inferior in lyrical quality — I need refer to only two most commonly heard — ‘Sri Venkatesam’ in Kalyana Vasantham and ‘Nandagopala’ in Yamuna Kalyani, which are now fathered on Muthuswami Dikshitar chiefly owing to the presence of the Guruguha mudra. There is also a tendency to make Dikshitar a frequent traveller of sorts. With no awareness of the difficulties in commuting during his time, it is common to attribute visits by him to all kinds of remote places starting from Pasupatinath in Nepal to Honnavar in Karnataka, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and even Pushkar in Rajasthan and Puri in Orissa. That he did travel to Varanasi in the company of his guru is a fact that is vouched for in the extremely truthful and barebonesw biography provided by Subbarama Dikshitar. This journey by itself was a great achievement in the unsettled late 18th/early 19th century. Travelling beyond that, and this within a short span of five years, with two wives in tow, would have been impossible. Raja Serfoji’s travel to Varanasi at around the same time is well documented. Even he, with all the resources at his command, did not stray from the time-tested route. What then of Dikshitar? But what is significant is the distance he did travel within a lifespan of just 59 years. Twenty years after his death, the Government of Madras embarked on a study and its report revealed that hardly anyone ever stirred out of their places of stay, given the conditions of the roads, the rapaciousness of toll collectors and the fear of haraIt is time to get back to the lyrical and musical aspects of Dikshitar’s compositionsssment by dacoits, apart from dangers of falling ill. That Dikshitar braved all this makes him a remarkable man indeed. It is time to get back to the lyrical and musical aspects of Dikshitar’s compositions, though there has been an increasing tendency over the years to ‘Tyagarajize’ his songs. Perhaps in the five years left for his 250th birth anniversary, we may see a change, with less myth-making and more focus on his music.  The Chennai-based author and historian writes on music and culture.   There is a school of thought that all songs with the Guruguha mudra or signature are Muthuswami Dikshitar’s works.

25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A mature performance||Musicians seem to have shrugged off the fallout of the Covid lockdown and inaction, judging by Bharat Sundar’s impactful concert for Sunaadalahari. Bharat’s concert underscored his ability to master three elements — creativity, depth and moderation of youthful exuberance. The final product was polished and draws comparison with some vintage music. The young are getting their repertoire lessons quite early these days. Bharat announced his priorities by singing Trinity compositions as his first three pieces. ‘Telisi Rama’ (Poornachandrika, Tyagaraja), ‘Karunanidhi ilalo’ (Thodi, Syama Sastri) and ‘Sree Mathrubhootham’ (Kannada, Dikshitar) are classic expressions of the respective composers. Bharat’s treatment of Thodi and his niraval at “komala mridhubhashini” largely hovering around the upper octave was bright and engaging. Even though all three songs had swara appendages, they were not mechanical. Bharat has a good way of mixing laya and jiva swaras to give new forms. Alapana style The highpoint was Kalyani (‘Etavunara,’ Tyagaraja). Most seasoned musicians maintain a unique style for raga alapana, as did Bharat with his Kalyani. The first few minutes had his sangathis and novelties (some unleash them later) starting at the Panchamam and packing with short creative phrases. This was one of the tools T.N. Seshagopalan used to distinguish himself in the 1970s. Bharat’s later course was more predictable but he paced himself well throughout. There is some magic in violinist Rajeev’s fingers. His Kalyani alapana was aligned in spirit with Bharat’s vision that day, but aesthetic in its own right. In the Kalyani niraval (at ‘Sree Karudagu’) too, Bharat opted to sway in the tenor range to fully exploit his melodious voice. Bharat has resolved the sound issue admirably by modulating the decibel and the sharpness in his voice before it reaches the listener’s ears. So, there are no jarring expressions or jerky sounds. His singing is unlikely to wake up a sleeping kid! Mridangist Praveen Sparsh was quite outstanding, alternating between strong strokes when needed and pauses and soft hands when the singing had to be in the spotlight. Good anticipation of Bharat’s laya forays helped him well. The thani with Chandrasekara Sharma on the ghatam had its own charm, although one felt a 25 minute thani in a 2½ hour concert could be divided into two sessions at two different places and talams, as it used to be once upon a time. It must also be added that Bharat’s pronunciation and word splits are apt. “Bhu kamalarka” is, for instance, the right split for the charanam of ‘e tavunara.’ It is a good approach to get into first principles in everything . With so much talent, one hopes he stays level-headed. ‘Innudaya barade’ (Kalyanavasantham) of Purandaradasa gave Bharat some emotive spots to explore as did his virutham ‘Orumaiyudan’ in Mohana Kalyani, Sindhubhairavi and Kapi that was followed by ‘Pazhani ninra’ in Kapi. The ubiquitous Maund thillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman signed off a mature performance by a team of bearded men.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-mature-performance/article33414905.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Both erudite and talented||In the very opening Bhairavi varnam (Pachimiriyam Adiappayya – Ata Talam), Sumitra Vasudev solidly demonstrated her scholarship and talent, sticking to its original expanded version in her guru R. Vedavalli’s footsteps. This version has an extra charanam swaram — Pa Da Ni Sa Ri Ga Ma — and a concluding sahityam segment ‘Chiruchema Taluraga,’ ending with the pallavi, and not with the usual charanam. Gifted with a pleasing voice, Sumitra could bring out the charm of each piece and she exuded confidence throughout. After an extensive, yet contemplative alapana in Karaharapriya, Sumitra chose Tyagaraja’s ‘Soumitri Bhagyame Bhagyamu,’ as the main piece, commencing with the anupallavi. Sumitra’s niraval and swaraprastara were set on the charanam, ‘Baguga Vinta’. Dynamic swaras were exchanged between her and the violinist R.K. Shriramkumar, who has made a mark as a leading accompanist. His skill in anticipation is worthy of emulation. Enjoyable thani When K. Arunprakash is on the mridangam, rasikas can anticipate an unexpected thani. He mesmerised listeners with his gentle rhythm in a keezhkala (slow pace) Misra Nadai, followed with Misra Kuraippu. Arun Prakash used his subdued playing skills well, enriching every kriti. During the thani, Anirudh Atreya’s responses on the kanjira were excellent and whenever he joined the kritis, he added musical vigour. Sumitra rendered Arunachala Kavi’s Rama Natakam Kriti ‘Saranam Saranam’ (Sowrashtram – Misra Chapu), with swarams at ‘Sankara Abhayam’. This was followed by a brief yet brilliant essay of Harikamboji for Tyagaraja’s ‘Enduku Nirdaya’. Patnam Subramanya Iyer’s ‘Marivere Dikkevarayya Rama’ in a lilting Shanmukhapriya was rendered with punch. Niraval and swaras at ‘Sannutanga Sri Venkatesa’ added lustre to the piece. The 18th century composer, Mazhavai Chidambara Bharathi, has several enchanting kritis to his credit. Sumitra rendered his ‘Karunai Thanthu Ennai Alamma’ (Begada-Misra Chapu), which has a unique structure, well. Dikshitar’s ‘Ehi Annapurne’ (Punnagavarali) and Gopalakrishna Bharathi’s ‘Etho Theriyamal Poachuthe’ (Hamir Kalyani – Rupakam) were sung in a pensive mood. Purandara Dasa’s ‘Dasara Nindisa Beda’ in Thilang was neatly done. After a short virutham in Saveri, Sama, Sindhu Bhairavi and Behag, Sumitra wound up her delightful recital with the Tiruppavai, ‘Orutthi Maganai Pirandu.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/both-erudite-and-talented/article33414932.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Spirited exchanges||The 78th festival of Tamil Isai Sangam commenced on the right note, with a nagaswaram recital by Seshampatti T. Sivalingam. The concert began with the Gambhira Nattai kriti, ‘Gnana Vinayakane,’ composed by Sharavanabhavananda. It created a spiritual ambience. The exchange of swaras at the pallavi between Sivalingam and K. Selvam, the accompanying artiste, was crisp yet eloquent. Seshampatti Sivalingam has a strong foundation in the art, having learnt it from Kiranur Ramaswamy Pillai and Tiruvarur Kitchappa Pillai. He has won several awards including the Kalaimamani and Sangeet Natak Akademi awards. Sivalingam’s elucidation of Malayamarutham was an example of imaginative craftsmanship. After an alapana, he rendered Papanasam Sivan’s ‘Karpaga Manohara’ (Jhampa tala) on Kapaleeswarar. One remarkable aspect through the concert was the synchrony between the two. From the inherent musical structure of this raga, Sivalingam could weave several patterns in the swaraprastara at the pallavi, eliciting its meditative mood. The crowning glory of the concert was the Mayamalavagowla interpretation, evoking the santha rasa (peace). Sivalingam rendered ‘Aadikkondaar Antha Vedikkai,’ a masterpiece by Muthu Thandavar (Adi tala). The melodic exchanges between Sivalingam and Selvam in kalpanaswaras at the charanam, ‘Ara Navamani Malaika,’ enhanced the composition’s appeal. Power-packed thani The thavil accompaniment by S. Gajendran and Dakshinamurthy added verve and vigour to the concert. Their technical virtuosity came to the fore in the short but power-packed thani. The Durita kala (fast-paced) exchange between the two was exciting. Sivalingam’s traditional moorings came through in the rendering of the Rathipathipriya composition by Ghanam Krishna Iyer, ‘Jagajjanani Sukhavani’. In the anupallavi, ‘Sukha Swarupini,’ he played the sangathis with ease. Kalki’s ‘Katrinile Varum Geetham’ was not a surprising choice, since we get to hear the song often in online events. Seshampatti concluded the concert with the Thiruppugazh, ‘Niraimathi’, in Hamsanandi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/spirited-exchanges/article33414907.ece
25 December 2020||December 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Why it’s time to stop labelling||What is traditional and what is contemporary in Indian dance. These questions were raised at a recent round table discussion arranged by TomoeArts, a Vancouver-based dance theatre company, supported by ArtsComeOnline and spearheaded by Shivani Jatar. Paris-based dancer-researcher Kavya Iyer was the moderator. In a specially curated India version of the event, four dancers from the diaspora shared their experiences and journey. Meher Malik traced the origin of belly dancing to the pagan ritual of Rajasthan that was passed on from mother to daughter to prepare for birthing a child. This gypsy trail found its way to different countries outside India like Egypt and was looked at as entertainment for men. Though deemed ‘vulgar’ and barred from being performed as an ‘art’ form, Meher’s passion for the dance kept her research going. She spoke of how the sensuality of its movements came in the way of it being accepted as a form of performance art like any other. “It is referred to as ‘birth dance’, since mothers-to-be who regularly did belly dancing were supposed to have shorter labours,” said Meher. In an excerpt from her solo piece, ‘Body, Mind and Soul’, Meher conveyed a meaning beyond the long hair, costume and midriff, the external identities associated with the dance. A collaborative project with an Odissi group (a dance form that also has fluid torso movements) attracted harsh criticism on one side and appreciation from even traditionalists on the other. “Dance is a constant search for a language that doesn’t seek words,” said Meher. Divya Ravi from the U.K. touched upon the turbulent history of Bharatanatyam, how it fell victim to Victorian standards of morality, and was salvaged from oblivion. Her aim was to objectively look at the tradition as the transmission of a historically and culturally significant entity. Besides the tangible legacies being passed on, what is more important is the passing on of the intangible, such as practice and discipline. “Traditional art is exhaustive in construct and scope. To think out of the box, you need to know what is inside the box,” said Divya. In an ambitious attempt to break the stereotype, Divya created a new margam — Manjari. A clipping of the varnam was shown, with the lotus as protagonist. Showcasing mudras For the layman, the traditional and the contemporary are two ends of a spectrum. Divya asked if contemporary is a marker of relevant art created in the present, but pointed out that the freedom offered by the idiom of Bharatanatyam is immense. It is fertile ground to explore current social issues. Her digital work in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Sharan Subramanian, showcasing the hasta mudras, underlined their journey into veganism. In her Navaratri piece titled, ‘Not just an idol’, she brought out woman power. Traditional, classical and contemporary are all subjective terms. It is important to respect artistic choices. Hanne M.de Bruin from the Netherlands, who has spent over 30 years in Tamil Nadu and is the co-founder and director of Kattaikkuttu Sangam, spoke of the theatre form. The soundscape of the gurukulam, the elaborate make-up, and colourful costumes were encapsulated in an introductory video. She spoke of all-night performances in the village. “In ‘Rama-Ravana’, the principal characters were presented by many women artistes. The juxtaposition of Rama and Ravana was contemporary in approach. In another piece on the disrobing of Draupadi, she was depicted as a bold woman, not subservient or suffering,” said Hanne. In a recent collaboration, using music by T.M. Krishna and Sangeetha Sivakumar, and with Duryodhana played by Rajagopal, the last day of the Kurukshetra war was displayed differently. The coming together of Carnatic music and Kattaikkuttu was unusual, but these experiments need to take into account the economic aspects, as well as the performance space and proximity of the village audience. The moderator pointed out how the sphere of folk art has specificities which we often tend to ignore. Dancer Sanjukta Wagh, quoting T.S. Eliot, said, “The definition of tradition is a matter of wider significance. Tradition cannot be inherited. If you want it, you must obtain it with great labour.” Terming her dance as being rooted in Kathak and Hindustani music, her approach has been to inculcate an inter-disciplinary approach with many art forms in conversation. A visual from ‘Rage and Beyond,’ her collaborative work with Deepa Dharmadikari on the lights, depicted Gandhari’s rage directed inwards. The script emerged in words, silences, songs, sounds of the tatkar, and strings of the guitar. The next visual was an extract from 16th century Sufi poet Shah Hussain’s poems, a collective voice of defiant women. Before staging this project, Wagh spoke of her experience at Laban in unlearning and relearning movements in a newly aligned body. Instead of binding forms into terminologies like traditional and contemporary, Sanjukta asked if it was time to do away with them altogether.

25 December 2020||New Delhi,||‘Delhi ready to receive vaccine from Centre’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that Delhi was fully prepared and the government had made all arrangements to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from the Centre for storage and to administer to patients. He said this after attending a review meeting on vaccination steps. In the first phase, he said, the vaccine will be given to 51 lakh people as earmarked by the Central government in priority lists, which include 3 lakh healthcare workers, 6 lakh frontline workers and 42 lakh people either aged above 50 or below but with co-morbidities. Recovery rate “There has been a significant decrease in daily deaths due to COVID-19 and we have to reduce it further. The recovery rate has also considerably increased. But now, everyone’s eyes are on the vaccine,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “The Delhi government has made all arrangements for the administration of the vaccine to Delhiites. Around 51 lakh people come in our priority categories as defined by the Central government. These people have been marked and any work that is left will be completed soon,” he also said. According to Mr. Kejriwal, one person will get two doses each, which meant that 1.02 crore doses will be required to be administered to 51 lakh people. The Delhi government, he said, has cold storage capacity for 74 lakh doses, which will increase to 1,15,00,000 doses in the next 5-7 days. The vaccine will be administered to only those people whose registration has been done. Such individuals will be contacted via SMS and be given full information regarding the vaccine rollout, the manpower and the number of teams that are required for the administration of the vaccine, such as, officers and workers have been marked and trained for the task and each such team would have five people, he said. “In case we come to know about some post-vaccine side-effects on a person, we can provide treatment to such patients, such as the arrangement of doctors and adequate treatment methods,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-ready-to-receive-vaccine-from-centre/article33414696.ece
25 December 2020||LUCKNOW,||ABVP activists threaten to raze idol in Jain college||A college run by the Jain community in Baghpat district of western Uttar Pradesh has accused the ABVP, the student wing of the RSS, of threatening to demolish a temple and an idol of a Jain goddess on the premises. While the ABVP later issued an apology for the misconduct and alleged attempts to vandalise by its activists, blaming it on ignorance, an FIR was lodged against four persons, at least two of them members of the outfit, on charges of rioting, criminal intimidation and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace. The college administration, however, expressed dissatisfaction at the sections invoked in the FIR and demanded nothing less than the arrest of the accused persons. D.K. Jain, joint secretary of Digambar Jain College, said that on Tuesday around 25-30 persons, including girl students and outsiders, many of them wearing saffron scarves, barged into the campus and attempted to vandalise goddess Shrutdevi’s idol, the Jain goddess of knowledge. The college authorities said the mob locked the college gates and staged a dharna in front of the idol, which was installed in 2016 in presence of Governor Ram Naik during the centenary year of the institution, and tried to vandalise the property. They demanded the removal of the idol. The ABVP later apologised to the Digambar Jain community for the incident. An FIR was lodged against four students and one unidentified person under IPC Sections 147, 504 and 506. The accused were identified as Akshay Kumar, Yachika Tomar, Ankur Chaudhary and Happy Sharma. Mr. Kumar is a third-semester M.A English student, as per the FIR lodged on the complaint of Principal Virendra Singh. In the police complaint, Mr. Singh said there were 10 students and other anti-social elements along with the four named accused who barged into the college. Baraut police station SHO Ajay Kumar Sharma, however, said no arrests were made in the case. In the complaint, Dr. Virendra Singh said the activists raised indecent slogans in front of the temple. “We fear that these unruly students and others [outsiders] involved with them can cause harm to the temple and statue of Ma Shrutdevi, the symbol of faith of Jain devotees,” he stated. ‘Ignorance’ The ABVP said the incident happened out of ignorance and without the knowledge of its senior members. “Even then, the ABVP does not have even a shred of support for such an incident,” it said on Twitter. “The ABVP apologises to the entire society for the mistake of some workers of Baghpat,” it stated. Amit Rai Jain, a Jain historian who attended a meeting of Jain groups and intellectuals concerned over the incident, said the activists climbed on to the idol of Shrutdevi with their footwear and breached its dignity.  “This is highly condemnable,” he remarked. Baraut SHO said, “There was a confusion. We made them sit together and hold talks.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/abvp-activists-threaten-to-raze-idol-in-jain-college/article33414686.ece
25 December 2020||New Delhi,||No respite for Capital from ‘severe’ AQI||The air quality of Delhi and Noida continued to be in the “severe” category for the third consecutive day on Thursday and Gurugram’s was in the “very poor” category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The air quality of the national capital is expected to improve on Friday. “Better ventilation condition is forecast for the next two days. Hence, the AQI is forecast to improve to the higher end of the “very poor” category by December 25 and likely to further improve to the middle-end of very poor on December 26 and 27,” said a statement by the government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. Also, the effect of stubble burning is low, SAFAR said. Apart from the pollutants, two other factors are negatively impacting the air quality of the city. The speed of surface-level winds is “low”, which aids in accumulation of pollutants. The AQI of Delhi was 423 on Thursday, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 361 and 441 respectively. Also, the Environment Committee of the Delhi Assembly wrote to three municipal commissioners asking them to submit detailed steps taken by the corporations to stop dust pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-respite-for-capital-from-severe-aqi/article33414689.ece

The decision taken on Wednesday by the De-escalation Committee (COVID-19) which was constituted to assess the current position of hospital admissions and discharges and recommend reduction in the number of beds dedicated for COVID-19 patients. The Delhi government said the panel has recommended that “de-escalation may be carried out in a graded manner preferably in Delhi government and private sector hospitals”, but not in Central government hospitals. “The committee recommends that COVID ICU beds reservation of 80% of total ICU beds in the private sector be reduced to 60%, making 40% ICU capacity of the private hospitals available for the non-COVID critical care,” the government said. “This will make available 600 ICU beds [approx] for non-COVID patients. The committee decided not to change the COVID ICU beds status of any Delhi government hospitals as for now,” it added. The court was also informed that the panel has recommended that “the COVID beds reservation of 60% of total beds in all private hospitals should be de-escalated to 45%.
